            <li>I get so many compliments from women and men.</li>
            <li>THE PRICE WAS EVEN BETTER</li>
            <li>My favorite is still J&#x27;adore</li>
            <li>I love the hit of iris and that it&#x27;s not over powering.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many compliments on this when I wear it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>She get compliments on this parfum all the time - it is very sweet smelling and not overpowering, very rich and distinctive.</li>
            <li>but so worth the wait and PRICE!!</li>
            <li>It has a lovely floral scent that is light, yet elegant.</li>
            <li>I love this large bottle of La Vie Est Bell!!!  </li>
            <li>If you are a fan of Coco Madamoiselle , Georgio Armani Si and Calvin Klein Euphoria , I am pretty sure you will love this !</li>
            <li>It has a sexy and just this beautiful smell that I can&#x27;t get enough of, and every time I wear it I receive compliments from men and women</li>
            <li>Still a good amount and decent smelling while it lasts.</li>
            <li>The scent of this one disappears much more quickly.</li>
            <li>It is a sweet scent that, like most Lancome perfumes, last&#x27;s all day and smells great on anyone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sort of like a warm floral smell, romantic and sexy!</li>
            <li>Perfect as expected!!!</li>
            <li>3.4 ounces is a HUGE bottle.  </li>
            <li>So light.  </li>
            <li>Was a great Christmas present</li>
            <li>Finally a great deal on a scent that actually lasts longer than a minute.  </li>
            <li>I wore a jacket a week after my initial use and the waiter commented on what a great perfume I was wearing.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this scent right away.</li>
            <li>This perfume is quite possibly the most fragrant smell on earth!!</li>
            <li>This is definitely my new favorite!</li>
            <li>Love this parfum, has become my new favorite.</li>
            <li>Alex was a pleasure to talk to :) thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>The product is not the original one because The box has been altered</li>
            <li>You know when someone smells rich?</li>
            <li>If you are thinking of getting this awesome lancome la vie est belle, think no more.</li>
            <li>The original lasts all day.</li>
            <li>lot of questions about original etc.</li>
            <li>Came in the original box and packaging (shrink wrapped or whatever it is they put around it)</li>
            <li>Smells great and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is unique in that it doesn’t announce itself 20 feet away.</li>
            <li>I have used other good quality perfumes and this is my favorite now.  </li>
            <li>had I known Iris was in it as it usually isn&#x27;t a welcome scent for my sensitive nose, but the other ingredients make this a great scent that really envelopes you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it was a good Christmas present</li>
            <li>sure it&#x27;s real.  </li>
            <li>Love it so much</li>
            <li>Wife loved it, packing could have been a little better but no damage....</li>
            <li>When I bought it at Macy&#x27;s , the fragrance seemed to last all day and often people would comment ( hours later ) how good I smelled !!</li>
            <li>Shipped quick.</li>
            <li>but this is my second favorite for sure.</li>
            <li>My tiny sample lasted a while, after I ran out I came here to buy, I was scared it wasn&#x27;t authentic, but it is 100% authentic the box is sealed in wrap.</li>
            <li>Beautiful, magical smell in a heavy, classic bottle.  </li>
            <li>After giving to her (and explaining I hadn&#x27;t visited the local dance club from the cocktail of perfumes I had sampled), she loved it right away.</li>
            <li>My new favorite and</li>
            <li>got here very quick and was the real thing.</li>
            <li>Came in a sealed box, super fragrant, color is right and scent is exactly right</li>
            <li>My favorite so far.</li>
            <li>I love the soft smell.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>It arrived when it was supposed to wrapped perfectly to avoid being broken.</li>
            <li>Worth the cost.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get enough of this warm, spicy smell.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money for that</li>
            <li>As we both have a sensitive nose we love this one.</li>
            <li>it was so worth the price.</li>
            <li>You are making the right choice.</li>
            <li>what a beautiful, delicate scent.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect everyday personal fragrance.</li>
            <li>It’s more intimate as it sneaks up on you and it goes directly to the senses.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell like the real thing at all!</li>
            <li>I first received this perfume as a sample from somewhere.</li>
            <li>It only smells better as the day goes on and it fades into your skin and clothes.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>Love this fragrance...plain and simple.</li>
            <li>The fragrance doesn&#x27;t  last more then 1/2 hour or maybe 45 minutes .</li>
            <li>I love this perfume and it stays on the skin for the entire day.</li>
            <li>I have always battled with great smelling perfumes that don&#x27;t  last long.</li>
            <li>Such a sexy smell</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy again and again!! :)</li>
            <li>Perfect for casual or evenings out.</li>
            <li>It has a very nice long lasting smell.</li>
            <li>This perfume is the complete package though , it smells AMAZING and last ALL day.</li>
            <li>She said the fragrance is wonderful, but a small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Since wearing it, she said she has gotten lots of compliments on it from both men and women and also indicated that this perfume lasts all day and actually stays just as strong at the end of the day as it did from when she first sprayed it on.</li>
            <li>Seemed like a great price for the size but after receiving, I can definitely say this is not original.</li>
            <li>nice, but I expected it to smell a little more sweeter</li>
            <li>Will be returning it today and going to go to the store for the real thing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very feminine and lasts throughout the day without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Better than I expected.</li>
            <li>fast shipping, no complain.</li>
            <li>Awesome,super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>exelent products thanks</li>
            <li>, this is the REAL THING.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>My wife really loves this Parfum.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, but not sure if this is the real thing.</li>
            <li>very strong and long lasting</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m particular about my fragrances.</li>
            <li>A classic must have.</li>
            <li>wife, who is particular with her perfumes, had never tried this perfume before me giving to her.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li>Due to the too strong scent</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally review</li>
            <li>La vie est belle has long lasting,rich and sweet smell.</li>
            <li>It was described to me by the salesperson as a new scent that Julia Roberts is advertising, not that makes any difference to me</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get my favorite perfume at a better price, just got it delivered today and it smells so bad!</li>
            <li>too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was first worried about the legitimacy since it was only $77</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never felt the desire to wear any frangrnce besides that of my body wash, but wow, this perfume is changed my mind!</li>
            <li>One squirt last all day &amp; everyone wants to know what your wearing!</li>
            <li>smells like classy sex</li>
            <li>If you want to drive a man wild, this is the perfume to do it withl.  </li>
            <li>The box look old, someone has opened it and used it before.</li>
            <li>Only to find out its a knock off of the real thing.</li>
            <li>I’ve also noticed a marked increase in cuddle time.</li>
            <li>It is a scent for mature women, not for teenagers.</li>
            <li>No, it is not an old lady perfume.</li>
            <li>She compared it to a more expensive bottle which she already had and knew right away</li>
            <li>A sweet 16 gift from mommy to her little princess</li>
            <li>Fabulous perfume, terrific price and delivered earlier than expected.  </li>
            <li>I tried about four different ones on my hunt for a new scent.</li>
            <li>The price currently here at 108 dollars is a bit high as I found this size in a gift set currently selling at Macy&#x27;s for 82 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the price here, this perfume from a husband&#x27;s perspective is 5 stars.</li>
            <li>But if I spray more than once I am nauseated and can get a headache.</li>

            <li> Had spritzed this at Macy&#x27;s and loved it at once never realizing it had Iris in it.</li>
            <li> Never forgave the &amp;#34;powers that be&amp;#34; for discontinuing my beloved Bill Blass for Women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon for a killer deal.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s strong but not overpowering and it lasts all day!</li>
            <li> It is great at first application, but you will have to refresh once or twice during the day.</li>

            <li> I get so many compliments from women and men.</li>
            <li> THE PRICE WAS EVEN BETTER</li>
            <li> My favorite is still J&#x27;adore</li>
            <li> I love the hit of iris and that it&#x27;s not over powering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many compliments on this when I wear it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> She get compliments on this parfum all the time - it is very sweet smelling and not overpowering, very rich and distinctive.</li>
            <li> but so worth the wait and PRICE!!</li>
            <li> It has a lovely floral scent that is light, yet elegant.</li>
            <li> I love this large bottle of La Vie Est Bell!!!  </li>
            <li> If you are a fan of Coco Madamoiselle , Georgio Armani Si and Calvin Klein Euphoria , I am pretty sure you will love this !</li>
            <li> It has a sexy and just this beautiful smell that I can&#x27;t get enough of, and every time I wear it I receive compliments from men and women</li>
            <li> Still a good amount and decent smelling while it lasts.</li>
            <li> The scent of this one disappears much more quickly.</li>
            <li> It is a sweet scent that, like most Lancome perfumes, last&#x27;s all day and smells great on anyone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sort of like a warm floral smell, romantic and sexy!</li>
            <li> Perfect as expected!!!</li>
            <li> 3.4 ounces is a HUGE bottle.  </li>
            <li> So light.  </li>
            <li> Was a great Christmas present</li>
            <li> Finally a great deal on a scent that actually lasts longer than a minute.  </li>
            <li> I wore a jacket a week after my initial use and the waiter commented on what a great perfume I was wearing.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this scent right away.</li>
            <li> This perfume is quite possibly the most fragrant smell on earth!!</li>
            <li> This is definitely my new favorite!</li>
            <li> Love this parfum, has become my new favorite.</li>
            <li> Alex was a pleasure to talk to :) thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> The product is not the original one because The box has been altered</li>
            <li> You know when someone smells rich?</li>
            <li> If you are thinking of getting this awesome lancome la vie est belle, think no more.</li>
            <li> The original lasts all day.</li>
            <li> lot of questions about original etc.</li>
            <li> Came in the original box and packaging (shrink wrapped or whatever it is they put around it)</li>
            <li> Smells great and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is unique in that it doesn’t announce itself 20 feet away.</li>
            <li> I have used other good quality perfumes and this is my favorite now.  </li>
            <li> had I known Iris was in it as it usually isn&#x27;t a welcome scent for my sensitive nose, but the other ingredients make this a great scent that really envelopes you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it was a good Christmas present</li>
            <li> sure it&#x27;s real.  </li>
            <li> Love it so much</li>
            <li> Wife loved it, packing could have been a little better but no damage....</li>
            <li> When I bought it at Macy&#x27;s , the fragrance seemed to last all day and often people would comment ( hours later ) how good I smelled !!</li>
            <li> Shipped quick.</li>
            <li> but this is my second favorite for sure.</li>
            <li> My tiny sample lasted a while, after I ran out I came here to buy, I was scared it wasn&#x27;t authentic, but it is 100% authentic the box is sealed in wrap.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, magical smell in a heavy, classic bottle.  </li>
            <li> After giving to her (and explaining I hadn&#x27;t visited the local dance club from the cocktail of perfumes I had sampled), she loved it right away.</li>
            <li> My new favorite and</li>
            <li> got here very quick and was the real thing.</li>
            <li> Came in a sealed box, super fragrant, color is right and scent is exactly right</li>
            <li> My favorite so far.</li>
            <li> I love the soft smell.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> It arrived when it was supposed to wrapped perfectly to avoid being broken.</li>
            <li> Worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this warm, spicy smell.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money for that</li>
            <li> As we both have a sensitive nose we love this one.</li>
            <li> it was so worth the price.</li>
            <li> You are making the right choice.</li>
            <li> what a beautiful, delicate scent.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect everyday personal fragrance.</li>
            <li> It’s more intimate as it sneaks up on you and it goes directly to the senses.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like the real thing at all!</li>
            <li> I first received this perfume as a sample from somewhere.</li>
            <li> It only smells better as the day goes on and it fades into your skin and clothes.</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance...plain and simple.</li>
            <li> The fragrance doesn&#x27;t  last more then 1/2 hour or maybe 45 minutes .</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and it stays on the skin for the entire day.</li>
            <li> I have always battled with great smelling perfumes that don&#x27;t  last long.</li>
            <li> Such a sexy smell</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy again and again!! :)</li>
            <li> Perfect for casual or evenings out.</li>
            <li> It has a very nice long lasting smell.</li>
            <li> This perfume is the complete package though , it smells AMAZING and last ALL day.</li>
            <li> She said the fragrance is wonderful, but a small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Since wearing it, she said she has gotten lots of compliments on it from both men and women and also indicated that this perfume lasts all day and actually stays just as strong at the end of the day as it did from when she first sprayed it on.</li>
            <li> Seemed like a great price for the size but after receiving, I can definitely say this is not original.</li>
            <li> nice, but I expected it to smell a little more sweeter</li>
            <li> Will be returning it today and going to go to the store for the real thing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very feminine and lasts throughout the day without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Better than I expected.</li>
            <li> fast shipping, no complain.</li>
            <li> Awesome,super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> exelent products thanks</li>
            <li> , this is the REAL THING.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My wife really loves this Parfum.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, but not sure if this is the real thing.</li>
            <li> very strong and long lasting</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m particular about my fragrances.</li>
            <li> A classic must have.</li>
            <li> wife, who is particular with her perfumes, had never tried this perfume before me giving to her.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> Due to the too strong scent</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally review</li>
            <li> La vie est belle has long lasting,rich and sweet smell.</li>
            <li> It was described to me by the salesperson as a new scent that Julia Roberts is advertising, not that makes any difference to me</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get my favorite perfume at a better price, just got it delivered today and it smells so bad!</li>
            <li> too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was first worried about the legitimacy since it was only $77</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never felt the desire to wear any frangrnce besides that of my body wash, but wow, this perfume is changed my mind!</li>
            <li> One squirt last all day &amp; everyone wants to know what your wearing!</li>
            <li> smells like classy sex</li>
            <li> If you want to drive a man wild, this is the perfume to do it withl.  </li>
            <li> The box look old, someone has opened it and used it before.</li>
            <li> Only to find out its a knock off of the real thing.</li>
            <li> I’ve also noticed a marked increase in cuddle time.</li>
            <li> It is a scent for mature women, not for teenagers.</li>
            <li> No, it is not an old lady perfume.</li>
            <li> She compared it to a more expensive bottle which she already had and knew right away</li>
            <li> A sweet 16 gift from mommy to her little princess</li>
            <li> Fabulous perfume, terrific price and delivered earlier than expected.  </li>
            <li> I tried about four different ones on my hunt for a new scent.</li>
            <li> The price currently here at 108 dollars is a bit high as I found this size in a gift set currently selling at Macy&#x27;s for 82 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the price here, this perfume from a husband&#x27;s perspective is 5 stars.</li>
            <li> But if I spray more than once I am nauseated and can get a headache.</li>
            <li> it does not seem to last as long as I remembered?</li>
            <li> The smell does not last long.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> The smell stays all day long on me.</li>
            <li> Get a lot of compliments when I wear this perfume - not really for work (in my conservative opinion), but a total hit on a date night.</li>
            <li> This is  longer lasting for me than other scents I have used.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> and it actually lasts all day unlike other perfumes.</li>
            <li> Lasts a very long time and does not weaken.</li>
            <li> Get compliments EVERY single time I wear this.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> The item arrived on time and was as expected.</li>
            <li> Also it came as expected</li>
            <li> other women ask &amp;</li>
            <li> You do get what you pay for, a little spritz goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> &gt; Hate to say it&#x27;s been over 30 years since I have had a perfume I absolutely love.  </li>
            <li> Spraying just a small sample, I could tell that a little goes a long way with this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My previous purchase (bought in a department store) smelled a bit stronger and lasted almost all day.</li>
            <li> So for less than $80 for a 3.4 oz.</li>
            <li> It was not full when delivered to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle and my perfumes usually lasts me at least 1 1/2 years.</li>
            <li> Have to admit,  was little nervous because of price.</li>
            <li> wish you had little testers so i can sample them.</li>
            <li> This scent wears off after a few hours.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure why that is.</li>
            <li> I have worn it for about 2 years now and have had people from late teens to late fifties inquire on what I am wearing.</li>
            <li> La Vie Est Belle is as subtle as a woman who knows how to get her way, but once she has it she knows how to make it seem like your idea.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a scent you don&#x27;t get tired of smelling time and again.</li>
            <li> and of course I sneak a few squirts here &amp; there &amp; mommy loves it too!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought perfume off of amazon before and it was totally fake.</li>
            <li> Bought this parfum for my wife, she tried it on at a department store but found the price was outrageous (over $200.00 for the same size, retail)</li>
            <li> So sad and disappointed.</li>
            <li> she doesn&#x27;t smell bad anymore</li>
            <li> Feel disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I never write reviews but had to on this one! I was so excited to get my favorite perfume at a better price, just got it delivered today and it smells so bad! Doesn&#x27;t smell like the real thing at all! So sad and disappointed. Will be returning it today and going to go to the store for the real thing. Lesson learned!  Update Even though this perfume didn&#x27;t work out Amazon is so amazing they are refunding me! Very satisfied by the way they handled this and this is why they will always have my business!! Alex was a pleasure to talk to :) thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> The product is not the original one because The box has been altered</li>
            <li> Good fragrance perfume she loved it was a good Christmas present</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings about this. If you spray it once it smells very nice. It has vanilla tones, some flowery, powder and spicey. But if I spray more than once I am nauseated and can get a headache. Also the scent stays for days. I won&#x27;t be buying this again. Due to the too strong scent</li>
            <li> what a beautiful, delicate scent. Reminds me of summer flowers. Love it!</li>
            <li> I first received this perfume as a sample from somewhere. As soon as I tried it, I was in love. If heaven had a smell, it would be like this! Absolutely beautiful! It also has incredible staying power. One spray on your neck and you will smell yourself all day, which is very important for me when choosing a perfume. It only smells better as the day goes on and it fades into your skin and clothes.</li>
            <li> I love this on my wife and my wife loves the way it smells on her</li>
            <li> LOVE! Smells like heaven &amp; the smell lasts all day!</li>
            <li> Wonderful fragrance, received in time for Valentine&#x27;s day ! My wife loves it and so do I.</li>
            <li> I love this scent! Very good price too!</li>
            <li> A sweet 16 gift from mommy to her little princess and she loves it and of course I sneak a few squirts here &amp; there &amp; mommy loves it too!!!! Plenty of compliments on the lovely scent...</li>
            <li> Wifey gave it four stars. I bought it because Julia Roberts was pitching it.</li>
            <li> very happy with this purchase....packaging was flawless ...will purchase again in the future. thanks! smells delicious</li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife now she doesn&#x27;t smell bad anymore so 5 stars it is.</li>
            <li> The package was delivered very quickly and my wife is very happy</li>
            <li> Love it! Will be buying again... Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great, not to strong, very nice.</li>
            <li> This smells soooooo good!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny!!!!!</li>
            <li> Smells divine...just like it did at the store!  My hubby cannot stop sniffing me when I put it on...This will be on my list of signature scents!!  People are constantly asking me who/what I&#x27;m wearing when I put it on.  What can I say?! La Vie Est certainement Belle!!</li>
            <li> excellent service and product as described</li>
            <li> My Mother loves this perfume and when I saw it on sale here on Amazon, I had to get it for her. It is a sweet scent that, like most Lancome perfumes, last&#x27;s all day and smells great on anyone.</li>
            <li> Awesome perfume.  Have been receiving sooooo many compliments on how good I smell.</li>
            <li> Excellent!!! All I get from people is &amp;#34;You smell good&amp;#34;. I am so please about this perfume. The smell stays all day long on me.</li>
            <li> Service was great! Perfume wasn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> love Lancôme and &#x27;La Vie Est Belle L&#x27;Eau - but the sprayer on mine actually squirts instead of spraying.&lt;br /&gt;tossed the box for a return, so will try to bring to a Lancôme counter to exchange</li>
            <li> This fragrance smells wonderful.  It&#x27;s very feminine and lasts throughout the day without being overpowering.  This is definitely my new favorite!</li>
            <li> My new favorite and it was the best deal I found</li>
            <li> I get the most compliments with this perfume</li>
            <li> Get a lot of compliments when I wear this perfume - not really for work (in my conservative opinion), but a total hit on a date night.</li>
            <li> This perfume is quite possibly the most fragrant smell on earth!! I love it!</li>
            <li> Wife loves it, I think the brand is over priced but this seller is on par and good shipping.</li>
            <li> My favorite so far. I have used other good quality perfumes and this is my favorite now.  The scent last and lasts. You will still smell it on your cloths the next day.</li>
            <li> It smells really good</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance...plain and simple.</li>
            <li> nice, but I expected it to smell a little more sweeter</li>
            <li> My wife is very happy !!!!</li>
            <li> Better than I expected.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this from Sephora and wore it till I ran out and I guess I must have talked quite a bit about it because I got it as a gift over the holidays and this is my go to perfume. I love it. It has a sexy and just this beautiful smell that I can&#x27;t get enough of, and every time I wear it I receive compliments from men and women, it&#x27;s just one of those scents that will turn heads. You do get what you pay for, a little spritz goes a very long way. The scent lasts all day and even after I come home and take a shower the scent still lingers on me, so the quality is amazing which doesn&#x27;t surprise me since Lancome is an amazing brand.</li>
            <li> last all day. smells like classy sex</li>
            <li> a good amount at a relatively good price - a lovely fragrance</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle and my perfumes usually lasts me at least 1 1/2 years. This scent is amazing it lasts an entire day..I LOVEEEEE IT</li>
            <li> I love the soft smell. The price better than belKS.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.  A little goes a long way, so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This stuff is good... damn! bought this for my mum. You know when someone smells rich? She smells wealthy. love to walk with her..because she smells so damn good, I tap from her compliments. If you are thinking of getting this awesome lancome la vie est belle, think no more. You are making the right choice. Thank me later!</li>
            <li> This is the best fragrance EVER!!!!!</li>
            <li> Surpassed expectations. She loves it.</li>
            <li> Beautiful smell. A gift for mom.</li>
            <li> Love it! The fragrance last all day!</li>
            <li> Excellent product fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I received this product however it does not smell like my smaller bottle. I am not sure why that is. The smell is still pleasant and this was a great buy.</li>
            <li> Feels like an imposter .... The fragrance doesn&#x27;t  last more then 1/2 hour or maybe 45 minutes . When I bought it at Macy&#x27;s , the fragrance seemed to last all day and often people would comment ( hours later ) how good I smelled !!</li>
            <li> Great fragrance my wife loves it</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and it stays on the skin for the entire day.</li>
            <li> Best perfume ever. Period.</li>
            <li> This is  longer lasting for me than other scents I have used.&lt;br /&gt;Love it !</li>
            <li> This scent wears off after a few hours.  It is great at first application, but you will have to refresh once or twice during the day.</li>
            <li> my wife love it. excellent packaging,. fast shipping, no complain.</li>
            <li> Along with Poeme, another lovely fragrance by Lancome. Just love their perfumes/ L&#x27;eau de Parfum.</li>
            <li> My wife loves lancome La Vie Est Belle, from Lancome.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, magical smell in a heavy, classic bottle.  It arrived when it was supposed to wrapped perfectly to avoid being broken.</li>
            <li> The best perfume ever! It&#x27;s strong but not overpowering and it lasts all day! I constantly get compliments on it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally review but I&#x27;m particular about my fragrances. Seemed like a great price for the size but after receiving, I can definitely say this is not original. It&#x27;s my favorite and I&#x27;ve purchased it many times over..... Feel disappointed. Still a good amount and decent smelling while it lasts. The original lasts all day.</li>
            <li> A++++++&lt;br /&gt;Good Product,Excellent Seller,Fast shipping</li>
            <li> A beautiful fragrance that everyone seems to love. Lasts a very long time and does not weaken. I would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> Awesome,super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I received a sample spray in the mail and this is parfum I purchased.  This parfum does not smell the same as the sample I received.  I want to know what I can do.  I&#x27;ve also sprayed this in the stores and the stores same parfum smelled lots stronger this one I purchased from Amazon</li>
            <li> It has a very nice long lasting smell. Love it, Love it.</li>
            <li> Beautiful Scent!  But, then again, it&#x27;s made by Lancome!</li>
            <li> This is legit! Came in a sealed box, super fragrant, color is right and scent is exactly right too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was first worried about the legitimacy since it was only $77 as opposed to $110 in stores. This bottle will last me a while since you only need one spray each use. I spray it in the air and walk in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance is amazing, everyone always asks what I&#x27;m wearing even strangers! It&#x27;s sort of like a warm floral smell, romantic and sexy!</li>
            <li> Great Perfume at a great price. Shipped quick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on this fragrance.  It has a lovely smell.  Worth the cost.</li>
            <li> gf, family and friends love this smell. a++</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this warm, spicy smell.  I just love it!  The bottle is absolutely beautiful too.  A classic must have.</li>
            <li> Unforgettable smell... 100% recommend.. I get lots of compliments</li>
            <li> Life is beautiful when I can smell nice and my husband love it too.</li>
            <li> Every time I wear this people ask me what I am wearing and tell me how good I smell</li>
            <li> wasnt same as from store but its okey for use sometime</li>
            <li> Beautiful fragance love it!!!!! Arrived a head of time too!!!</li>
            <li> My wife loved Lancome La Vie Est Belle</li>
            <li> this perfume is so romantic.  I get stopped everytime I use it.  If you want to drive a man wild, this is the perfume to do it withl.  Could not beat the price.</li>
            <li> شكل ورائحة جذابة&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attractive smell</li>
            <li> I recommend  to anyone</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful fragrance that women of all ages can wear. I have worn it for about 2 years now and have had people from late teens to late fifties inquire on what I am wearing. This is probably the fragrance I get complimented on the most. It is stronger than anything else that I wear so I use it sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I cannot attest to the authenticity of this fragrance sold online **</li>
            <li> wife loves it now she loves me</li>
            <li> This is definitely the finest parfum that Lancôme has ever created, in my opinion of course. Beautiful fragrance and well worth the $$.</li>
            <li> Excellent scent. arrive in time.</li>
            <li> smells awesome.  it came in a sealed container. which makes me 99.9% sure it&#x27;s real.  I bought perfume off of amazon before and it was totally fake.</li>
            <li> Smells like cotton candy. Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never felt the desire to wear any frangrnce besides that of my body wash, but wow, this perfume is changed my mind! It has a lovely floral scent that is light, yet elegant. I&#x27;ve received so many compliments! This is the perfect everyday personal fragrance.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, but not sure if this is the real thing. My previous purchase (bought in a department store) smelled a bit stronger and lasted almost all day. The scent of this one disappears much more quickly.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and lasts all day!</li>
            <li> Liked it and will get it again</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this fragrance!! I get&lt;br /&gt;compliments daily on &amp;#34;how good I smell&amp;#34;! I would recommend this fragrance to any gal wanting those same comments!</li>
            <li> exelent products thanks</li>
            <li> Great!!!! Everything was A+!!!</li>
            <li> My wife loves Lancôme, thought I would try a different scent, I don&#x27;t know if she likes it yet, she hasn&#x27;t tried it yet.</li>
            <li> I love this scent! it does not seem to last as long as I remembered? It could be just me? I still love it!</li>
            <li> Bought this parfum for my wife, she tried it on at a department store but found the price was outrageous (over $200.00 for the same size, retail) so we looked on several sites and found the best price here on Amazon. She get compliments on this parfum all the time - it is very sweet smelling and not overpowering, very rich and distinctive. Definitely worth the money for that someone special!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of questions about original etc., this is the REAL THING. Came in the original box and packaging (shrink wrapped or whatever it is they put around it) it is definitely not a knock off product.</li>
            <li> very strong and long lasting</li>
            <li> I  did not know this perfume, but I buy it to test, and turned too spectacular¡¡¡ Smell delicious....its excelent¡¡¡ i love it....it was an excellent purchase...I recommend</li>
            <li> It was not full when delivered to me. The box look old, someone has opened it and used it before. The smell does not last long. I am very very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Does not smell like sample at all!!!!</li>
            <li> Great price;quick ship!</li>
            <li> I ordered this Parfum for my wife.  She loves it.  Only takes a short spray to bring out the fragrance.</li>
            <li> My wife is very happy with this gift. I can recommend seller and item, your smell is great. If you have a girlfriend gift one.</li>
            <li> This is in my opinion their best fragrance yet . I would buy this again and again as I do Euphoria by Calvin Klein. Perfect for casual or evenings out. I feel blissfully gorgeous when I wear it . A must have . If you are a fan of Coco Madamoiselle , Georgio Armani Si and Calvin Klein Euphoria , I am pretty sure you will love this !</li>
            <li> love this parfume, it&#x27;s my fav.fragrance. La vie est belle has long lasting,rich and sweet smell. Love it so much</li>
            <li> got here very quick and was the real thing. figured it was going to be a knock-off. thanks</li>
            <li> Brought it for my mother, this is her favorite parfum. As we both have a sensitive nose we love this one. Good protection, even the box of the parfum came in flawless condition.</li>
            <li> What can I say.. You get what the wife wanted an you pay the price.. Viola.. A happy husband.</li>
            <li> Lancome&#x27;s La Vie Est Belle is my wife&#x27;s favorite purfume. So for less than $80 for a 3.4 oz. bottle, she had to have it. Only to find out its a knock off of the real thing. She compared it to a more expensive bottle which she already had and knew right away it wasn&#x27;t the same. The color isn&#x27;t even the same. If you don&#x27;t know perfume as well as she does, you may be okay with it. Otherwise she would not recommend this item to anyone.</li>
            <li> It was a gift but my daughter loved it!!</li>
            <li> Wife was very happy with the gift. Arrived on-time.</li>
            <li> Smells great and lasts a long time.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Wife loved it, packing could have been a little better but no damage....</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife and she loves it.  She said the fragrance is wonderful, but a small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> my wife and I love it</li>
            <li> Smells so good!! I received a sample from ultra and I had to purchase this fragrance</li>
            <li> My summer scent. So light.  Ultimate complement...  other women ask &amp;#34;what are you wearing?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> huge bottle, wife loves it!</li>
            <li> The item arrived on time and was as expected.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this scent. Was a great Christmas present</li>
            <li> I purchased this fragrance as a Christmas present for my wife. She loves it, and I love it on her. The fragrance is unique in that it doesn’t announce itself 20 feet away. It’s more intimate as it sneaks up on you and it goes directly to the senses. La Vie Est Belle is as subtle as a woman who knows how to get her way, but once she has it she knows how to make it seem like your idea.  I’ve also noticed a marked increase in cuddle time.</li>
            <li> Bought for wife she loves it</li>
            <li> A gift for my mother... arrived on time, as described and she loved it</li>
            <li> Lovely scent, wife loves it.  3.4 ounces is a HUGE bottle.  Not for travel.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Had never even smelled it until it came. Have to admit,  was little nervous because of price. But when it came, myself and my husband both said, omy that smells great. Ive gotten compliments where ever i go. Love it &amp; Thank you p.s. wish you had little testers so i can sample them. I will order more.</li>
            <li> Smells good but, is VERY strong! Only need 2 sprays max and you will smell it all day.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume, love it.</li>
            <li> I love this large bottle of La Vie Est Bell!!!  I will be re-ordering this again!</li>
            <li> I received a lot of compliments, but is not as &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; as the one I bought at Macy&#x27;s so it doesn&#x27;t last as long. Still I kept it because of the compliments</li>
            <li> This is an amazing fragrance ...turned heads , got compliments, I love love love</li>
            <li> All time favorite  perfume. I have always battled with great smelling perfumes that don&#x27;t  last long. This perfume is the complete package though , it smells AMAZING and last ALL day. I wear it to work, and by the end of the day customers and coworkers are still complimenting me. There are guys at my job that ask me to walk by them whenever I wear this scent. It is bold and delicious.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my girlfriend. She loves the scent and so do I. It&#x27;s a scent you don&#x27;t get tired of smelling time and again.</li>
            <li> Greatest perfume I love the smell and I get so many compliments it was so worth the price.</li>
            <li> Great perfume!!! I get so many compliments from women and men. It is a scent for mature women, not for teenagers. No, it is not an old lady perfume. I totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> AMAZING AND THE PRICE WAS EVEN BETTER</li>
            <li> Love this parfum, has become my new favorite. Great price also!</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing. Love love love it!! Such a sexy smell and it actually lasts all day unlike other perfumes. My favorite is still J&#x27;adore but this is my second favorite for sure.</li>
            <li> This perfume is a recent purchase for me. I tried about four different ones on my hunt for a new scent. reece@roadrunner.com I love the hit of iris and that it&#x27;s not over powering. I&#x27;ve had many compliments on this when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Fabulous perfume, terrific price and delivered earlier than expected.  Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Very good product at a excellent price.</li>
            <li> I got a bunch of perfume samples from my sister &amp; this was one. I fell in love with this scent right away. One squirt last all day &amp; everyone wants to know what your wearing! My tiny sample lasted a while, after I ran out I came here to buy, I was scared it wasn&#x27;t authentic, but it is 100% authentic the box is sealed in wrap. Glad I have my own now &amp; will buy again!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and 5 star customer service period.</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful and I get compliments all the time!</li>
            <li> My wife really loves this Parfum. Excellent choice.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Period.</li>
            <li> I recently went looking for an anniversary gift for the wife and ultimately decided on perfume as the gift. I shopped around and after trying a dizzying array of different perfumes (about 30, trust me I felt dizzy), I ultimately decided on La vie est belle. It was described to me by the salesperson as a new scent that Julia Roberts is advertising, not that makes any difference to me but once I smelled it, I knew it was the perfume that I had to get for her. This perfume mixes the scent of iris, patchouli and a gourmand blend but aside from all that, this perfume stood out to me as smelling nicer than all the rest that I had sampled. A nice scent without being overpowering, but still smells sexy. Spraying just a small sample, I could tell that a little goes a long way with this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife, who is particular with her perfumes, had never tried this perfume before me giving to her. After giving to her (and explaining I hadn&#x27;t visited the local dance club from the cocktail of perfumes I had sampled), she loved it right away. This perfume smelled just as good on her as it did on the paper that I sampled it on. Since wearing it, she said she has gotten lots of compliments on it from both men and women and also indicated that this perfume lasts all day and actually stays just as strong at the end of the day as it did from when she first sprayed it on. The price currently here at 108 dollars is a bit high as I found this size in a gift set currently selling at Macy&#x27;s for 82 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the price here, this perfume from a husband&#x27;s perspective is 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Get compliments EVERY single time I wear this. Smells divine</li>
            <li> Great fragrance, my girl love it. I love it.</li>
            <li> Perfect as expected!!!</li>
            <li> Best Price for the size! Lasts me awhile and get compliments everywhere I go!! This is my #1 favorite perfume! I recommend this to every woman out there! Trust me! You&#x27;ll love this! Also it came as expected but so worth the wait and PRICE!! I will definitely buy again and again!! :)</li>
            <li> Finally a great deal on a scent that actually lasts longer than a minute.  I wore a jacket a week after my initial use and the waiter commented on what a great perfume I was wearing. Had spritzed this at Macy&#x27;s and loved it at once never realizing it had Iris in it. I probably wouldn&#x27;t have sprized had I known Iris was in it as it usually isn&#x27;t a welcome scent for my sensitive nose, but the other ingredients make this a great scent that really envelopes you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Hate to say it&#x27;s been over 30 years since I have had a perfume I absolutely love.  Never forgave the &amp;#34;powers that be&amp;#34; for discontinuing my beloved Bill Blass for Women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon for a killer deal.  I&#x27;ll be back......</li>
