            <li>They are great for pigtails and braids.  </li>
            <li>great for children.  </li>
            <li>These are the perfect size and are easy to work with.  </li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li>it was handy to buy these online</li>
            <li>These are perfect for my 4 year old&#x27;s hair, but i wish you could buy just the pinks and purples.  </li>
            <li>I like these the best of all my young daughter&#x27;s hair ties.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, silky hair, but I&#x27;ve got boatloads of it.</li>
            <li>Not the best deal, but a better color assortment than I was seeing locally.</li>
            <li>My toddler just reached the point where we need more substantial elastic bands for her hair.  </li>
            <li>They are easy to work with and come out easily.</li>
            <li>breaks easily.</li>
            <li>The colors work, which isn&#x27;t that important to me.</li>
            <li>These are great for styling my little girl&#x27;s fine and slippery hair, and it&#x27;s a huge bonus that they don&#x27;t pull her hair when being removed.</li>
            <li>She has very fine hair, but with about 4 turns, these stay in well for a ponytail, and are easy for my big fingers to work with.</li>
            <li>The size is right.</li>
            <li>Pretty colors though</li>
            <li>First one snapped as soon as I tried to use it.</li>
            <li>I love the colors in this pack since I&#x27;m not crazy about pastels which is what a lot of other ones include.</li>
            <li>Standard size are just too big - these are much better!  </li>
            <li>Very stirdy and holds the ponytail in place.</li>
            <li>My hair is thin and these work great for me.  </li>
            <li>Elastics are nice, but they don&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
            <li>I use these for my 2 years old&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>Guess I should have paid more attention to the size of these because they are too small for me!  </li>
            <li>Strong, small hair bands that don&#x27;t pull at or break hair.  </li>
            <li>This manages to hold my hair in place with less slipping than any other kind I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>very small and cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t tangle, which makes them easy for her to pull out, but that&#x27;s worth not having to hurt her poor little head by pulling her hair.</li>
            <li>Also, i have ordered this multiple times and sometimes it comes with the colors shown, and sometimes, it&#x27;s lots of greens and blues, a few dark purple, and no pink or light purple at all.  </li>
            <li>My family has thin, fine hair, but the white color of these are just snapping and breaking as soon as I try to put them in my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>

            <li> My daughter is 2 and has thin hair, the &amp;#34;ouchless&amp;#34; rubber bands rip out her hair, I was hoping these would be better, but I can&#x27;t get this tight around her hair because it keeps breaking!</li>
            <li> Anyone with long hair or a daughter knows how these items always disappear...</li>
            <li> pretty small, didn&#x27;t realize just HOW little!</li>
            <li> If you have really thick, coarse hair this is probably not a good fit for you, because the bands are so small around.</li>
            <li> thinner than expected</li>
            <li> Not the quality I expected from goody</li>
            <li> Not happening with the other colors</li>
            <li> old girl whose hair is still a little thin.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll get some every few months.</li>
            <li> This has very little stretch to it.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that the colors were mostly dark and dreary, not girlie or vibrant.</li>
            <li> Too small for ponytails because my daughters hair is thick.  </li>
            <li> These are hard to find - order lots!  </li>
            <li> These would probably work well for a toddler&#x27;s thin hair</li>

            <li> Very stirdy and holds the ponytail in place.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, silky hair, but I&#x27;ve got boatloads of it. This manages to hold my hair in place with less slipping than any other kind I&#x27;ve tried. I can finally make it through a load of dishes without eating my bangs! If you have really thick, coarse hair this is probably not a good fit for you, because the bands are so small around.</li>
            <li> Guess I should have paid more attention to the size of these because they are too small for me!  I had to give them away to a friend who has asmall daughter.  Pretty colors though</li>

            <li> These are perfect for my 4 year old&#x27;s hair, but i wish you could buy just the pinks and purples.  She won&#x27;t wear the yellows, greens, or blues.  Also, i have ordered this multiple times and sometimes it comes with the colors shown, and sometimes, it&#x27;s lots of greens and blues, a few dark purple, and no pink or light purple at all.  she doesn&#x27;t like those colors.</li>
            <li> Great for anyone with &amp;#34;thin hair&amp;#34; pony tail!  Standard size are just too big - these are much better!  These are hard to find - order lots!  I just wish they made them in earth tone colors...</li>
            <li> I use these for my 2 years old&#x27;s hair. They are easy to work with and come out easily. I love the colors in this pack since I&#x27;m not crazy about pastels which is what a lot of other ones include.</li>

            <li> I like these the best of all my young daughter&#x27;s hair ties. They don&#x27;t stick to her hair or tug when you pull them out. She has very fine hair, but with about 4 turns, these stay in well for a ponytail, and are easy for my big fingers to work with.</li>
            <li> These are great for styling my little girl&#x27;s fine and slippery hair, and it&#x27;s a huge bonus that they don&#x27;t pull her hair when being removed. I&#x27;ve added them to my subscribe and save so I&#x27;ll get some every few months.</li>

            <li> thinner than expected</li>
            <li> Perfect size and colors for my 21mos. old girl whose hair is still a little thin. They work for ponytails, pigtails, braids, you name it. They don&#x27;t tangle, which makes them easy for her to pull out, but that&#x27;s worth not having to hurt her poor little head by pulling her hair.</li>

            <li> My toddler just reached the point where we need more substantial elastic bands for her hair.  These are the perfect size and are easy to work with.  I would just like to find additional color options.</li>
            <li> My family has thin, fine hair, but the white color of these are just snapping and breaking as soon as I try to put them in my daughter&#x27;s hair.  Not happening with the other colors so that&#x27;s good.  The size is right.</li>
            <li> great for children.  very small and cheaply made.  breaks easily.</li>
            <li> perfect size for a toddler, they stay in well.</li>
            <li> Keeps the hair in place. Thats all I needed.</li>
            <li> Granddaughters use them all the time. I recommend then especially as an add-on item!</li>
