            <li>It was a surprisingly high-quality soap &amp; arrived in the mail very quickly.</li>
            <li>Very strong though.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s too soon to tell if this is going to be a holy grail product, the scent is intoxicating and so far I have had very good results with cleansing my face with this soap.</li>

            <li>glad I did.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>This one soap did more for me in one week than rx for brown skin did for me in a 6 months....</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t wash my face with this too many times because it&#x27;ll make my face ashy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It lathers quicker and better than any soap I have used before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I must say I am quite pleased</li>
            <li>For the most part I would rather stink and keep my skin.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>I am really enjoying using this soap.</li>
            <li>and I also use a store brand cleanser mixed with the soap and my skin is flawless.</li>
            <li>ITS LATHERS GOOD,SMELL OKAY.</li>
            <li>It smells refreshing.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that this soap has a very rich lather.</li>
            <li>Smells tropical, and leaves a nice clean smell to your skin after</li>
            <li>but if it do they have some good stuff out there.it&#x27;s the first thing I smell when I walk into my bedroom.</li>
            <li>Rich, creamy, luxurious!</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like soap with strong smells, this one should be okay for you.</li>
            <li>I got this soap after reading lot of positive reviews,this soap seems to be a good cleanser, takes all the dirt and makeup out completely,also lathers well.</li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned and this soap leaves my skin soft and clean.</li>
            <li>It makes you feel clean all over!  </li>
            <li>Keeps my skin clear and smells great.</li>
            <li>This soap is ideal for sever to moderate acne conditions.</li>
            <li>Beware that the shipping and handling cost is exceptional high as it cost more than the soap itself.</li>
            <li>Can they manufacture this soap to be more user friendly while rendering results?</li>
            <li>Definitely not bad like sulfur soaps!</li>
            <li>I opened it and could smell the *strong* perfume scent.  </li>
            <li>This soap removes my make-up pretty easily and has a nice smell.</li>
            <li>The first day I thought this soap was amazing, but it did end up purging my skin</li>
            <li>I love the clean feeling and sound.</li>
            <li>This best soap hands down</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t live in a good neighborhood where you have to wonder if it&#x27;ll be there when you get home</li>
            <li>Thankfully I live in a generally good neighborhood</li>
            <li>People, this soap is for everyone, not just black people (do you know how incredibly ignorant that sounds?!</li>
            <li>After using this for sometime your gina skins will be even toned, bump free, and luxurious baby.</li>
            <li>If anyones worried if their efficient when it comes to shipping I would say that they are, I am an amazon prime member and the shipping was free for all my goods, paid by amazon.</li>
            <li>it keeps your skin exfoliated and blemish free.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t burn me till the third week of use, but it works great on my body.</li>
            <li>It lathers VERY well and works nicely, but it&#x27;s just too drying for me to use.</li>
            <li>Good oil free soap,perfect for oily skin,may not be suitable for dry skin.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face and so does my teenage daughter skin is responding very nicely...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s super strong though</li>
            <li>If you have any kind of skin problem I highly recomend this soap, I have not had to use any type of rash ointment since I began using this soap.</li>
            <li>It does not have a nice natural perfume scent - it is strong &amp; overpowering.  </li>
            <li>but it is well worth it!</li>
            <li>Fabulous scent that is full of floral accents.</li>
            <li>Five bucks for a year&#x27;s worth of cleanser!</li>
            <li>It has a unique clean smell but</li>
            <li>It smells \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; and clean.</li>
            <li>Dudu-Osun soap suds up so well, is long-lasting, and feels so clean.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It leaves my skin 100% clean.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that it leaves his skin squeaky clean without stripping it of moisture.</li>
            <li>all the soap is well worth the extra wiping of the shower as it is a great product.</li>
            <li>I feel really clean after using it.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product because it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin like the chemical anti-bacterial soaps, and seems to work as well as most anti-bacterial</li>
            <li>This product makes my arms and legs feel super clean, and smells clean, not perfumed or chemically.  </li>
            <li>I gave some as gifts and also got back good feedback from others.</li>
            <li>A good investment and moderately priced</li>
            <li>purchased this INSTEAD of an anti-bacterial soap full of chemicals.  </li>
            <li>It works as a good, moisturizing facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li>You will feel fresh and clean and you will glow.  </li>
            <li>This soap arrived quickly, on time, and was well packaged.</li>
            <li>However, I love the smell and it leaves my face smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Quick note of another product I wish that was offered on Amazon is Kirlangic olive soap--there is nothing like this soap.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this soap. :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced a lot of issues with dark spots/blemishes, and acne.</li>
            <li>I love the way this makes my skin feel, soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>Many reviews said this was the best product while others said that Raw Black Soap was better.</li>
            <li>My skin has not looked this good for a very long time.  </li>
            <li>All in all best black soap ive used and invested in so far.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t really move my face freely but that subsided after an or or so.</li>
            <li>THE ONLY way i can use it eeryday is if i mix it with some kind of oil (castor, shea butter, or jojoba)</li>
            <li>I suffer from a rare skin disease called Granuloma Faciale.  </li>
            <li>I love the idea of using mystical elements from the Dead Sea...but honestly, I didn&#x27;t see any change in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I always get compliments about my skin being clear, radiant and smooth!</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a more natural alternative cleansing than just the store soaps like \\&quot;dove\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>oh my goodness so fresh.  </li>
            <li>Makes the four dollars and some change for a bar of soap worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product religiously for 3-4 weeks, and I honestly say I have noticed a difference...</li>
            <li>So I bought this in my efforts to use more natural products on my skin.</li>
            <li>It was the same kind of tub that Shea butter would come in.  </li>
            <li>The product truly is worth buying.</li>
            <li>We love this soap for its natural ingredients and the way that it makes our skin feel.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even wear foundation most days anymore, my skin is clear and even.</li>
            <li>(Love Tamanu and both were purchased via Amazon), and Natural Shea butter (from amazon) for the rest of my body.  </li>
            <li>A friend gave me a nondescript bar of bamboo ash black soap as a gift; I fell in love with it, and hoped The Dudu would be a suitable replacement.</li>
            <li>The soap came in two days as stated it would be and did everything good the other reviews said it would.</li>
            <li>I purchased this soap the other day I can tell you that this soap is good on the skin it takes off the build up oils in the skin from lotions and body oils</li>
            <li>but now I apply it and rinse it right off.</li>
            <li>Enjoy your new skin!</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant to purchase soap to clean my face since I have always been told that soap is a no no for your skin.</li>
            <li>So I don&#x27;t know if it was natural or authentic had to go one of the health stores and get the bar of soap I ordered which I love and definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>Since it can dry and sting, some folks get best results by using every other day or so.</li>
            <li>I recommend strongly if u want to clear your oily skin.</li>
            <li>Some say it moisturizes skin nicely, others get dry and recommend moisturizing afterward.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased and will continue to buy and recommend (have already converted several of my co-workers and friends who all have been converted!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon for offering such great products at such affordable prices !!</li>
            <li>and I love the results on red spots and scars.  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s been using this daily, and let me tell you her skin is glowing and has never looked better.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t put a finger on what it was, exactly ...</li>
            <li>I really love this soap &amp; just regret that it took me years to finally try it after first hearing about it.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more of this product</li>
            <li>I tried this soap for the first time about 2 months ago.  </li>
            <li>first off I want to give a rreview of the shipping.</li>
            <li>When I first receieved it I used it day and night..</li>
            <li>Just smooth, soft and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Read as many reviews as possible, as results vary.</li>
            <li>The smell is somewhat odd, but not bad and is easy to become accustomed to quickly.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and DuDu-OSun, keeps me from breaking out and also reduces any dark scaring on my skin, Love it!</li>
            <li>This soap leaves my skin squeaky clean, soft, and moisturized.</li>
            <li>My face feels soft and clean.</li>
            <li>Just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t user&#x27;s error, i tried again to use it for a week straight three times and the same results happen.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best soap out there, but be careful because if you use it to much it can dry your skin out.</li>
            <li>The first one was from a whole foods store, and it did nothing.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say that my breakouts have come to a minimum and my dark spots have lightened up a lot.</li>
            <li>Strips off old make up and suntan lotions etc leaving skin really squeaky clean..</li>
            <li>The fragrance actually stays on your skin and you will feel fresh and clean after use.</li>
            <li>fresh clean scent makes the entire bathroom smell nice&lt;</li>
            <li>I am super sensitive to soaps</li>
            <li>Not only that it helped me greatly with cystic acne and dark spots on my face.  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly large bar, which appears like it will last a good long time.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this soap because it stated 100% pure.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients are as pure as you can get.</li>
            <li>I should note that it would be wise to mix the soap with an oil such as jojoba or rosehip seed oil, as it can be drying to your face if you have dry or combination skin like I do.</li>
            <li>Made from all natural ingredients with nothing in it to dry your skin out or leave chemical residue but to leave your skin like nature intended, clean, super baby soft smooth that my husband just loves to touch</li>
            <li>I also get these little tiny bumps ... stemming from my shea butter allergy that I ignore lol .</li>
            <li>She used it and low and behold her skin cleared up greatly with a few breakouts once in a while along the chin or hairline.</li>
            <li>and she really wanted to try it.  </li>
            <li>My skin is VERY SOFT...but VERY ASHY.</li>
            <li>It works VERY well for my bf, but he gets very ashy as well; but my hair &amp; face LLOOOOOOOVVVVEE IT STILL.</li>
            <li>This difference was a glow; my skin was glowing and much brighter (not lighter, just brighter).  </li>
            <li>So much bubble for a bar of soap</li>
            <li>but it has really cleared my face.</li>
            <li>I use it as a shaving soap and to wash with...leaves skin fresh and baby soft.</li>
            <li>Having psoriasis I thought this product would be more hydrating, but it was not what I expected.</li>
            <li>so i know the real from the manufactured and processed.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really do much for my hyperpigmented acne marks I have on my skin</li>
            <li>But On my body, not so much.</li>
            <li>It has soothed his irritated skin so much.</li>
            <li>Gentle, non drying.</li>
            <li>I deal with oily acne prone skin and this soap has helped so much</li>
            <li>But be gentle when apply it to your skin, it really exfoilates.</li>
            <li>I really like this soap.</li>
            <li>scent is very pleasing.  </li>
            <li>The price was reasonable</li>
            <li>The soap doesn&#x27;t seem to work as fast or miraculous for me as it did for my sister</li>
            <li>but it made my skin feel very itchy.</li>
            <li>This soap is so gentle yet it works.</li>
            <li>I quickly got a burning and itching sensation on my face, especially my jawline and chin area which I ignored at first and didn&#x27;t touch.</li>
            <li>I also wish Amazon would carry my other FAVORITE brand that&#x27;s almost identical</li>
            <li>I have extremely oily skin which makes it more subjected to breakouts..</li>
            <li>I would rather have the raw kind, but this will do for now.</li>
            <li>it felt nice, but afterwards it made the area very tight and almost squeaky</li>
            <li>My personal experience with this soap, after buying and using one full bar, is that it really works.  </li>
            <li>but it will definitely get your skin clean and under control</li>
            <li>I personally use this soap to clean every inch of my body.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had to lather him once for him to get clean.</li>
            <li>One thing though is that is will dissolve fast if left in water, to lengthen the life of this NATURAL soap, make sure to put it somewhere where water will not stand near it.  </li>
            <li>It makes me feel incredibly clean without drying my skin &amp; continued use has brought about this healthy overall glow &amp; gradual fading of dark spots.</li>
            <li>I also had an allergic reaction to my new cat and broke out into a rash, the soap took care of that in a few days which was nice.</li>
            <li>skin:  sensitive to most everything, oily but dry?</li>
            <li>I just make sure I use a toner (50/50 mix of Rose water and witch hazel) to remove any film left behind.</li>
            <li>other have written, this soap gives your skins a smooth, but dry type feeling - more smooth than dry.  </li>
            <li>After bathing him I make sure to slather him down from head to toe with a shea butter and aloe vera gel mixture.</li>
            <li>Dudu-Osun 100% Pure African Black Soap -  smells nice and it lathers well, but doesn&#x27;t do anything more for skin than any other soap.</li>
            <li>and it does not dry my skin out love it a bit messy with the color but not hard to clean up</li>
            <li>If it stays wet all the time it disolves very quickly.</li>
            <li>I thought this would&#x27;ve been a great and promising product based off of the reviews, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li>My skin is cleaner, pores appears to be smaller, my very sensitive skin has been clearer and feels almost squeaky clean after washing it,</li>
            <li>I attributed it to the fact that there is lime juice in this soap, and we all know that lemon and lime are highly acidic.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended, for this price you can&#x27;t go wrong!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I started using it and am fairly happy, my skin has not had a major rocesea break out in a while, but it is worse in the winter, so I shall see then.</li>
            <li>And smells fresh and clean with a long lasting freshness</li>
            <li>i REALLY like the smell and how soft my skin is.</li>
            <li>It did clear my face within a week, but I had to stop using it because it was burning me way too much.</li>
            <li>Most of my acne dried up and some of the scars looked lighter.  </li>
            <li>I will stick to my normal soap.</li>
            <li>I have gotten alot of compliments on how nice my skin looks lately.</li>
            <li>it is natural and unrefined but we live in a modern age.  </li>
            <li>Had used African black soap with Cocoa butter and shea and it cleared my blemishes so nicely.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft but not as soft as the raw kind.  </li>
            <li>This is a great african black soap for dry and ichy skin problems.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;it wipes up easy and does not stain but the dark brown streaks can be a bit unsightly.&lt;br /&gt;over</li>
            <li>I love using the Dusu-Osun 100% Pure African Black Soap.</li>
            <li>The soap doesn&#x27;t live up to the claims.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a lifelong zest user to feel clean with no soap residue feeling.</li>
            <li>I have always used expensive cleansers and beauty products and could honestly say I rather use my black soap and rose water any day.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and now my skin is silky smooth with hardly no acne!</li>
            <li>It does indeed clear out darker areas on the body!  </li>
            <li>It makes your face brighter and it makes your acne clear!</li>
            <li>GO NATURAL!</li>
            <li>Wow is this not your every day soap!</li>
            <li>I always have to put on way more moisturizer than usual after using it and then have to reapply as the day goes on.</li>
            <li>The lather is amazing and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I did not experience any burning or drying when using this soap as others have reported; it has actually been more gentle than a lot of the acne cleansers I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>Glad to have my black soap back in my life &amp; by the way</li>
            <li>I bought this after hearing African Black soap worked for acne-prone skin, and I was not disappointed!!</li>
            <li>I got this soap in hopes that it would clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>My face was clear.</li>
            <li>My skin&#x27;s so soft that i don&#x27;t mind a bit</li>
            <li>I DO NOT have sensitive skin, so this was a surprise to me...</li>
            <li>But then again, I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I recommend the soap for everyone, I have sensitive skin and have not had any problems with it so far.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive and this BURNED my face.</li>
            <li>The next morning I noticed my one acne scar I had on my cheek was VERY faded</li>
            <li>felt soft.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and supple after using this.</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that the ingredients are simple and straight to the point</li>
            <li>I want to start by saying that I do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>DEVELOPED ADULT ACNE</li>
            <li>SINCE I WENT NATURAL WITH MY HAIR</li>
            <li>I DECIDED TO TRY NATURAL PRODUCTS ON MY FACE.</li>
            <li>AND SO FAR</li>
            <li>I have soft spots everywhere</li>
            <li>I am highly sensitive to drugs and chemicals and have some allergies.</li>
            <li>My second thing that I will say is that it will burn the sensitive skin user for the first week or so, and then your face gets used to it or it is working as an astringent - but bare with it.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see full results until the bar was dwindling down a bit - but the diminishing is noticeable indeed.  </li>
            <li>So, yeah, it is black soap.... or rather dark brown, and it is named something you might pronounce \\&quot;doo-doo\\&quot;, but man is this a nice product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The only problem I found was this seems to leave my skin more dry as I already have dry skin.</li>
            <li>For the first couple of weeks of using this product, my skin was really dry.</li>
            <li>sure to be careful with this soap for other reasons as well.</li>
            <li>She claimed it quickly cleared her acne and cleared up the dark spots.</li>
            <li>When I first used this product, I found it to be a little harsh, mostly on my girly bits.</li>
            <li>Got this soap after reading about other people&#x27;s success with helping their acne/problem skin.</li>
            <li>When I used it on my face, my skin felt squeaky clean and firm.</li>
            <li>I have to mention the soap is not black but in fact brown.</li>
            <li>After a few uses, I barely notice anything but smooth skin.</li>
            <li>A few more days and my lips and other sensitive areas would sting if left sudzed up for more than a few seconds.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t the soap for my face or body and it makes one skin more dry, too harsh.</li>
            <li>I have spent loads of money on products I ended up throwing away because it either stopped or never helped my skin in the first</li>
            <li>You have to be patient with this product, it does calm down my acne</li>
            <li>But that wasn&#x27;t enough, within a little while of using it I ended up with huge breakouts along my jawline and chin that took quite a while to finally calm down and go away.</li>
            <li>This is your every day luxurious lathering all natural will NOT dry your skin out soap!</li>
            <li>This is like no other soap I&#x27;ve ever tried</li>
            <li>I recommend keeping it away from private areas for the first use, just for the potential sting in this deep cleansing soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have been using a semi liquid form of African black soap for a few months for my face, amazing.  </li>
            <li>This soap is high quality and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>i tried this soap because i have had issues w breaks outs off and on over the years, after reading reviews i decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;this is not a soap you use anywhere near the eyes or if you have very sensitive or dry</li>
            <li>I barely put any moisturizer on my face and I have not felt any drying effects on it.</li>
            <li>It only made my skin soft</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s only carried at coastalscents.com.</li>
            <li>It is the only soap that fully and completely washes off my matte makeup without leaving any residue.</li>
            <li>WHEN I WAS 18YRS OLD, BEEN SUCH A PROBLEM FOR ME FOR OVER 20YRS.</li>
            <li>and I ended up with more blemished skin behind it.</li>
            <li>The only negative if this is really one, is if you do not put it a proper soap dish it will disentigrate quickly.  </li>
            <li>one may not want to use this on a daily basis especially if they live in an area with a colder climate.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this product, first time purchasing black soap, thinking I was going to receive it as it is pictured in the product description (bar form).</li>
            <li>It has a mild scent, and I&#x27;m not really sure how to describe it.</li>
            <li>I love using this soap feel clean and smell fresh, but have been told that it is no longer allowed because it leaves a dark  residue on the shower like someone possibly  had bad diarrhea and couldn&#x27;t  find  the toilet.</li>
            <li>(I know I shouldn&#x27;t), so it is taking a little longer to clear up, but it really does seem to be working.</li>
            <li>I also got my soap much sooner than expected; I have a feeling I will be re-ordering soon!</li>
            <li>It lathered up well with a thick rich feel.</li>
            <li>I would have to agree with the ones that say Raw Black Soap is better.</li>
            <li>This has to be the first time I have ever washed my face with soap since I was a little girl.</li>
            <li>It will even lather a little brown at first.</li>
            <li>this soap also melts down pretty fast as natural soaps usually do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s solidly made, and has lasted much longer than my other soap shea butter soap.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend this to anyone who has sensitive and/or dry skin.</li>
            <li>Thank you for providing Dudu-Osun Black soap at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I will go back to using the green shea butter black soap for my face, because the brown is to strong.</li>
            <li>I have read in some of the reviews that it is great as a shampoo, but I have super dry hair already and I am afraid that this may make it worse.</li>
            <li>bought this Dudu-Osun bar to see if the rest of my skin would like African Black soap as much as much face has.  </li>
            <li>This has helped so much with my acne n dark spots!</li>
            <li>My skin did burn a little bit but not so much.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> glad I did.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> This one soap did more for me in one week than rx for brown skin did for me in a 6 months....</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t wash my face with this too many times because it&#x27;ll make my face ashy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It lathers quicker and better than any soap I have used before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I must say I am quite pleased</li>
            <li> For the most part I would rather stink and keep my skin.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying using this soap.</li>
            <li> and I also use a store brand cleanser mixed with the soap and my skin is flawless.</li>
            <li> ITS LATHERS GOOD,SMELL OKAY.</li>
            <li> It smells refreshing.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this soap has a very rich lather.</li>
            <li> Smells tropical, and leaves a nice clean smell to your skin after</li>
            <li> but if it do they have some good stuff out there.it&#x27;s the first thing I smell when I walk into my bedroom.</li>
            <li> Rich, creamy, luxurious!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like soap with strong smells, this one should be okay for you.</li>
            <li> I got this soap after reading lot of positive reviews,this soap seems to be a good cleanser, takes all the dirt and makeup out completely,also lathers well.</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned and this soap leaves my skin soft and clean.</li>
            <li> It makes you feel clean all over!  </li>
            <li> Keeps my skin clear and smells great.</li>
            <li> This soap is ideal for sever to moderate acne conditions.</li>
            <li> Beware that the shipping and handling cost is exceptional high as it cost more than the soap itself.</li>
            <li> Can they manufacture this soap to be more user friendly while rendering results?</li>
            <li> Definitely not bad like sulfur soaps!</li>
            <li> I opened it and could smell the *strong* perfume scent.  </li>
            <li> This soap removes my make-up pretty easily and has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> The first day I thought this soap was amazing, but it did end up purging my skin</li>
            <li> I love the clean feeling and sound.</li>
            <li> This best soap hands down</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t live in a good neighborhood where you have to wonder if it&#x27;ll be there when you get home</li>
            <li> Thankfully I live in a generally good neighborhood</li>
            <li> People, this soap is for everyone, not just black people (do you know how incredibly ignorant that sounds?!</li>
            <li> After using this for sometime your gina skins will be even toned, bump free, and luxurious baby.</li>
            <li> If anyones worried if their efficient when it comes to shipping I would say that they are, I am an amazon prime member and the shipping was free for all my goods, paid by amazon.</li>
            <li> it keeps your skin exfoliated and blemish free.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t burn me till the third week of use, but it works great on my body.</li>
            <li> It lathers VERY well and works nicely, but it&#x27;s just too drying for me to use.</li>
            <li> Good oil free soap,perfect for oily skin,may not be suitable for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face and so does my teenage daughter skin is responding very nicely...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s super strong though</li>
            <li> If you have any kind of skin problem I highly recomend this soap, I have not had to use any type of rash ointment since I began using this soap.</li>
            <li> It does not have a nice natural perfume scent - it is strong &amp; overpowering.  </li>
            <li> but it is well worth it!</li>
            <li> Fabulous scent that is full of floral accents.</li>
            <li> Five bucks for a year&#x27;s worth of cleanser!</li>
            <li> It has a unique clean smell but</li>
            <li> It smells \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; and clean.</li>
            <li> Dudu-Osun soap suds up so well, is long-lasting, and feels so clean.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It leaves my skin 100% clean.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that it leaves his skin squeaky clean without stripping it of moisture.</li>
            <li> all the soap is well worth the extra wiping of the shower as it is a great product.</li>
            <li> I feel really clean after using it.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product because it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin like the chemical anti-bacterial soaps, and seems to work as well as most anti-bacterial</li>
            <li> This product makes my arms and legs feel super clean, and smells clean, not perfumed or chemically.  </li>
            <li> I gave some as gifts and also got back good feedback from others.</li>
            <li> A good investment and moderately priced</li>
            <li> purchased this INSTEAD of an anti-bacterial soap full of chemicals.  </li>
            <li> It works as a good, moisturizing facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li> You will feel fresh and clean and you will glow.  </li>
            <li> This soap arrived quickly, on time, and was well packaged.</li>
            <li> However, I love the smell and it leaves my face smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Quick note of another product I wish that was offered on Amazon is Kirlangic olive soap--there is nothing like this soap.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this soap. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experienced a lot of issues with dark spots/blemishes, and acne.</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my skin feel, soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> Many reviews said this was the best product while others said that Raw Black Soap was better.</li>
            <li> My skin has not looked this good for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> All in all best black soap ive used and invested in so far.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t really move my face freely but that subsided after an or or so.</li>
            <li> THE ONLY way i can use it eeryday is if i mix it with some kind of oil (castor, shea butter, or jojoba)</li>
            <li> I suffer from a rare skin disease called Granuloma Faciale.  </li>
            <li> I love the idea of using mystical elements from the Dead Sea...but honestly, I didn&#x27;t see any change in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I always get compliments about my skin being clear, radiant and smooth!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a more natural alternative cleansing than just the store soaps like \\&quot;dove\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> oh my goodness so fresh.  </li>
            <li> Makes the four dollars and some change for a bar of soap worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product religiously for 3-4 weeks, and I honestly say I have noticed a difference...</li>
            <li> So I bought this in my efforts to use more natural products on my skin.</li>
            <li> It was the same kind of tub that Shea butter would come in.  </li>
            <li> The product truly is worth buying.</li>
            <li> We love this soap for its natural ingredients and the way that it makes our skin feel.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even wear foundation most days anymore, my skin is clear and even.</li>
            <li> (Love Tamanu and both were purchased via Amazon), and Natural Shea butter (from amazon) for the rest of my body.  </li>
            <li> A friend gave me a nondescript bar of bamboo ash black soap as a gift; I fell in love with it, and hoped The Dudu would be a suitable replacement.</li>
            <li> The soap came in two days as stated it would be and did everything good the other reviews said it would.</li>
            <li> I purchased this soap the other day I can tell you that this soap is good on the skin it takes off the build up oils in the skin from lotions and body oils</li>
            <li> but now I apply it and rinse it right off.</li>
            <li> Enjoy your new skin!</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to purchase soap to clean my face since I have always been told that soap is a no no for your skin.</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t know if it was natural or authentic had to go one of the health stores and get the bar of soap I ordered which I love and definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Since it can dry and sting, some folks get best results by using every other day or so.</li>
            <li> I recommend strongly if u want to clear your oily skin.</li>
            <li> Some say it moisturizes skin nicely, others get dry and recommend moisturizing afterward.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased and will continue to buy and recommend (have already converted several of my co-workers and friends who all have been converted!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon for offering such great products at such affordable prices !!</li>
            <li> and I love the results on red spots and scars.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s been using this daily, and let me tell you her skin is glowing and has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t put a finger on what it was, exactly ...</li>
            <li> I really love this soap &amp; just regret that it took me years to finally try it after first hearing about it.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more of this product</li>
            <li> I tried this soap for the first time about 2 months ago.  </li>
            <li> first off I want to give a rreview of the shipping.</li>
            <li> When I first receieved it I used it day and night..</li>
            <li> Just smooth, soft and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Read as many reviews as possible, as results vary.</li>
            <li> The smell is somewhat odd, but not bad and is easy to become accustomed to quickly.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and DuDu-OSun, keeps me from breaking out and also reduces any dark scaring on my skin, Love it!</li>
            <li> This soap leaves my skin squeaky clean, soft, and moisturized.</li>
            <li> My face feels soft and clean.</li>
            <li> Just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t user&#x27;s error, i tried again to use it for a week straight three times and the same results happen.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best soap out there, but be careful because if you use it to much it can dry your skin out.</li>
            <li> The first one was from a whole foods store, and it did nothing.</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say that my breakouts have come to a minimum and my dark spots have lightened up a lot.</li>
            <li> Strips off old make up and suntan lotions etc leaving skin really squeaky clean..</li>
            <li> The fragrance actually stays on your skin and you will feel fresh and clean after use.</li>
            <li> fresh clean scent makes the entire bathroom smell nice&lt;</li>
            <li> I am super sensitive to soaps</li>
            <li> Not only that it helped me greatly with cystic acne and dark spots on my face.  </li>
            <li> Surprisingly large bar, which appears like it will last a good long time.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this soap because it stated 100% pure.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients are as pure as you can get.</li>
            <li> I should note that it would be wise to mix the soap with an oil such as jojoba or rosehip seed oil, as it can be drying to your face if you have dry or combination skin like I do.</li>
            <li> Made from all natural ingredients with nothing in it to dry your skin out or leave chemical residue but to leave your skin like nature intended, clean, super baby soft smooth that my husband just loves to touch</li>
            <li> I also get these little tiny bumps ... stemming from my shea butter allergy that I ignore lol .</li>
            <li> She used it and low and behold her skin cleared up greatly with a few breakouts once in a while along the chin or hairline.</li>
            <li> and she really wanted to try it.  </li>
            <li> My skin is VERY SOFT...but VERY ASHY.</li>
            <li> It works VERY well for my bf, but he gets very ashy as well; but my hair &amp; face LLOOOOOOOVVVVEE IT STILL.</li>
            <li> This difference was a glow; my skin was glowing and much brighter (not lighter, just brighter).  </li>
            <li> So much bubble for a bar of soap</li>
            <li> but it has really cleared my face.</li>
            <li> I use it as a shaving soap and to wash with...leaves skin fresh and baby soft.</li>
            <li> Having psoriasis I thought this product would be more hydrating, but it was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> so i know the real from the manufactured and processed.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really do much for my hyperpigmented acne marks I have on my skin</li>
            <li> But On my body, not so much.</li>
            <li> It has soothed his irritated skin so much.</li>
            <li> Gentle, non drying.</li>
            <li> I deal with oily acne prone skin and this soap has helped so much</li>
            <li> But be gentle when apply it to your skin, it really exfoilates.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap.</li>
            <li> scent is very pleasing.  </li>
            <li> The price was reasonable</li>
            <li> The soap doesn&#x27;t seem to work as fast or miraculous for me as it did for my sister</li>
            <li> but it made my skin feel very itchy.</li>
            <li> This soap is so gentle yet it works.</li>
            <li> I quickly got a burning and itching sensation on my face, especially my jawline and chin area which I ignored at first and didn&#x27;t touch.</li>
            <li> I also wish Amazon would carry my other FAVORITE brand that&#x27;s almost identical</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin which makes it more subjected to breakouts..</li>
            <li> I would rather have the raw kind, but this will do for now.</li>
            <li> it felt nice, but afterwards it made the area very tight and almost squeaky</li>
            <li> My personal experience with this soap, after buying and using one full bar, is that it really works.  </li>
            <li> but it will definitely get your skin clean and under control</li>
            <li> I personally use this soap to clean every inch of my body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had to lather him once for him to get clean.</li>
            <li> One thing though is that is will dissolve fast if left in water, to lengthen the life of this NATURAL soap, make sure to put it somewhere where water will not stand near it.  </li>
            <li> It makes me feel incredibly clean without drying my skin &amp; continued use has brought about this healthy overall glow &amp; gradual fading of dark spots.</li>
            <li> I also had an allergic reaction to my new cat and broke out into a rash, the soap took care of that in a few days which was nice.</li>
            <li> skin:  sensitive to most everything, oily but dry?</li>
            <li> I just make sure I use a toner (50/50 mix of Rose water and witch hazel) to remove any film left behind.</li>
            <li> other have written, this soap gives your skins a smooth, but dry type feeling - more smooth than dry.  </li>
            <li> After bathing him I make sure to slather him down from head to toe with a shea butter and aloe vera gel mixture.</li>
            <li> Dudu-Osun 100% Pure African Black Soap -  smells nice and it lathers well, but doesn&#x27;t do anything more for skin than any other soap.</li>
            <li> and it does not dry my skin out love it a bit messy with the color but not hard to clean up</li>
            <li> If it stays wet all the time it disolves very quickly.</li>
            <li> I thought this would&#x27;ve been a great and promising product based off of the reviews, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> My skin is cleaner, pores appears to be smaller, my very sensitive skin has been clearer and feels almost squeaky clean after washing it,</li>
            <li> I attributed it to the fact that there is lime juice in this soap, and we all know that lemon and lime are highly acidic.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended, for this price you can&#x27;t go wrong!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started using it and am fairly happy, my skin has not had a major rocesea break out in a while, but it is worse in the winter, so I shall see then.</li>
            <li> And smells fresh and clean with a long lasting freshness</li>
            <li> i REALLY like the smell and how soft my skin is.</li>
            <li> It did clear my face within a week, but I had to stop using it because it was burning me way too much.</li>
            <li> Most of my acne dried up and some of the scars looked lighter.  </li>
            <li> I will stick to my normal soap.</li>
            <li> I have gotten alot of compliments on how nice my skin looks lately.</li>
            <li> it is natural and unrefined but we live in a modern age.  </li>
            <li> Had used African black soap with Cocoa butter and shea and it cleared my blemishes so nicely.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft but not as soft as the raw kind.  </li>
            <li> This is a great african black soap for dry and ichy skin problems.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;it wipes up easy and does not stain but the dark brown streaks can be a bit unsightly.&lt;br /&gt;over</li>
            <li> I love using the Dusu-Osun 100% Pure African Black Soap.</li>
            <li> The soap doesn&#x27;t live up to the claims.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lifelong zest user to feel clean with no soap residue feeling.</li>
            <li> I have always used expensive cleansers and beauty products and could honestly say I rather use my black soap and rose water any day.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and now my skin is silky smooth with hardly no acne!</li>
            <li> It does indeed clear out darker areas on the body!  </li>
            <li> It makes your face brighter and it makes your acne clear!</li>
            <li> GO NATURAL!</li>
            <li> Wow is this not your every day soap!</li>
            <li> I always have to put on way more moisturizer than usual after using it and then have to reapply as the day goes on.</li>
            <li> The lather is amazing and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I did not experience any burning or drying when using this soap as others have reported; it has actually been more gentle than a lot of the acne cleansers I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Glad to have my black soap back in my life &amp; by the way</li>
            <li> I bought this after hearing African Black soap worked for acne-prone skin, and I was not disappointed!!</li>
            <li> I got this soap in hopes that it would clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> My face was clear.</li>
            <li> My skin&#x27;s so soft that i don&#x27;t mind a bit</li>
            <li> I DO NOT have sensitive skin, so this was a surprise to me...</li>
            <li> But then again, I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I recommend the soap for everyone, I have sensitive skin and have not had any problems with it so far.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive and this BURNED my face.</li>
            <li> The next morning I noticed my one acne scar I had on my cheek was VERY faded</li>
            <li> felt soft.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and supple after using this.</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that the ingredients are simple and straight to the point</li>
            <li> I want to start by saying that I do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> DEVELOPED ADULT ACNE</li>
            <li> SINCE I WENT NATURAL WITH MY HAIR</li>
            <li> I DECIDED TO TRY NATURAL PRODUCTS ON MY FACE.</li>
            <li> AND SO FAR</li>
            <li> I have soft spots everywhere</li>
            <li> I am highly sensitive to drugs and chemicals and have some allergies.</li>
            <li> My second thing that I will say is that it will burn the sensitive skin user for the first week or so, and then your face gets used to it or it is working as an astringent - but bare with it.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see full results until the bar was dwindling down a bit - but the diminishing is noticeable indeed.  </li>
            <li> So, yeah, it is black soap.... or rather dark brown, and it is named something you might pronounce \\&quot;doo-doo\\&quot;, but man is this a nice product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The only problem I found was this seems to leave my skin more dry as I already have dry skin.</li>
            <li> For the first couple of weeks of using this product, my skin was really dry.</li>
            <li> sure to be careful with this soap for other reasons as well.</li>
            <li> She claimed it quickly cleared her acne and cleared up the dark spots.</li>
            <li> When I first used this product, I found it to be a little harsh, mostly on my girly bits.</li>
            <li> Got this soap after reading about other people&#x27;s success with helping their acne/problem skin.</li>
            <li> When I used it on my face, my skin felt squeaky clean and firm.</li>
            <li> I have to mention the soap is not black but in fact brown.</li>
            <li> After a few uses, I barely notice anything but smooth skin.</li>
            <li> A few more days and my lips and other sensitive areas would sting if left sudzed up for more than a few seconds.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the soap for my face or body and it makes one skin more dry, too harsh.</li>
            <li> I have spent loads of money on products I ended up throwing away because it either stopped or never helped my skin in the first</li>
            <li> You have to be patient with this product, it does calm down my acne</li>
            <li> But that wasn&#x27;t enough, within a little while of using it I ended up with huge breakouts along my jawline and chin that took quite a while to finally calm down and go away.</li>
            <li> This is your every day luxurious lathering all natural will NOT dry your skin out soap!</li>
            <li> This is like no other soap I&#x27;ve ever tried</li>
            <li> I recommend keeping it away from private areas for the first use, just for the potential sting in this deep cleansing soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have been using a semi liquid form of African black soap for a few months for my face, amazing.  </li>
            <li> This soap is high quality and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> i tried this soap because i have had issues w breaks outs off and on over the years, after reading reviews i decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;this is not a soap you use anywhere near the eyes or if you have very sensitive or dry</li>
            <li> I barely put any moisturizer on my face and I have not felt any drying effects on it.</li>
            <li> It only made my skin soft</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s only carried at coastalscents.com.</li>
            <li> It is the only soap that fully and completely washes off my matte makeup without leaving any residue.</li>
            <li> WHEN I WAS 18YRS OLD, BEEN SUCH A PROBLEM FOR ME FOR OVER 20YRS.</li>
            <li> and I ended up with more blemished skin behind it.</li>
            <li> The only negative if this is really one, is if you do not put it a proper soap dish it will disentigrate quickly.  </li>
            <li> one may not want to use this on a daily basis especially if they live in an area with a colder climate.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this product, first time purchasing black soap, thinking I was going to receive it as it is pictured in the product description (bar form).</li>
            <li> It has a mild scent, and I&#x27;m not really sure how to describe it.</li>
            <li> I love using this soap feel clean and smell fresh, but have been told that it is no longer allowed because it leaves a dark  residue on the shower like someone possibly  had bad diarrhea and couldn&#x27;t  find  the toilet.</li>
            <li> (I know I shouldn&#x27;t), so it is taking a little longer to clear up, but it really does seem to be working.</li>
            <li> I also got my soap much sooner than expected; I have a feeling I will be re-ordering soon!</li>
            <li> It lathered up well with a thick rich feel.</li>
            <li> I would have to agree with the ones that say Raw Black Soap is better.</li>
            <li> This has to be the first time I have ever washed my face with soap since I was a little girl.</li>
            <li> It will even lather a little brown at first.</li>
            <li> this soap also melts down pretty fast as natural soaps usually do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s solidly made, and has lasted much longer than my other soap shea butter soap.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this to anyone who has sensitive and/or dry skin.</li>
            <li> Thank you for providing Dudu-Osun Black soap at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I will go back to using the green shea butter black soap for my face, because the brown is to strong.</li>
            <li> I have read in some of the reviews that it is great as a shampoo, but I have super dry hair already and I am afraid that this may make it worse.</li>
            <li> bought this Dudu-Osun bar to see if the rest of my skin would like African Black soap as much as much face has.  </li>
            <li> This has helped so much with my acne n dark spots!</li>
            <li> My skin did burn a little bit but not so much.</li>
            <li> , i prefer pure raw organic shea butter.</li>
            <li> I AM GOING TO USE THE SOAP TO CLEAR UP SOME OF MY ACNE SCARS, BUT OTHER THAN THAT</li>
            <li> The soap can be a little drying to the skin if you use a wash cloth with it, so I highly suggest you purchase the Shea butter.</li>
            <li> I still used their treatment to clear it up (which I would also recommend), but now my skin is clear and I just have to use this soap to maintain it, no more benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping my skin would clear up from some black spots on back</li>
            <li> Some recommend starting very slowly for use with children, such as just doing hands at first, and working up to whole body a few times a week.</li>
            <li> long lasting bar...</li>
            <li> It has a rough texture and seems a little counterintuitive to use black soap, but it was gentle enough for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin - especially in the winter - and this soap has made a big difference.  </li>
            <li> When you first start using it, it makes your skin feel a little tight, like there is a film left on your face.</li>
            <li> It did clear up some of where I was breaking out on my back, but just a little.</li>
            <li> use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap will last longer if you allow it to dry between use.  </li>
            <li> My facial skin is now clear and evenly toned with small pores.  </li>
            <li> So hopefully this is a long term answer for my family.</li>
            <li> I only spent five dollars on this, so nothing ventured nothing gained...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it on my body but am awfully curious to try it on my face.</li>
            <li> This product will definitely sting so be careful how you shave.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t leave it on your face for too long.</li>
            <li> It can be a little harsh on the body I only use it on my face  good to use with cold water</li>
            <li> I am using this soap in conjunction with my other facial skin care products (toner, masks, moisturizer) and have not had any issues.  </li>
            <li> Some of the other reviews also mentioned the smell of this soap, but I personally think it smells just like you would think soap should smell like!</li>
            <li> It lasts for a long time so you don&#x27;t have to be buying it every month!</li>
            <li> I am an african american with combination skin a little closer to dry.  </li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t buy it if you already have dry skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li> It does leave my skin dry afterwards but that&#x27;s what scrubs and moisturizers are for.</li>
            <li> Now this will dry your skin, but that was the reason why i bought it..</li>
            <li> and because I had some dry ashy skin.</li>
            <li> I saw this on Dr. Oz as a recommendation to help moisten skin and reduce the dry cracking.  </li>
            <li> I have notice on my chest and back the dark spots lightening and acne disappearing after 2 weeks of using the soap.</li>
            <li> And yes, my face only calmed down after I gave up the soap.</li>
            <li> For me, the soap has begun to fade the dark spots and done a little to clear my acne</li>
            <li> few complaints are the mess it makes in my shower, it leaves black streaks on the edge of the tub, and when you get too much of the soap in the naughty bits, it does burn a little until it&#x27;s completely rinsed out.</li>
            <li> This is my second time using a black soap.</li>
            <li> It actually wasn&#x27;t even black ... or brown, for that matter.</li>
            <li> The only thing with this soap is that after using it, it did make my face itchy and I felt a slight burning feeling.</li>
            <li> which is the Tama Black Soap made with Palm Kernel Oil, Unrefined Shea Butter, Coconut Oil, Water, Cocoa Pod Ash, Neem Oil, Lavender, Eucalyptus and Lemon Grass Essential Oil.</li>
            <li> use African Black to cleanse, followed by Tamanu oil / argan oil for my face</li>
            <li> I used it in the shower for about a week, moisturizing as usual, and then I started noticing my skin drying out and getting patchy, which is not typical for me.</li>
            <li> but the difference was staggering - the soapy, dry filmy feeling led to a few white heads on my arms</li>
            <li> If you are looking to just try the single bar - do so!  </li>
            <li> Last longer and a little bit makes a ton of lather.</li>
            <li> Acne products get soo expensive with all the special formulas but seriously, this soap is going to be the only thing I buy in the future.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to use the soap on children under 12 as it can be a little harsh on young skin</li>
            <li> I switched back to using the Raw Black Soap and two days later my face it just about all cleared up again.</li>
            <li> I have been breaking out pretty bad on my back over the past couples months, which is unusual for me and nothing</li>
            <li> Now, granted - this is a lifelong condition that I have, so I will always have to have treatment...</li>
            <li> But not really working for him.</li>
            <li> I HAVE TRIES ALMOST EVERYTHING ON THE MARKET.</li>
            <li> MY SKIN STARTED CLEARING UP OVER THE  LAST FEW YRS.</li>
            <li> so well you can forget about rubbing it between your hands, just take your wet fingers, run them over the bar a bit, then rub them together</li>
            <li> I do not use it daily because on heavy workout days I feel the need for a deodorant soap.  </li>
            <li> I continue to smell on my skin hours later (not a huge perfume wearer either).</li>
            <li> I have kp and when I use this soap, everything wrong in life becomes right.</li>
            <li> I did not care for the strong unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li> use this soap in conjunction with 100% raw, organic, unrefined, African Shea butter as a moisturizer for my face, neck, and chest.  </li>
            <li> of course the wash cloth looks dirty when used, but always washes clean.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had even a slight breakout with this or dry patches</li>
            <li> so I cannot comment on the soap other than that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen no difference in my skin from using this soap other than the fact it burns my face as soon as I apply it.</li>
            <li> The only thing that reduces the scars is laser surgery, which we cannot usually afford.  </li>
            <li> But I do concur with other reviews that it does take some patience.  </li>
            <li> It also helps relieve skin problems due to eczema and other skin problems.</li>
            <li> I was buying this soap at 4.00 a bar and having to drive to the other side of town because it&#x27;s not sold in my area.</li>
            <li> I will be switching to this soap once my other one runs out.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll try to find other product.</li>
            <li> : well truly i guess i can not really call it a con as there is no way to avoid the fact that the soap is dark brown</li>
            <li> Have tried and been disappointed by more products than I care to list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint is it can cause your washcloths 2 discolor.</li>
            <li> i just use dark brown ones....or hellllooo oxiclean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> AFTER A WEEK I notice a  spot in my face getting dark, I would not recommend this bar soap.</li>
            <li> I came across this item looking for something else, the reviews were enough to make me at least try it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it, not worth it.</li>
            <li> It is called \\&quot;black\\&quot; soap because there are plant ashes in the soap, giving it it&#x27;s dark appearance.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, it does produce a brown sudsy liquid that could be a tad messy in the shower but to me that downside is minimal compared to the benefits my skin gets from using it.</li>
            <li> Hands down.</li>
            <li> and i have to wipe the shower down</li>
            <li> This soap helps with acne break out to prevent and to literally erase dark marks on skin from previous acne mark and scars.  </li>
            <li> You may feel slight stinging when the soap reaches them.</li>
            <li> I read about the black soap online and decided to try.  </li>
            <li> I just received my black soap about a day ago...</li>
            <li> but now scared to buy black soap again</li>
            <li> I hve used a variet of black soaps before</li>
            <li> My previous investment was RX for brown skin...</li>
            <li> It also burned my skin slightly during application.</li>
            <li> However, it makes a black gooey mess in the shower</li>
            <li> however, it makes too much of a mess in the bathroom</li>
            <li> and my face look a mess.</li>
            <li> I received this in a timely fashion but what I received was a little tub That had black soap written on it.  </li>
            <li> My reaction settled down after a few hours</li>
            <li> I did hear it was a little drying</li>
            <li> It may sting a little</li>
            <li> I tried using lotion, which helped a little.</li>
            <li> , just didn&#x27;t like the mess it left behind.</li>
            <li> BUT i can&#x27;t use this soap everyday.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when my son wanted to try it as a dandruff remedy because he is so sensitive to products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Dead Sea soaps, sulfur soaps, etc.</li>
            <li> dried out my skin, doesn&#x27;t help with anything that its supposed to.</li>
            <li> I would never recommend &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; your face with it either....as it may be too harsh for some skin</li>
            <li> Messy and stained everything.  </li>
            <li> It dried out my skin.</li>
            <li> I used to use lever, which dried my skin out, and a body soap to shave my legs, the body soap contained sodium sulfates.</li>
            <li> I got it after having some weird problems with my skin and decided to go all natural.</li>
            <li> (I know what??), not many breakouts but every so often a big monster pimple would appear, take forever to go away and sometimes leave a tell tale dark spot behind, flaky at times.  </li>
            <li> Totally dried my skin Out</li>
            <li> With too much use my face becomes dry and annoying.</li>
            <li> I ran out of my last one &amp; temporarily switched over to Irish Spring ( bad, I know)</li>
            <li> Very soothing to dry itching skin..looks ugly, but it does work..even on your hair!</li>
            <li> I have a friend from Africa (DRC) that knows about this product, but she had used another brand that she was not pleased with.</li>
            <li> I received this product in a plastic container in a thick liquid form that the product leaked out of and was dried and crusted on the container.</li>
            <li> no more feeling like I missed a spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This soap seemed to be working but made my face dry and made my bathtub dirty when i put it down</li>
            <li> My other daughter is using the liquid counterpart and the black soap now and her bad acne is getting less noticeable.</li>
            <li> But be patient and don&#x27;t be afraid of the initial sting - it means it is working.</li>
            <li> On a scale of 1 to 10 (with 10 being darkest), my blemishes were at least an 8.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for almost a year now (July 2012) and this sounds crazy, but I am still on the SAME BAR!</li>
            <li> Seriously it lathers up</li>
            <li> This soap looks like it smells bad, but it&#x27;s smell is addictive!</li>
            <li> This product was not good.</li>
            <li> but it made me break out even worse.</li>
            <li> The scent is too artificial and it is not effective at all.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and figured everyone that had a bad reaction to the soap were maybe just... delicate.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this.  </li>
            <li> but I was jittery and very uncomfortable and vowed not to use it again.</li>
            <li> I did think that the smell of it wasn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> I was burnt badly under my eyes, cheeks, t zone, and on the side of my face.</li>
            <li> I had a bad reaction to this soap.</li>
            <li> I can say for myself that you would not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> With hyperpigmintaion from pregnancy acne (those crazy hormones!).</li>
            <li> I would recommend this soap to anyone, for 5 bucks you can&#x27;t go wrong!!</li>
            <li> You wont be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t say one thing bad about it!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This has helped so much with my acne n dark spots! I will never stop using this!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this soap because it stated 100% pure.  It is not.  I opened it and could smell the *strong* perfume scent.  I looked at the ingredients and indeed it states &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; in the list.  It does not have a nice natural perfume scent - it is strong &amp; overpowering.  I didn&#x27;t chance using it because of skin sensitivities so I cannot comment on the soap other than that.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter.  Lot&#x27;s of talk about it on TV at the time and she really wanted to try it.  I don&#x27;t think she cared for it.&lt;br /&gt;She never asked me for it again so that tells me she&#x27;s over it.  I did hear it was a little drying so I wouldn&#x27;t buy it if you already have dry skin.</li>
            <li> This soap leaves my skin squeaky clean, soft, and moisturized. Someone mentioned it left residue all over their shower but that wasn&#x27;t the case for me. My only complaint is it can cause your washcloths 2 discolor. My skin&#x27;s so soft that i don&#x27;t mind a bit...i just use dark brown ones....or hellllooo oxiclean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here&#x27;s an update(3/23/10)....i REALLY like the smell and how soft my skin is. BUT i can&#x27;t use this soap everyday. I can only use it 3 times a week, max. My skin is VERY SOFT...but VERY ASHY. Annnnddddd my skin begins to itch if I use it every day. I DO NOT have sensitive skin, so this was a surprise to me...i&#x27;ve never had this happen. Just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t user&#x27;s error, i tried again to use it for a week straight three times and the same results happen. THE ONLY way i can use it eeryday is if i mix it with some kind of oil (castor, shea butter, or jojoba)....what&#x27;s the point in that? It works VERY well for my bf, but he gets very ashy as well; but my hair &amp; face LLOOOOOOOVVVVEE IT STILL. So now that&#x27;s what i use it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONE LAST UPDATE- 5/18/2015:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I no longer use this soap, as I now oil-cleanse my face, and use another shampoo to wash my hair. The last time I used it, one year ago, my face even broke out. So I decided that it was time to switch up.</li>
            <li> This soap is great. It lathers great it rinses great and my skin just loves it! I was skeptical when my son wanted to try it as a dandruff remedy because he is so sensitive to products. His hair turned out great. Shiney, no dandruff either. He uses it twice a week now. Im not that brave to try  it as shampoo but it works great on my skin!     Best discovery in awhile for me awhile! I gave some as gifts and also got back good feedback from others. Will order more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen no difference in my skin from using this soap other than the fact it burns my face as soon as I apply it. This isn&#x27;t the soap for my face or body and it makes one skin more dry, too harsh.</li>
            <li> I suffer from a rare skin disease called Granuloma Faciale.  It results in red blemishes which I have to have medicine injected into bi-monthly.  The only thing that reduces the scars is laser surgery, which we cannot usually afford.  I&#x27;ve tried Dead Sea soaps, sulfur soaps, etc. and this soap is the only thing that has reduced the scarification without pricey laser surgery.  My personal experience with this soap, after buying and using one full bar, is that it really works.  Now, granted - this is a lifelong condition that I have, so I will always have to have treatment...but the red spots on my face HAVE subsided since I have been using this soap.  But I do concur with other reviews that it does take some patience.  I didn&#x27;t see full results until the bar was dwindling down a bit - but the diminishing is noticeable indeed.  My second thing that I will say is that it will burn the sensitive skin user for the first week or so, and then your face gets used to it or it is working as an astringent - but bare with it.  That burn means it is working!!  My skin is way better now, and doesn&#x27;t sting anymore when I use the soap - and I love the results on red spots and scars.  I wanted to see results before I came on here and praised a soap.  I love the idea of using mystical elements from the Dead Sea...but honestly, I didn&#x27;t see any change in my skin.  With the Dudu soap (yes, I call it doo-doo soap ha ha)I definitely see results.  I will be purchasing the bigger packs from now on.  If you are looking to just try the single bar - do so!  But be patient and don&#x27;t be afraid of the initial sting - it means it is working.</li>
            <li> I got this soap after reading lot of positive reviews,this soap seems to be a good cleanser, takes all the dirt and makeup out completely,also lathers well.The only problem I found was this seems to leave my skin more dry as I already have dry skin.</li>
            <li> Love this soap. Very strong though. Deep cleans your skin and gets deep into your pores almost like hydrogen peroxide. Strips off old make up and suntan lotions etc leaving skin really squeaky clean.. I do not recommend it for winter face cleaning as it strips off all oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not totally kill dermodex skin mites but helps diminish their population. You may feel slight stinging when the soap reaches them.</li>
            <li> this soap does well for my skin i have oily combination skin and it does not dry my skin out love it a bit messy with the color but not hard to clean up</li>
            <li> I purchased this soap after a recomendation from a friend with skin problems. I always get rashes in the spring and the fall, doctors dont know what causes them and just give me some sort of cream. Since I have been using it I have not gotten my seasonal rash. I am very fair skinned and this soap leaves my skin soft and clean. My husband uses it for his hair and his flaky scalp has improved 100%. I will not be without this soap ever again. I love the smell (I have read some reviews that dont care for the smell) It smells \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; and clean. I never have a problem with staining. I even use white wash clothes, I actually think the soap helps...........of course the wash cloth looks dirty when used, but always washes clean. If you have any kind of skin problem I highly recomend this soap, I have not had to use any type of rash ointment since I began using this soap. I would give it even more stars if available!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this soap for my friend who has rosacea and who tends to break out. She&#x27;s been using this daily, and let me tell you her skin is glowing and has never looked better. She loves this soap and says it&#x27;s the best thing she&#x27;s ever used. I totally agree.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my rosecea and my daughter&#x27;s acne. She used it and low and behold her skin cleared up greatly with a few breakouts once in a while along the chin or hairline. Wonder if she is not getting the soap in those spots....I started using it and am fairly happy, my skin has not had a major rocesea break out in a while, but it is worse in the winter, so I shall see then. My other daughter is using the liquid counterpart and the black soap now and her bad acne is getting less noticeable. So hopefully this is a long term answer for my family. I plan on buying more.</li>
            <li> The soap came in two days as stated it would be and did everything good the other reviews said it would. I have been breaking out pretty bad on my back over the past couples months, which is unusual for me and nothing seemed to help. I tried all sorts of washes and Murad&#x27;s spray worked for awhile. Immediately after one day of using this soap I could tell there was a difference. Most of my acne dried up and some of the scars looked lighter.  I have also been using on my face. The first day I thought this soap was amazing, but it did end up purging my skin and I ended up picking at some of the whiteheads (I know I shouldn&#x27;t), so it is taking a little longer to clear up, but it really does seem to be working. I am using this soap in conjunction with my other facial skin care products (toner, masks, moisturizer) and have not had any issues.  I read some of the reviews that said this soap is very drying and make your skin look ashy, but I have very oily skin and have not experienced this. I barely put any moisturizer on my face and I have not felt any drying effects on it. I do put lotion on my legs and hands, but it is more out of habit than anything. Some of the other reviews also mentioned the smell of this soap, but I personally think it smells just like you would think soap should smell like! Definitely not bad like sulfur soaps! I will update in a couple weeks after I hopefully see more results.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, and planned to use this on my back, legs, and chest, areas of mine that can accumulate sweat when I work out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While actually lathering it on my skin it felt nice, but afterwards it made the area very tight and almost squeaky it was so drying. For my skin-type this is an accomplishment. I only spent five dollars on this, so nothing ventured nothing gained... but I still wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying it. I haven&#x27;t used it in weeks.</li>
            <li> This is my second time using a black soap. The first one was from a whole foods store, and it did nothing. It actually wasn&#x27;t even black ... or brown, for that matter. That&#x27;s a different story for another day.....  I washed my face with this soap one night. The next morning, I noticed something. I couldn&#x27;t put a finger on what it was, exactly ... but I noticed something different and I liked it. This difference was a glow; my skin was glowing and much brighter (not lighter, just brighter).  I&#x27;ve experienced a lot of issues with dark spots/blemishes, and acne. I began using this soap on 12/30/11 and I can honestly say that my breakouts have come to a minimum and my dark spots have lightened up a lot. On a scale of 1 to 10 (with 10 being darkest), my blemishes were at least an 8. Now, I&#x27;ll give them a 3 or 4.  The only thing with this soap is that after using it, it did make my face itchy and I felt a slight burning feeling. I use this soap on my body as well, but I&#x27;ve only felt this on my face. I attributed it to the fact that there is lime juice in this soap, and we all know that lemon and lime are highly acidic. The sensation goes away after about 5 minutes. It is not intolerable or unbearable by any means. Trust me, if it was ... I would give this product 5 stars.  I highly recommend this soap. :)</li>
            <li> This soap surpised me.dont know if it comes from the motherland but if it do they have some good stuff out there.it&#x27;s the first thing I smell when I walk into my bedroom.Love it</li>
            <li> Got this soap after reading about other people&#x27;s success with helping their acne/problem skin. While it&#x27;s too soon to tell if this is going to be a holy grail product, the scent is intoxicating and so far I have had very good results with cleansing my face with this soap. I did not experience any burning or drying when using this soap as others have reported; it has actually been more gentle than a lot of the acne cleansers I have used in the past. But then again, I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin. I also got my soap much sooner than expected; I have a feeling I will be re-ordering soon!</li>
            <li> This item was featured on a segment of Dr. Oz.  I found it intreging that the product was from the country that my current boss was from.  It smells so good and feels even better.</li>
            <li> I saw this soap on the Dr OZ show and sence I am super sensitive to soaps I thought I&#x27;d give it a try and see if I could use it. It&#x27;s a bit more expensive when you include shipping ( if you are not purchasing anthing else) but it is well worth it! I will deffenatly be buying more.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m allergic to shea butter but I don&#x27;t even care. I have kp and when I use this soap, everything wrong in life becomes right. If I have a pimples that&#x27;s going away, I leave a dollop of this soap on it overnight and the next day there are no signs of a pimple ever being there. It&#x27;s a conspiracy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff helps with razor bumps on your vajayjay aswell. After using this for sometime your gina skins will be even toned, bump free, and luxurious baby. It&#x27;s great for my body but I have to use it sparingly on my face. With too much use my face becomes dry and annoying. I also get these little tiny bumps ... stemming from my shea butter allergy that I ignore lol .</li>
            <li> I really love this soap &amp; just regret that it took me years to finally try it after first hearing about it. I&#x27;ve only used it on my body but am awfully curious to try it on my face. It makes me feel incredibly clean without drying my skin &amp; continued use has brought about this healthy overall glow &amp; gradual fading of dark spots. This is like no other soap I&#x27;ve ever tried &amp; I can actually feel it working on my skin upon application. I&#x27;ve repurchased now twice &amp; just recently went for the 6-pack because I can&#x27;t be without it. I ran out of my last one &amp; temporarily switched over to Irish Spring ( bad, I know) but the difference was staggering - the soapy, dry filmy feeling led to a few white heads on my arms - ugh. Glad to have my black soap back in my life &amp; by the way, I don&#x27;t think Nubian Heritage compares to this brand, I didn&#x27;t get the same results using it. I can use this soap without exfoliating if I want to.</li>
            <li> AFTER A WEEK I notice a  spot in my face getting dark, I would not recommend this bar soap.</li>
            <li> Great product for very dry skin; smells wonderful; doesn&#x27;t leave oily residue on skin or in bath area.  Buy more than one you will be very happy with product.  I use it on my face and so does my teenage daughter skin is responding very nicely...have a glow looks good even during the winter..I will definitely buy more of this product</li>
            <li> I have use Dudu-Osun for years! I always get compliments about my skin being clear, radiant and smooth! This soap helps with acne break out to prevent and to literally erase dark marks on skin from previous acne mark and scars.  One thing though is that is will dissolve fast if left in water, to lengthen the life of this NATURAL soap, make sure to put it somewhere where water will not stand near it.  I always put it on a soap rack.  I recommend the soap for everyone, I have sensitive skin and have not had any problems with it so far.  It also helps relieve skin problems due to eczema and other skin problems.</li>
            <li> This product worked great on my skin. It doesn&#x27;t dry it out. Perfect make remover! Need a big chunk to use all over.</li>
            <li> I tried this soap for the first time about 2 months ago.  I just figured I would give it a try.  I have been looking for a more natural alternative cleansing than just the store soaps like \\&quot;dove\\&quot;.  My baby is allergic to everything.  I read about the black soap online and decided to try.  Well thank goodness for this brand.  My baby skin doesn&#x27;t get irritated.  I am an african american with combination skin a little closer to dry.  I love this soap.  It cleans but never feels too drying and the smell... oh my goodness so fresh.  Even my finicky husband love it.  We both notice a nice glow to our skin and even a brightening.  I haven&#x27;t had even a slight breakout with this or dry patches it seems to balance everything out.  Definitely order the 12 pack best bargain. I know it is also used on the hair.  I haven&#x27;t tried that since I only co-wash not poo or soap.  The only negative if this is really one, is if you do not put it a proper soap dish it will disentigrate quickly.  I hope they never stop making this.  I bought some for my mom, brother, and friends.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this soap the other day I can tell you that this soap is good on the skin it takes off the build up oils in the skin from lotions and body oils I use it on my hair too and I like it. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to use the soap on children under 12 as it can be a little harsh on young skin this soap also melts down pretty fast as natural soaps usually do. Beware that the shipping and handling cost is exceptional high as it cost more than the soap itself. Would I purchase this soap again yes but not from Amazon You can get this soap from local farmers market type places as I have seen this soap before there.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive and this BURNED my face. It did clear my face within a week, but I had to stop using it because it was burning me way too much. I will try it again another time and see if it still burns.</li>
            <li> I just received my black soap about a day ago...first off I want to give a rreview of the shipping. If anyones worried if their efficient when it comes to shipping I would say that they are, I am an amazon prime member and the shipping was free for all my goods, paid by amazon. I received it within the estimated time (1-2) days, priority and it was shipped to my door. If you don&#x27;t live in a good neighborhood where you have to wonder if it&#x27;ll be there when you get home I would see about calling amazon about requiring a signature. Thankfully I live in a generally good neighborhood so when I got home it was there. When I opened it, I was pleased to see that it was packaged with care. So much bubble for a bar of soap but I liked it because it says a lot about the company amazon and how they treat the products they handle and customers. I would recommend always purchasing something through amazon where the money transaction and products are being shipped from their warehouse. You wont be disappointed! Now the soap, I tried it the minute I got home. It lathered up well with a thick rich feel. I have to mention the soap is not black but in fact brown. No biggy, its to be expected when incorporating natural ingredients. When I went to rinse, my fingers squeaked across my face like a fogged mirror and a a finger streaking across it. I love the clean feeling and sound. Makes the four dollars and some change for a bar of soap worth it. The smell is absolutley amazing to me. It has a unique clean smell but very....sweet aswell in a way. The next morning I noticed my one acne scar I had on my cheek was VERY faded and my face looked in felt soft. Completely different from the night before after I used the soap it felt like an egg white mask. I couldn&#x27;t really move my face freely but that subsided after an or or so. All in all best black soap ive used and invested in so far.  I cant wait for further results. I&#x27;m looking forward to what some of you called \\&quot;radiant\\&quot; its only been acouple days so we&#x27;ll see! To anyone reading this and contemplating investing your bucks? Take a whim or give your self a treat. Hey! Its better then spending 20 bucks on a proactiv regimine. GO NATURAL! better results as guaranteed. Any skin type, Color, etc...GIVE IT A TRY!</li>
            <li> this product is amazing. it&#x27;s super strong though so beware but it will definitely get your skin clean and under control</li>
            <li> I bought this soap because of the rave reviews. I had been using it for a week or so.     Best thing is the smell, yes it does smell great!    however, it makes too much of a mess in the bathroom and i started noticing that it would make my skin breakout where it had never done before.     this one is not for me.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to purchase soap to clean my face since I have always been told that soap is a no no for your skin. This has to be the first time I have ever washed my face with soap since I was a little girl. Dudu-Osun leaves no film, has a pleasant scent, makes your skin feel smooth, clean, and best of all \\&quot;clear\\&quot;. I have bought almost every cleanser under the sun for combination/ acne skin.  I have spent loads of money on products I ended up throwing away because it either stopped or never helped my skin in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this soap in conjunction with 100% raw, organic, unrefined, African Shea butter as a moisturizer for my face, neck, and chest.  The soap can be a little drying to the skin if you use a wash cloth with it, so I highly suggest you purchase the Shea butter. After all these years of throwing money out the window on fancy products, the only thing my skin has adapted well to has come from nature (and it&#x27;s inexpensive too). Enjoy your new skin!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product on a Saturday and it came by Thursday. I love this soap. Keeps my skin clear and smells great. I was buying this soap at 4.00 a bar and having to drive to the other side of town because it&#x27;s not sold in my area. I&#x27;m saving money and time buy buying on line.</li>
            <li> Dudu-Osun soap suds up so well, is long-lasting, and feels so clean.  My daughter said she doesn&#x27;t have to shave her legs as often when using the soap, too.</li>
            <li> I came across this item looking for something else, the reviews were enough to make me at least try it. It has a rough texture and seems a little counterintuitive to use black soap, but it was gentle enough for my sensitive skin. I did not care for the strong unpleasant odor. Might try again.</li>
            <li> It only made my skin soft but that&#x27;s all. It was okay. It was okay. It was okay. It was okay. It was okay. It was okay. Yup.</li>
            <li> dried out my skin, doesn&#x27;t help with anything that its supposed to. Don&#x27;t buy it, not worth it. This is the only brand I have ever tried so maybe its just this one. but now scared to buy black soap again</li>
            <li> I used this product with my Japanese Bath towel to exfoliate my skin. I have only been using the product for about 2-3 weeks but it has really cleared my face.</li>
            <li> Its a great exfoliator for your body.  Not only that it helped me greatly with cystic acne and dark spots on my face.  My facial skin is now clear and evenly toned with small pores.  It makes you feel clean all over!  I will NEVER be without this soap!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should add however, one may not want to use this on a daily basis especially if they live in an area with a colder climate.  During the winter months I don&#x27;t use it as often because it could be a bit drying.  I would never recommend &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; your face with it either....as it may be too harsh for some skin types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, it does produce a brown sudsy liquid that could be a tad messy in the shower but to me that downside is minimal compared to the benefits my skin gets from using it.</li>
            <li> This soap arrived quickly, on time, and was well packaged. It&#x27;s solidly made, and has lasted much longer than my other soap shea butter soap. I will be switching to this soap once my other one runs out. I love the smell too! Thanks for a really great product :-)</li>
            <li> My favorite soap. Hands down. It does leave my skin dry afterwards but that&#x27;s what scrubs and moisturizers are for. My skin feels soft and supple after using this. I love how it smells and feels. Can&#x27;t wait to use it again.</li>
            <li> Wow is this not your every day soap! This is your every day luxurious lathering all natural will NOT dry your skin out soap! Made from all natural ingredients with nothing in it to dry your skin out or leave chemical residue but to leave your skin like nature intended, clean, super baby soft smooth that my husband just loves to touch and everyone tells me I look glowy in the face! I will never buy chemical soap again. I also wish Amazon would carry my other FAVORITE brand that&#x27;s almost identical which is the Tama Black Soap made with Palm Kernel Oil, Unrefined Shea Butter, Coconut Oil, Water, Cocoa Pod Ash, Neem Oil, Lavender, Eucalyptus and Lemon Grass Essential Oil. So far it&#x27;s only carried at coastalscents.com. Rich, creamy, luxurious! LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li> This best soap hands down</li>
            <li> I like this stuff a lot. I use it on my face a couple times a week and on my body almost every day. it keeps your skin exfoliated and blemish free.</li>
            <li> My husband noticed how good the bathroom smells after I took a shower and wanted to know what I was using.  he was so impressed that I had to order more.so glad I did.</li>
            <li> Nice aroma...foams/lathers great...long lasting bar...I use it as a shaving soap and to wash with...leaves skin fresh and baby soft.</li>
            <li> Messy and stained everything.  Now I know hat it is natural and unrefined but we live in a modern age.  Can they manufacture this soap to be more user friendly while rendering results?</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this soap has a very rich lather. It does a good job of cleaning the skin. It may sting a little but I see that as validation that it&#x27;s doing what its supposed to do. I also like the fact that the ingredients are simple and straight to the point and you can Google all of them and see what&#x27;s going on your skin. White clothing can be stained from this product so avoid using white wash rags or trying to wash clothes with it. This product will definitely sting so be careful how you shave. If you shave incorrectly on the circular portion of your man parts(assuming the person reading this review) and you leave a cut, don&#x27;t use this soap or else you will still be in pain after you shower. Take it from someone with experience. Overall, If you suffer from skin ailments then this is something you can definitely look into.</li>
            <li> I thought this would&#x27;ve been a great and promising product based off of the reviews, but I was wrong. I quickly got a burning and itching sensation on my face, especially my jawline and chin area which I ignored at first and didn&#x27;t touch. But that wasn&#x27;t enough, within a little while of using it I ended up with huge breakouts along my jawline and chin that took quite a while to finally calm down and go away. And yes, my face only calmed down after I gave up the soap. The soap doesn&#x27;t live up to the claims.</li>
            <li> Got this for the gf per her request, she says it works great and she likes it a lot, according to her it can be drying so she adds jojoba oil along with using it.</li>
            <li> I got this one for my husband having acne. But not really working for him. Maybe I&#x27;ll try to find other product.</li>
            <li> Having psoriasis I thought this product would be more hydrating, but it was not what I expected. It dried out my skin. so I would not recommend</li>
            <li> I hve used a variet of black soaps before so i know the real from the manufactured and processed. The scent is too artificial and it is not effective at all. I would not buy it again!</li>
            <li> It can be a little harsh on the body I only use it on my face  good to use with cold water it work well</li>
            <li> Good oil free soap,perfect for oily skin,may not be suitable for dry skin.I recommend strongly if u want to clear your oily skin.</li>
            <li> I love it!!!! Best soap I&#x27;ve bought. My face feels soft and clean. I recommend it</li>
            <li> I love using the Dusu-Osun 100% Pure African Black Soap. It is the only soap that fully and completely washes off my matte makeup without leaving any residue.It is also great for washing your body (esp. if you get body acne). I should note that it would be wise to mix the soap with an oil such as jojoba or rosehip seed oil, as it can be drying to your face if you have dry or combination skin like I do.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT... This is my miracle in a bar.. I have extremely oily skin which makes it more subjected to breakouts.. I&#x27;ve been using this product religiously for 3-4 weeks, and I honestly say I have noticed a difference... I was always teased in school because of the oily on my face and breakouts... This was definitley my cure.... When I first receieved it I used it day and night.. Now I use it once a day... Now this will dry your skin, but that was the reason why i bought it.. After using this prduct it does leave my face smoother than a baby&#x27;s bottom.. I would swear by this product. My previous investment was RX for brown skin... I had about 6 different products with the Rx for brown skin and cost me approx $40.00... This one soap did more for me in one week than rx for brown skin did for me in a 6 months.... Honest truth.. And it only cost me $5.00!!!</li>
            <li> Great soap and fresh smell!</li>
            <li> I love using this soap feel clean and smell fresh, but have been told that it is no longer allowed because it leaves a dark  residue on the shower like someone possibly  had bad diarrhea and couldn&#x27;t  find  the toilet.</li>
            <li> This soap seemed to be working but made my face dry and made my bathtub dirty when i put it down</li>
            <li> You have to be patient with this product, it does calm down my acne so I&#x27;m thankful for that. It doesn&#x27;t really do much for my hyperpigmented acne marks I have on my skin and I can&#x27;t wash my face with this too many times because it&#x27;ll make my face ashy.&lt;br /&gt; However, I love the smell and it leaves my face smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> So I bought this in my efforts to use more natural products on my skin. I used to use lever, which dried my skin out, and a body soap to shave my legs, the body soap contained sodium sulfates. Both products made my fair skin ashy and itchy. When I first used this product, I found it to be a little harsh, mostly on my girly bits. After a few uses, I barely notice anything but smooth skin. I personally use this soap to clean every inch of my body. It smells pleasant and makes my skin feel amazing, and lathers nicely to shave ones legs with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My few complaints are the mess it makes in my shower, it leaves black streaks on the edge of the tub, and when you get too much of the soap in the naughty bits, it does burn a little until it&#x27;s completely rinsed out.</li>
            <li> This is a great african black soap for dry and ichy skin problems.  Would recommend purchasing this item.  A+ transaction!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best soap out there, but be careful because if you use it to much it can dry your skin out.</li>
            <li> Fabulous scent that is full of floral accents. It lathers quicker and better than any soap I have used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my skin 100% clean. Use a quality lotion afterwards and you are good to go!</li>
            <li> I got this soap in hopes that it would clear up my skin. It did and yet it didn&#x27;t. My face was clear. When I used it on my face, my skin felt squeaky clean and firm. But On my body, not so much. It did clear up some of where I was breaking out on my back, but just a little. I also had an allergic reaction to my new cat and broke out into a rash, the soap took care of that in a few days which was nice. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m rating this soap a 4. When you get this, watch out because it will leave brown soap residue on whatever it rests on. It will even lather a little brown at first. It has a mild scent, and I&#x27;m not really sure how to describe it. If you don&#x27;t like soap with strong smells, this one should be okay for you.</li>
            <li> This soap is the BEST! It tightens your skin a bit BUT it does your skin justice after a couple weeks of use. You will feel fresh and clean and you will glow.  Just use it in the shower all over your face and I promise you the blemishes will start to fade after a couple of days.  Im still in the process of witnessing the great results after a month and I must say I am quite pleased and I have been dealing with acne and zits since I was 12 and never found any medication or soaps that worked UNTIL NOW!</li>
            <li> I want to start by saying that I do not have sensitive skin. I have cheerily showered with everything from Lava to Zum Bar. A friend gave me a nondescript bar of bamboo ash black soap as a gift; I fell in love with it, and hoped The Dudu would be a suitable replacement. I read the reviews and figured everyone that had a bad reaction to the soap were maybe just... delicate. My ancestors were Irish and German, so I have skin like a potato. I digress. I ordered The Dudu, and received it from this seller as promised in a timely manner (thank you seller). It smells really good in a powdery/floral/sweet way, so it has that going for it. I used it in the shower for about a week, moisturizing as usual, and then I started noticing my skin drying out and getting patchy, which is not typical for me. A few more days and my lips and other sensitive areas would sting if left sudzed up for more than a few seconds. The Dudu was thenceforth discontinued. tl/dr: The Dudu does not abide.</li>
            <li> Great soap, great scent. People, this soap is for everyone, not just black people (do you know how incredibly ignorant that sounds?! I wish people would research stuff before they perpetuate this kind of nonsense.) It is called \\&quot;black\\&quot; soap because there are plant ashes in the soap, giving it it&#x27;s dark appearance. It is made from leaves and bark of various trees and plants that are burned in a kettle or vat. The leaves are from banana trees, plantain skins, leaves and bark, palm tree leaves, cocoa pods, shea tree bark, etc. The ashes from the leaves are then mixed with water and then filtered. Oils such as shea butter, coconut oil, palm oil, palm kernel oil, and cocoa butter are added to this water to create the soap.</li>
            <li> I bought this bar of soap to see if it would help with my sons severe eczema. It has soothed his irritated skin so much. I also noticed that it leaves his skin squeaky clean without stripping it of moisture. I&#x27;ve only had to lather him once for him to get clean. I&#x27;ve used it on his skin 3 times already and there is a vast improvement. After bathing him I make sure to slather him down from head to toe with a shea butter and aloe vera gel mixture. I will definitely get this again!!!</li>
            <li> Dudu-Osun 100% Pure African Black Soap -  smells nice and it lathers well, but doesn&#x27;t do anything more for skin than any other soap.</li>
            <li> Great for face washing</li>
            <li> It is totally now what&#x27;s shown in the pic, so I returned it. Never used it so cannot comment on the product</li>
            <li> Gentle, non drying. It lasts and lasts too if you don&#x27;t let it sit in water. I got it after having some weird problems with my skin and decided to go all natural.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping my skin would clear up from some black spots on back and because I had some dry ashy skin. After a week of using this continuously, I started developing red pimple like spots on my back. My skin was ashier than ever. I do not recommend this to anyone who has sensitive and/or dry skin. I will stick to my normal soap.</li>
            <li> I received this in a timely fashion but what I received was a little tub That had black soap written on it.  It was the same kind of tub that Shea butter would come in.  So I don&#x27;t know if it was natural or authentic had to go one of the health stores and get the bar of soap I ordered which I love and definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> What can I say this soap is awesome!! I deal with oily acne prone skin and this soap has helped so much I couldn&#x27;t say one thing bad about it!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product sometime ago and was a bit hurt when I ran out. The product truly is worth buying. I have a friend from Africa (DRC) that knows about this product, but she had used another brand that she was not pleased with. When I gave her one of the bars to use she told me that her sister made comments that her face was clearer. I can say for myself that you would not be disappointed. The fragrance actually stays on your skin and you will feel fresh and clean after use. Quick note of another product I wish that was offered on Amazon is Kirlangic olive soap--there is nothing like this soap. It is a product of Turkey and it has the same effect as this one. The ingredients are as pure as you can get. I hope in the future I will see Kirlangic sold on Amazon as well.</li>
            <li> Not, the product discribed and it burned my skin.  For the most part I would rather stink and keep my skin.</li>
            <li> This soap is ideal for sever to moderate acne conditions. Can be used anytime and as mcuh as you want. But be gentle when apply it to your skin, it really exfoilates. It&#x27;s a deep cleanser also. Great body deodorizer soap bar as well.  This is excellent for teenagers too. Last longer and a little bit makes a ton of lather. But requires a good quality moisturizer afterwards. Because it&#x27;s deep cleaning and exfoilates your skin...it can be a bit drying. But it will definetly heal your skin issues.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! It works miracles on my skin! I use it everyday and now my skin is silky smooth with hardly no acne!</li>
            <li> This soap is high quality and lasts a long time. It takes off all my make-up in one go and leaves my face squeaky-clean but not over-dried. I love it!</li>
            <li> I really like this soap. I&#x27;m a lifelong zest user to feel clean with no soap residue feeling. This soap feels cleaner than that! And smells fresh and clean with a long lasting freshness I continue to smell on my skin hours later (not a huge perfume wearer either). Very nice, and I will be reordering more this week.</li>
            <li> Very soothing to dry itching skin..looks ugly, but it does work..even on your hair! A good investment and moderately priced</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing!!! I purchased this product after it was recommended by a co-worker. The smell is somewhat odd, but not bad and is easy to become accustomed to quickly. The lather is amazing and a little goes a long way. I have read in some of the reviews that it is great as a shampoo, but I have super dry hair already and I am afraid that this may make it worse. For the first couple of weeks of using this product, my skin was really dry. It appears as if my skin has acclimated to this product well. I must say that I am joining the bandwagon to say that I will likely be a life-long user of this product. I love the way it makes my skin feel. Great product!!!</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying using this soap. I have gotten alot of compliments on how nice my skin looks lately. When you first start using it, it makes your skin feel a little tight, like there is a film left on your face. I just make sure I use a toner (50/50 mix of Rose water and witch hazel) to remove any film left behind. This soap removes my make-up pretty easily and has a nice smell. Also, you can&#x27;t beat the price!!! I have always used expensive cleansers and beauty products and could honestly say I rather use my black soap and rose water any day.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this.  I had recalled this soap being sold in the streets for the longest times but I never gave it any thought.  I needed soaps so I tried this.  It does indeed clear out darker areas on the body!  I have no spots (also known as freckles) on my skin, but some ares get darkened and this lightened them back up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like other have written, this soap gives your skins a smooth, but dry type feeling - more smooth than dry.  This soap looks like it smells bad, but it&#x27;s smell is addictive!</li>
            <li> Thank you for providing Dudu-Osun Black soap at a reasonable price.  We love this soap for its natural ingredients and the way that it makes our skin feel.  We definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I tried using this soap and broke out all along the perimeter of my face.  I ended up throwing it away.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely wonderful. I wash my face with it once a day and I also use a store brand cleanser mixed with the soap and my skin is flawless.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews before I bought this. Many reviews said this was the best product while others said that Raw Black Soap was better. I would have to agree with the ones that say Raw Black Soap is better. I did think that the smell of it wasn&#x27;t bad but it made me break out even worse. I switched back to using the Raw Black Soap and two days later my face it just about all cleared up again. Everyone&#x27;s skin if different so it may work for you but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> DEVELOPED ADULT ACNE WHEN I WAS 18YRS OLD, BEEN SUCH A PROBLEM FOR ME FOR OVER 20YRS. I HAVE TRIES ALMOST EVERYTHING ON THE MARKET. WITHOUT EVEN NOTICING IT MY SKIN STARTED CLEARING UP OVER THE  LAST FEW YRS. I THINK NOW THAT I HAVE CLEARER SKIN, I TAKES CARE OF IT NOW BUT IN ORDER FOR ME TO DO THAT SINCE I WENT NATURAL WITH MY HAIR I DECIDED TO TRY NATURAL PRODUCTS ON MY FACE. SO I ORDER DUDU-OSUN SOAP IT ARRIVED YESTERDAY AND SO FAR SO GOOD. I AM GOING TO USE THE SOAP TO CLEAR UP SOME OF MY ACNE SCARS, BUT OTHER THAN THAT ITS LATHERS GOOD,SMELL OKAY.</li>
            <li> So, yeah, it is black soap.... or rather dark brown, and it is named something you might pronounce \\&quot;doo-doo\\&quot;, but man is this a nice product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this INSTEAD of an anti-bacterial soap full of chemicals.  I am very pleased with this product because it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin like the chemical anti-bacterial soaps, and seems to work as well as most anti-bacterial soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very pleasing.  Smells tropical, and leaves a nice clean smell to your skin after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap will last longer if you allow it to dry between use.  If it stays wet all the time it disolves very quickly.</li>
            <li> This soap smells extremely good. It works as a good, moisturizing facial cleanser.  It was a surprisingly high-quality soap &amp; arrived in the mail very quickly. We&#x27;ll order it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this after hearing African Black soap worked for acne-prone skin, and I was not disappointed!! Acne products get soo expensive with all the special formulas but seriously, this soap is going to be the only thing I buy in the future. I did use acne.org&#x27;s line as well, and began substituting this soap for their cleanser. I still used their treatment to clear it up (which I would also recommend), but now my skin is clear and I just have to use this soap to maintain it, no more benzoyl peroxide. Lathers amazing, not too drying but also gets all the oil off my skin. Highly recommended, for this price you can&#x27;t go wrong!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update- I&#x27;ve been using this soap for almost a year now (July 2012) and this sounds crazy, but I am still on the SAME BAR! Seriously it lathers up so well you can forget about rubbing it between your hands, just take your wet fingers, run them over the bar a bit, then rub them together and you have enough to wash your face. Five bucks for a year&#x27;s worth of cleanser! I don&#x27;t even wear foundation most days anymore, my skin is clear and even. I would recommend this soap to anyone, for 5 bucks you can&#x27;t go wrong!!</li>
            <li> I will never use this soap on my face. I was burnt badly under my eyes, cheeks, t zone, and on the side of my face. I have soft spots everywhere and my face look a mess. It didn&#x27;t burn me till the third week of use, but it works great on my body. I will go back to using the green shea butter black soap for my face, because the brown is to strong.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product, first time purchasing black soap, thinking I was going to receive it as it is pictured in the product description (bar form). I received this product in a plastic container in a thick liquid form that the product leaked out of and was dried and crusted on the container. It may have the same effects as the bar soap form but I would have like to known that this was liquid before purchasing. Still scared to try it because of how it was packaged, not even sealed. So FYI THEY WILL NOT SEND YOU THE BAR SOAP AS PICTURED, IT IS LIQUID!</li>
            <li> i tried this soap because i have had issues w breaks outs off and on over the years, after reading reviews i decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;this is not a soap you use anywhere near the eyes or if you have very sensitive or dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;i myself would not venture to use it anywhere else but my face but i think some viewers have and were pleased.&lt;br /&gt;very good idea to use a good moisturizer after this, i prefer pure raw organic shea butter. i use this soap morning and night and have had no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. fresh clean scent makes the entire bathroom smell nice&lt;br /&gt;2. gets your skin squeeky clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: well truly i guess i can not really call it a con as there is no way to avoid the fact that the soap is dark brown and i have to wipe the shower down so there are no brown streaks when the soap drips from the shower shelf.&lt;br /&gt;it wipes up easy and does not stain but the dark brown streaks can be a bit unsightly.&lt;br /&gt;over all the soap is well worth the extra wiping of the shower as it is a great product.</li>
            <li> Great soap, suds up well. I feel really clean after using it. Does not leave any residue or oily feeling. Wish I had found it sooner.  Lasts a long time. I keep it away from the shower spray... in a soap dish so it does not sit in water.</li>
            <li> My sister told me about this soap.  She RAVED about how great it was and how it was like magic for her face.  The price was reasonable so I decided to try it hoping for the same results.  She claimed it quickly cleared her acne and cleared up the dark spots. For me, the soap has begun to fade the dark spots and done a little to clear my acne but it&#x27;s taking time.  The soap doesn&#x27;t seem to work as fast or miraculous for me as it did for my sister but maybe I just have different skin.  Either way it is a good product and at a good price, it&#x27;s well worth a try!</li>
            <li> I love this soap!! It smells really good. Just don&#x27;t leave it on your face for too long. I had to stop usage for a bit because it made my face burn but now I apply it and rinse it right off. Good for toning and clearing up your skin.</li>
            <li> I saw this on Dr. Oz as a recommendation to help moisten skin and reduce the dry cracking.  I have very dry skin - especially in the winter - and this soap has made a big difference.  I do not use it daily because on heavy workout days I feel the need for a deodorant soap.  Three or four times a week is enough to see and feel a difference.</li>
            <li> The soap is great for my skin. I have a caramel complexion/combo skin. With hyperpigmintaion from pregnancy acne (those crazy hormones!). I have notice on my chest and back the dark spots lightening and acne disappearing after 2 weeks of using the soap. Pretty impressed. I hope this helps you make an informed decision.</li>
            <li> It makes your face brighter and it makes your acne clear! It lasts for a long time so you don&#x27;t have to be buying it every month!</li>
            <li> I noticed my skin was brighter on day 2 of using this product but it made my skin feel very itchy. I tried using lotion, which helped a little. It smells refreshing.</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my skin feel, soft and clean.  However, it makes a black gooey mess in the shower so I quit using it.  So I&#x27;ll give it a 3 star rating because it is a good product, just didn&#x27;t like the mess it left behind.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft but not as soft as the raw kind.  I would rather have the raw kind, but this will do for now.</li>
            <li> It lathers VERY well and works nicely, but it&#x27;s just too drying for me to use. I always have to put on way more moisturizer than usual after using it and then have to reapply as the day goes on. I just use it to wash my hands sometimes now.</li>
            <li> Have been using a semi liquid form of African black soap for a few months for my face, amazing.  My skin is cleaner, pores appears to be smaller, my very sensitive skin has been clearer and feels almost squeaky clean after washing it, no more feeling like I missed a spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin:  sensitive to most everything, oily but dry? (I know what??), not many breakouts but every so often a big monster pimple would appear, take forever to go away and sometimes leave a tell tale dark spot behind, flaky at times.  Definitely a combo type of skin.  Have tried and been disappointed by more products than I care to list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this Dudu-Osun bar to see if the rest of my skin would like African Black soap as much as much face has.  Only been using about a week and I must say, its pretty wonderful.  Surprisingly large bar, which appears like it will last a good long time.  This product makes my arms and legs feel super clean, and smells clean, not perfumed or chemically.  Just smooth, soft and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use African Black to cleanse, followed by Tamanu oil / argan oil for my face (Love Tamanu and both were purchased via Amazon), and Natural Shea butter (from amazon) for the rest of my body.  My skin has not looked this good for a very long time.  I am so pleased and will continue to buy and recommend (have already converted several of my co-workers and friends who all have been converted!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon for offering such great products at such affordable prices !!</li>
            <li> This soap is so gentle yet it works.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and DuDu-OSun, keeps me from breaking out and also reduces any dark scaring on my skin, Love it!</li>
            <li> This product was not good. Totally dried my skin Out and I ended up with more blemished skin behind it. It also burned my skin slightly during application. Was very disappointed. Had used African black soap with Cocoa butter and shea and it cleared my blemishes so nicely. This, product did just the opposite.</li>
            <li> I had a bad reaction to this soap. I believe it was because I washed everywhere, including the anal area which is tied to the bloodstream. I am highly sensitive to drugs and chemicals and have some allergies. It threw me for quite a loop. My heart raced and it just felt like something got into my system like a drug I&#x27;m allergic to. My best guess is I may be allergic to the tree bark or ash that&#x27;s in it. My reaction settled down after a few hours but I was jittery and very uncomfortable and vowed not to use it again. My skin did burn a little bit but not so much. I recommend keeping it away from private areas for the first use, just for the potential sting in this deep cleansing soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to be careful with this soap for other reasons as well. Since it can dry and sting, some folks get best results by using every other day or so. Read as many reviews as possible, as results vary. Some say it moisturizes skin nicely, others get dry and recommend moisturizing afterward. Some recommend starting very slowly for use with children, such as just doing hands at first, and working up to whole body a few times a week.</li>
