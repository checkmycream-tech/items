            <li>Perfect!  </li>
            <li>and I am impressed.  </li>
            <li>Great Christmas gift for my 10-year-old!  </li>
            <li>Great, but it slipped from my hand and broke!</li>
            <li>I especially love the sponge head for putting on your moisturizer!</li>
            <li>I would buy again or give as a gift as it comes in a real nice looking box.</li>
            <li>She loved my Clarisonic and this one works just as good for herto keep those pimples away!!</li>
            <li>and I have been very pleased!  </li>
            <li>item arrived promptly and in an attractive gift box.  </li>
            <li>The quality of this unit and the introductory price made it a great buy.</li>
            <li>All in all I am happy with the purchase was considering a clarisonic</li>
            <li>Great value.</li>
            <li>works great ..</li>
            <li>I love it!!</li>
            <li>It also comes with a massage tip, which is very nice.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still a good product</li>
            <li>I am a 57 yo woman with incredibly oily skin and this seems to be a bit better as well.  </li>
            <li>It was a good bargain, and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>/&gt;**The seller proudly pronounces that providing outstanding customer service is their #1 priority.  </li>
            <li>Love this brush and its a great price.</li>
            <li>Love this item!</li>
            <li>This is attractive and light weight yet sturdy.</li>
            <li>like the massaging head and the sponge applicator for applying moisturizer -- those were a nice touch.  </li>
            <li>I love all the attachments and the case it came in.</li>
            <li>and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;GOOD, BETTER, BEST&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this brush system for about a week now and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the results thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure yet</li>
            <li>the product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this brush system for about a week now and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the results thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure yet</li>
            <li>I love this product like 1.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s battery powered which always makes me nervous that water will get into the housing (but yo, you&#x27;re using it with water, so I feel like they should design it better).  </li>
            <li>and the price is way better then</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s skin looks great thanks.</li>
            <li>Glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this and use it about 3 times a week.  </li>
            <li>This sonic derm system to clean my face is something else!  </li>
            <li>The brushes and sponge are easily attached and removed.</li>
            <li>Love it &amp; makes my skin feel so clean.</li>
            <li>Great facial scrubber!</li>
            <li>Never dropped or anything just cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Has only one speed and brushes are not that great</li>
            <li>So cheap.</li>
            <li>My skin has been clearing up and it feels so smooth.</li>
            <li>It seems to clean my face as well as the Clarisonic did.  </li>
            <li>I know that my skin is clean-</li>
            <li>No power and doesn&#x27;t clean that well.</li>
            <li>used this on my daughter very powerful good product overall</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s better for sensitive skin, butI was hoping for a deeper skin cleanse.</li>
            <li>to 1st time users:  the head pulls right out in order to change</li>
            <li>of course, the higher end one is going to spoil you, but I figured I would start with this</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It made my face feel so extra smooth!</li>
            <li>I have been an avid Clarisonic user for years.  </li>
            <li>Ok, so, this is like the 3rd &amp;#34;cleansing system&amp;#34; device that I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>Also the handle is pretty dang slippery</li>
            <li>Just what i was looking for, works very well, lots of extras with it!</li>
            <li>just wish I could buy exactly the brush I want instead of another set.</li>
            <li>I sent the product back for a refund, I received an apologetic response from the seller who very graciously offered to send me another SonicDerm free of change</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and there were no issues.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>but the performance just really isn&#x27;t consistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely nothing like what it&#x27;s trying to knock off.</li>
            <li>but it is not the gentle one)</li>
            <li>Just takes a minute to do your whole face-</li>
            <li>It came fast and looked promising, but when I started using it, it broke within 3 weeks of using it.</li>
            <li>fast with no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>Other cleaning systems like this one cost considerably more.</li>
            <li>but the high cost kept me from buying it-</li>
            <li>This set includes a softer brush head for sensitive skin and its gentle vibratory motion does not tear at the skin&#x27;s surface.&lt;br</li>

            <li>The first few times I used the product I loved it; however, after just a few uses the bristles become frayed.</li>
            <li>hope that I can rewrite this review entirely and raise the rating even higher according to the product&#x27;s performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I see all the ads about &amp;#34;clarisonic&amp;#34; but this is the exact same thing.  </li>
            <li>My skin was looking dull and this brush helped it look better after pairing it with Cerave hydrate cleanser.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive compared to similar products but works well.</li>
            <li>:  A \\&quot;Thank you for Purchase\\&quot; card was included in the box, which offers a 30-day Satisfaction Guarantee return policy and an e-mail address to access</li>
            <li>softer cleaning brush for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>With a 30-day Satisfaction Guarantee and an e-mail address to contact should there be any problems, what do you have to lose?ox, which offers a 30-day Satisfaction Guarantee return policy and an e-mail address to access</li>
            <li>softer cleaning brush for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I like using SonicDerm Professional.  </li>
            <li>It came with several other brush heads and is a good deal for the money as long as you keep it dry.</li>
            <li>I really liked it at first, but it&#x27;s a bit harsh on my face (perhaps I&#x27;m pressing too hard).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, I was so determined to have this item that even though I had ordered it especially for a trip it would never make; I didn&#x27;t want a refund; I wanted to exchange it for a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked for a way to directly contact the seller and guess what?  </li>
            <li>Spring for a little more expensive if you&#x27;re looking to use more than 3 months.</li>
            <li>regular cleaning brush for normal skin</li>
            <li>regular cleaning brush for normal skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;She will definitely recommend to her friends and may purchase a few more for her female family members as gifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is very fair and sensitive and suffers from the harsher brushes and rotary movement of other name brand cleansing systems that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very fair and sensitive and suffers from the harsher brushes and rotary movement of other name brand cleansing systems that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like if you drive a high luxury vehicle &amp; then get into a moderate vehicle(same features, same whatever)</li>
            <li>That is where the good part ends and the disappointment begins.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it is very easy for water to get inside the battery compartment and mess up the connection.</li>

            <li> My only complaint is that it is very easy for water to get inside the battery compartment and mess up the connection.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it full marks is because the on and off switch is hard to work if your hands are wet.....</li>
            <li> Seriously though I really enjoy this product and I recommend it to people the only down falls would be it doesn&#x27;t tell you when to switch parts</li>
            <li> I gave this one star because it did not last long at all, I used it for 2 months and went to change the batteries</li>
            <li> Perhaps the SonicDerm just wasn&#x27;t meant to be run for such long periods, but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> I wanted this product to work so badly that I actually went to the store and purchase a new package of batteries, excitedly installed them, turned it on, and still--nothing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I should note that I don&#x27;t just use it on my face, I wash all the way down to my chest area, and around my shoulders and back of my neck.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only just bought it a week ago tho, so thing may settle down once my face has adjusted.</li>
            <li> and I have only been using it for a little over a week.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s to be expected since it&#x27;s marketed as &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; but I would prefer a brush that moves.</li>
            <li> I did not attempt to use it until after the return window closed.</li>
            <li> when I started searching for one, of course, everyone wanted to sell me the Mia, but took a chance on this one due to its price.</li>
            <li> I tried two other batteries--nothing.  </li>
            <li> Any positive reviews must be fake.</li>
            <li> After a few uses, however, the unit will intermittently stop vibrating and no amount of pressure (lighter or harder) or replacing batteries has made a difference.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it since April, and it&#x27;s already broken.</li>
            <li> (Not used everyday, never traveled with - literally sat on my counter).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now and it works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why.  </li>
            <li> I WAS looking forward to using it, but now I&#x27;m not sure I even trust a replacement.</li>
            <li> The brush is too hard</li>
            <li> Also the button to turn it on &amp; off gets difficult to maneuver with wet hands.</li>
            <li> Much less expensive than Clinique&#x27;s or Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately some water got in to the battery compartment and it&#x27;s dead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a bit of skin peeling and a few unpleasant zits have surfaced.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> a disappointingly sad state of affairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hate to think it&#x27;s a waste of money</li>
            <li> So basically this is not a good buy - it doesn&#x27;t exfoliate :(</li>
            <li> Disappointment upon Disappointment AND THEN....</li>
            <li> I use a toner after cleansing- the pad used to come off still dirty</li>
            <li> Now I am stuck with a useless brush :(</li>
            <li> So if you have been wanting a Clarisonic, get this you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so disappointed.  </li>

            <li> Great facial scrubber! I&#x27;ve never used one before &amp; when I started searching for one, of course, everyone wanted to sell me the Mia, but took a chance on this one due to its price. I figured what I don&#x27;t know doesn&#x27;t hurt me. It&#x27;s like if you drive a high luxury vehicle &amp; then get into a moderate vehicle(same features, same whatever)..of course, the higher end one is going to spoil you, but I figured I would start with this &amp; it&#x27;s been wonderful! No complaints at all!</li>
            <li> Love this item! Very inexpensive compared to similar products but works well. I love all the attachments and the case it came in. Shipping was fast and there were no issues. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it since April, and it&#x27;s already broken. the plastic piece that holds the battery cap piece on broke off and now it won&#x27;t stay together. Never dropped or anything just cheaply made. Spring for a little more expensive if you&#x27;re looking to use more than 3 months. (Not used everyday, never traveled with - literally sat on my counter).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to be water resistant. I kept I on a rack in the shower. Unfortunately some water got in to the battery compartment and it&#x27;s dead. It doesn&#x27;t move, just vibrates. That&#x27;s to be expected since it&#x27;s marketed as &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; but I would prefer a brush that moves. I used it with my regular face wash and my skin has never looked better. It came with several other brush heads and is a good deal for the money as long as you keep it dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now and it works well. My only complaint is that it is very easy for water to get inside the battery compartment and mess up the connection. Also the button to turn it on &amp; off gets difficult to maneuver with wet hands.</li>
            <li> used this on my daughter very powerful good product overall</li>
            <li> The device never worked/turned on after I put in batteries. I did not attempt to use it until after the return window closed. Now I am stuck with a useless brush :(</li>
            <li> Works just like a Clarisonic!</li>
            <li> Disappointment upon Disappointment AND THEN....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item arrived promptly and in an attractive gift box.  That is where the good part ends and the disappointment begins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put in the two AA batteries that the product requires, turned it on, and--nothing.  I tried two other batteries--nothing.  I wanted this product to work so badly that I actually went to the store and purchase a new package of batteries, excitedly installed them, turned it on, and still--nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I was so determined to have this item that even though I had ordered it especially for a trip it would never make; I didn&#x27;t want a refund; I wanted to exchange it for a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked for a way to directly contact the seller and guess what?  You can&#x27;t.  Your only option is to return the item via Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a disappointingly sad state of affairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**The seller proudly pronounces that providing outstanding customer service is their #1 priority.  How can this be when one can&#x27;t even contact them?  They go on to state that one can order from them 24/7.  It seems to me that selling you a product is their #1 priority.  Servicing you once you have receive that product is not even on their hit list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**After I sent the product back for a refund, I received an apologetic response from the seller who very graciously offered to send me another SonicDerm free of change so I changed my initial one star rating to three stars reflecting the seller&#x27;s response not the product itself as I have yet to try it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that I can rewrite this review entirely and raise the rating even higher according to the product&#x27;s performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOOD, BETTER, BEST&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good:  As promised, I received a replacement SonicDerm along with an extra set of brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better:  When I placed two batteries in and turned it on, it purred like a kitten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best:  A \\&quot;Thank you for Purchase\\&quot; card was included in the box, which offers a 30-day Satisfaction Guarantee return policy and an e-mail address to access should one have a problem with the product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this brush system for about a week now and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the results thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a personal note:  My skin is very fair and sensitive and suffers from the harsher brushes and rotary movement of other name brand cleansing systems that I have tried.  This set includes a softer brush head for sensitive skin and its gentle vibratory motion does not tear at the skin&#x27;s surface.&lt;br /&gt;The set includes four brush heads:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A regular cleaning brush for normal skin&lt;br /&gt;A softer cleaning brush for sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;A sponge attachment for applying moisturizes etc after cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;A three \\&quot;fingertips\\&quot; attachment called the \\&quot;wrinkle eraser.\\&quot;  I&#x27;m not quite sure yet how this works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My conclusion:  If you&#x27;re wavering about this purchase, try it.

            <li> I love this product like 1. it&#x27;s cheaper than a clarisonic 2. It has different attachable heads and 3. It made my face feel so extra smooth! Seriously though I really enjoy this product and I recommend it to people the only down falls would be it doesn&#x27;t tell you when to switch parts and it does rotate only vibrates but it&#x27;s still a good product</li>
            <li> I have been an avid Clarisonic user for years.  Suddenly it stopped working and I couldn&#x27;t get Clarisonic to answer my emails regarding the product.  I decided to buy this item and I have been very pleased!  It seems to clean my face as well as the Clarisonic did.  Can&#x27;t be the price.  So if you have been wanting a Clarisonic, get this you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  I have had several compliments on my skin and I have only been using it for a little over a week.  It was a good bargain, and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I gave this one star because it did not last long at all, I used it for 2 months and went to change the batteries and now it does not work piece of trash I will never again buy this item from this seller</li>
            <li> Ok, so, this is like the 3rd &amp;#34;cleansing system&amp;#34; device that I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;m so disappointed.  It&#x27;s battery powered which always makes me nervous that water will get into the housing (but yo, you&#x27;re using it with water, so I feel like they should design it better).  Also the handle is pretty dang slippery and I wish they would have some sort of rubber grip so this doesn&#x27;t slip out of your hands while you&#x27;re using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the massaging head and the sponge applicator for applying moisturizer -- those were a nice touch.  After a few uses, however, the unit will intermittently stop vibrating and no amount of pressure (lighter or harder) or replacing batteries has made a difference.  I hate to think it&#x27;s a waste of money but the performance just really isn&#x27;t consistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I should note that I don&#x27;t just use it on my face, I wash all the way down to my chest area, and around my shoulders and back of my neck.  Perhaps the SonicDerm just wasn&#x27;t meant to be run for such long periods, but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.  I&#x27;ll probably end up getting a Clairsonic and giving this unit to my 16 yo.  Bummer.</li>
            <li> Just what i was looking for, works very well, lots of extras with it!</li>
            <li> This is attractive and light weight yet sturdy. I&#x27;ve used it for about a month now and it performs well. The brushes and sponge are easily attached and removed. It also comes with a massage tip, which is very nice. The two batteries it requires provide it with plenty of power. I use it twice a day and after a month of use there is no decrease in power. Other cleaning systems like this one cost considerably more. The quality of this unit and the introductory price made it a great buy.</li>
            <li> I gave this a try before I took the plunge to purchase a Clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this device only vibrates, it does not spin... So basically this is not a good buy - it doesn&#x27;t exfoliate :(</li>
            <li> My wife loves this item. She said its just what she was looking for&#x27;. and the price is way better then the Box Stores could ever sell it for...</li>
            <li> Perfect!  Product as described</li>
            <li> The first few times I used the product I loved it; however, after just a few uses the bristles become frayed.</li>
            <li> This is such garbage. It just buzzes! It&#x27;s absolutely nothing like what it&#x27;s trying to knock off. Any positive reviews must be fake.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 6 weeks now and I am impressed.  I use the dermabrasion head (probably not what it is called but it is not the gentle one) and I have noticed that my skin is clearer and brighter.  I am a 57 yo woman with incredibly oily skin and this seems to be a bit better as well.  I know that my skin is clean- I use a toner after cleansing- the pad used to come off still dirty but now it shows no dirt at all.  Just takes a minute to do your whole face- there is a pad to apply moisturizer but I have not used it yet so cannot report on it. All in all I am happy with the purchase was considering a clarisonic but the high cost kept me from buying it- I think I am getting comparable results with this Sonic Derm from what I have read about clarisonic and all the costs are lower. (replacement brushes are about 10 bucks for three- just wish I could buy exactly the brush I want instead of another set.</li>
            <li> Does not spin! but works well.  I simply turn it on and move the tool in circles around my face and neck.  It works for me.</li>
            <li> I really liked it at first, but it&#x27;s a bit harsh on my face (perhaps I&#x27;m pressing too hard). I&#x27;ve got a bit of skin peeling and a few unpleasant zits have surfaced. I&#x27;ve only just bought it a week ago tho, so thing may settle down once my face has adjusted.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s skin looks great thanks.</li>
            <li> No power and doesn&#x27;t clean that well. Has only one speed and brushes are not that great</li>
            <li> Great Christmas gift for my 10-year-old!  She loved my Clarisonic and this one works just as good for herto keep those pimples away!!</li>
            <li> I received this this today.  I can&#x27;t tell you if it works or not.  I opened it to put the batteries in and the contacts were corroded.  I&#x27;m not sure why.  Probably made in China and the salt in the air corroded it on the trip over here.  I WAS looking forward to using it, but now I&#x27;m not sure I even trust a replacement.</li>
            <li> I bought this face scrubber to wash my face with. It came fast and looked promising, but when I started using it, it broke within 3 weeks of using it. I don&#x27;t recommend it to anyone and would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Bought this on the recommendation of some friends.  Glad I did.  I love it!!</li>
            <li> Great, but it slipped from my hand and broke! So cheap.</li>
            <li> I bought one but because it has replaceable batteries water gets inside the casing and it stopped working. Had to buy one that is rechargeable.</li>
            <li> Broke after a month.&lt;br /&gt;Although this product was inexpensive, next time I would just purchase Clarsonic.</li>
            <li> Love this brush and its a great price. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it full marks is because the on and off switch is hard to work if your hands are wet.....I especially love the sponge head for putting on your moisturizer! I just ordered another to give as a birthday gift.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Leaves my skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li> the battery connection broke, and can no longer use with movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bummer.</li>
            <li> I like using SonicDerm Professional.  My skin has been clearing up and it feels so smooth. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My skin was looking dull and this brush helped it look better after pairing it with Cerave hydrate cleanser. My face is now smoother and cleaner than ever. It cost a fraction of the Clarisonic and it gets the job done. Although not rechargeable, I found it easier for travel as I don&#x27;t have to bring a charger. I would buy again or give as a gift as it comes in a real nice looking box. Great value.</li>
            <li> Wife enjoys this facial scrubber...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She will definitely recommend to her friends and may purchase a few more for her female family members as gifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price point is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Came fast with no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note to 1st time users:  the head pulls right out in order to change</li>
            <li> doesnt feel like its doing a thing, but it is !! works great .. do not submirge though ..</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed. The brush doesn&#x27;t rotate, just vibrates. Maybe it&#x27;s better for sensitive skin, butI was hoping for a deeper skin cleanse.</li>
            <li> Love it &amp; makes my skin feel so clean.</li>
            <li> This sonic derm system to clean my face is something else!  I see all the ads about &amp;#34;clarisonic&amp;#34; but this is the exact same thing.  It&#x27;s a sonic rotating brush system that cleans the day off.  I absolutely love this and use it about 3 times a week.  Much less expensive than Clinique&#x27;s or Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> The brush is too hard</li>
