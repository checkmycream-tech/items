            <li>sure to buy edible peppermint .</li>
            <li>This was a gift and they love it/</li>
            <li>but I am ok with that</li>
            <li>and it does its magic.</li>
            <li>It is  refreshing  and</li>
            <li>so refreshing</li>
            <li>in Distilled water then with 2 or 3 drops of Tea Tree oil and wee bit of baking soda to make a Clean Chemical FREE Room Freshner and people Love It!</li>
            <li>Now foods makes good oils and they are always pure.</li>
            <li>Not as strong as Eden Gardens.</li>
            <li>wonderful for a few days.</li>
            <li>I mix it with olive oil and am pain free after that for quite a while.</li>
            <li>it still was very useful to make my apartment smell</li>
            <li>I was surprised and very pleased.</li>
            <li>Very soothing, pleasant and energizing all at the same time!  </li>
            <li>I bought this product for my headaches and heard it was worth it.</li>
            <li>Got it pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Well my friend was right.</li>
            <li>It worked right away.</li>
            <li>Shipping &amp; Receiving was fine but far as getting rid of mice,it didn&#x27;t help there.</li>
            <li>Thanks a million!</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS OIL ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE ALLERGIES</li>
            <li>It really does work.</li>
            <li>FAST SERVICE.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>And reasonably priced</li>
            <li>They really keep pushing me to sign up for this service</li>
            <li>and they pretty much disappeared from there nearly immediately!  </li>
            <li>Smells better than other sprays.</li>
            <li>Very strong and powerful don&#x27;t get confused</li>
            <li>used this to repel ants around my house-I live in the country.  </li>
            <li>I live in FL.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t affect all aspects of the headache, notably the feeling of pressure around my eye, so it is not a miracle cure, but it definitely lessens the pain in my forehead as well as the degree to which the pain radiates to other parts of my face.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff, I keep a kettle of water on the wood stove and shake a few drops of this in it every day, it keeps the kettle from rusting because it coats it with oil, the smell is very invigorating, its always a big pick me up when the smell starts to flow, plus apparently spiders don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like to use poison or traps, and had read on line that you could soak peppermint oil into cotton balls and the mice could not stay near as it would choke their lungs.  </li>
            <li>I mixed it with water in a spray bottle where they were traveling most heavily</li>
            <li>I put into a small spray bottle on FINE mist to spray up in air for bathrooms</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the lasting smell  of this peppermint oil.  </li>
            <li>and so far it has worked and not as bad as I thought it would be, I actually liked it.&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>

            <li> Great product.  I have bought it 2 times now.</li>
            <li> one of my favorite oils, love the smell!</li>
            <li> Very strong and powerful don&#x27;t get confused this is not something you want to put on your skin</li>
            <li> use it for many things +++</li>
            <li> Love It!  Very soothing, pleasant and energizing all at the same time!  Try popping a peppermint bon bon in your mouth while diffusing with the oil! ❤️</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my headaches and heard it was worth it. Well my friend was right. I love it! It really does work. I haven&#x27;t used it yet for other uses but I would recommend this product. The seller ships it out on time too. I received before the delivery date.</li>
            <li> AS DESCRIBED. FAST SERVICE.</li>
            <li> Great product, will buy again.</li>
            <li> I actually burned this oil and it could be smelled down the block. The smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming, and although it didn&#x27;t work for the  purpose of me buying it (to get rid of mice. I heard they hate the smell) it still was very useful to make my apartment smell great. Oh, and they lasted for a while even though they were very small bottles.</li>
            <li> used this to repel ants around my house-I live in the country.  This works GREAT for that!  I mixed it with water in a spray bottle where they were traveling most heavily and they pretty much disappeared from there nearly immediately!  I purchased more for keeping them at bay this summer.  Wish I had known this sooner!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of peppermint</li>
            <li> place a few drops on a cotton ball and leave it in the house and the whole home smells&lt;br /&gt;just wonderful for a few days.</li>
            <li> I mix it with olive oil and am pain free after that for quite a while. It is great on feet.</li>
            <li> Great for headaches, just rub it on your temple.  I use a lot of peppermint so this 2 pack was a great buy.</li>
            <li> I use this to repel mosquitos. Smells better than other sprays. It works very well. Be sure not to miss a spot. Wear white, they don&#x27;t like that color. Got it pretty quickly. I live in FL. Lots of sqeeters here. Works here! Try it!</li>
            <li> Bought this edible peppermint because I was told it would help to reduce appetite if dabbed inside of cheek and so far it has worked and not as bad as I thought it would be, I actually liked it.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to buy edible peppermint .</li>
            <li> Just 20 drops in a small spray bottle of water and your spider problems are a thing of the past. It really works and smells great!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Now foods makes good oils and they are always pure. Great for homemade toothpaste or mouthwash.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and they love it/</li>
            <li> Prefer NOW products...they are reliable... Good quality control... And reasonably priced</li>
            <li> This is a great product at a great price! Received it in the post in a timely fashion. If I need more, I&#x27;ll know where to get it! Thanks a million!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I keep a kettle of water on the wood stove and shake a few drops of this in it every day, it keeps the kettle from rusting because it coats it with oil, the smell is very invigorating, its always a big pick me up when the smell starts to flow, plus apparently spiders don&#x27;t like it. It does not have a dropper but I am ok with that, I just tip it over the kettle, give it a few shakes and it does its magic.</li>
            <li> I find no difference between this and YL except the price.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as Eden Gardens. But, it will do.</li>
            <li> I mix this Peppermint oil (30 drops or so, Love the Smell to be Strong!) in Distilled water then with 2 or 3 drops of Tea Tree oil and wee bit of baking soda to make a Clean Chemical FREE Room Freshner and people Love It! I put into a small spray bottle on FINE mist to spray up in air for bathrooms</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the lasting smell  of this peppermint oil.  I use it on cottonballs in my car to keep mice and other &amp;#34;friends&amp;#34; out of it. It is  refreshing  and others comment that it is nice.</li>
            <li> bought this to get rid of mice that came in over the winter. It worked right away. I was surprised and very pleased. Since I placed in it my home have seen no droppings. I did call an exterminator who put down traps but I didn&#x27;t use their service to plug up any holes that the mice might be coming in through. I did catch 1 mouse in a trap but as I&#x27;ve said did not do anything to prevent them from coming in my home except use the peppermint oil. I saved around $1,600+ which the  company wanted to charge me. They really keep pushing me to sign up for this service but I wanted to see if the peppermint would work and IT DID! I did waste some $$ by calling exterminator company, I wish had the peppermint oil before I called them. To clarify the company did not put any poison that could kill the mice or do anything that would prevent the mice from coming in.</li>
            <li> Shipping &amp; Receiving was fine but far as getting rid of mice,it didn&#x27;t help there. I think that it might be a deterent for them but they did not help me getting rid of them once they were already there.</li>
            <li> One of my bottles bust.</li>
            <li> I though it was food grade</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would help with my chronic headaches, and it does.  I dab some on my temples and under my nose, and it has helped a great deal to alleviate the pain.  It doesn&#x27;t affect all aspects of the headache, notably the feeling of pressure around my eye, so it is not a miracle cure, but it definitely lessens the pain in my forehead as well as the degree to which the pain radiates to other parts of my face.  I have had these headaches for years and all I can say is I wish I had tried this sooner.</li>
            <li> Crazy as it may sound, i used the peppermint oil to get rid of mice.  I don&#x27;t like to use poison or traps, and had read on line that you could soak peppermint oil into cotton balls and the mice could not stay near as it would choke their lungs.  Whatever, it seems to have worked to make them go away.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS OIL ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE ALLERGIES</li>
            <li> I add a few drops to my bath, my hair mask, my kitchen cupboards to keep bugs away....  Works every time.</li>
            <li> Worked in keeping bugs away from some flowers wife used on</li>
            <li> I love this peppermint oil! so refreshing</li>
