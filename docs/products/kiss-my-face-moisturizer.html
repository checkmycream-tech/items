    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It&#x27;s not at all &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; and the patchouli is not full-strength -- it&#x27;s a perfect blend!</li>
            <li>so the scent is wonderful to me..</li>
            <li>Win!</li>
            <li>Win!</li>

            <li>I was thrilled to find it on Amazon, what a savings!</li>
            <li>I just received mine yesterday and am thrilled with it!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pleasant scent, though.</li>
            <li>The lotion moisturizes well and is pleasantly scented, but the patchouli scent is somewhat masked by the citrus elements.</li>
            <li>is about all I can say that was good</li>

            <li>I have my own patchouli oil</li>

            <li>It is easy to rub in, absorbs quickly, and has an amazing scent!</li>
            <li>Love this scent.  </li>
            <li>I love the way this lotion smells.</li>
            <li>If you love patchouli, you&#x27;ll love it too.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I bought it because I love the scent of the Kiss</li>
            <li>and see if I get a better bottle.</li>
            <li>love this lotion.</li>
            <li>patchouli is my favorite of any scent.</li>
            <li>This is a more softer patchouli scented lotion.</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks for delivering a great product.</li>
            <li>Love all of Kiss My Face products.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>i love all kiss my face products and recommend them to anyone</li>
            <li>Since I wanted a product with more patchouli scent, I&#x27;ve given it an &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; rating.</li>
            <li>so I can always wear more if I want to our use another scent.  </li>
            <li>I used to love the smell</li>
            <li>I love the pachouli deodorant, it actually smells great!</li>
            <li>I love this lotion, it comes in various scents which are all great, but Patchouli is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>cheap product... Love the Kiss</li>
            <li>It really keeps my skin soft and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>Not too strong, but no question it is Patchouli.</li>
            <li>I am a huge Patchouli buff</li>
            <li>saved me a lot of money plus free shipping.</li>
            <li>Go to Walmart or Walgreens for any generic as it would be just as good as this item.</li>
            <li>I have been able to keep it under control with Jergens, Eucerin, or really any lotion I have on hand.</li>
            <li>However, it is still a pleasant smelling lotion, and I enjoy other Kiss My Face products.</li>
            <li>I ran into this scent and brand while I worked for an organic company and am glad I can still get this at a somewhat decent price not working for them anymore.</li>
            <li>Patchouli can be overwhelming if you use the oil, but this lotion will give you just enough scent to enjoy and not give your co-workers a headache!  </li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly as stated.&lt;br /&gt;AbesMarket</li>
            <li>Fresh, clean and yes very peaceful.  </li>
            <li>You guys are my new favorite market place.</li>
            <li>I am happy with the lotion as it is exactly what I expected; however, the container arrived damaged.  </li>
            <li>it absorbs quickly and actually smells nice.</li>
            <li>For someone who wants less patchouli scent, it would be ideal.</li>
            <li>It may have good moisturizing qualities; but, there is just the tiniest hint of patchouli combined with some other oil.</li>
            <li>I think it is just the right strength.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this in the past and it has been great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s relatively mild compared to straight patchouli oil.</li>
            <li>but this is not strong at all and is mostly pleasant.</li>
            <li>, otherwise I might have some kind of rare disease that shows itself by extreme softening of the derma.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again until \\&quot;Patchouli Oil\\&quot; is one of the first 5 ingredients.</li>
            <li>It does not smell enough like patchouli to my liking, and it smells more like hemp than patchouli.</li>
            <li>My Face - Peaceful Patchouli Ultra Moisturizer, 16 fl oz lotion]]  </li>
            <li>Very dissappointed!</li>
            <li>My Face Peaceful Patchouli is for you.</li>
            <li>My Face Peaceful Patchouli body wash.</li>
            <li>First, I used it on my hands, and this morning my hands feel like velvet.  </li>
            <li>I also really like the Peaceful Patchouli Shower Gel.</li>
            <li>this normally i use right before bed</li>
            <li>The customer service is great, but the first time the lotion arrived with a broken pump.  </li>
            <li>i did not care for this lotion at all, it smelled very old, i have smelled this before in stores which it smelled earthy and fresh</li>
            <li>You need to add some real patchouli to this product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it smells very patchouli.  </li>
            <li>Great fragrance but really, really thin and runny</li>
            <li>It has real staying power for a lotion, and at this time I year I really need that.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>The smell is great, and not overwhelming, but strong enough to last.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d say &amp;#34;Ultra&amp;#34; but  &amp;#34;Very Good Moisturizer&amp;#34; is harder to fit on the front of a bottle.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care about the scent like many other reviews.</li>
            <li>The lotion is great, subtle scent but obviously a problem with the source.  </li>
            <li>I have super dry skin and this product really works..</li>
            <li>nice thick lotion, goes on well and not greasy.</li>
            <li>My skin is very soft and supple.</li>
            <li>and it leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>The quality of the lotion is okay, if you&#x27;ve used any other Kiss My Face products, it&#x27;s the same as the rest of them....</li>
            <li>It does not go on white on your skin like so many other natural lotions.</li>
            <li>If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;d like old, white-haired geezers to yell at you every time you walk by, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li>It does make your skin soft though.</li>
            <li>Kinda greasy, but overall a decent moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I finally found my favorite moisturizer with a subtle patchouli scent.</li>
            <li>It just screams &amp;#34;I am against everything you stand for,&amp;#34; especially if you live in a so-called &#x27;red&#x27; state.</li>
            <li>I have used this product before and am a big fan of Kiss My Face products in general.  </li>

            <li> My Face Peaceful Patchouli is for you.</li>
            <li> My Face Peaceful Patchouli body wash.</li>

            <li> It just screams &amp;#34;I am against everything you stand for,&amp;#34; especially if you live in a so-called &#x27;red&#x27; state.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and am a big fan of Kiss My Face products in general.  </li>
            <li> I have been wearing patchouli oil for years and was excited to see this lotion, but was not happy when I put it on.  </li>
            <li> The lotion is just the right consistency, not too thick and not too thin and it absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance doesn&#x27;t last very long, so this isn&#x27;t intended to make you smell like patchouli all day long.</li>
            <li> A couple of other recent reviewers said the same thing, so I&#x27;m going to try and exchange it</li>
            <li> i keep this in the bedroom because it gets dry in there</li>
            <li> I normally do not like patchouli</li>
            <li> Doesnt even remotely smell of patchouli.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a heavy patchouli smell, just enough to know it&#x27;s there.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, and was told I had eczema as a child, but I never had any symptoms anywhere other than my hands until this winter.</li>
            <li> Soft and subtle patchouli scent is what you can expect.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 due to the fact</li>
            <li> The scent is not overwhelming, but the way the product moisturizes it feels like you only need to use it once or twice a day anyway.  </li>
            <li> I have recently started enjoying the smell of patchouli (I used to hate it!)...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll write later if it turns out to be a false alarm.</li>
            <li> The plastic pump that you press down on to dispense the lotion is broken almost in half.</li>
            <li> not sure what it smells like?</li>
            <li> it smelled nothing like advertised and was not a very good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> it is very heavy and thick.</li>
            <li> This item has very little patchouli scent and not really a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Scent is faint but peppery,  I do not like floral so it suits me.</li>
            <li> For some reason this moisturizer does not smell ANYTHING like it usually does!</li>
            <li> Smells weird like the unscented lotion smell with maybe a hint of patchouli when you first put it on that wears off after about 5 min.  :(</li>
            <li> not too thick or thin and not sticky.</li>
            <li> I ordered again, and the lotion arrived with a broken pump (again).  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be put off by poor reviews about how this product&#x27;s scent isn&#x27;t noticable.  </li>
            <li> By far one of the worst products I have ever</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I purchased 3 bottles of it.</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t smell bad, it just has no patchouli.</li>
            <li> Try it and you will not be disappointed.</li>

            <li> I finally found my favorite moisturizer with a subtle patchouli scent. Kiss My Face moisturizer is not greasy and the scent lingers, doesn&#x27;t overpower. It&#x27;s not at all &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; and the patchouli is not full-strength -- it&#x27;s a perfect blend! (I also use Kiss My Face Tea Tree liquid soap, and wish that this scent would also be made as a moisturizer.)</li>
            <li> This does not smell like Patchouli whatsoever and I am very disappointed.  I have been wearing patchouli oil for years and was excited to see this lotion, but was not happy when I put it on.  Again, it does NOT smell like patchouli and I can&#x27;t even describe what it smells like.  Will NOT be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin and this product really works..I am a huge Patchouli buff so the scent is wonderful to me..I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 due to the fact the scent could be somewhat stronger..overall I suggest this product and plan on ordering it again..</li>
            <li> I have always liked the aroma of Patchouli. It had it&#x27;s hey-day in the 60&#x27;s. Loved the fragrance then too! I also really like the Peaceful Patchouli Shower Gel. But...this Ultra-Moisturizer leaves alot to be desired where the fragrance is concerned. Unfortunately, I purchased 3 bottles of it. It may have good moisturizing qualities; but, there is just the tiniest hint of patchouli combined with some other oil. You need to add some real patchouli to this product. I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again until \\&quot;Patchouli Oil\\&quot; is one of the first 5 ingredients. I may have to buy some \\&quot;real\\&quot; Patchouli oil and add it to each bottle. Hence, I could actually do that with any moisturizer, couldn&#x27;t I?</li>
            <li> Love this scent.  Not too strong, but no question it is Patchouli.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it smells very patchouli.  I don&#x27;t even see any patchouli oil in the ingredients list.  Smells weird like the unscented lotion smell with maybe a hint of patchouli when you first put it on that wears off after about 5 min.  :(</li>
            <li> I ordered the patchouli body lotion. For some reason it had a blend of scents with the patchouli lotion. Not enough of the patchouli scent.</li>
            <li> I have recently started enjoying the smell of patchouli (I used to hate it!)...but this does not smell like patchouli at all.  However, it is still a pleasant smelling lotion, and I enjoy other Kiss My Face products.</li>
            <li> i love this lotion! it absorbs quickly and actually smells nice. I normally do not like patchouli but this is not strong at all and is mostly pleasant. even my fiancee agrees - he also does not like patchouli- I ran into this scent and brand while I worked for an organic company and am glad I can still get this at a somewhat decent price not working for them anymore. i keep this in the bedroom because it gets dry in there and overnight i sometimes wake up to apply lotion.. this normally i use right before bed and i dont wake up to re apply.</li>
            <li> If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;d like old, white-haired geezers to yell at you every time you walk by, this is the product for you. It just screams &amp;#34;I am against everything you stand for,&amp;#34; especially if you live in a so-called &#x27;red&#x27; state. As a moisturizer, it&#x27;s very good. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d say &amp;#34;Ultra&amp;#34; but  &amp;#34;Very Good Moisturizer&amp;#34; is harder to fit on the front of a bottle. My skin is very soft and supple. I hope it&#x27;s because of this product, otherwise I might have some kind of rare disease that shows itself by extreme softening of the derma. Now I&#x27;m worried...I&#x27;ll write later if it turns out to be a false alarm.</li>
            <li> Second time I&#x27;ve ordered this lotion from this vendor.  The customer service is great, but the first time the lotion arrived with a broken pump.  Nutricity replaced it, no problem.  I ordered again, and the lotion arrived with a broken pump (again).  They offered to replace for a discount but at this point I decided it was easier to pour it into another container.  The lotion is great, subtle scent but obviously a problem with the source.  Take a walk to the health food store, I will next time.</li>
            <li> Been using for 15 plus years and the prices here are so great I cab stock up!</li>
            <li> This lotion is wonderfully emollient and does a great job at moisturizing one&#x27;s skin. It does not smell enough like patchouli to my liking, and it smells more like hemp than patchouli. It&#x27;s a pleasant scent, though.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance but really, really thin and runny</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00142E9NC Kiss My Face - Peaceful Patchouli Ultra Moisturizer, 16 fl oz lotion]]  The scent is not overwhelming, but the way the product moisturizes it feels like you only need to use it once or twice a day anyway.  Fresh, clean and yes very peaceful.  I was thrilled to find it on Amazon, what a savings!</li>
            <li> i did not care for this lotion at all, it smelled very old, i have smelled this before in stores which it smelled earthy and fresh but they discontined it.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, it comes in various scents which are all great, but Patchouli is my favorite.  The lotion is just the right consistency, not too thick and not too thin and it absorbs quickly.  It keeps my skin hydrated all day after putting it on after my morning shower.</li>
            <li> I love the way this lotion smells. If you love patchouli, you&#x27;ll love it too. It&#x27;s relatively mild compared to straight patchouli oil. The fragrance doesn&#x27;t last very long, so this isn&#x27;t intended to make you smell like patchouli all day long. The quality of the lotion is okay, if you&#x27;ve used any other Kiss My Face products, it&#x27;s the same as the rest of them....Kinda greasy, but overall a decent moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this in the past and it has been great. For some reason this moisturizer does not smell ANYTHING like it usually does! Smells nothing like patchouli. Weird!! Very dissappointed!</li>
            <li> Doesnt even remotely smell of patchouli. Nice lotion but not sure what it smells like?</li>
            <li> By far one of the worst products I have ever use!!&lt;br /&gt;The smell  is Horrible doesn&#x27;t smell at all like Patchouli&lt;br /&gt;Very cheap product... Love the Kiss My Face Deodorant in Patchouli&lt;br /&gt;But this lotion is awful</li>
            <li> Great lotion with a pleasant smell,yet it is very heavy and thick.Makes for a great colder weather lotion. If your looking for an alternative to boring and overpowering smells,Kiss My Face Peaceful Patchouli is for you. Soft and subtle patchouli scent is what you can expect.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It really keeps my skin soft and smells wonderful. I recommend it to any skin type.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother with this item.  This item has very little patchouli scent and not really a good moisturizer.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Go to Walmart or Walgreens for any generic as it would be just as good as this item. Beware, you can&#x27;t return this item!</li>
            <li> Rating this one star because it has no detectable patchouli smell! I bought it because I love the scent of the Kiss My Face Peaceful Patchouli body wash. This stuff doesn&#x27;t smell bad, it just has no patchouli. A couple of other recent reviewers said the same thing, so I&#x27;m going to try and exchange it and see if I get a better bottle. Will update review then.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be put off by poor reviews about how this product&#x27;s scent isn&#x27;t noticable.  I just received mine yesterday and am thrilled with it!  First, I used it on my hands, and this morning my hands feel like velvet.  It has real staying power for a lotion, and at this time I year I really need that.  As to the scent...it smells beautiful.  I think it is just the right strength.  Patchouli can be overwhelming if you use the oil, but this lotion will give you just enough scent to enjoy and not give your co-workers a headache!  Try it and you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Wife loves the scent and feel of the lotion.  I will likely but this product or a similar one in the future.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> love this lotion. has a great scent. and it leaves my skin feeling very soft. patchouli is my favorite of any scent.</li>
            <li> This is a more softer patchouli scented lotion. I love the way it feels on my skin. Absorbs quickly as stated.&lt;br /&gt;AbesMarket saved me a lot of money plus free shipping. Win! Win! Thanks for delivering a great product. You guys are my new favorite market place.</li>
            <li> Love all of Kiss My Face products. Very nice scent and not too overpowering like patchouli can sometimes be.</li>
            <li> Love the patchouli fragrance and the product!</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff!  Very light scent and great moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It does not go on white on your skin like so many other natural lotions. It is easy to rub in, absorbs quickly, and has an amazing scent!</li>
            <li> Great smell, very moisturising, love this product!! I have been using this lotion for over a year, and I still love it! The smell is great, and not overwhelming, but strong enough to last.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and am a big fan of Kiss My Face products in general.  I am happy with the lotion as it is exactly what I expected; however, the container arrived damaged.  The plastic pump that you press down on to dispense the lotion is broken almost in half.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care about the scent like many other reviews. I care that this product did not work for me. I have very dry skin, and was told I had eczema as a child, but I never had any symptoms anywhere other than my hands until this winter. I have been able to keep it under control with Jergens, Eucerin, or really any lotion I have on hand. I bought this lotion thinking I like this brand and I like the ingredients. Well, after two weeks of using it, I have eczema break outs all over my arms! After applying it, within 10 minutes my skin doesn&#x27;t feel like I put anything on. I&#x27;m throwing this out and buying a moisturizer that actually works.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product...it smelled nothing like advertised and was not a very good moisturizer.  It came on time is about all I can say that was good</li>
            <li> nice smell. not too thick or thin and not sticky. i love all kiss my face products and recommend them to anyone</li>
            <li> nice thick lotion, goes on well and not greasy. Scent is faint but peppery,  I do not like floral so it suits me. good buy.</li>
            <li> The lotion moisturizes well and is pleasantly scented, but the patchouli scent is somewhat masked by the citrus elements. Since I wanted a product with more patchouli scent, I&#x27;ve given it an &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; rating. For someone who wants less patchouli scent, it would be ideal.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a heavy patchouli smell, just enough to know it&#x27;s there.  I have my own patchouli oil so I can always wear more if I want to our use another scent.  Overall the lotion itself is wonderful.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> great condition/prompt delivery</li>
            <li> I just got this via ups. I used to love the smell but this is totally different then in years past.&lt;br /&gt;They need to put the pachouli back in this pachouli lotion, I smell none! It does make your skin soft though. I love the pachouli deodorant, it actually smells great!</li>
