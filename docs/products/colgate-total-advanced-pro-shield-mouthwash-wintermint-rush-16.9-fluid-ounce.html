    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>One recommendation I thought was excellent was children 6 years to under 12-years-old should be supervised while using this mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The taste isn&#x27;t impressive, but then I don&#x27;t purchase mouthwash for its jazzy flavor like I would the smell of my cologne.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still impressed with this product.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;d be happy to change to that wording.</li>
            <li>The “Wintermint Rush” flavor smells great, and as an added bonus it doesn&#x27;t sting like the cheaper brands because it isn&#x27;t alcohol-based.</li>
            <li>But for some people I suspect that the milder sensation would be a welcome change.  </li>
            <li>This mouthwash gives you a great taste and no sting.  </li>
            <li>liked this flavor, minty but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I already finished the product and really liked it.  </li>
            <li>My wife tried it and also liked it.  </li>
            <li>purple color is also fun and helps keep the product attractive to the kids.</li>
            <li>My breath is fresh, but my mouth doesn&#x27;t taste great, so it&#x27;s a bit of a wash.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t taste all that good as fatr as mouthwashes go, though it&#x27;s not bad per se either.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it tastes fine and works a lot better than nothing!</li>
            <li>I like this product &amp; feel safe using it.</li>
            <li>couple of things I did like about the container were (1) the plastic cap came with a safety sealed wrapper around it so the consumer can be assured that there has been no tampering (most mouthwashes come this way, but</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now let&#x27;s get to the questions most consumers have when they shop for mouthwash:</li>
            <li>those nights when I don&#x27;t brush my teeth, rinsing with this product is \\&quot;better than nothing\\&quot;?  </li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t any mouthwash out there that tastes phenomenal</li>
            <li>The bottle fit nicely into my cabinet, I&#x27;ve had issues with that before.</li>
            <li>If you like this flavor it may be a better option for you</li>
            <li>I think most people would.</li>
            <li>It tastes pretty good.</li>
            <li>I want a strong mint, and most non-alcohiolic mouthwash I&#x27;ve tried is rather wimpy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it nearly every day for a month, and it feels great.  </li>
            <li>The taste is ok, and it gave me that clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>The fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong flavor wasn&#x27;t a problem for me.</li>
            <li>But I didn&#x27;t feel any strong urge to buy this item again.  </li>
            <li>The flavor of Colgate&#x27;s Wintermint Rush Total Advanced ProShield Mouthwash is very nice and refreshing, minty without being too strong or overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I found the mouthwash left a pleasant coating on my lips, which my wife also found appealing.</li>
            <li>It leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean without an overwhelming taste that destroys the rest of my morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I buy it because it works; because it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Kills germs.&lt;br /&gt;~ Significantly prevents and reduces plaque.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I leave the bathroom not feelin as sparklingly clean as I&#x27;m used too.</li>
            <li>It gives your mouth that clean feeling that brushing alone can&#x27;t give.  </li>
            <li>It has a clean taste and it was no problem swishing for 60 seconds.</li>
            <li>My breath stayed reasonably fresh and free of an undesirable smell.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for an alcohol free mouthwash with a mild taste, then this might be worth trying.</li>
            <li>It leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean and it lasts.  </li>
            <li>Teeth did not really feel clean, but I loved the way my breath smells.</li>
            <li>is an okay product, just as good as any colgate I&#x27;ve used, but I can&#x27;t say I notice a huge improvement over the regular total mouthwash.</li>
            <li>This mouthwash is much easier to use than the harsher brands that have alcohol and a strong burning sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product offered similar protection, but the winter mint was a very pleasant surprise and powerful enough to be a rinse and a mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s purple and that is fun.</li>
            <li>The spearmint flavor is very refreshing and the fresh breath lasts a long time(if you don&#x27;t eat or drink</li>
            <li>I doubt it was intended for this, but I found the inside cap could be used as a measuring cup for dispensing the right amount of mouthwash.</li>
            <li>You can also have your coffee right after without that 30 minute wait.  </li>
            <li>The Colgate product is alcohol free and has a much milder sensation when first used.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for an effective mouthwash that was alcohol free because I&#x27;m tired of the \\&quot;alcohol burn\\&quot; that comes with many of the top-named brands.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I was pleased with this new Colgate Total Advanced Pro-Shield mouthwash.</li>
            <li>The product I am reviewing is the 16.9 fluid ounce plastic bottle manufactured by the Colgate-Palmolive Company and comes with several fairly remarkable claims:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ 12-hour protection against germs, even after eating and</li>
            <li>I first saw the 12-hour protection guarantee and then noted the 24/7 protection promise I thought, \\&quot;Wait a minute!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>In other words, no where am I claiming that the product is a substitute for regular (and fairly rigorous) teeth-brushing!</li>
            <li>I decided to Try the Colgate Total Advance since it prominently said &#x27;No Alcohol&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>This Colgate Total Advanced Pro-Shield Wintermint, though, is surprisingly bold in flavor.</li>
            <li>new Colgate Total Advanced Pro-Shield is alcohol free and is advertised as an anti-gingivitis, anti-plaque mouthwash.</li>
            <li>I feel positive about all aspects of the product with one exception.  </li>
            <li>I stumbled on this Colgate Total brand, and although all of their colorful varieties are alcohol-free, this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>After rinsing I found the mouthwash left a fresh, clean taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li>The big difference is the taste, which may or may not be a strong selling point for Colgate.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a milder mouthwash then you should certainly look into this</li>
            <li>very clean.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>I finished my bottle of Colgate Total Advanced Pro-Shield mouthwash this morning</li>
            <li>of the reason I am skeptical of non-alcoholic mouthwashs, frankly, is that the taste on many of them just isn&#x27;t very strong.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this to see if my mouth could feed refreshed without burning, but overall I don&#x27;t like the taste.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; is mild enough that I am able to tolerate a full 45 second rinse, and the taste is smooth and evaporates only a few minutes after use.  </li>
            <li>It does a decent job.</li>
            <li>I hardly expected the above to be controversial.  </li>
            <li>That is partially because it is alcohol free which I like.</li>
            <li>Left my mouth tingling and fresh, and it&#x27;s a product I&#x27;ll buy again.  </li>
            <li>But if you want a good antibacterial (to head off bad breath and kill bacteria without drying your mouth out with alcohol, I would recommend the Colgate, particularly if you like a bold flavor!</li>
            <li>Even though this was a 16.9 fluid ounce bottle, I was surprised just how quickly I used it up; even when using the nifty pseudo measuring cup I had discovered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I saw this new product from Colgate</li>
            <li>This new Colgate-Palmolive mouth also comes in two additional flavors: \\&quot;Peppermint</li>
            <li>I usually use Listerine TotalCarePlus but that burning sensation as you&#x27;re swishing it around in your mouth can be overwhelming at times.  </li>
            <li>far as really cleaning my teeth, I&#x27;m afraid I am going to stick with the alcohol-infused antiseptic mouthwash, mostly because my problem is not bad breath, but wanting to prevent gingivitis and the like.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say it does particularly any better or worse than normal either.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d not recommend it, I would recommend Crest Pro-Health Complete.</li>
            <li>As far as I am concerned it does.</li>
            <li>This was completely unexpected; what a relief.(not my gums) because of some prescribed medication I&#x27;m taking.</li>
            <li>This was completely unexpected; what a relief.</li>
            <li>This mouthwash has a very mild, rather dull taste; no fizzing, bubbling, burning and definitely no rush; exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>when you first use it, there is a sharp tinge in the mouth.  </li>
            <li>label comes with many of the usual list of active and inactive ingredients, warnings and and so forth.</li>
            <li>I just miss the really  lean feeling I get from other mouthwashs.</li>
            <li>my last 3 check-ups have been complete successes--no extra dental work required.  </li>

            <li> It seems to last for a long time afterwards</li>
            <li> It is hard to get excited about mouthwash, but for me, it is especially hard to get excited about alcohol-free mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had reassuring success with Colgate Total, and since there are nights and days when I&#x27;m too tired or stressed to brush my teeth, this represents an almost-as-good substitute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Postscript:</li>
            <li> It is not possible for an average consumer to judge the manufacturer’s claims about the benefits of a mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> the evaluation of Colgate Total Mouthwash comes down to two criteria – taste  </li>
            <li> Moreover, a claim that weak certainly would not justify a 5-star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using this product for only a few days I haven&#x27;t had another sore in my mouth.</li>
            <li> After using this product for only a few days I haven&#x27;t had another sore in my mouth.</li>
            <li> But I could say the same thing about rinsing with plain water.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have seen some rather wide price ranges for this product – ranging from a low of some .21 cents per ounce to a high of .47 cents per ounce.  </li>
            <li> I use it every day and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d also like to try the other flavors.</li>
            <li> After having used it for a few weeks now though I&#x27;m not really a fan of the aftertaste.</li>
            <li> all comes down to your preference in a mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> and it really bothered her bad back teeth.</li>
            <li> I have not had any black stains after 3 weeks use.  </li>

            <li> How do you review a mouthwash?&lt;br /&gt;I mean, it is what it is. It doesn&#x27;t taste all that good as fatr as mouthwashes go, though it&#x27;s not bad per se either. Can&#x27;t say it does particularly any better or worse than normal either. It just....is. It&#x27;s not special.</li>
            <li> Did not like this. Teeth did not really feel clean, but I loved the way my breath smells. It even helped my Grandmother who has breath that. could stop a train. My daughter used this when she was visiting and it really bothered her bad back teeth. I&#x27;d not recommend it, I would recommend Crest Pro-Health Complete. MY Grandmother finished it because she will not let anything go to waste.</li>
            <li> I like this product &amp; feel safe using it. Makes my mouth feel very clean.&lt;br /&gt;A trusted product. Hope you like it, also.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for an effective mouthwash that was alcohol free because I&#x27;m tired of the \\&quot;alcohol burn\\&quot; that comes with many of the top-named brands. When I saw this new product from Colgate I thought I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new Colgate Total Advanced Pro-Shield is alcohol free and is advertised as an anti-gingivitis, anti-plaque mouthwash. The product I am reviewing is the 16.9 fluid ounce plastic bottle manufactured by the Colgate-Palmolive Company and comes with several fairly remarkable claims:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ 12-hour protection against germs, even after eating and drinking.&lt;br /&gt;~ Kills 99% of germs; kills germs that cause bad breath, gingivitis and plaque.&lt;br /&gt;~ 24/7 protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first saw the 12-hour protection guarantee and then noted the 24/7 protection promise I thought, \\&quot;Wait a minute!\\&quot; I may not be a math wiz but those two claims don&#x27;t add up. After closer observation I spotted the following recommendation: \\&quot;Use 2X daily.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of things I did like about the container were (1) the plastic cap came with a safety sealed wrapper around it so the consumer can be assured that there has been no tampering (most mouthwashes come this way, but not all do) and (2) the cap just screws off; no tricky push-it-down and turn or press-in-the-sides and turn caps. Also, if you flip the cap over so you can see the inside, there is what appears to be a cap inside of a cap. I doubt it was intended for this, but I found the inside cap could be used as a measuring cup for dispensing the right amount of mouthwash. I suspect the double-cap design is intended to prevent leakage but I thought it also worked well as a dispenser, too. Even though this was a 16.9 fluid ounce bottle, I was surprised just how quickly I used it up; even when using the nifty pseudo measuring cup I had discovered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now let&#x27;s get to the questions most consumers have when they shop for mouthwash: (1) Does it work as advertised? and (2) what does it taste like? The product I have has a flavor that Colgate-Palmolive calls \\&quot;Wintermint Rush.\\&quot; Now considering that I was looking for a mouthwash without a burning sensation or one with a soda pop taste I was hoping this \\&quot;Wintermint Rush\\&quot; also wouldn&#x27;t taste like the title...a RUSH! After trying it out it definitely didn&#x27;t have a burn or a rush. This mouthwash has a very mild, rather dull taste; no fizzing, bubbling, burning and definitely no rush; exactly what I was looking for. After rinsing I found the mouthwash left a fresh, clean taste in my mouth. But does it work like advertised? As far as I am concerned it does. My breath stayed reasonably fresh and free of an undesirable smell. I found the mouthwash left a pleasant coating on my lips, which my wife also found appealing. This new Colgate-Palmolive mouth also comes in two additional flavors: \\&quot;Peppermint Blast\\&quot; and \\&quot;Spearmint Surge.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The label comes with many of the usual list of active and inactive ingredients, warnings and and so forth. This product is intended for use by adults and children over the age of five. One recommendation I thought was excellent was children 6 years to under 12-years-old should be supervised while using this mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I was pleased with this new Colgate Total Advanced Pro-Shield mouthwash. The fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong flavor wasn&#x27;t a problem for me. The taste isn&#x27;t impressive, but then I don&#x27;t purchase mouthwash for its jazzy flavor like I would the smell of my cologne. I buy it because it works; because it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Kills germs.&lt;br /&gt;~ Significantly prevents and reduces plaque.&lt;br /&gt;~ Helps prevent gingivitis.&lt;br /&gt;~ Has no alcohol burn.&lt;br /&gt;~ Freshens breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Postscript (17 March 2014): I finished my bottle of Colgate Total Advanced Pro-Shield mouthwash this morning and I&#x27;m still impressed with this product. One additional note: I have been for decades prone to having minor, yet still annoying sores on the inside of my cheeks(not my gums) because of some prescribed medication I&#x27;m taking. After using this product for only a few days I haven&#x27;t had another sore in my mouth. This was completely unexpected; what a relief.(not my gums) because of some prescribed medication I&#x27;m taking. After using this product for only a few days I haven&#x27;t had another sore in my mouth. This was completely unexpected; what a relief.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash does it all - cleans, freshens, and protects - I just miss the really  lean feeling I get from other mouthwashs. There is no &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; of alcohol here and I leave the bathroom not feelin as sparklingly clean as I&#x27;m used too. Otherwise, it tastes fine and works a lot better than nothing!</li>
            <li> When I switched to invisalign and found out that I would need to use mouthwash after every meal, I groaned.  I&#x27;ve never been a fan and never used it regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After extensive research I stumbled on this Colgate Total brand, and although all of their colorful varieties are alcohol-free, this is by far my favorite.  The &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; is mild enough that I am able to tolerate a full 45 second rinse, and the taste is smooth and evaporates only a few minutes after use.  It leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean without an overwhelming taste that destroys the rest of my morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The purple color is also fun and helps keep the product attractive to the kids.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash is much easier to use than the harsher brands that have alcohol and a strong burning sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We liked this flavor, minty but not overpowering.  Makes your breath smell awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re hoping adding this to our toothbrushing routine improves our gum health.  I will report back after the next dentist visit.</li>
            <li> It is hard to get excited about mouthwash, but for me, it is especially hard to get excited about alcohol-free mouthwash. I tend to prefer antiseptic to antibacterial mouthwash (this one being the latter), but I was asked to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part of the reason I am skeptical of non-alcoholic mouthwashs, frankly, is that the taste on many of them just isn&#x27;t very strong. I want a strong mint, and most non-alcohiolic mouthwash I&#x27;ve tried is rather wimpy. This Colgate Total Advanced Pro-Shield Wintermint, though, is surprisingly bold in flavor. I could feel the mint in my mouth for about an hour after I used it (something I usually only get from Listerine or Act antiseptic mouthwash).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as really cleaning my teeth, I&#x27;m afraid I am going to stick with the alcohol-infused antiseptic mouthwash, mostly because my problem is not bad breath, but wanting to prevent gingivitis and the like. But if you want a good antibacterial (to head off bad breath and kill bacteria without drying your mouth out with alcohol, I would recommend the Colgate, particularly if you like a bold flavor!</li>
            <li> Even my grandkids like this stuff (if I catch them drinking it, no more mouthwash).  I&#x27;ve had reassuring success with Colgate Total, and since there are nights and days when I&#x27;m too tired or stressed to brush my teeth, this represents an almost-as-good substitute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Postscript: I hardly expected the above to be controversial.  (Hope it wasn&#x27;t something I said.)  Practically everything in the review is reportage of \\&quot;personal experience,\\&quot; which no reader is qualified to \\&quot;refute.\\&quot;  Since I gave the product 5 stars, I can only suspect that I offended a Crest fan (maybe the company&#x27;s CEO or a Proctor and Gamble shareholder).  But I happen to like Colgate Total, and my last 3 check-ups have been complete successes--no extra dental work required.  The only \\&quot;claim\\&quot; that may be inviting some controversy is the very final clause.  Would it be acceptable if I changed it to: \\&quot;On those nights when I don&#x27;t brush my teeth, rinsing with this product is \\&quot;better than nothing\\&quot;?  (I&#x27;d be happy to change to that wording. But I could say the same thing about rinsing with plain water.  Moreover, a claim that weak certainly would not justify a 5-star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notice the qualifier in my title: \\&quot;necessarily comes in 2nd place.\\&quot;  In other words, no where am I claiming that the product is a substitute for regular (and fairly rigorous) teeth-brushing!</li>
            <li> I like it. It tastes pretty good. There isn&#x27;t any mouthwash out there that tastes phenomenal but I have tasted some pretty bad ones. I would buy this one again. The bottle fit nicely into my cabinet, I&#x27;ve had issues with that before. I like the color. It&#x27;s purple and that is fun. I use it every day and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The flavor of Colgate&#x27;s Wintermint Rush Total Advanced ProShield Mouthwash is very nice and refreshing, minty without being too strong or overpowering.  Left my mouth tingling and fresh, and it&#x27;s a product I&#x27;ll buy again.  I&#x27;d also like to try the other flavors.</li>
            <li> I have used several mouthwashes for the last several years both at night and in the morning.  This product offered similar protection, but the winter mint was a very pleasant surprise and powerful enough to be a rinse and a mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;This is a product I would buy from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I usually use Listerine TotalCarePlus but that burning sensation as you&#x27;re swishing it around in your mouth can be overwhelming at times.  I decided to Try the Colgate Total Advance since it prominently said &#x27;No Alcohol&#x27;.  I do like the product.  It gives your mouth that clean feeling that brushing alone can&#x27;t give.  It doesn&#x27;t burn like the Listerine product does.  You can also have your coffee right after without that 30 minute wait.  The spearmint flavor is very refreshing and the fresh breath lasts a long time(if you don&#x27;t eat or drink coffee).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still it does not have the floride and the enamel protection that TotalCarePlus has.  I think after this bottle is consumed its back to the burn.</li>
            <li> As far as mouthwashes go, this one isn&#x27;t bad. The “Wintermint Rush” flavor smells great, and as an added bonus it doesn&#x27;t sting like the cheaper brands because it isn&#x27;t alcohol-based. After having used it for a few weeks now though I&#x27;m not really a fan of the aftertaste. My breath is fresh, but my mouth doesn&#x27;t taste great, so it&#x27;s a bit of a wash. If you like this flavor it may be a better option for you, otherwise I&#x27;d recommend going with the spearmint or trying a different brand.</li>
            <li> It is not possible for an average consumer to judge the manufacturer’s claims about the benefits of a mouthwash.  I assume that this product does in fact kill the bacteria in the mouth.  I do not believe it is possible to objectively evaluate cosmetic appearances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the evaluation of Colgate Total Mouthwash comes down to two criteria – taste  which is totally subjective and price – totally objective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion the closest product to this one is Listerine Total Care.  The Listerine I have been using is alcohol based and when you first use it, there is a sharp tinge in the mouth.  The Colgate product is alcohol free and has a much milder sensation when first used.  That could be a plus or a negative depending on your taste and preference.  I suppose that I have become accustomed to the Listerine and the Colgate seems like it is missing something – that without the sting, it is not working as well.  But for some people I suspect that the milder sensation would be a welcome change.  It does leave your mouth feeling refreshed and cleaner.  If you are looking for a milder mouthwash then you should certainly look into this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is objective. Unfortunately I have seen some rather wide price ranges for this product – ranging from a low of some .21 cents per ounce to a high of .47 cents per ounce.  But I have also seen comparable prices for the Listerine – ranging from .21 to over .40 cents per ounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I found a wide range of prices for both products, the prices from identical sources are generally comparable.  The big difference is the taste, which may or may not be a strong selling point for Colgate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It all comes down to your preference in a mouthwash.  If you are looking for an alcohol free mouthwash with a mild taste, then this might be worth trying.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this to see if my mouth could feed refreshed without burning, but overall I don&#x27;t like the taste. It seems to last for a long time afterwards and that&#x27;s enough for me to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this mouth wash amazing nor horrible.  The taste is ok, and it gave me that clean feeling.  But I didn&#x27;t feel any strong urge to buy this item again.  It does a decent job.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash gives you a great taste and no sting.  I&#x27;ve used it nearly every day for a month, and it feels great.  The bottle is enough to last 1 person over 2 months if used twice daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is forgettable, nothing fancy, but not bothersome either.</li>
            <li> I already finished the product and really liked it.  It has a clean taste and it was no problem swishing for 60 seconds. That is partially because it is alcohol free which I like. It also helps fight a varieity of potential oral problems. My wife tried it and also liked it.  I think most people would. Give it a try.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash does not burn, even after flossing.  It lingers with protection for several hours. Although not 12 hours that is refered to by Colgate.&lt;br /&gt; I have not had any black stains after 3 weeks use.  I only use it one time a day though.&lt;br /&gt;This is an okay product, just as good as any colgate I&#x27;ve used, but I can&#x27;t say I notice a huge improvement over the regular total mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  It leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean and it lasts.  I feel positive about all aspects of the product with one exception.  The tamper proof plastic on the cap doesn&#x27;t work and the bottle itself doesn&#x27;t have a seal.  It is possible for someone to open the container, tamper with it and then put the cap back on.  No one would be the wiser.  Hence, the four stars.</li>
