    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Best bronzer for those with cooler/summer skin tones, have been using for a couple years now.</li>
            <li>This bronzer has the perfect combination of colors that will give you the perfect luminous glow.</li>
            <li>Definitely a good purchase!</li>
            <li>beautiful results</li>
            <li>I have fair skin</li>
            <li>it looks fabulous on her!!  </li>
            <li>The color is nice, though and it does give a nice glow.  </li>
            <li>I am a bit concerned about buying cosmetics online as there are so many counterfeits on the market, so not having a box just kind of set a flag up.  </li>
            <li>Perfect natural looking touch of color.</li>
            <li>Great product but not the right shade for me.</li>
            <li>Love the bronzers from Too Faced.  </li>
            <li>Love this product from Two Faced.</li>
            <li>Two Faced Snow Bunny is my favorite bronzer ...</li>
            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>Love it ...</li>
            <li>It is very soft when you wear it, not cakey and it was packaged nicely!</li>
            <li>I like a color that is blends with my light olive complexion.  </li>
            <li>It gives my face a light \\&quot;glow\\&quot;...</li>
            <li>was that it was not in it&#x27;s original box.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty light in color...</li>
            <li>I really like the neutrals and the pearly color in this pallete and bought this shading based on my friends recommendation, her skin is a little bit more yellowish toned than mine, yet fair skinned like me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ben using this product for years and continue to love the natural effect it has.</li>
            <li>this color would be too light for me, and next time I will get a darker shade.</li>
            <li>But it really makes my skin glow.</li>
            <li>I love the four different colors because I can easily build up or tone down my look.</li>
            <li>It gives just the right amount of glow to my face and looks so natural.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this in the mail a few days ago, and it has already become an instant favorite of mine.</li>
            <li>Being an older person</li>
            <li>On a side note, the shipping was very fast and it came wrapped very well in bubble wrap only thing that bugged me</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, I have pale skin</li>
            <li>so I really should have gotten something with less pink and maybe more neutral tones</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t realize this pink would show up so much on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing a ton of makeup with this product because it is so lightweight yet still manages to create such a natural glow.</li>

            <li> Love the bronzers from Too Faced.  I use them together in summer and individually at other times of year.  Long lasting and not over powering color that stays put all day.</li>
            <li> Love this product from Two Faced.</li>
            <li> Best bronzer for those with cooler/summer skin tones, have been using for a couple years now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for a few days now and I&#x27;m not sure if I really like it or not- My skin has a pink undertone so I really should have gotten something with less pink and maybe more neutral tones, I didn&#x27;t realize this pink would show up so much on my skin.  The color is nice, though and it does give a nice glow.  I really like the neutrals and the pearly color in this pallete and bought this shading based on my friends recommendation, her skin is a little bit more yellowish toned than mine, yet fair skinned like me.  However I am blonde and she has red hair- it looks fabulous on her!!  I was hoping it would look the same on me, but no.  On a side note, the shipping was very fast and it came wrapped very well in bubble wrap only thing that bugged me was that it was not in it&#x27;s original box.  I&#x27;m not sure why this is.  I am a bit concerned about buying cosmetics online as there are so many counterfeits on the market, so not having a box just kind of set a flag up.  Next time I will be buying cosmetics at a store.</li>
            <li> It has a lot of shimmer/gold to it</li>
            <li> Two Faced Snow Bunny is my favorite bronzer ... I have used it  over the past 4 year.  Being an older person I like a color that is blends with my light olive complexion.  It gives my face a light \\&quot;glow\\&quot;...</li>
            <li> This is the nicest stuff made on the market.  It is very soft when you wear it, not cakey and it was packaged nicely!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this in the mail a few days ago, and it has already become an instant favorite of mine.

            <li> Love it ...beautiful results</li>
            <li> I had a feeling this color would be too light for me, and next time I will get a darker shade. But it really makes my skin glow. Takes years off my age too. Definitely a good purchase!</li>
            <li> Great product but not the right shade for me. My complexion just eats up this color.</li>
            <li> The colours of this broncer are beautiful but it came broken :(</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I have pale skin and it just adds a touch of colour. Only bad thing is that there is a bid of a shimmer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty light in color...I&#x27;d call it a powder and not a bronzer. I have fair skin</li>
