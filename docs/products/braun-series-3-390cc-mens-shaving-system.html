            <li>I try I happy</li>
            <li>The features work great.  </li>
            <li>The Braun 370 is truly a great shaver for the price.  </li>
            <li>and it still gave me a great shave, just not that close</li>
            <li>battery life is great</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a great shaving system at a great value that I hope I will be using for years to come.</li>
            <li>Great price on this razor.</li>
            <li>bought this for my son at a great price compared to retail stores.</li>
            <li>Great company.</li>
            <li>This shaver gives the cleanest shave I&#x27;ve experienced, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of shavers.  </li>
            <li>Also the cleaner is great.</li>
            <li>The automatic cleaning/charging unit is great also.</li>
            <li>He was quite happy with the performance of this product.</li>
            <li>2 passes provides great shaving results</li>
            <li>, that was a great razor too.  </li>
            <li>happy with it so</li>
            <li>Happy Consequences.&lt;br /&gt;;~PB</li>
            <li>Great recharge life, and the shaver lets you know when it need to be cleaned or recharged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It did a great job.</li>
            <li>it is really a great affordable shaver.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is very nice.</li>
            <li>The hubby loved that it cleaned itself, and it looks like a great razor, but after we got it we realized it doesn&#x27;t work as great as the Norelco does.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Conclusion: I&#x27;m happy and pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;BTW:</li>
            <li>Well I am here to tell you this shaver is AMAZING!  </li>
            <li>ITS AMAZING!</li>
            <li>best shaver in the world, 1st electric shaver that cuts  as close as any blade that i ever had, love it, would recommend to anyone .</li>
            <li>if you need it for a trim maybe but to get a nice shave, no way i have 12 oclock shadow by 10AM !</li>
            <li>Though the solution has a pleasant lemon scent, it can leave a unpleasing taste.</li>
            <li>Most electric shavers don&#x27;t feel very good on the skin, but this one was so nice!</li>
            <li>and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good shaver.</li>
            <li>So, I upgraded to the Series 3 (#390cc) and loved it.  </li>
            <li>I guess a good comparison is that the closeness the braun shaves me, is about how my face feels 3 hrs after I&#x27;ve shaved with my mach 3.</li>
            <li>Good shaver.</li>
            <li>try to buy a good shave.</li>
            <li>this give me some good feeling when shaving.</li>
            <li>nest time, want to try series 5 or 7, give me good impression.</li>
            <li>I think the man to whom I gave the thing she loved.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe, how good is it!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve owned, which is good because they are expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It shaves well, and I use the cleaning system about once a week to give it a good cleaning, lubricate the blades, and recharge.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>Norelco has a good product, it just does not work with my beard.</li>
            <li>Friend loved it.</li>
            <li>I would have laughed</li>
            <li>Good decisions :</li>
            <li>It is always good to see improvement on consumer products from year to year.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also good priceing.</li>
            <li>I got the best price at Amazon and quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the Braun and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my choice.  </li>
            <li>, I was very satisfied with the shopping</li>
            <li>Maybe not as effective as the Panasonics I have, but for the price a really good deal.  </li>
            <li>Oh well, was able to sell on E-Bay to a very nice fellow&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li>I love the self cleaning feature!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>I love that it charges and cleans just by puting it in the charger and pressing a button!  </li>
            <li>Once you use it you will never go back to a blade the Germans have once again made an excellent product, it seems everything they do is top notch from razors to guns to creating the perfect race.</li>
            <li>This is top notch shaver!</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned with a very light beard.</li>
            <li>Shaving clean, suitable for their own use, to give as gifts is also very good.</li>
            <li>I noted that the beard trimmer (which you must push up with your thumb,) felt kind of flimsy.</li>
            <li>Nicely made and feels well balanced while using.</li>
            <li>With BB&amp;B&#x27;s liberal expiration date policy on store 20% coupons, the price was as good or better than anywhere else.    </li>
            <li>The shave doesn&#x27;t compare to a blade, but it is as good or better than any shaver I&#x27;ve ever used, and I have yet to get a shaver burn from it.    </li>
            <li>It comes with a nice hard-side case for travel that should prevent any damage banging around in a suitcase.    </li>
            <li>Trimmer is handy and the cleaning/charging station is nice.</li>
            <li>I really liked the cleaning system too.  </li>
            <li>Those are my own issues/preferences, not the fault of the product.</li>
            <li>but this shaver is superior in many ways.  </li>
            <li>Comes with a travel case which comes in handy.</li>
            <li>this can be a nice electric razor for you.  </li>
            <li>The cleaner is effective, too, but I don&#x27;t know how it will hold up.</li>
            <li>Braun is my favorite but Panasonic is also good.</li>
            <li>I have used it for about a month now, and the results are spectacular.  </li>
            <li>The lemon smell is nice</li>
            <li>hurt skin to shave, feels nice, cuts well</li>
            <li>it did not do a great job of leaving a clean edge when it cut.  </li>
            <li>I use for the first time, I feel very good</li>
            <li>They do make cleaning and maintaining the unit very easy.</li>
            <li>and I think this is the best improvement by far!</li>
            <li>I like the side trimmer much better, and the clean and renew system works great.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the greatest shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>I surprised my husband and his best friend with a shaver each.</li>
            <li>It gives a good clean shave.  </li>
            <li>I think because it&#x27;s not that good a trimmer I tended to press on it to get a clean line.</li>
            <li>It just glides across your face and very smooth, close shave.  </li>
            <li>When done showering, give your face a quick touch up with a razor blade and your good to go.</li>
            <li>1 thing was good (charged quickly) but it also&lt;</li>
            <li>Good strong, cuts smooth.</li>
            <li>Huge error!  </li>
            <li>about $50 more.  </li>
            <li>My wife agrees that it does a better job.</li>
            <li>I have shaved with a Braun Electric Razor for many years and was always satisfied but</li>
            <li>And one more thing, as I ramble on, my husband also loves the fact that he can rinse the blade under the water and continue to shave.  </li>
            <li>Now he is enjoying shaving &amp; cleaning it himself.  </li>
            <li>You also need to set more time aside for shaving as compared to a razor blade.</li>
            <li>was nt to sure because of the price..  </li>
            <li>Your skin feels nice and smooth like you shaved with a stright razor.</li>
            <li>I love the self cleaner function of this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had, but I don&#x27;t go for that ever since a dermatologist explained that very close shaves welcome ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>I had used a Braun shaver for many years.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Much better than the Norelco razor it replaced.  </li>
            <li>I love this shaver, I would buy it again.</li>
            <li>I love this shaver.  </li>
            <li>However might need slightly more time.</li>
            <li>Braun shaver systems have been in my house for many years.</li>
            <li>kicker is, I like it BETTER than the top-of-the-line Braun series 7 790cc that I got after it.</li>
            <li>The series 7 does have a pivoting head, and the vibration, but in the end I GET A BETTER SHAVE from this 390cc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a good product and worth the money.</li>
            <li>Quieter, better and quicker shave.</li>
            <li>The 390cc really does a great job for an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>This will make your hairs stand up for a closer shave and will leave your skin feeling just that much better.    </li>
            <li>This shaver is OK and nothing more for me.</li>
            <li>Replaced a Norelco shaver with this hoping for better results, which I didn&#x27;t get.</li>
            <li>Much more quite and cleaning is a breeze.  </li>
            <li>THe Braun 390cc is an OK shaver.  </li>
            <li>and whatnot I&#x27;m sure.)  </li>
            <li>This make shaving easier, hence him looking better.</li>
            <li>Based on the advertising, I thought this product would be better than it is.  </li>
            <li>the deal isn&#x27;t really that great a deal.  </li>
            <li>I love a close shave.  </li>
            <li>So more than a decade ago a bought a Norelco.</li>
            <li>It‘s great！I love</li>
            <li>/&gt;This pulls hair more often than a razor.  </li>
            <li>The battery life is better also.  </li>
            <li>I love brauns because they shave close for an electric and the blades</li>
            <li>I wanted to give up on this machine so many times</li>
            <li>I would try my best to stretch the skin and attacking the hairs from different angles but there were some damn hairs that I just could not get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>that some more time has elapsed it has become quite a bit faster to shave with this</li>
            <li>but I am extremely pleased with its performance.</li>
            <li>For most of us, life feels like a movie we&#x27;ve arrived at forty-five minutes</li>
            <li>You meet someone, fall in love.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be buying any more Braun shavers.</li>
            <li>so make sure that you have the time do this.</li>
            <li>Make sure you wash your face &amp; hands thoroughly afterwards.</li>
            <li>pleased with the shaver :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad we bought another Braun.</li>
            <li>After he charged it, he did a trial run and was quite satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li>more convenient than lathering up with shaving cream and all that,</li>
            <li>Love how close this shaver gets.</li>
            <li>The price is not the lowest at the time I bought it, there were more discounts before.</li>
            <li>This product is a very good shaver I get a clean shave with a smooth and fresh feel with the cleaner</li>
            <li>clean is a nice feature</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure this will not be our last successful purchase with this brand!</li>
            <li>This is the best razor ever it cuts so close and leaves your face feeling fresh and new.  </li>
            <li>It gives a pretty good shave</li>
            <li>Shaves very smoothly and comfortably.</li>
            <li>The shave is close, its easy to use, easy to handle, I love the self cleaning add on.  </li>
            <li>The shave is more comfortable and closer.  </li>
            <li>and I love it because his face is baby smooth for days</li>
            <li>Not a straight edge purist, but a lather-up and shave with the best razor I could buy purist.</li>
            <li>but so far it&#x27;s a great improvement.</li>
            <li>but it def doesn&#x27;t give you a real close shave like razor, which can actually be good thing sometimes.</li>
            <li>but I wanted to wait a little bit before giving any reviews just to make sure he remained very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to control over my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the wife that likes the bathroom sink clean and NO wiskers in it, so I&#x27;m pleased too.</li>
            <li>Easy on my son&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning system is easy to set up, minimum of fuss.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had problems with irritation and look forward to many more good years with a close shave from a simple easy to use electric razor.</li>
            <li>First, I used to own a Norelco triple head razor.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for offering this older model, which is every bit as nice as the newer models and much more affordable.</li>
            <li>Hands down, the best shave I&#x27;ve had in years.  </li>
            <li>Very good product, sharp blade and yet soft on skin, great shave over andn over, strobgly recommened it.</li>
            <li>Yes, I am getting a good shave with my new Braun shaver.</li>
            <li>and it seems fine that way instead of cleaning every day as they suggest.</li>
            <li>Received the Braun 3-390cc about 3 weeks ago and it works fine</li>
            <li>This is a fine product.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m fine with it.</li>
            <li>This one does the job just fine.</li>
            <li>and I love how quickly it shaves my beard.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;lost power quickly!  </li>
            <li>I mean, good things do happen, sometimes beautiful things.</li>
            <li>Good buy, but can not return if do not get the order right first time..</li>
            <li>For a little over $100, it&#x27;s probably the best razor you can get at this price point.</li>
            <li>It works well with the exception you can not trim sideburns accurately and must use a safety for trimming mustache or sideburns.</li>
            <li>Clean shave and easy cleaning system.</li>
            <li>His skins feels soo smooth like a baby&#x27;s bottom.  </li>
            <li>I have a fairly light beard, but do have a problem with hairs lying close to the skin.</li>
            <li>told my wife it would be a great christmas present.</li>
            <li>saw this Braun series 3 390cc on sale cheap, so I got it.</li>
            <li>I got a close, smooth, comfortable shave from day one.</li>
            <li>I am happy with the razor for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;-Slightly</li>
            <li>/&gt;-more comfortable and lighter</li>
            <li>Overall, been happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but they do a great job of following the curves of your face.</li>
            <li>Smooth &amp; close shave each and</li>
            <li>Cuts close, quickly, quietly, comfortably.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Something important seems to be going on . . .</li>
            <li>The shaver is easy to clean, and waterproof.</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>I had been looking for a replacement for my old Braun and found this and the sale prices were to good to pass up.</li>
            <li>husband face is so nice and soft!!!</li>
            <li>so i was able to select the right replacement part.  </li>
            <li>The first shave was very comfortable and smooth and nick free.</li>
            <li>This one works just fine and is always clean because the holder is also a cleaner.  </li>
            <li>Clean, smooth shave, and easy to keep clean with the supplied cleaner.</li>
            <li>HE ABSOLUTELY LOVES IT!!!</li>
            <li>There is now a four pack that is very economical.  </li>
            <li>My new Series 3-390cc does a better job and is more comfortable to hold and use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The purchase was easy, with quick delivery.</li>
            <li>He is the type of man that can shave in the morning and have a beard at the end of the day...not a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow but a a good week worth of growth of a normal man&#x27;s beard.  </li>
            <li>Small price for a good shaver and Braun has always produced good shavers.</li>
            <li>Have purchased \\&quot;Norelco\\&quot; for past 20+ years and have been very happy with a close &amp; comfortable shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and he says it&#x27;s great -- much better than the other!</li>
            <li>I clean it manually, but the clean light doesn&#x27;t know that.</li>
            <li>It is even better than the first one.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you understand policy on all products you order first...</li>
            <li>However, you can take off the head and run both the head and the shaver under the tap to clean it on the road.</li>
            <li>Whenever I travel I leave the cradle at home and just bring the shaver and power chord and simply clean it under running water.     </li>
            <li>Clean shave without any pulling or pinching of the skin.</li>
            <li>Maybe in a couple years I&#x27;ll upgrade to Series 7, I can only image how much more amazing that shaver is.</li>
            <li>The most quiet electric shaver of its kind.  </li>
            <li>-You don&#x27;t need to clean it every time you use it.    </li>
            <li>Then, last January, my old one died and I bought a 390cc because it was the best I could afford.  </li>
            <li>It gives me a clean and close shave.  </li>
            <li>The Clean and Renew cartridges are made in Ireland.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>am ambivalent about the Clean and Renew cartridges.</li>
            <li>You can flush clean a used cartridge under a faucet.</li>
            <li>The ingredients listed on the Clean and Renew package are SD-Alcohol 40-B (Denatured Alcohol), Perfume, Limonen and Citral.</li>
            <li>it take 4 hours to charge and clean the shaver</li>
            <li>You cannot clean the Shaver with a brush.  </li>
            <li>As good or better than the Panasonic because I almost never get cuts while shaving wet, and it&#x27;s quieter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure Braun is able to make more profit by outsourcing their manufacturing to China, but not from this long time customer.  </li>
            <li>So far I am a satisfied user!</li>
            <li>I loved my first Braun electric shaver, but after about a year I had to replace the foil and cutter and have done so two more times in its short, four-year lifespan.  </li>
            <li>(I guess I translated that right!)  </li>
            <li>The cleaner is good and I clean the shaver every 2nd shave.</li>
            <li>So far, I am loving this model.</li>
            <li>This is my second Braun, good razor and of course made in Germany.</li>
            <li>I have returned many Remington MicroScreen shavers that wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge, and VERY noisy operation.</li>
            <li>(he accidentally ordered more than he intended to buy), I was very hesitant.</li>
            <li>VERY SATISFIED.WORKS BETTER</li>
            <li>Like the title says I am convinced that your happiness with this product will be directly related to two things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As of the time of me writing this review I&#x27;m still using this but am contemplating just going back to my good ole Mach 3.  </li>
            <li>Give you get a good deal I would definitely give this shaver a try.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good enough.</li>
            <li>So not bad at all.       </li>
            <li>I liked to choose when to recharge, to sometime let the shaver deplete the battery charge to the fullest before recharging to deep cycle the battery and better battery life, as the brochure states to do so for the first couple of recharges, but I cannot clean using the chemical system I must hand clean for those occasions.</li>
            <li>If you shave every day or every other day even, this razor works great.</li>
            <li>I love my new Braun electric razor!  </li>
            <li>This new one is perfect, quiet, and shaves really well.  </li>
            <li>He said that it is much better than the Braun 360 especially with being able to raise up the shaver to get around close areas.  </li>
            <li>they always left my face incredibly irritated and itchy (since I have sensitive skin) and doesn&#x27;t shave quite as close as a razor, not to mention taking thrice longer than a razor to shave you.    </li>
            <li>I received this shaver back in December of 2012 and it has done ok for the most part.  </li>
            <li>This newer model is considerably better than the older one.  </li>
            <li>You will probably be able to shave in a decent amount of time and therefore won&#x27;t have your face irritated.  </li>
            <li>i BUY THIS ITEM TO MY OLDER SON, AND HE LOVE IT</li>
            <li>Overall I am very happy with all of my Braun shavers and look forward to what the next 6 years will bring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you need something to work quick then look somewhere else.</li>
            <li>he likes it very much and used smoothly.</li>
            <li>Very fast service from Amazon too!</li>
            <li>The clean and renew cartridges supposedly last a month, but mine is still going strong, and the level indicates that i&#x27;ll get a couple more weeks out of it.  </li>
            <li>I was happy when he told me it cut&lt;br /&gt;well, didn&#x27;t cause any pulling or pain (as a previous norelco had done) and seemed&lt;br /&gt;genuinely</li>
            <li>Thanks Braun for making a product that is so easy to use and shaves so closely.</li>
            <li>Be aware of this policy before purchasing!</li>
            <li>this is my first purchase from this company, and I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li>But then again, being able to dry shave for 10 mins while in bed is a lot better than having to take 5 mins to go to the bathroom, put shaving cream on, shave and then cleanup after.</li>
            <li>This could have been easily avoided if they&#x27;d actually tried using the product a bit more.</li>
            <li>and the shave was very close and smooth.</li>
            <li>This shaver is smooth and fast.  </li>
            <li>Works great for me, I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard</li>
            <li>It makes him look so young and sexy.  </li>
            <li>is 1000 better than my old one.  </li>
            <li>My old $20 Remington worked much better.  </li>
            <li>but there&#x27;s nothing like a freshly cleaned shaver.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money</li>
            <li>Well worth the money either way.</li>
            <li>more, the price is reasonable and the delivery is fast.</li>
            <li>You fall out of love, or perhaps the other person falls out of love with you.</li>
            <li>It is quiet, much quieter than my old Braun, and I love the cleaning system, which had better extend the life of this shaver and battery for the full, advertised six years!  </li>
            <li>My face got used to it right away</li>
            <li>This one feels just right to me.  </li>
            <li>It is right on the package that the shaver and case are made in China.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sometimes if you don&#x27;t hit the button right, instead of releasing the razor you start the cleaning process.</li>
            <li>Take care because one of the video reviews is for two products, one of which CAN be used &#x27;right in the shower&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Even between cleanings, with the shaver in the station, the head will have a nice clean \\&quot;lemony\\&quot; smell, due to the proximity of the cleaning solution.</li>
            <li>far, I am loving my new Braun Series 3-390cc Shaving System.</li>
            <li>Having been a loyal owner of many Remington shavers for the past 20 years, I&#x27;m definately sold on this shaver, and glad I made the switch.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a shower safe version, pay a little more.</li>
            <li>Used the new shaver this morning and it was so smooth</li>
            <li>The feel is a bit more harsh than my Norelco, but it doesn&#x27;t give me any more razor burn.</li>
            <li>a good shaver I&#x27;ve been using for about a year and half.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>In a year I suppose I will purchase a new cleaning cartridge, since the filter in the original will probably be clogged up.  </li>
            <li>I really like the ability to clean the shaver and it seems to lubricate the shaver real well.</li>
            <li>the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the message is clear, I am 100% satisfied and I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dave</li>
            <li>Could have a little more power but overall good.</li>
            <li>While this new one is not built nearly as well as my old one (much more plastic, not as powerful), it works well and the price at Amazon was great - almost 50% less than Walmart.</li>
            <li>It comes out clean and looking new every time</li>
            <li>First shave:  </li>
            <li>Anybody that wants the Braun can have mine!</li>
            <li>I continue to be a consistent Braun user</li>
            <li>After my first shave with the 390</li>
            <li>To this point product is performing exactly as represented.  </li>
            <li>Still, that was a respectable amount of time for the razor to last.  </li>
            <li>charges fast!  </li>
            <li>While it does a close shave, if you have a more ample face, you will be running it over and over again to get those last</li>
            <li>Just shave regularly and you will love it like I do.</li>
            <li>The first charge lasted about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>It gives you a pretty close shave, almost as close to my gilette mach 3.</li>
            <li>I have had Remington (first electric shaver).</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t even ask me about the cleaning system, you better be well off financially to support that cleaning system.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying the 3 pack of cartridges for now, but may try the cheap refill method when the machine hits one year old.  </li>
            <li>Bought this last year for my husband but wanted to wait awhile before leaving a review to make sure it was a good product for longer than a few months.</li>
            <li>If I had been aware of this NEVER, NEVER would I have ordered this product.</li>
            <li>And although I can&#x27;t get as close as with a razor, shaving has never left my skin feeling better.    </li>
            <li>This Razor is now replacing what was a great long lasting braun product with hopefully another.</li>
            <li>My old shaver gave me a close and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>This is the first Braun Shaver I have used.</li>
            <li>It shaves exactly as I would expect an electric shaver to and does so without irretating my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first is the trimmer, which is pretty flimsy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did because the Norelco I got just didn&#x27;t have enough power like these Braun shavers.</li>
            <li>It is the first electric shaver I have owned in over 10 years.  </li>
            <li>While it does an OK job on short hairs, it takes forever to pick up longer hairs on the neck and face region or, one has to resort to the trimmer or a blade.</li>
            <li>Cleans under hot tap water.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it is not expensive but clear and  smooth</li>
            <li>however this was exactly that to close</li>
            <li>The first one lasted about eight years until the battery no longer held a charge.</li>
            <li>This is the first electric shaver I tried after 30 years.</li>
            <li>I was hoping that my facial hair would adjust and it would get better, but after 2 months it still has this issue.</li>
            <li>Some were good and lasted a few years, but eventually broke.</li>
            <li>had a older version of the razor (about ten years old) thought it was really good</li>
            <li>When I went to get a return label I am not allowed due to Hazardous Material.</li>
            <li>And lastly, the sideburn/hair trimmer doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job, it seems it can only cut doing an up motion and doesn&#x27;t that well.  </li>
            <li>This one does shave fine but the cleaning method is not very user friendly.  </li>
            <li>I love the cleaning technology and the long charge life.  </li>
            <li>This model&#x27;s trim blade mows them down nicely.  </li>
            <li>I think that if you clean it with the little included brush it should be good enough.</li>
            <li>The motor is quiet and sounds strong.</li>
            <li>Also, this thing won&#x27;t cut at certain angles.  </li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I clean the Braun shaver every other shave when the cleaning light is on.  </li>
            <li>The initial cost is more and the shave doesn&#x27;t last as long as a blade, but for me, being able to put away the styptic pencil makes it all worth while.</li>
            <li>Needless to say he loves his shaver and also thanks amazon for messing up my order and giving me something better! :)</li>
            <li>Takes a long time to shave and often misses areas - this compared to an older Braun I had for years until the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge any more.</li>
            <li>First of all, the shaver cannot be charged in the cleaning cradle, unless you are actually using a clean cycle.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m most likely going to just buy a replacement foil and blades for my older Brauninstead of buying a new one again for a while.</li>
            <li>And now I&#x27;m so happy with it that I&#x27;ve been using it everyday, sometimes even twice a day, for the last 2 months.</li>
            <li>silken smooth with only 2 passes.  </li>
            <li>Overall the fit and finish of the Braun is excellant.</li>
            <li>The shave is quiet, smooth, reasonably close and the shaver is more compact than I expected.</li>
            <li>Thanks everyone.</li>
            <li>After about a week, I learned how to use it so that I am getting a very close shave in comparison.</li>
            <li>I had a Braun 3441 (I believe) series shaver for 8 years and really thought it was a quality product.  </li>
            <li>It was just a slab of plastic that didn&#x27;t seem very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>This shaver works very well for a close shave.</li>
            <li>You dont have to go over the same spot a thousand times like the cheap ones.</li>
            <li>I expected more for my hundred bucks.    </li>
            <li>Purchased this for my son and he absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>The Braun Series 3-390cc gives a fast close shave.  </li>
            <li>I really like the self cleaning feature.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Do identify specific attributes (e.g. comfort &amp; fit of a shirt or the battery life of a camera) and whether they met your expectations.</li>
            <li>much</li>
            <li>And, when you see what&#x27;s in the used cleaning solution after cleaning, you realize it really does work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so, I found this one which is reasonably priced and has held up for over a year.</li>
            <li>and I threw the whole package out...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use a power outlet that my wife needs to do all she wants to do each day,</li>
            <li>much too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really have to grind away from every angle to get them.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I will say this:  if you have a light to moderate beard</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>Refill cleaners are readily available at the local store.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if he really needed another one</li>
            <li>The foil head is very flexible and lets me get all areas of my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t want to pay that much.</li>
            <li>Does not cut real close.</li>
            <li>the cleaning system really works.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not using the whole cleaning system yet, I just run it under the water every once in a while.</li>
            <li>Not too much need for cleaner &amp; solution&lt;br</li>
            <li>my father and i like it very much&lt;br /&gt;may</li>
            <li>It produced a very close shave.</li>
            <li>I have always shaved my whole life with a Mach 3 and shaving cream etc, was fighting some razor burn and decided to give this a</li>
            <li>I think it goes through the cleaning solution too fast.</li>
            <li>Just as described, this is what I want at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>我以为会毫不费力的就剃很干净，但还是会有黑胡茬。质量感觉是不错的。Do explain why you liked or disliked this</li>
            <li>* did give a close shave for the larger areas such as the cheeks (on my face!)&lt;br /&gt;* Nice contoured case for the shaver for travel use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BAD:&lt;br /</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m still having trouble catching all the hairs on my neck.  </li>
            <li>you willmore than likely head back to the good old reliable manual</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to get a straight electric razor for fears it wouldn&#x27;t be able to get the jawline well enough like a triple action razor.  </li>
            <li>luckily I got the first 2 at stores where i could take the product back and not return it by mail.  </li>
            <li>The shaver \\&quot;Clean me\\&quot; light comes on after every two or three shaves, so if you clean/charge it every few days, it will be ready to go when you have to travel.</li>
            <li>working properly, it gives a great shave, but three cutter/foil units in 9 months is poor, especially since I could easily go a year or more before having to replace the cutter on prior Braun models I have owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>like all the other electric razor, burns your skin shaves ok and</li>
            <li>I have never spent so much money on a razor but the promising reviews had me thinking that this may provide the golden shave...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through many electric shavers, from the Norelco rotary shavers to other Braun foil shavers.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by how long a cleaning cycle takes (4 hours I think), but that is OK if you plan ahead.</li>
            <li>I leave the facial hair on my jawline and this shaver would not leave a clean edge, even when it was fully charged and cleaned.&lt;br</li>
            <li>* Did not give a clean shave on the facial hair on my throat area.  </li>
            <li>Granted, I&#x27;ve only had mine for a month or so, but I don&#x27;t clean it</li>
            <li>The previous model had a rigid foil, this one has the Smart Foil which allows the foil to better meet the contours of your face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for about 5 weeks, and am in the process of running the battery full down before recharge three times, as recommended, to get full capacity.</li>
            <li>I really like it and highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li>This is my second one and they are the work horse of the braun shavers, specially for this price.</li>
            <li>I shaved about 3 minutes a day for 18 days after the first charge and not a heavy beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First thing I noticed the extremely loud running noise.</li>
            <li>The shaver doesn&#x27;t have nearly the power as my old razor, you have to go over your face 2-3 times more often to get the same shave and</li>
            <li>I broke it pretty early on trimming my side burns.</li>
            <li>overall is not a clean good shave.</li>
            <li>would recomend this product to anyone who wants to spend a little less time shaving and who wants a great shaving experience.</li>
            <li>smooth, fast, and extremely close shave, thanks braun</li>
            <li>He told me three times this weekend how much he loves his new razor.  </li>
            <li>nothing more, nothing less.  </li>
            <li>I had an older model of this razor for about 6 years.  </li>
            <li>As with any electric shaver, it takes time to figure out which direction to move the shaver for a particular section of your beard.</li>
            <li>the years I have slowing been upgrading to better more expensive units as the pervious ones breakdown.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>am glad to report, this is the most expensive shaver I have ever purchased</li>
            <li>you do want a super close shave, simply just use a razor after using the 390cc.</li>
            <li>The cleaning solution does become stagnant / not so nice smelling after two months, so I just empty it out and replace the fluid with 91% isopropyl and Lemon Extract.  </li>
            <li>I see that on Amazon&#x27;s top-seller personal hygiene list the only Braun that makes the top-100 is the 7-790, which is the $250 top of the line that some (including me) can&#x27;t afford.  </li>
            <li>I notice the price is only ten more than I paid so</li>
            <li>This shaver is replacing an older Series 3 that I have been using for about 4 years or so.  </li>
            <li>I was stretching my skin as suggested in the manual and applying decent pressure.  </li>
            <li>In particular, the trim blade cuts better on this model than on the previous one.</li>
            <li>The older one pulled and tugged on eyebrows.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;d had a Braun older series</li>
            <li>I thought I was getting a high performance shaver.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have used this for a month now and perhaps my expectations are too high.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Braun set up the new design to force us to buy fluid more regularly.</li>
            <li>Of course, the title may not be saying much, since I use a shaver until it nearly falls apart, replacing the rechargeable batteries as they die.</li>
            <li>So basically I shave, then hang it in it&#x27;s cradle to clean, charge, and dry.</li>
            <li>I bought this when it was deal of the day and based on some great reviews I felt I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li>I probably will only rarely use the cleaning system.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this one will last me just as long or even longer.  </li>
            <li>Normally I don&#x27;t give my written opinions, but</li>
            <li>The normal shaver works still</li>
            <li>I am pleased that there have wasted their money.</li>
            <li>With a normal non-electric razor there is not 1/2 month acclimation time for your face.  </li>
            <li>Our son has MS and needed a shaver that prevented the nicks made by a normal razor.</li>
            <li>I just received this new one as a gift and the shaving experience</li>
            <li>I ordered a new replacement screen and blades for my Remington</li>
            <li>Your face has to adjust to the new type shaver.</li>
            <li>I am still learning to shave with this new feature</li>
            <li>before.&lt;br /&gt;Bought a new \\&quot;Norelco\\&quot; with all the bells and whistles including the cleaner and cleaning</li>
            <li>But this new 3-390cc works even</li>
            <li>The new ones do not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it was time to invest in a new one.</li>
            <li>Also, this newer shaver stays a bit wet after finishing the 4 hour clean cycle.  </li>
            <li>and I expected to be clean shaven every work day.  </li>
            <li>I can see where routine cleaning and lubricating is important but it leaves the head wet even after it&#x27;s all  done with the complete cycle.</li>
            <li>But he was persistent and I thought, for that kind of money I guess the shaver should be somewhat decent, at the very least it should be something I could use when I travel and don&#x27;t have the luxury to use shaving cream and all that.       </li>
            <li>A previous Braun I owned worked fine ~15</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money and look forward to using this shaver for a long time.</li>
            <li>Since Amazon no longer is willing to speak wityh a customer through the phone system, I&#x27;ll probably not be doing business in the future.</li>
            <li>Amazon send me a second one which worked well for the first couple of months then</li>
            <li>Braun makes more \\&quot;advanced\\&quot; and more expensive series 5 and 7, but for the money (especially the Amazon price)</li>
            <li>The entire system really works!</li>
            <li>far as the shave goes, you get a close shave, specially with the wet shave.</li>
            <li>Other than that the things cuts really close on the rest of the face, and leaves it almost as smooth as a traditional razor.</li>
            <li>I had a need for a new shaver since the old one was literally falling apart.</li>
            <li>Because my old Braun shaver was not working and the blade area broke, I purchased this new Braun shaver.  </li>
            <li>It worked adequately enough before the cleanign stopped working, and I had great luck with previous Braun shavers, so I will get something in the 7 series and hope it lasts the typical 6-7 years I&#x27;d been getting out of their products (</li>
            <li>My old Braun razor was a beast this one not as strong and leaves a lot of little hairs</li>
            <li>Anyway, after many years being a Braun fan, I am now switching loyalty to a Panasonic wet and dry model.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an adequate shaver, neither the best nor the worst I&#x27;ve had in terms of closeness of shave and speed.</li>
            <li>It works very well for about 90% of my face, but the other 10% I end up having to use a traditional razor to clean up.</li>
            <li>Previously had the three circle blade electric razors and so far has cut and held up the same or better.</li>
            <li>razor burn is far less than it used to be, and I think it will only get better once my skin gets used to the electric razor.  </li>
            <li>Not so, the first shave and all since have been better than any other razor that I have ever used; I have a heavy beard bye</li>
            <li>so I have decided to clean it that method about once a week or when the battery goes down.</li>
            <li>The only reason I did not rate it a 5 is the trimmer could be a little better or could have a couple of difference sizes or something which would bump it up to 5 star.</li>
            <li>My old one was a different model and lasted a whole month on a charge, this one I have to charge every 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I went from an avg old Phillips rotary shaver to the 390 and</li>
            <li>I found that it was very flimsy construction being held in place by two tiny plastic pegs.  </li>
            <li>Oh, I should tell you that my husband is a 54-year old man, who grows facial hair fast and has sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The shaver doesn&#x27;t perform as well as my old Braun that is 5 years old.  </li>
            <li>However, the biggest problem thus far is that the shaver will not charge in the cleaning station, despite the manual&#x27;s assurance that it will charge in the cleaning</li>
            <li>so you save considerably.</li>
            <li>My face feels ultra smooth everyday.  </li>
            <li>When it finally needed replacement, I wanted to get another Braun, and I chose this model because of its features and reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>(Thanks for the solution goes to someone who posted this earlier.)</li>
            <li>I went to use the trimmer and when it opened, it popped completely off.  </li>
            <li>My old Braun of 6+ years hasn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Then I shaved with a regular manual razor that cost so much money for the re fills.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>My old Braun&#x27;s battery got</li>
            <li>I had to get the Braun Series 3-390cc to replace my old braun 5565.  </li>
            <li>I have only had this shaver for a few days but so far I love it.  </li>
            <li>I have been saving money by doing it the old fashion way.  </li>
            <li>Still, it should not have stopped this early.</li>
            <li>I shave in about 4-5 minutes (completely) and</li>
            <li>Shave almost as close as I got with the old method.</li>
            <li>am very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>The key ingredient is denatured alcohol which is really inexpensive.</li>
            <li>WHERE near that of a $1.00 disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a really sensitive face.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, so far it is def.</li>
            <li>but this was an unexpected surprise.  </li>
            <li>old braun...tried it yet again....</li>
            <li>bad thing is i find the cleaning solution to have a very strong lemon scent, too strong</li>
            <li>Shortly, when I was trying to see if I could replace the cutter (or the entire pop-up section,) the plastic slab snapped right off.   </li>
            <li>It took me 3 tries to get the right razor head.  </li>
            <li>I like the cleaning as needed but was suprized that the stand will not clean as a choice, but appears to clean and charge any time the button is activated with the shaver in the stand.</li>
            <li>understand that different skin and hair types make a difference with the performance of shavers in general, and this model really just got me by...</li>
            <li>I would think I could get a decent close shave...not the case I can go over and over the same areas on my face a number of times and the shave is NO</li>
            <li>The Braun was highly rated by Consumers reports, came with a 60 day money back guarantee and a 2 year warranty.</li>
            <li>I never thought I would like the cleaning/charging aspect of the new shavers but this one is simple to use and has far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>Holds a charge for a long time and you can shave with it right up until it finally quits.</li>
            <li>The more expensive models shave a little better</li>
            <li>It takes me a little longer to shave with this because of how many times you have to go over the same area, especially the curve of your jaw / neck area.  </li>
            <li>It was in pretty rough shape.  </li>
            <li>My husband takes out the plastic thing and just fills it with normal rubbing alcohol and water and it works just the same.</li>
            <li>Regardless, that shaver is still kicking but last night, this new 390CC Series 3 shaver broke on me.  </li>
            <li>have to take mine out about once a week to charge it, overall a minor inconvenience, but for the money, should not have happen in the first place.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one is Chinese made and does not shave nearly as well as my old one.</li>
            <li>It worked early on, but it no longer slides far enough to push the heads out of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I drop it in the cleaner/charger daily, but don&#x27;t plan to push the charger connection down until it needs cleaning, once I&#x27;ve gone through my full discharge cycles.</li>
            <li>(no, it&#x27;s not manual-razor close, but as close as you can get without major irritation).</li>
            <li>This is a major one.</li>
            <li>, so the first few weeks shaving with this thing it took me a pretty long time to shave my face with it.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought the cleaning kit would be a hazzle and would not last very long.</li>
            <li>Right down to bare skin.  </li>
            <li>He also doesn&#x27;t like to clean his shavers that much, so I usually do it.</li>
            <li>I only used the cleaning system once so far since the battery does charge when cleaning</li>
            <li>With the 390, I never use the trimmer, except for an occasional trim of my nearly non-existent side burns.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 51 years young, and I&#x27;ve been shaving since 1978 with a Norelco Rotatract - yes it still works after 35 years and only one rebuild/comb &amp; cutter replacement!  </li>
            <li>, I never use the trimmer, except for an occasional trim of my nearly non-existent side burns.</li>
            <li>I decided after 30 years I&#x27;d had enough of my old graying beard.  </li>
            <li>I barely felt it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I went back to my OLD norelco...</li>
            <li>This experience was both worse and more costly.</li>
            <li>When cleaning, the cleaning light stays on long enough for the alcohol-based cleaning fluid to evaporate, indicating that the shaver is dry enough to use.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, with less than 12 months of use on this one, being extremely careful with the pop-up trimmer because of the warnings, an internal plastic bit snapped and it popped off.</li>
            <li>Seriously, for a razor that costs this much, it should be built a little more sturdy than this.</li>
            <li>since I personally consider other opinions, I felt like I should tell you how much my husband loves this one!  </li>
            <li>I am still getting accumulated to the machine, is is very much different and the same at the same time as my old on a(7 years old).</li>
            <li>The other on-site reviews were very helpful.</li>
            <li>At least once or twice a week I HAD to use a blade shaver to clean up.</li>
            <li>This is clearly a long-term generic design weakness with Braun shavers, and totally unacceptable in a high-priced brand.</li>
            <li>The individual floating heads were odd at first</li>
            <li>This razor was purchased to follow a long line of Braun razors which have grown old rather than just dying.  </li>
            <li>I am a man with a sensitive neck area and there have not experienced any razor burn (which i have experienced in the past with other shavers and razors).</li>
            <li>and I wanted to cycle the battery a few times first.  </li>
            <li>I bought the first one and when it arrived the battery was completly dead and would not charge at all.</li>
            <li>This should cut down on irritation from the razor since it wont have to cut as much.     </li>
            <li>I am not getting the close shave that I had expected with the new Braun Series 3-390cc Men&#x27;s shaving system.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I have a new face; my skin is soft and moisterised where it used to be dry and rough feeling after shaving.</li>
            <li>one is much improved over the previous one.</li>
            <li>For me to get as near as possible to a close shave (not terribly near, either)</li>
            <li>I have a fairly thick beard that grows in rather quickly</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t shave daily and anyone who has used electric razors before can tell you that long hairs can be a major issue.</li>
            <li>I read warnings in the reviews when I bought it that the plastic bits in the pop-up trimmer tend to snap easily and render the shaver useless, and that&#x27;s exactly how my previous Braun shaver died several years ago.</li>

            <li> Great company.</li>
            <li> This shaver gives the cleanest shave I&#x27;ve experienced, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of shavers.  </li>
            <li> Also the cleaner is great.</li>
            <li> The automatic cleaning/charging unit is great also.</li>

            <li> Great recharge life, and the shaver lets you know when it need to be cleaned or recharged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did a great job.</li>
            <li> it is really a great affordable shaver.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is very nice.</li>
            <li> The hubby loved that it cleaned itself, and it looks like a great razor, but after we got it we realized it doesn&#x27;t work as great as the Norelco does.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Conclusion: I&#x27;m happy and pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;BTW:</li>
            <li> Well I am here to tell you this shaver is AMAZING!  </li>
            <li> ITS AMAZING!</li>
            <li> best shaver in the world, 1st electric shaver that cuts  as close as any blade that i ever had, love it, would recommend to anyone .</li>
            <li> if you need it for a trim maybe but to get a nice shave, no way i have 12 oclock shadow by 10AM !</li>
            <li> Though the solution has a pleasant lemon scent, it can leave a unpleasing taste.</li>
            <li> Most electric shavers don&#x27;t feel very good on the skin, but this one was so nice!</li>
            <li> and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good shaver.</li>
            <li> So, I upgraded to the Series 3 (#390cc) and loved it.  </li>
            <li> I guess a good comparison is that the closeness the braun shaves me, is about how my face feels 3 hrs after I&#x27;ve shaved with my mach 3.</li>
            <li> Good shaver.</li>
            <li> try to buy a good shave.</li>
            <li> this give me some good feeling when shaving.</li>
            <li> nest time, want to try series 5 or 7, give me good impression.</li>
            <li> I think the man to whom I gave the thing she loved.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe, how good is it!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve owned, which is good because they are expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It shaves well, and I use the cleaning system about once a week to give it a good cleaning, lubricate the blades, and recharge.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> Norelco has a good product, it just does not work with my beard.</li>
            <li> Friend loved it.</li>
            <li> I would have laughed</li>
            <li> Good decisions :</li>
            <li> It is always good to see improvement on consumer products from year to year.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also good priceing.</li>
            <li> I got the best price at Amazon and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the Braun and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my choice.  </li>
            <li> , I was very satisfied with the shopping</li>
            <li> Maybe not as effective as the Panasonics I have, but for the price a really good deal.  </li>
            <li> Oh well, was able to sell on E-Bay to a very nice fellow&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li> I love the self cleaning feature!</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> I love that it charges and cleans just by puting it in the charger and pressing a button!  </li>
            <li> Once you use it you will never go back to a blade the Germans have once again made an excellent product, it seems everything they do is top notch from razors to guns to creating the perfect race.</li>
            <li> This is top notch shaver!</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned with a very light beard.</li>
            <li> Shaving clean, suitable for their own use, to give as gifts is also very good.</li>
            <li> I noted that the beard trimmer (which you must push up with your thumb,) felt kind of flimsy.</li>
            <li> Nicely made and feels well balanced while using.</li>
            <li> With BB&amp;B&#x27;s liberal expiration date policy on store 20% coupons, the price was as good or better than anywhere else.    </li>
            <li> The shave doesn&#x27;t compare to a blade, but it is as good or better than any shaver I&#x27;ve ever used, and I have yet to get a shaver burn from it.    </li>
            <li> It comes with a nice hard-side case for travel that should prevent any damage banging around in a suitcase.    </li>
            <li> Trimmer is handy and the cleaning/charging station is nice.</li>
            <li> I really liked the cleaning system too.  </li>
            <li> Those are my own issues/preferences, not the fault of the product.</li>
            <li> but this shaver is superior in many ways.  </li>
            <li> Comes with a travel case which comes in handy.</li>
            <li> this can be a nice electric razor for you.  </li>
            <li> The cleaner is effective, too, but I don&#x27;t know how it will hold up.</li>
            <li> Braun is my favorite but Panasonic is also good.</li>
            <li> I have used it for about a month now, and the results are spectacular.  </li>
            <li> The lemon smell is nice</li>
            <li> hurt skin to shave, feels nice, cuts well</li>
            <li> it did not do a great job of leaving a clean edge when it cut.  </li>
            <li> I use for the first time, I feel very good</li>
            <li> They do make cleaning and maintaining the unit very easy.</li>
            <li> and I think this is the best improvement by far!</li>
            <li> I like the side trimmer much better, and the clean and renew system works great.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the greatest shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> I surprised my husband and his best friend with a shaver each.</li>
            <li> It gives a good clean shave.  </li>
            <li> I think because it&#x27;s not that good a trimmer I tended to press on it to get a clean line.</li>
            <li> It just glides across your face and very smooth, close shave.  </li>
            <li> When done showering, give your face a quick touch up with a razor blade and your good to go.</li>
            <li> 1 thing was good (charged quickly) but it also&lt;</li>
            <li> Good strong, cuts smooth.</li>
            <li> Huge error!  </li>
            <li> about $50 more.  </li>
            <li> My wife agrees that it does a better job.</li>
            <li> I have shaved with a Braun Electric Razor for many years and was always satisfied but</li>
            <li> And one more thing, as I ramble on, my husband also loves the fact that he can rinse the blade under the water and continue to shave.  </li>
            <li> Now he is enjoying shaving &amp; cleaning it himself.  </li>
            <li> You also need to set more time aside for shaving as compared to a razor blade.</li>
            <li> was nt to sure because of the price..  </li>
            <li> Your skin feels nice and smooth like you shaved with a stright razor.</li>
            <li> I love the self cleaner function of this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had, but I don&#x27;t go for that ever since a dermatologist explained that very close shaves welcome ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> I had used a Braun shaver for many years.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Much better than the Norelco razor it replaced.  </li>
            <li> I love this shaver, I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver.  </li>
            <li> However might need slightly more time.</li>
            <li> Braun shaver systems have been in my house for many years.</li>
            <li> kicker is, I like it BETTER than the top-of-the-line Braun series 7 790cc that I got after it.</li>
            <li> The series 7 does have a pivoting head, and the vibration, but in the end I GET A BETTER SHAVE from this 390cc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a good product and worth the money.</li>
            <li> Quieter, better and quicker shave.</li>
            <li> The 390cc really does a great job for an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> This will make your hairs stand up for a closer shave and will leave your skin feeling just that much better.    </li>
            <li> This shaver is OK and nothing more for me.</li>
            <li> Replaced a Norelco shaver with this hoping for better results, which I didn&#x27;t get.</li>
            <li> Much more quite and cleaning is a breeze.  </li>
            <li> THe Braun 390cc is an OK shaver.  </li>
            <li> and whatnot I&#x27;m sure.)  </li>
            <li> This make shaving easier, hence him looking better.</li>
            <li> Based on the advertising, I thought this product would be better than it is.  </li>
            <li> the deal isn&#x27;t really that great a deal.  </li>
            <li> I love a close shave.  </li>
            <li> So more than a decade ago a bought a Norelco.</li>
            <li> It‘s great！I love</li>
            <li> /&gt;This pulls hair more often than a razor.  </li>
            <li> The battery life is better also.  </li>
            <li> I love brauns because they shave close for an electric and the blades</li>
            <li> I wanted to give up on this machine so many times</li>
            <li> I would try my best to stretch the skin and attacking the hairs from different angles but there were some damn hairs that I just could not get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that some more time has elapsed it has become quite a bit faster to shave with this</li>
            <li> but I am extremely pleased with its performance.</li>
            <li> For most of us, life feels like a movie we&#x27;ve arrived at forty-five minutes</li>
            <li> You meet someone, fall in love.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be buying any more Braun shavers.</li>
            <li> so make sure that you have the time do this.</li>
            <li> Make sure you wash your face &amp; hands thoroughly afterwards.</li>
            <li> pleased with the shaver :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad we bought another Braun.</li>
            <li> After he charged it, he did a trial run and was quite satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li> more convenient than lathering up with shaving cream and all that,</li>
            <li> Love how close this shaver gets.</li>
            <li> The price is not the lowest at the time I bought it, there were more discounts before.</li>
            <li> This product is a very good shaver I get a clean shave with a smooth and fresh feel with the cleaner</li>
            <li> clean is a nice feature</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure this will not be our last successful purchase with this brand!</li>
            <li> This is the best razor ever it cuts so close and leaves your face feeling fresh and new.  </li>
            <li> It gives a pretty good shave</li>
            <li> Shaves very smoothly and comfortably.</li>
            <li> The shave is close, its easy to use, easy to handle, I love the self cleaning add on.  </li>
            <li> The shave is more comfortable and closer.  </li>
            <li> and I love it because his face is baby smooth for days</li>
            <li> Not a straight edge purist, but a lather-up and shave with the best razor I could buy purist.</li>
            <li> but so far it&#x27;s a great improvement.</li>
            <li> but it def doesn&#x27;t give you a real close shave like razor, which can actually be good thing sometimes.</li>
            <li> but I wanted to wait a little bit before giving any reviews just to make sure he remained very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to control over my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the wife that likes the bathroom sink clean and NO wiskers in it, so I&#x27;m pleased too.</li>
            <li> Easy on my son&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning system is easy to set up, minimum of fuss.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had problems with irritation and look forward to many more good years with a close shave from a simple easy to use electric razor.</li>
            <li> First, I used to own a Norelco triple head razor.  </li>
            <li> Thank you for offering this older model, which is every bit as nice as the newer models and much more affordable.</li>
            <li> Hands down, the best shave I&#x27;ve had in years.  </li>
            <li> Very good product, sharp blade and yet soft on skin, great shave over andn over, strobgly recommened it.</li>
            <li> Yes, I am getting a good shave with my new Braun shaver.</li>
            <li> and it seems fine that way instead of cleaning every day as they suggest.</li>
            <li> Received the Braun 3-390cc about 3 weeks ago and it works fine</li>
            <li> This is a fine product.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m fine with it.</li>
            <li> This one does the job just fine.</li>
            <li> and I love how quickly it shaves my beard.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;lost power quickly!  </li>
            <li> I mean, good things do happen, sometimes beautiful things.</li>
            <li> Good buy, but can not return if do not get the order right first time..</li>
            <li> For a little over $100, it&#x27;s probably the best razor you can get at this price point.</li>
            <li> It works well with the exception you can not trim sideburns accurately and must use a safety for trimming mustache or sideburns.</li>
            <li> Clean shave and easy cleaning system.</li>
            <li> His skins feels soo smooth like a baby&#x27;s bottom.  </li>
            <li> I have a fairly light beard, but do have a problem with hairs lying close to the skin.</li>
            <li> told my wife it would be a great christmas present.</li>
            <li> saw this Braun series 3 390cc on sale cheap, so I got it.</li>
            <li> I got a close, smooth, comfortable shave from day one.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the razor for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;-Slightly</li>
            <li> /&gt;-more comfortable and lighter</li>
            <li> Overall, been happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but they do a great job of following the curves of your face.</li>
            <li> Smooth &amp; close shave each and</li>
            <li> Cuts close, quickly, quietly, comfortably.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Something important seems to be going on . . .</li>
            <li> The shaver is easy to clean, and waterproof.</li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a replacement for my old Braun and found this and the sale prices were to good to pass up.</li>
            <li> husband face is so nice and soft!!!</li>
            <li> so i was able to select the right replacement part.  </li>
            <li> The first shave was very comfortable and smooth and nick free.</li>
            <li> This one works just fine and is always clean because the holder is also a cleaner.  </li>
            <li> Clean, smooth shave, and easy to keep clean with the supplied cleaner.</li>
            <li> HE ABSOLUTELY LOVES IT!!!</li>
            <li> There is now a four pack that is very economical.  </li>
            <li> My new Series 3-390cc does a better job and is more comfortable to hold and use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The purchase was easy, with quick delivery.</li>
            <li> He is the type of man that can shave in the morning and have a beard at the end of the day...not a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow but a a good week worth of growth of a normal man&#x27;s beard.  </li>
            <li> Small price for a good shaver and Braun has always produced good shavers.</li>
            <li> Have purchased \\&quot;Norelco\\&quot; for past 20+ years and have been very happy with a close &amp; comfortable shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and he says it&#x27;s great -- much better than the other!</li>
            <li> I clean it manually, but the clean light doesn&#x27;t know that.</li>
            <li> It is even better than the first one.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you understand policy on all products you order first...</li>
            <li> However, you can take off the head and run both the head and the shaver under the tap to clean it on the road.</li>
            <li> Whenever I travel I leave the cradle at home and just bring the shaver and power chord and simply clean it under running water.     </li>
            <li> Clean shave without any pulling or pinching of the skin.</li>
            <li> Maybe in a couple years I&#x27;ll upgrade to Series 7, I can only image how much more amazing that shaver is.</li>
            <li> The most quiet electric shaver of its kind.  </li>
            <li> -You don&#x27;t need to clean it every time you use it.    </li>
            <li> Then, last January, my old one died and I bought a 390cc because it was the best I could afford.  </li>
            <li> It gives me a clean and close shave.  </li>
            <li> The Clean and Renew cartridges are made in Ireland.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> am ambivalent about the Clean and Renew cartridges.</li>
            <li> You can flush clean a used cartridge under a faucet.</li>
            <li> The ingredients listed on the Clean and Renew package are SD-Alcohol 40-B (Denatured Alcohol), Perfume, Limonen and Citral.</li>
            <li> it take 4 hours to charge and clean the shaver</li>
            <li> You cannot clean the Shaver with a brush.  </li>
            <li> As good or better than the Panasonic because I almost never get cuts while shaving wet, and it&#x27;s quieter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure Braun is able to make more profit by outsourcing their manufacturing to China, but not from this long time customer.  </li>
            <li> So far I am a satisfied user!</li>
            <li> I loved my first Braun electric shaver, but after about a year I had to replace the foil and cutter and have done so two more times in its short, four-year lifespan.  </li>
            <li> (I guess I translated that right!)  </li>
            <li> The cleaner is good and I clean the shaver every 2nd shave.</li>
            <li> So far, I am loving this model.</li>
            <li> This is my second Braun, good razor and of course made in Germany.</li>
            <li> I have returned many Remington MicroScreen shavers that wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge, and VERY noisy operation.</li>
            <li> (he accidentally ordered more than he intended to buy), I was very hesitant.</li>
            <li> VERY SATISFIED.WORKS BETTER</li>
            <li> Like the title says I am convinced that your happiness with this product will be directly related to two things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As of the time of me writing this review I&#x27;m still using this but am contemplating just going back to my good ole Mach 3.  </li>
            <li> Give you get a good deal I would definitely give this shaver a try.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good enough.</li>
            <li> So not bad at all.       </li>
            <li> I liked to choose when to recharge, to sometime let the shaver deplete the battery charge to the fullest before recharging to deep cycle the battery and better battery life, as the brochure states to do so for the first couple of recharges, but I cannot clean using the chemical system I must hand clean for those occasions.</li>
            <li> If you shave every day or every other day even, this razor works great.</li>
            <li> I love my new Braun electric razor!  </li>
            <li> This new one is perfect, quiet, and shaves really well.  </li>
            <li> He said that it is much better than the Braun 360 especially with being able to raise up the shaver to get around close areas.  </li>
            <li> they always left my face incredibly irritated and itchy (since I have sensitive skin) and doesn&#x27;t shave quite as close as a razor, not to mention taking thrice longer than a razor to shave you.    </li>
            <li> I received this shaver back in December of 2012 and it has done ok for the most part.  </li>
            <li> This newer model is considerably better than the older one.  </li>
            <li> You will probably be able to shave in a decent amount of time and therefore won&#x27;t have your face irritated.  </li>
            <li> i BUY THIS ITEM TO MY OLDER SON, AND HE LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Overall I am very happy with all of my Braun shavers and look forward to what the next 6 years will bring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you need something to work quick then look somewhere else.</li>
            <li> he likes it very much and used smoothly.</li>
            <li> Very fast service from Amazon too!</li>
            <li> The clean and renew cartridges supposedly last a month, but mine is still going strong, and the level indicates that i&#x27;ll get a couple more weeks out of it.  </li>
            <li> I was happy when he told me it cut&lt;br /&gt;well, didn&#x27;t cause any pulling or pain (as a previous norelco had done) and seemed&lt;br /&gt;genuinely</li>
            <li> Thanks Braun for making a product that is so easy to use and shaves so closely.</li>
            <li> Be aware of this policy before purchasing!</li>
            <li> this is my first purchase from this company, and I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li> But then again, being able to dry shave for 10 mins while in bed is a lot better than having to take 5 mins to go to the bathroom, put shaving cream on, shave and then cleanup after.</li>
            <li> This could have been easily avoided if they&#x27;d actually tried using the product a bit more.</li>
            <li> and the shave was very close and smooth.</li>
            <li> This shaver is smooth and fast.  </li>
            <li> Works great for me, I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard</li>
            <li> It makes him look so young and sexy.  </li>
            <li> is 1000 better than my old one.  </li>
            <li> My old $20 Remington worked much better.  </li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s nothing like a freshly cleaned shaver.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money</li>
            <li> Well worth the money either way.</li>
            <li> more, the price is reasonable and the delivery is fast.</li>
            <li> You fall out of love, or perhaps the other person falls out of love with you.</li>
            <li> It is quiet, much quieter than my old Braun, and I love the cleaning system, which had better extend the life of this shaver and battery for the full, advertised six years!  </li>
            <li> My face got used to it right away</li>
            <li> This one feels just right to me.  </li>
            <li> It is right on the package that the shaver and case are made in China.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sometimes if you don&#x27;t hit the button right, instead of releasing the razor you start the cleaning process.</li>
            <li> Take care because one of the video reviews is for two products, one of which CAN be used &#x27;right in the shower&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Even between cleanings, with the shaver in the station, the head will have a nice clean \\&quot;lemony\\&quot; smell, due to the proximity of the cleaning solution.</li>
            <li> far, I am loving my new Braun Series 3-390cc Shaving System.</li>
            <li> Having been a loyal owner of many Remington shavers for the past 20 years, I&#x27;m definately sold on this shaver, and glad I made the switch.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a shower safe version, pay a little more.</li>
            <li> Used the new shaver this morning and it was so smooth</li>
            <li> The feel is a bit more harsh than my Norelco, but it doesn&#x27;t give me any more razor burn.</li>
            <li> a good shaver I&#x27;ve been using for about a year and half.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> In a year I suppose I will purchase a new cleaning cartridge, since the filter in the original will probably be clogged up.  </li>
            <li> I really like the ability to clean the shaver and it seems to lubricate the shaver real well.</li>
            <li> the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the message is clear, I am 100% satisfied and I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dave</li>
            <li> Could have a little more power but overall good.</li>
            <li> While this new one is not built nearly as well as my old one (much more plastic, not as powerful), it works well and the price at Amazon was great - almost 50% less than Walmart.</li>
            <li> It comes out clean and looking new every time</li>
            <li> First shave:  </li>
            <li> Anybody that wants the Braun can have mine!</li>
            <li> I continue to be a consistent Braun user</li>
            <li> After my first shave with the 390</li>
            <li> To this point product is performing exactly as represented.  </li>
            <li> Still, that was a respectable amount of time for the razor to last.  </li>
            <li> charges fast!  </li>
            <li> While it does a close shave, if you have a more ample face, you will be running it over and over again to get those last</li>
            <li> Just shave regularly and you will love it like I do.</li>
            <li> The first charge lasted about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> It gives you a pretty close shave, almost as close to my gilette mach 3.</li>
            <li> I have had Remington (first electric shaver).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even ask me about the cleaning system, you better be well off financially to support that cleaning system.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying the 3 pack of cartridges for now, but may try the cheap refill method when the machine hits one year old.  </li>
            <li> Bought this last year for my husband but wanted to wait awhile before leaving a review to make sure it was a good product for longer than a few months.</li>
            <li> If I had been aware of this NEVER, NEVER would I have ordered this product.</li>
            <li> And although I can&#x27;t get as close as with a razor, shaving has never left my skin feeling better.    </li>
            <li> This Razor is now replacing what was a great long lasting braun product with hopefully another.</li>
            <li> My old shaver gave me a close and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> This is the first Braun Shaver I have used.</li>
            <li> It shaves exactly as I would expect an electric shaver to and does so without irretating my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first is the trimmer, which is pretty flimsy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did because the Norelco I got just didn&#x27;t have enough power like these Braun shavers.</li>
            <li> It is the first electric shaver I have owned in over 10 years.  </li>
            <li> While it does an OK job on short hairs, it takes forever to pick up longer hairs on the neck and face region or, one has to resort to the trimmer or a blade.</li>
            <li> Cleans under hot tap water.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it is not expensive but clear and  smooth</li>
            <li> however this was exactly that to close</li>
            <li> The first one lasted about eight years until the battery no longer held a charge.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric shaver I tried after 30 years.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that my facial hair would adjust and it would get better, but after 2 months it still has this issue.</li>
            <li> Some were good and lasted a few years, but eventually broke.</li>
            <li> had a older version of the razor (about ten years old) thought it was really good</li>
            <li> When I went to get a return label I am not allowed due to Hazardous Material.</li>
            <li> And lastly, the sideburn/hair trimmer doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job, it seems it can only cut doing an up motion and doesn&#x27;t that well.  </li>
            <li> This one does shave fine but the cleaning method is not very user friendly.  </li>
            <li> I love the cleaning technology and the long charge life.  </li>
            <li> This model&#x27;s trim blade mows them down nicely.  </li>
            <li> I think that if you clean it with the little included brush it should be good enough.</li>
            <li> The motor is quiet and sounds strong.</li>
            <li> Also, this thing won&#x27;t cut at certain angles.  </li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I clean the Braun shaver every other shave when the cleaning light is on.  </li>
            <li> The initial cost is more and the shave doesn&#x27;t last as long as a blade, but for me, being able to put away the styptic pencil makes it all worth while.</li>
            <li> Needless to say he loves his shaver and also thanks amazon for messing up my order and giving me something better! :)</li>
            <li> Takes a long time to shave and often misses areas - this compared to an older Braun I had for years until the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge any more.</li>
            <li> First of all, the shaver cannot be charged in the cleaning cradle, unless you are actually using a clean cycle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m most likely going to just buy a replacement foil and blades for my older Brauninstead of buying a new one again for a while.</li>
            <li> And now I&#x27;m so happy with it that I&#x27;ve been using it everyday, sometimes even twice a day, for the last 2 months.</li>
            <li> silken smooth with only 2 passes.  </li>
            <li> Overall the fit and finish of the Braun is excellant.</li>
            <li> The shave is quiet, smooth, reasonably close and the shaver is more compact than I expected.</li>
            <li> Thanks everyone.</li>
            <li> After about a week, I learned how to use it so that I am getting a very close shave in comparison.</li>
            <li> I had a Braun 3441 (I believe) series shaver for 8 years and really thought it was a quality product.  </li>
            <li> It was just a slab of plastic that didn&#x27;t seem very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> This shaver works very well for a close shave.</li>
            <li> You dont have to go over the same spot a thousand times like the cheap ones.</li>
            <li> I expected more for my hundred bucks.    </li>
            <li> Purchased this for my son and he absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> The Braun Series 3-390cc gives a fast close shave.  </li>
            <li> I really like the self cleaning feature.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Do identify specific attributes (e.g. comfort &amp; fit of a shirt or the battery life of a camera) and whether they met your expectations.</li>
            <li> much</li>
            <li> And, when you see what&#x27;s in the used cleaning solution after cleaning, you realize it really does work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so, I found this one which is reasonably priced and has held up for over a year.</li>
            <li> and I threw the whole package out...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use a power outlet that my wife needs to do all she wants to do each day,</li>
            <li> much too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really have to grind away from every angle to get them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I will say this:  if you have a light to moderate beard</li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> Refill cleaners are readily available at the local store.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if he really needed another one</li>
            <li> The foil head is very flexible and lets me get all areas of my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t want to pay that much.</li>
            <li> Does not cut real close.</li>
            <li> the cleaning system really works.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not using the whole cleaning system yet, I just run it under the water every once in a while.</li>
            <li> Not too much need for cleaner &amp; solution&lt;br</li>
            <li> my father and i like it very much&lt;br /&gt;may</li>
            <li> It produced a very close shave.</li>
            <li> I have always shaved my whole life with a Mach 3 and shaving cream etc, was fighting some razor burn and decided to give this a</li>
            <li> I think it goes through the cleaning solution too fast.</li>
            <li> Just as described, this is what I want at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> 我以为会毫不费力的就剃很干净，但还是会有黑胡茬。质量感觉是不错的。Do explain why you liked or disliked this</li>
            <li> * did give a close shave for the larger areas such as the cheeks (on my face!)&lt;br /&gt;* Nice contoured case for the shaver for travel use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BAD:&lt;br /</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m still having trouble catching all the hairs on my neck.  </li>
            <li> you willmore than likely head back to the good old reliable manual</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to get a straight electric razor for fears it wouldn&#x27;t be able to get the jawline well enough like a triple action razor.  </li>
            <li> luckily I got the first 2 at stores where i could take the product back and not return it by mail.  </li>
            <li> The shaver \\&quot;Clean me\\&quot; light comes on after every two or three shaves, so if you clean/charge it every few days, it will be ready to go when you have to travel.</li>
            <li> working properly, it gives a great shave, but three cutter/foil units in 9 months is poor, especially since I could easily go a year or more before having to replace the cutter on prior Braun models I have owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> like all the other electric razor, burns your skin shaves ok and</li>
            <li> I have never spent so much money on a razor but the promising reviews had me thinking that this may provide the golden shave...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through many electric shavers, from the Norelco rotary shavers to other Braun foil shavers.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by how long a cleaning cycle takes (4 hours I think), but that is OK if you plan ahead.</li>
            <li> I leave the facial hair on my jawline and this shaver would not leave a clean edge, even when it was fully charged and cleaned.&lt;br</li>
            <li> * Did not give a clean shave on the facial hair on my throat area.  </li>
            <li> Granted, I&#x27;ve only had mine for a month or so, but I don&#x27;t clean it</li>
            <li> The previous model had a rigid foil, this one has the Smart Foil which allows the foil to better meet the contours of your face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for about 5 weeks, and am in the process of running the battery full down before recharge three times, as recommended, to get full capacity.</li>
            <li> I really like it and highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li> This is my second one and they are the work horse of the braun shavers, specially for this price.</li>
            <li> I shaved about 3 minutes a day for 18 days after the first charge and not a heavy beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First thing I noticed the extremely loud running noise.</li>
            <li> The shaver doesn&#x27;t have nearly the power as my old razor, you have to go over your face 2-3 times more often to get the same shave and</li>
            <li> I broke it pretty early on trimming my side burns.</li>
            <li> overall is not a clean good shave.</li>
            <li> would recomend this product to anyone who wants to spend a little less time shaving and who wants a great shaving experience.</li>
            <li> smooth, fast, and extremely close shave, thanks braun</li>
            <li> He told me three times this weekend how much he loves his new razor.  </li>
            <li> nothing more, nothing less.  </li>
            <li> I had an older model of this razor for about 6 years.  </li>
            <li> As with any electric shaver, it takes time to figure out which direction to move the shaver for a particular section of your beard.</li>
            <li> the years I have slowing been upgrading to better more expensive units as the pervious ones breakdown.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> am glad to report, this is the most expensive shaver I have ever purchased</li>
            <li> you do want a super close shave, simply just use a razor after using the 390cc.</li>
            <li> The cleaning solution does become stagnant / not so nice smelling after two months, so I just empty it out and replace the fluid with 91% isopropyl and Lemon Extract.  </li>
            <li> I see that on Amazon&#x27;s top-seller personal hygiene list the only Braun that makes the top-100 is the 7-790, which is the $250 top of the line that some (including me) can&#x27;t afford.  </li>
            <li> I notice the price is only ten more than I paid so</li>
            <li> This shaver is replacing an older Series 3 that I have been using for about 4 years or so.  </li>
            <li> I was stretching my skin as suggested in the manual and applying decent pressure.  </li>
            <li> In particular, the trim blade cuts better on this model than on the previous one.</li>
            <li> The older one pulled and tugged on eyebrows.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;d had a Braun older series</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting a high performance shaver.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a month now and perhaps my expectations are too high.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Braun set up the new design to force us to buy fluid more regularly.</li>
            <li> Of course, the title may not be saying much, since I use a shaver until it nearly falls apart, replacing the rechargeable batteries as they die.</li>
            <li> So basically I shave, then hang it in it&#x27;s cradle to clean, charge, and dry.</li>
            <li> I bought this when it was deal of the day and based on some great reviews I felt I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> I probably will only rarely use the cleaning system.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this one will last me just as long or even longer.  </li>
            <li> Normally I don&#x27;t give my written opinions, but</li>
            <li> The normal shaver works still</li>
            <li> I am pleased that there have wasted their money.</li>
            <li> With a normal non-electric razor there is not 1/2 month acclimation time for your face.  </li>
            <li> Our son has MS and needed a shaver that prevented the nicks made by a normal razor.</li>
            <li> I just received this new one as a gift and the shaving experience</li>
            <li> I ordered a new replacement screen and blades for my Remington</li>
            <li> Your face has to adjust to the new type shaver.</li>
            <li> I am still learning to shave with this new feature</li>
            <li> before.&lt;br /&gt;Bought a new \\&quot;Norelco\\&quot; with all the bells and whistles including the cleaner and cleaning</li>
            <li> But this new 3-390cc works even</li>
            <li> The new ones do not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it was time to invest in a new one.</li>
            <li> Also, this newer shaver stays a bit wet after finishing the 4 hour clean cycle.  </li>
            <li> and I expected to be clean shaven every work day.  </li>
            <li> I can see where routine cleaning and lubricating is important but it leaves the head wet even after it&#x27;s all  done with the complete cycle.</li>
            <li> But he was persistent and I thought, for that kind of money I guess the shaver should be somewhat decent, at the very least it should be something I could use when I travel and don&#x27;t have the luxury to use shaving cream and all that.       </li>
            <li> A previous Braun I owned worked fine ~15</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money and look forward to using this shaver for a long time.</li>
            <li> Since Amazon no longer is willing to speak wityh a customer through the phone system, I&#x27;ll probably not be doing business in the future.</li>
            <li> Amazon send me a second one which worked well for the first couple of months then</li>
            <li> Braun makes more \\&quot;advanced\\&quot; and more expensive series 5 and 7, but for the money (especially the Amazon price)</li>
            <li> The entire system really works!</li>
            <li> far as the shave goes, you get a close shave, specially with the wet shave.</li>
            <li> Other than that the things cuts really close on the rest of the face, and leaves it almost as smooth as a traditional razor.</li>
            <li> I had a need for a new shaver since the old one was literally falling apart.</li>
            <li> Because my old Braun shaver was not working and the blade area broke, I purchased this new Braun shaver.  </li>
            <li> It worked adequately enough before the cleanign stopped working, and I had great luck with previous Braun shavers, so I will get something in the 7 series and hope it lasts the typical 6-7 years I&#x27;d been getting out of their products (</li>
            <li> My old Braun razor was a beast this one not as strong and leaves a lot of little hairs</li>
            <li> Anyway, after many years being a Braun fan, I am now switching loyalty to a Panasonic wet and dry model.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an adequate shaver, neither the best nor the worst I&#x27;ve had in terms of closeness of shave and speed.</li>
            <li> It works very well for about 90% of my face, but the other 10% I end up having to use a traditional razor to clean up.</li>
            <li> Previously had the three circle blade electric razors and so far has cut and held up the same or better.</li>
            <li> razor burn is far less than it used to be, and I think it will only get better once my skin gets used to the electric razor.  </li>
            <li> Not so, the first shave and all since have been better than any other razor that I have ever used; I have a heavy beard bye</li>
            <li> so I have decided to clean it that method about once a week or when the battery goes down.</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not rate it a 5 is the trimmer could be a little better or could have a couple of difference sizes or something which would bump it up to 5 star.</li>
            <li> My old one was a different model and lasted a whole month on a charge, this one I have to charge every 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I went from an avg old Phillips rotary shaver to the 390 and</li>
            <li> I found that it was very flimsy construction being held in place by two tiny plastic pegs.  </li>
            <li> Oh, I should tell you that my husband is a 54-year old man, who grows facial hair fast and has sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The shaver doesn&#x27;t perform as well as my old Braun that is 5 years old.  </li>
            <li> However, the biggest problem thus far is that the shaver will not charge in the cleaning station, despite the manual&#x27;s assurance that it will charge in the cleaning</li>
            <li> so you save considerably.</li>
            <li> My face feels ultra smooth everyday.  </li>
            <li> When it finally needed replacement, I wanted to get another Braun, and I chose this model because of its features and reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> (Thanks for the solution goes to someone who posted this earlier.)</li>
            <li> I went to use the trimmer and when it opened, it popped completely off.  </li>
            <li> My old Braun of 6+ years hasn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Then I shaved with a regular manual razor that cost so much money for the re fills.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> My old Braun&#x27;s battery got</li>
            <li> I had to get the Braun Series 3-390cc to replace my old braun 5565.  </li>
            <li> I have only had this shaver for a few days but so far I love it.  </li>
            <li> I have been saving money by doing it the old fashion way.  </li>
            <li> Still, it should not have stopped this early.</li>
            <li> I shave in about 4-5 minutes (completely) and</li>
            <li> Shave almost as close as I got with the old method.</li>
            <li> am very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> The key ingredient is denatured alcohol which is really inexpensive.</li>
            <li> WHERE near that of a $1.00 disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a really sensitive face.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, so far it is def.</li>
            <li> but this was an unexpected surprise.  </li>
            <li> old braun...tried it yet again....</li>
            <li> bad thing is i find the cleaning solution to have a very strong lemon scent, too strong</li>
            <li> Shortly, when I was trying to see if I could replace the cutter (or the entire pop-up section,) the plastic slab snapped right off.   </li>
            <li> It took me 3 tries to get the right razor head.  </li>
            <li> I like the cleaning as needed but was suprized that the stand will not clean as a choice, but appears to clean and charge any time the button is activated with the shaver in the stand.</li>
            <li> understand that different skin and hair types make a difference with the performance of shavers in general, and this model really just got me by...</li>
            <li> I would think I could get a decent close shave...not the case I can go over and over the same areas on my face a number of times and the shave is NO</li>
            <li> The Braun was highly rated by Consumers reports, came with a 60 day money back guarantee and a 2 year warranty.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would like the cleaning/charging aspect of the new shavers but this one is simple to use and has far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Holds a charge for a long time and you can shave with it right up until it finally quits.</li>
            <li> The more expensive models shave a little better</li>
            <li> It takes me a little longer to shave with this because of how many times you have to go over the same area, especially the curve of your jaw / neck area.  </li>
            <li> It was in pretty rough shape.  </li>
            <li> My husband takes out the plastic thing and just fills it with normal rubbing alcohol and water and it works just the same.</li>
            <li> Regardless, that shaver is still kicking but last night, this new 390CC Series 3 shaver broke on me.  </li>
            <li> have to take mine out about once a week to charge it, overall a minor inconvenience, but for the money, should not have happen in the first place.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one is Chinese made and does not shave nearly as well as my old one.</li>
            <li> It worked early on, but it no longer slides far enough to push the heads out of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I drop it in the cleaner/charger daily, but don&#x27;t plan to push the charger connection down until it needs cleaning, once I&#x27;ve gone through my full discharge cycles.</li>
            <li> (no, it&#x27;s not manual-razor close, but as close as you can get without major irritation).</li>
            <li> This is a major one.</li>
            <li> , so the first few weeks shaving with this thing it took me a pretty long time to shave my face with it.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought the cleaning kit would be a hazzle and would not last very long.</li>
            <li> Right down to bare skin.  </li>
            <li> He also doesn&#x27;t like to clean his shavers that much, so I usually do it.</li>
            <li> I only used the cleaning system once so far since the battery does charge when cleaning</li>
            <li> With the 390, I never use the trimmer, except for an occasional trim of my nearly non-existent side burns.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 51 years young, and I&#x27;ve been shaving since 1978 with a Norelco Rotatract - yes it still works after 35 years and only one rebuild/comb &amp; cutter replacement!  </li>
            <li> , I never use the trimmer, except for an occasional trim of my nearly non-existent side burns.</li>
            <li> I decided after 30 years I&#x27;d had enough of my old graying beard.  </li>
            <li> I barely felt it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I went back to my OLD norelco...</li>
            <li> This experience was both worse and more costly.</li>
            <li> When cleaning, the cleaning light stays on long enough for the alcohol-based cleaning fluid to evaporate, indicating that the shaver is dry enough to use.</li>
            <li> Sure enough, with less than 12 months of use on this one, being extremely careful with the pop-up trimmer because of the warnings, an internal plastic bit snapped and it popped off.</li>
            <li> Seriously, for a razor that costs this much, it should be built a little more sturdy than this.</li>
            <li> since I personally consider other opinions, I felt like I should tell you how much my husband loves this one!  </li>
            <li> I am still getting accumulated to the machine, is is very much different and the same at the same time as my old on a(7 years old).</li>
            <li> The other on-site reviews were very helpful.</li>
            <li> At least once or twice a week I HAD to use a blade shaver to clean up.</li>
            <li> This is clearly a long-term generic design weakness with Braun shavers, and totally unacceptable in a high-priced brand.</li>
            <li> The individual floating heads were odd at first</li>
            <li> This razor was purchased to follow a long line of Braun razors which have grown old rather than just dying.  </li>
            <li> I am a man with a sensitive neck area and there have not experienced any razor burn (which i have experienced in the past with other shavers and razors).</li>
            <li> and I wanted to cycle the battery a few times first.  </li>
            <li> I bought the first one and when it arrived the battery was completly dead and would not charge at all.</li>
            <li> This should cut down on irritation from the razor since it wont have to cut as much.     </li>
            <li> I am not getting the close shave that I had expected with the new Braun Series 3-390cc Men&#x27;s shaving system.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I have a new face; my skin is soft and moisterised where it used to be dry and rough feeling after shaving.</li>
            <li> one is much improved over the previous one.</li>
            <li> For me to get as near as possible to a close shave (not terribly near, either)</li>
            <li> I have a fairly thick beard that grows in rather quickly</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shave daily and anyone who has used electric razors before can tell you that long hairs can be a major issue.</li>
            <li> I read warnings in the reviews when I bought it that the plastic bits in the pop-up trimmer tend to snap easily and render the shaver useless, and that&#x27;s exactly how my previous Braun shaver died several years ago.</li>
            <li> The second charge is a little more than half gone, so it looks like 3 weeks on a charge is typical for my shaving.</li>
            <li> My face was getting a decent shave, however, when it came to the hairs on my neck it was patchy mess.  </li>
            <li> This is the second self cleaning Braun shaver I&#x27;ve had, and its built with the same quality as the other one that lasted nearly 10 years.</li>
            <li> I particularly like it because it gives him a very close shave since he has a tough beard.</li>
            <li> I did try a new Norelco rotary and the blades were shot in less than a year</li>
            <li> The only draw back is that it takes twice as long to get a close shave with this as I used to with my mach 3.</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m pretty hard on razors and</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;comb\\&quot; and cutters will grab those low-lying hairs, with a few extra passes, like no shaver I&#x27;ve ever used, and even take care of the occasional wild ear hair.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;Do compare to similar products and share how long you&#x27;ve used this</li>
            <li> The shaver is my attention for a long time, the recent decision to buy two because of my father&#x27;s birthday, I&#x27;m going to send one to him, and then keep a</li>
            <li> only reason I gave it 4 star is that the Sideburn Shaver just popped out in the second week and has been loose since.</li>
            <li> I have to hold it while I shave, which is not a big deal, it&#x27;s just not very high</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that 24 hours is not enough to dry it sometimes.  </li>
            <li> I did not have to shave for at least two days after using this product, but I believe this is due to the fact that it grates the follicle right off your face.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the 5, or 7 series are better electric shavers, but this one is a bit of a disappointment.</li>
            <li> but I figured I should really use it for at least as long as the manual advises before I come to a conclusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to get a close shave with no risk of cutting myself.  </li>
            <li> I am 60 years old and have gone through a few electric razors during this time.</li>
            <li> My old shaver just went dead</li>
            <li> The shave can leave long hairs that need trimed to then shave.</li>
            <li> I no longer get the stray long hairs, so the long hair part of the head works as advertised.</li>
            <li> It can be wiped off, but not completely.</li>
            <li> Also, this shaver, with the gimmicky pivot system doesn&#x27;t seem to cut my hair as close as the old one did.</li>
            <li> I ran that old shaver ragged and didn&#x27;t change the blades for a few years</li>
            <li> Hopefully it lasts long giving a close shave.</li>
            <li> About 10 years ago they put a long hair triming blade in between the foils</li>
            <li> I have long been a fan of Braun and over the years, have probably spent close on $3000 keeping the company afloat, along with others.</li>
            <li> Although the razor is quiet, the cleaning system is certainly not for the 20-minute cycle, and the cleaning solution is citrus-smelling, but</li>
            <li> This would be less expensive and more convenient then buying replacement cartridges.</li>
            <li> Also, this unit does not dry the head and because it&#x27;s sitting upside down in the holder</li>
            <li> I will never go back to Norelco or any other electric razor except the Braun self cleaning</li>
            <li> It gives you the same sensation as if you splashed your face with Williams Lectric Shave or some other alcohol based pre-shave product.  </li>
            <li> last a very long time compared to other foil shavers (remington)</li>
            <li> I take the head off to let it dry separately.</li>
            <li> One must let it dry</li>
            <li> only complaint so far is with the cleaning system.  </li>
            <li> Lasts for a month on a single charge.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to clean with a brush but at least you can use the faucet.</li>
            <li> and when he did he only took it down to stubble.  </li>
            <li> I finally broke down and got another shaver.  </li>
            <li> I solved this by either wiping the head after it&#x27;s done cleaning or by simply putting the shaver in upside down in the holder so the head is up</li>
            <li> /&gt;This shaver is less close than my last, a Remington MS3-3700.</li>
            <li> It is no where near as bad brand new as my old shavers were after using them for months!  </li>
            <li> Even in the tight spots like between my upper lip and nose</li>
            <li> This one does make my skin a little red</li>
            <li> I bought one years ago because of the great ads, and it was terrible, then forgot over the years.  </li>
            <li> I am sending the second back to braun as it is too late to get a refund from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 2 months into the Braun product and hope the cutter/comb assy will last at least a year - time will tell.  </li>
            <li> I replaced an at least 10 year old Braun shaver with this one.</li>
            <li> I took the plunge, bought a Braun and expected weeks of having to get used to the product.</li>
            <li> So I am not complaining on any part minus the fact that I had also ordered him a replacement shave head for the series 3 and cannot use it because it does not work with the 7.</li>
            <li> Amazon.com was one of the few places that had the proper replacement parts and at a cheaper price than the others.</li>
            <li> replaced quite a few foil heads throughtout the years before it recently started to die.</li>
            <li> Provided a closer shave than I expected.</li>
            <li> solution.&lt;br /&gt;That was a waste of $120.00+ as the results were the same.</li>
            <li> Really poor for a Braun, used to be much sturdier shavers.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning solution is dried on, and still present.</li>
            <li> It can be used wet, but not in the shower.</li>
            <li> The shaver is partially charged out of the box, fully charged a few hours later when I looked.</li>
            <li> It was nice for awhile, but never great and lousy for trimming.</li>
            <li> the trimmer to cut down the long hairs before you shave.    </li>
            <li> it did cut the hair after 2 or three passes but left me extremely raw.</li>
            <li> The charge plug is a little long and it sticks out from the outlet.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver after looking at all the other Series shavers.</li>
            <li> After researching and reading other opinions, I chose the Braun 390 for my husband.  </li>
            <li> I have always used electric shavers due to the fact that using a razor on my face makes me break out.&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> I say go to Bed Bath and Beyond or anywhere other than</li>
            <li> This shaver gets the whiskers on the neck where the other ones either missed them or took forever.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitve skin and was worried about this not being a wet/dry option and not allowing me to use any shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The other thing is a slider that is supposed to pull two of the heads away so you can trim under your nose.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works well, too, and I use it every other day.</li>
            <li> due course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had to quit shaving with a razor blade due to skin irrritation.</li>
            <li> Everything starts to feel like an endless routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life happens.</li>
            <li> I usually shave daily.</li>
            <li> I have had other brand electric shavers that couldn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Customer service kept trying to refer me to service centers and were not interested in addressing a design problem.</li>
            <li> I have only owned Braun shavers in the past.  </li>
            <li> I gave it only 4 stars as it does have a little trouble getting some of the longer hairs on my neck</li>
            <li> It does it&#x27;s job, but takes about 4 hours, which means I have to be very careful</li>
            <li> It takes around 4 hours to complete the cycle and it is just another item in your home that will use a small amount of electric which when combined with all of the other small items in your home starts to add up.</li>
            <li> It has been a rough month and a half though.  </li>
            <li> Amazon sells other electric shaver cleaners that are less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> This is my only complaint.</li>
            <li> Once broken in, the shaver gives a professional close shave.</li>
            <li> it took me a few tries to get used to it...</li>
            <li> I have to knock it down to 4 stars.  </li>
            <li> Knocked down to 2 stars.</li>
            <li> I ran the battry down on purpose and recharged and it has not needed a recharge in 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> He shaves every other day faithfully!</li>
            <li> The side cutters on both of my Remingtons failed within two months of each other, so a new shaver was mandatory.</li>
            <li> I have endured this shaver for a year and a half and probably ought to have returned it immediately.</li>
            <li> I previously owned a Braun shaver for over seven years</li>
            <li> of all let me say that I have been using this shaver now for a month and a half</li>
            <li> They are expensive (about 6 bucks a pop) and last only about six weeks.</li>
            <li> 3 previous models.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed was really hoping that it would cut close because my husband is on blood thinner and is not supposed to use  a regular razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this back in late 2010 and used it for about 2.5 years before the cleaning base would not longer clean the shaver; it would just charge it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the same failure in each of the three foils where the edge of the foil has torn at that spot while shaving, once making a small cut on my face.  </li>
            <li> Not with this trimmer blade, it mows down everything!</li>
            <li> Had a Braun 6520 that I used for nearly 20 years that finally died, which was too bad</li>
            <li> Having used braun shavers for the last 15+ years I have to also say that this shaver is not a good one compared to what I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> : Shaves relatively well with no fear of accidentally cutting your skin with traditional shaver.</li>
            <li> it couldn&#x27;t be any worse then all the others that has claimed the same.  </li>
            <li> Even a stright razor has trouble with that.</li>
            <li> I felt the Series 5 and 7 were a bit too gimmicky for the price, and the Series 1 lacked the \\&quot;comb\\&quot;, as Braun calls it, between the cutters.</li>
            <li> I have been using this thing since February (2010) and every shave is as frustrating as the last.  </li>
            <li> Battery dead and will not charge.</li>
            <li> Automatic cleaning doesnt get by dock doesnt get rid of hair trapped inside the shaver.</li>
            <li> Yes, the cleaning solution pods are proprietary and not cheap</li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t need to use it everyday which is why he likes it</li>
            <li> I have been an Amazon Prime customer for years with few complaints.</li>
            <li> $100 wasted.</li>
            <li> Shaver broke in a few days.</li>
            <li> The cleaning cartridges are costly and don&#x27;t last, and the shave is poor.  </li>
            <li> The worst of any kind I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using another electric razor for a few years but the battery has lost it&#x27;s ability to recharge fully (needs a recharge every time)</li>
            <li> I put my finger up against it and can&#x27;t even feel it, even though it does cut a few hairs when I put it to my side burns.  </li>
            <li> did I waste 80 bucks on this when I need to use a safety razor after I&#x27;m done</li>
            <li> However, if you have a thicker beard and have to shave everyday</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been using it for about 3 weeks now, thinking maybe he just needs to get used to it, but it takes him a lot longer to shave and it misses quite a few hair.  </li>
            <li> This is April 2013 and the shaver is DEAD.</li>
            <li> DEAD.</li>
            <li> I gave it a few weeks like the directions say for my skin to get used shaving with this type of razor.</li>
            <li> The sliding mustache lever also seemed to have to be held after a few months use in order to shave my mustache area.</li>
            <li> The electric shavers I have previously owned have given me razor burn on my neck, sometimes pretty bad.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come with all the typical, excessive wrapping</li>
            <li> However, it has several annoying features that were not a problem with the older shavers, like the Braun Activator shavers.  </li>
            <li> Small brush is needed to remove the hair trapped inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The new design moves the cutting block and foil all inside the shaving head.</li>
            <li> My only disappointment is that the shaving head is somewhat wet after self-cleaning.</li>
            <li> Third thing and the most annoying was that it was about impossible to shave the hairs on my neck under my chin.  </li>
            <li> Secondly,having to replace the Clean and Renew Cartridges and their cost is both inconvenient and expensive.</li>
            <li> The Remington can get too close and will chew up your skin, especially when the too-often replaced screens fail.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 3 Braun shavers in the past.  </li>
            <li> Is this usual?  </li>
            <li> The Braun shaver was SO quiet compared to the Remingtons that I thought there was something wrong with it.</li>
            <li> Never used the cleaning dock, not sure how well that works.  </li>
            <li> AND I don&#x27;t get the usual cuts and nicks I get from a razor shaver.    </li>
            <li> After battling this problem for months, I finally ended up using the trimmer to shave my neck, an uncomfortable method.     </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not satisfied with the cleaning station.  </li>
            <li> No more Braun&#x27;s for me.</li>
            <li> It is unfortunate because I have been a fan of Braun for several years, but this one doesn&#x27;t cut the mustard.</li>
            <li> I was not pleased with the shave, but based on what I paid, I was stuck.  </li>
            <li> No more  re fills.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It will miss some hairs completely and inexplicably leave 1 or 2 hairs in an area that is otherwise clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> A small plastic hook (tab)</li>
            <li> No more rashe on my neck.</li>
            <li> I bought the Braun Series 3-390cc electric shaver because my Norelco Triple Header was past its prime!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It comes with the shaver, the charging/cleaning stand, a container of cleaning solution, a charging cable, a travel case for the shaver, and a small cleaning brush.</li>
            <li> I reflected on the poor quality of shaving over the past years with nicks, cuts and poor overall results that a change was mandated.</li>
            <li> My first razor&#x27;s base had a button</li>
            <li> I have to work almost as hard to get a close shave with the Braun 3</li>
            <li> and it had started pulling the longer hairs (dull blades</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t always get every neck hair but hard to find a razor that does.</li>
            <li> Cleaning tool hard to understand how to use.</li>
            <li> and I hardly used any solution.&lt;br</li>
            <li> How thick your beard comes in&lt;br</li>
            <li> ,how often he shaves, how he maintains the shaver and how thick his beard is.</li>
            <li> The stupid cleaning solution runs out so fast it&#x27;s ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> If the housing had been designed to cover the edge of the foils, this failure type would not happen.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> This is a built in failure point.</li>
            <li> I still have to touch up very small areas on my neck</li>

            <li> Less expensive than \\&quot;Norelco\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think the cleaning system is a little silly</li>
            <li> My son didn&#x27;t shave often enough because he was bad at razor shaving.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not good for longer hair, but what is?</li>
            <li> I used to use electronic shavers a few years back, and I hated them coz</li>
            <li> This shaver is not good for getting a close shave fared worse than $30 shaver I bought a couple of years ago.</li>
            <li> I figured hey ... give it a try at the very least</li>
            <li> I have a very thick beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using electric shavers for approximately 40 years.  </li>
            <li> I got tired of cleaning the Norelco&#x27;s all the time - this Braun product solves that issue.  </li>
            <li> there are some things that show poor design.</li>
            <li> He said it&#x27;s quite frustrating.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine hauling the base around, especially with the liquid it uses for cleaning</li>
            <li> Poor decisions: sad consequences.</li>
            <li> The base is large and a bit annoying, but it works well.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m very disappointed with this product and with Amazon.  </li>
            <li> After using it for awhile now it has proved me wrong.</li>
            <li> I felt that after getting mediocre results for years that I would investigate changing brands.  </li>
            <li> So needless to say he did not shave often</li>
            <li> Unable to find a replacement and unable to use the stand as a cleaner.</li>
            <li> This China-manufactured razor is lousy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a Braun Razor since 2001, it lasted for over 10 years before things started to go wrong.</li>
            <li> He was tired of shaving with a razor and cutting himself, and sometimes shaing twice a day.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this was not the solution to the problem.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this is not an item that can be returned.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Turning 68, I found that some of the neck hairs were difficult to shave as they (like me) sagged where we had not</li>
            <li> When the battery eventually fails to hold a charge, you can still use it plugged in.</li>
            <li> This product should be made so that the consumer could go into the case and replace the battery pack when it fails to no longer hold a charge.</li>
            <li> /&gt;What&#x27;s not acceptable is the flawed construction.</li>
            <li> the beard-trimmer was very poor design &amp; construction.</li>
            <li> Very poor shave.  </li>
            <li> I had to keep checking to see if it was even cutting the hair.</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong!  </li>
            <li> I mean I hated it!</li>
            <li> now this item was not all bad</li>
            <li> But tragic things happen too.</li>
            <li> Plus now I can throw out all the hassle with having to use shaving cream and needing to shave in front of a sink with running water and all that crap.</li>
            <li> Now after 14 months, the razor will no longer even charge, so it is worthless.  </li>
            <li> so it appeared that this was the newer version with the addition of the cleaning base.  </li>
            <li> Problem was, and still is, I hate shaving as much as I hate a beard.</li>
            <li> The cleaning system base is made in Hungary.  </li>
            <li> but the base a 1.</li>
            <li> Some where awful and tore up my face.</li>
            <li> This is the worst electric shaver I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that this shaver is the worst ever of all the Brauns I have owned.</li>

            <li> I have endured this shaver for a year and a half and probably ought to have returned it immediately. I am 60 years old and have gone through a few electric razors during this time. I have to work almost as hard to get a close shave with the Braun 3 as I would if I lathered.  A previous Braun I owned worked fine ~15 yrs ago. I finally got fed up and just purchased a Panasonic ES-LA 63...about $50 more.  First shave:  silken smooth with only 2 passes.  Anybody that wants the Braun can have mine!</li>
            <li> My old shaver just went dead so I needed one. I ordered it on Thanksgiving day and received it the next day. All without express shipping. Great service. My old one was a different model and lasted a whole month on a charge, this one I have to charge every 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I am very  happy with my purchase of the Braun Series 3 Shaver.  I continue to be a consistent Braun user</li>
            <li> At first I thought the cleaning kit would be a hazzle and would not last very long. After using it for awhile now it has proved me wrong. Clean shave and easy cleaning system.</li>
            <li> I went from an avg old Phillips rotary shaver to the 390 and what an improvement! The difference is truly night and day and I am totally converted to Braun and their foil tech. The shaver itself feels very solid and well built. After my first shave with the 390 I feel like I have a new face; my skin is soft and moisterised where it used to be dry and rough feeling after shaving. Totally worth the money and look forward to using this shaver for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is the second self cleaning Braun shaver I&#x27;ve had, and its built with the same quality as the other one that lasted nearly 10 years. I fully expect to get another 10 years out of this one.</li>
            <li> Very good item.  I&#x27;ve had a Braun Razor for years and wouldn&#x27;t have anything else.  I got the best price at Amazon and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver after looking at all the other Series shavers. This shaver was the highest shaver in Series 3, and the lowest price. I probably will only rarely use the cleaning system. The shaver is partially charged out of the box, fully charged a few hours later when I looked. I shaved about 3 minutes a day for 18 days after the first charge and not a heavy beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is less close than my last, a Remington MS3-3700. The Remington can get too close and will chew up your skin, especially when the too-often replaced screens fail. The shave can leave long hairs that need trimed to then shave. At the end of its 6 year life it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge and the grip pads were ill-fitting and falling off. Too close is painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My shaver was made in Germany. Overall the fit and finish of the Braun is excellant. The shave is quiet, smooth, reasonably close and the shaver is more compact than I expected. It is easy to control over my face. I no longer get the stray long hairs, so the long hair part of the head works as advertised. The charge plug is a little long and it sticks out from the outlet. I clean it manually, but the clean light doesn&#x27;t know that. I like this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The purchase was easy, with quick delivery. The other on-site reviews were very helpful. Thanks everyone.</li>
            <li> I have used this shaver for about 2 weeks now and I love how quickly it shaves my beard. I gave it only 4 stars as it does have a little trouble getting some of the longer hairs on my neck but I&#x27;m very happy with the shaver and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good shaver.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 3 Braun shavers in the past.  It seems to run about 1/2 speed compared witht the others.  Is this usual?  Craig Mavis</li>
            <li> The Braun 390cc works well, and doesn&#x27;t pull my whiskers like the more expensive Series 7 shaver with \\&quot;Pulsonic technology.\\&quot;  My only disappointment is that the shaving head is somewhat wet after self-cleaning. It can be wiped off, but not completely. However, it doesn&#x27;t interfer with the shave.</li>
            <li> To this point product is performing exactly as represented.  It appears to be a class A product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several different electric razors over the years, Braun and otherwise. Some where awful and tore up my face. Some were good and lasted a few years, but eventually broke. So far, I am loving this model. It&#x27;s quiet. It gives a pretty good shave (no, it&#x27;s not manual-razor close, but as close as you can get without major irritation). I hope this one holds up over time!</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my boyfriend&#x27;s birthday. As I can see, he loves it, especially the cleaning system. His skin was always in pimples because of the razors. And now his face is cleaner and cleaner.</li>
            <li> My Norelco&#x27;s battery was not charging as well as it used to so I used birthday money to buy this razor. After about a week, I learned how to use it so that I am getting a very close shave in comparison. My wife agrees that it does a better job. The feel is a bit more harsh than my Norelco, but it doesn&#x27;t give me any more razor burn. note that I do use pre-shave lotion. The base is large and a bit annoying, but it works well. I have been sealing it and moving off the counter and only using it every 4 days and it seems fine that way instead of cleaning every day as they suggest.</li>
            <li> This is my second Braun, good razor and of course made in Germany. Shaves well when you just dont feel like lathering up. The refill things are to pricey so I just refill them with rubbing alcohol and use machine oil to lubricate it.</li>
            <li> I had an older model of this razor for about 6 years.  It was in pretty rough shape.  This new one is perfect, quiet, and shaves really well.  I love the self cleaning feature!</li>
            <li> I have shaved with a Braun Electric Razor for many years and was always satisfied but no so with this 390 model. It works well with the exception you can not trim sideburns accurately and must use a safety for trimming mustache or sideburns.</li>
            <li> Having been a former owner of two Norelco products since the mid 1990&#x27;s I had a need for a new shaver since the old one was literally falling apart. I have been replacing cutters, cleaning heads and used a shaver with a cleaning stand which broke after a year.  I felt that after getting mediocre results for years that I would investigate changing brands.  The Braun was highly rated by Consumers reports, came with a 60 day money back guarantee and a 2 year warranty. I reflected on the poor quality of shaving over the past years with nicks, cuts and poor overall results that a change was mandated. I took the plunge, bought a Braun and expected weeks of having to get used to the product. Not so, the first shave and all since have been better than any other razor that I have ever used; I have a heavy beard bye the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the message is clear, I am 100% satisfied and I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dave</li>
            <li> Having been a loyal owner of many Remington shavers for the past 20 years, I&#x27;m definately sold on this shaver, and glad I made the switch. The cleaning system seems to work well and the shave was very close and smooth. I have returned many Remington MicroScreen shavers that wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge, and VERY noisy operation. The Braun shaver was SO quiet compared to the Remingtons that I thought there was something wrong with it. The first shave was very comfortable and smooth and nick free. I am very satisfied with the Braun and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had ordered the Braun series 3 shaver for my fiance for Christmas. I ordered it back in October and didn&#x27;t realize until he opened it on Christmas that I had actually received the Braun series 7 shaver. So I am not complaining on any part minus the fact that I had also ordered him a replacement shave head for the series 3 and cannot use it because it does not work with the 7. Needless to say he loves his shaver and also thanks amazon for messing up my order and giving me something better! :)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband Christmas 2009. My husband loves loves this shaver but I wanted to wait a little bit before giving any reviews just to make sure he remained very happy with it.  After watching the promo on Braun&#x27;s website about how it&#x27;s supposed to remove the hassle/pain of shaving after a weekend of no shaving, I had to get it for my hubby.  He is the type of man that can shave in the morning and have a beard at the end of the day...not a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow but a a good week worth of growth of a normal man&#x27;s beard.  So needless to say he did not shave often and when he did he only took it down to stubble.  I figured hey ... give it a try at the very least it couldn&#x27;t be any worse then all the others that has claimed the same.  Well I am here to tell you this shaver is AMAZING!  He shaves every other day faithfully! Right down to bare skin.  His skins feels soo smooth like a baby&#x27;s bottom.  It makes him look so young and sexy.  After 20 years of marriage, to finally feel his face I can not Thank Braun enough!!!</li>
            <li> Simply put, it doeesn&#x27;t shave the hair off my face!!!  Since Amazon no longer is willing to speak wityh a customer through the phone system, I&#x27;ll probably not be doing business in the future.</li>
            <li> I had a Braun 3441 (I believe) series shaver for 8 years and really thought it was a quality product.  I just received this new one as a gift and the shaving experience is 1000 better than my old one.  I&#x27;m sure this one will last me just as long or even longer.  An excellent product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying that I owned a Braun electric razor for close to 8 years before the plastic casing began to crack from use &amp; the occasional drop on the bathroom floor.  Still, that was a respectable amount of time for the razor to last.  So, I upgraded to the Series 3 (#390cc) and loved it.  I noted that the beard trimmer (which you must push up with your thumb,) felt kind of flimsy. It was just a slab of plastic that didn&#x27;t seem very sturdy.  Well, lo &amp; behold while my family &amp; I were on vacation and my son was being helpful bringing Daddy his razor one morning and he drops the razor on the carpeted floor. The beard-trimmer cutter popped off. I found that it was very flimsy construction being held in place by two tiny plastic pegs.  Shortly, when I was trying to see if I could replace the cutter (or the entire pop-up section,) the plastic slab snapped right off.   Seriously, for a razor that costs this much, it should be built a little more sturdy than this. It&#x27;s almost like they want you to break it &amp; have to hunt for parts.  Overall, I like the shave it gives me but the beard-trimmer was very poor design &amp; construction.</li>
            <li> Recently, my husband&#x27;s 4 y/o Braun 360 bit the dust.  After researching and reading other opinions, I chose the Braun 390 for my husband.  HE ABSOLUTELY LOVES IT!!! He said that it is much better than the Braun 360 especially with being able to raise up the shaver to get around close areas.  (I guess I translated that right!)  Normally I don&#x27;t give my written opinions, but since I personally consider other opinions, I felt like I should tell you how much my husband loves this one!  I hope it will last him four years and we only paid $104 for it!  Oh, I should tell you that my husband is a 54-year old man, who grows facial hair fast and has sensitive skin.  And one more thing, as I ramble on, my husband also loves the fact that he can rinse the blade under the water and continue to shave.  He told me three times this weekend how much he loves his new razor.  That&#x27;s it!</li>
            <li> I received one as a gift 5 years ago, and just bought another one myself.  It is even better than the first one.  Some of my friends just bought one also, because I recommended it.  Nothing but Braun for me for life  It just glides across your face and very smooth, close shave.  charges fast!  I love it!  Very fast service from Amazon too!</li>
            <li> MY HUSBAND LOVES THIS SHAVER HE SAYS THAT IT IS THE BEST SHAVER THAT HE HAS EVER OWNED.</li>
            <li> It took me 3 tries to get the right razor head.  luckily I got the first 2 at stores where i could take the product back and not return it by mail.  I also finally figured out where the information is on the razor so i was able to select the right replacement part.  It is under the part of the razor that lefts to get the longer hairs. Amazon.com was one of the few places that had the proper replacement parts and at a cheaper price than the others. Amazon.com is a great place to shop!!   rj2linda</li>
            <li> The shaver doesn&#x27;t perform as well as my old Braun that is 5 years old.  I thought I was getting a high performance shaver.  Was on the road a bunch and so couldn&#x27;t try it out and now can&#x27;t return it to Amazon.  Double whammy and I&#x27;m out $[...]</li>
            <li> While it does a close shave, if you have a more ample face, you will be running it over and over again to get those last hairs.&lt;br /&gt;It does take about 90 days before your face \\&quot;adjusts\\&quot; to the shaver. However, the biggest problem thus far is that the shaver will not charge in the cleaning station, despite the manual&#x27;s assurance that it will charge in the cleaning station.&lt;br /&gt;I have to take mine out about once a week to charge it, overall a minor inconvenience, but for the money, should not have happen in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;Braun advises I drive over 1 hour to get the shaver \\&quot;serviced\\&quot; I say, I just won&#x27;t get another Braun and not have to worry about it.</li>
            <li> best shaver in the world, 1st electric shaver that cuts  as close as any blade that i ever had, love it, would recommend to anyone .</li>
            <li> My rotary died and after about 3 months of using nothing but blades I finally broke down and got another shaver.  It&#x27;s a dream.  My face got used to it right away and it gives an excellent shave.  I only used the cleaning system once so far since the battery does charge when cleaning and I wanted to cycle the battery a few times first.  I&#x27;ll probably start using it regularly after that.  If you&#x27;re worried about the solution evaporating, just cap it after cleaning it.</li>
            <li> This is by far the greatest shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned. The only reason I did not rate it a 5 is the trimmer could be a little better or could have a couple of difference sizes or something which would bump it up to 5 star. But over all this shaver is great and I&#x27;ve owned it for about 9 months now and have had zero problems with it.</li>
            <li> This razor was purchased to follow a long line of Braun razors which have grown old rather than just dying.  It seems to work well and the self cleaning is a bonus, although the cleaning solution is not a bargain at about $5 a throw.  I was surprised by how long a cleaning cycle takes (4 hours I think), but that is OK if you plan ahead.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using the Self-Cleaning Braun Razor for a number of years now and this is his second one.  Obviously, he must like it or we wouldn&#x27;t have purchased another one.  I particularly like it because it gives him a very close shave since he has a tough beard.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001VEK1E4 Braun Series 3-390cc Men&#x27;s Shaving System] I surprised my husband and his best friend with a shaver each. Husband is 63 and has a beard that grows in diffrent directions. He also doesn&#x27;t like to clean his shavers that much, so I usually do it. Now he is enjoying shaving &amp; cleaning it himself.  His friend 59 said it was the best shave he has ever had also. I&#x27;m the wife that likes the bathroom sink clean and NO wiskers in it, so I&#x27;m pleased too. Good buy, but can not return if do not get the order right first time.. I found out so the second system went to my husbands friend for his B-Day..Make sure you understand policy on all products you order first...</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on the basis of comments from friends and relatives. Nicely made and feels well balanced while using. As with any electric shaver, it takes time to figure out which direction to move the shaver for a particular section of your beard. You also need to set more time aside for shaving as compared to a razor blade. Do you need the automtic cleaning apparatus? Probably not. It takes around 4 hours to complete the cycle and it is just another item in your home that will use a small amount of electric which when combined with all of the other small items in your home starts to add up. For the perfect shave, use this product before you shower. When done showering, give your face a quick touch up with a razor blade and your good to go.</li>
            <li> Very poor shave.  Never worked properly out of the box and seller has yet to contact me back about replacement or refund.  My old $20 Remington worked much better.  Never used the cleaning dock, not sure how well that works.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> was nt to sure because of the price..  then I saw the video of the bald head guy and saw how well it work. I had the same problem looking for a shaver that would help my head shaving so I bough I try I happy</li>
            <li> This shaver works very well for a close shave. Your skin feels nice and smooth like you shaved with a stright razor. If you shave every day or every other day even, this razor works great. It&#x27;s not good for longer hair, but what is? Even a stright razor has trouble with that. Just shave regularly and you will love it like I do. Oh and aveage shave time with it, for me anyway is 2-3 mins. You dont have to go over the same spot a thousand times like the cheap ones. I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
            <li> Of course, the title may not be saying much, since I use a shaver until it nearly falls apart, replacing the rechargeable batteries as they die. My last two shavers were a Remington Interceptor (which has the comb/trimmer between the cutters) and an ancient Remington triple screen. I have a fairly light beard, but do have a problem with hairs lying close to the skin. This has meant that even with the Interceptor I&#x27;ve had to use the side trimmer to cut those wayward hairs before the screen cutter would finish the job. The side cutters on both of my Remingtons failed within two months of each other, so a new shaver was mandatory. My son suggested I try a Braun.    I looked over the specs and decided on a Series 3. I felt the Series 5 and 7 were a bit too gimmicky for the price, and the Series 1 lacked the \\&quot;comb\\&quot;, as Braun calls it, between the cutters. I had chosen the 370cc because I wanted to try out the cleaning/charging station, but the local Bed, Bath and Beyond store only had the 390cc in stock. With BB&amp;B&#x27;s liberal expiration date policy on store 20% coupons, the price was as good or better than anywhere else.    With the 390, I never use the trimmer, except for an occasional trim of my nearly non-existent side burns. The \\&quot;comb\\&quot; and cutters will grab those low-lying hairs, with a few extra passes, like no shaver I&#x27;ve ever used, and even take care of the occasional wild ear hair. The shave doesn&#x27;t compare to a blade, but it is as good or better than any shaver I&#x27;ve ever used, and I have yet to get a shaver burn from it.    I&#x27;ve had it for about 5 weeks, and am in the process of running the battery full down before recharge three times, as recommended, to get full capacity. The first charge lasted about 3 weeks. The second charge is a little more than half gone, so it looks like 3 weeks on a charge is typical for my shaving. The shaver \\&quot;Clean me\\&quot; light comes on after every two or three shaves, so if you clean/charge it every few days, it will be ready to go when you have to travel. I drop it in the cleaner/charger daily, but don&#x27;t plan to push the charger connection down until it needs cleaning, once I&#x27;ve gone through my full discharge cycles. When cleaning, the cleaning light stays on long enough for the alcohol-based cleaning fluid to evaporate, indicating that the shaver is dry enough to use. However, you can take off the head and run both the head and the shaver under the tap to clean it on the road. Even between cleanings, with the shaver in the station, the head will have a nice clean \\&quot;lemony\\&quot; smell, due to the proximity of the cleaning solution. It comes with a nice hard-side case for travel that should prevent any damage banging around in a suitcase.    At this point, if I had it to do over again, I would go with this shaver without a second thought.</li>
            <li> I bought a Braun since the one I had for over 20 years finally died.  While this new one is not built nearly as well as my old one (much more plastic, not as powerful), it works well and the price at Amazon was great - almost 50% less than Walmart.</li>
            <li> I expected more for my hundred bucks.    Takes a long time to shave and often misses areas - this compared to an older Braun I had for years until the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge any more.</li>
            <li> I used to use electronic shavers a few years back, and I hated them coz they always left my face incredibly irritated and itchy (since I have sensitive skin) and doesn&#x27;t shave quite as close as a razor, not to mention taking thrice longer than a razor to shave you.    So when my friend kept bugging me to buy his extra 390cc (he accidentally ordered more than he intended to buy), I was very hesitant. But he was persistent and I thought, for that kind of money I guess the shaver should be somewhat decent, at the very least it should be something I could use when I travel and don&#x27;t have the luxury to use shaving cream and all that.       And now I&#x27;m so happy with it that I&#x27;ve been using it everyday, sometimes even twice a day, for the last 2 months. It gives you a pretty close shave, almost as close to my gilette mach 3. I guess a good comparison is that the closeness the braun shaves me, is about how my face feels 3 hrs after I&#x27;ve shaved with my mach 3. So not bad at all.       Plus now I can throw out all the hassle with having to use shaving cream and needing to shave in front of a sink with running water and all that crap. I shave in bed, while watching tv, even while typing one handed in the computer. AND I don&#x27;t get the usual cuts and nicks I get from a razor shaver.    I love the self cleaner function of this. So basically I shave, then hang it in it&#x27;s cradle to clean, charge, and dry. Whenever I travel I leave the cradle at home and just bring the shaver and power chord and simply clean it under running water.     The only draw back is that it takes twice as long to get a close shave with this as I used to with my mach 3. But then again, being able to dry shave for 10 mins while in bed is a lot better than having to take 5 mins to go to the bathroom, put shaving cream on, shave and then cleanup after.</li>
            <li> This is the worst electric shaver I have ever owned. I have been using electric shavers for approximately 40 years.  I have had Remington (first electric shaver). A couple of Norelcos (when the rotary shavers came out).  This year I bought this Braun. First thing I noticed the extremely loud running noise. Second thing I noticed was that I had to press against my skin to get it to cut. Third thing and the most annoying was that it was about impossible to shave the hairs on my neck under my chin.  After battling this problem for months, I finally ended up using the trimmer to shave my neck, an uncomfortable method.     I have been using this thing since February (2010) and every shave is as frustrating as the last.  You have to keep going over and over and over the same place again and again and even then the results are unsatisfactory.  That is to say a close shave is not in the picture with this razor, not even close (pun intended)    Don&#x27;t even ask me about the cleaning system, you better be well off financially to support that cleaning system.    I have just purchased a Remington Rotary shaver and have been reintroduced to the speed, comfort, and convenience of electric shaving, not to mention the quiet running.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my son and he absolutely loves it.  Clean shave without any pulling or pinching of the skin.</li>
            <li> I owned a Braun before buying this one and still keep it as a backup.  This one works just fine and is always clean because the holder is also a cleaner.  It&#x27;s not the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had, but I don&#x27;t go for that ever since a dermatologist explained that very close shaves welcome ingrown hairs.  This one feels just right to me.  The only downside is that the cleaning cartridges are pricey.  A friend of mine has this machine also and just empties the cartridges and fills them with rubbing alcohol.  I&#x27;m buying the 3 pack of cartridges for now, but may try the cheap refill method when the machine hits one year old.  Update Nov 2012.  There is now a four pack that is very economical.  I get that and suggest you check it out.  It doesn&#x27;t come with all the typical, excessive wrapping so you save considerably.</li>
            <li> I have always used electric shavers due to the fact that using a razor on my face makes me break out.&lt;br /&gt;Over the years I have slowing been upgrading to better more expensive units as the pervious ones breakdown.&lt;br /&gt;I am glad to report, this is the most expensive shaver I have ever purchased and it is the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This shaver has lived up to the hype that I&#x27;ve seen on the commercials and even on the Braun website.  The shave is close, its easy to use, easy to handle, I love the self cleaning add on.  My face feels ultra smooth everyday.  Maybe in a couple years I&#x27;ll upgrade to Series 7, I can only image how much more amazing that shaver is.</li>
            <li> I had used a Braun shaver for many years.  When it finally needed replacement, I wanted to get another Braun, and I chose this model because of its features and reasonable price.  I am very pleased with my choice.  Clean, smooth shave, and easy to keep clean with the supplied cleaner.</li>
            <li> The Braun Series 3-390cc gives a fast close shave.  The motor is quiet and sounds strong. The features work great.  I am extremely pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Much better than the Norelco razor it replaced.  The shave is more comfortable and closer.  I really like the self cleaning feature.  For a little over $100, it&#x27;s probably the best razor you can get at this price point.</li>
            <li> 我以为会毫不费力的就剃很干净，但还是会有黑胡茬。质量感觉是不错的。Do explain why you liked or disliked this product.&lt;br /&gt;Do compare to similar products and share how long you&#x27;ve used this product.&lt;br /&gt;Do identify specific attributes (e.g. comfort &amp; fit of a shirt or the battery life of a camera) and whether they met your expectations.</li>
            <li> had a older version of the razor (about ten years old) thought it was really good replaced quite a few foil heads throughtout the years before it recently started to die. told my wife it would be a great christmas present. purchased a 390cc for me and could not believe the diffenence this shaver blows everything else away. smooth, fast, and extremely close shave, thanks braun</li>
            <li> VERY SATISFIED.WORKS BETTER IF YOU SHAVE AM &amp; PM.BETTER THAN ROTARY TYPE,DEFINITLY.I JUST BOUGHT MY SECOND ONE FOR WORK.</li>
            <li> Received the Braun 3-390cc about 3 weeks ago and it works fine but I&#x27;m not satisfied with the cleaning station.  I can see where routine cleaning and lubricating is important but it leaves the head wet even after it&#x27;s all  done with the complete cycle. I take the head off to let it dry separately. The cleaning solution costs too  much so I have decided to clean it that method about once a week or when the battery goes down.</li>
            <li> Good shaver. Trimmer is handy and the cleaning/charging station is nice. Could have a little more power but overall good.</li>
            <li> The battery life on this product is a problem. I bought the first one and when it arrived the battery was completly dead and would not charge at all. Amazon send me a second one which worked well for the first couple of months then one day the same thing happened. Battery dead and will not charge. I am sending the second back to braun as it is too late to get a refund from Amazon. Having used braun shavers for the last 15+ years I have to also say that this shaver is not a good one compared to what I have used in the past. Hopefully when I get my refund I will ugrade to the series 5 or 7.</li>
            <li> Yes, I am getting a good shave with my new Braun shaver.</li>
            <li> Because my old Braun shaver was not working and the blade area broke, I purchased this new Braun shaver.  I like it very much.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver, I would buy it again. I paid half-off for it $76.00 it arrived on time, &amp; I am very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> like all the other electric razor, burns your skin shaves ok and overall is not a clean good shave. if you need it for a trim maybe but to get a nice shave, no way i have 12 oclock shadow by 10AM ! Although i do shower at 5AM</li>
            <li> I am not getting the close shave that I had expected with the new Braun Series 3-390cc Men&#x27;s shaving system.  I ordered a new replacement screen and blades for my Remington and it gives me a closer shave.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver.  It gives a good clean shave.  the battery life is very good.  The cleaner is good and I clean the shaver every 2nd shave.</li>
            <li> Cons: Automatic cleaning doesnt get by dock doesnt get rid of hair trapped inside the shaver. Small brush is needed to remove the hair trapped inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Shaves relatively well with no fear of accidentally cutting your skin with traditional shaver. However might need slightly more time.</li>
            <li> Provided a closer shave than I expected.</li>
            <li> My shaver broke and they replaced it without a problem. Braun shaver systems have been in my house for many years.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if the item I received was defective but it was pretty pricey for it only to work for this short period.</li>
            <li> My old Braun razor was a beast this one not as strong and leaves a lot of little hairs I wouldn&#x27;t recommend purchasing this razor</li>
            <li> This is a continuation of my shaver search. See the previous main entry about my Remington, Norelco, and Panasonic shavers here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LX6UQLJZ5JCP/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;ASIN&#x3D;B0021AG0Z6&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this Braun series 3 390cc on sale cheap, so I got it. It&#x27;s very good. As good or better than the Panasonic because I almost never get cuts while shaving wet, and it&#x27;s quieter. It&#x27;s maybe 94% of shaving with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kicker is, I like it BETTER than the top-of-the-line Braun series 7 790cc that I got after it. The series 7 does have a pivoting head, and the vibration, but in the end I GET A BETTER SHAVE from this 390cc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am putting away my series 7, and going back to this 390cc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So save your money, get this one.</li>
            <li> I compare the price in the shore or somewhere，it is cheapest in Amazon，and with the big discount，my boyfriend like it~</li>
            <li> The most quiet electric shaver of its kind.  I have done thorough research without finding another competitor that equals the shave and hygiene.</li>
            <li> I like this razor a lot.  It is very good quality and has a good feature set.  I really liked the cleaning system too.  Yes, the cleaning solution pods are proprietary and not cheap but there&#x27;s nothing like a freshly cleaned shaver.  And, when you see what&#x27;s in the used cleaning solution after cleaning, you realize it really does work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars as a product.  Shaving with an electric, while convenient, just wasn&#x27;t for me.  It irritated my skin and didn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade (none of the electrics do!).  Those are my own issues/preferences, not the fault of the product.</li>
            <li> Bought this last year for my husband but wanted to wait awhile before leaving a review to make sure it was a good product for longer than a few months. He had been mentioning that he wanted a shaving system so, I found this one which is reasonably priced and has held up for over a year. He doesn&#x27;t need to use it everyday which is why he likes it and I love it because his face is baby smooth for days so I am not getting stabbed by whiskers. One thing I wanted to mention is the cleaning thing, it says you have to replace it (meaning you spend money you don&#x27;t have to). My husband takes out the plastic thing and just fills it with normal rubbing alcohol and water and it works just the same. So, that will save you money. This is a good product and worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have been an Amazon Prime customer for years with few complaints. This is a major one. I ordered this shaver as a holiday gift and needed to return it because my son already owned one. When I went to get a return label I am not allowed due to Hazardous Material. If I had been aware of this NEVER, NEVER would I have ordered this product. Be aware of this policy before purchasing! I say go to Bed Bath and Beyond or anywhere other than Amazon!http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VEK1E4/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_img</li>
            <li> Had a short time and the cleaner quit working.....  Unable to find a replacement and unable to use the stand as a cleaner.</li>
            <li> The Braun 370 is truly a great shaver for the price.  I previously owned a Braun shaver for over seven years but this shaver is superior in many ways.  Quieter, better and quicker shave. Also, Braun improved the cleaning mechanism too!  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The 390cc really does a great job for an electric shaver. And although I can&#x27;t get as close as with a razor, shaving has never left my skin feeling better.    Recommendations for using the 390cc.    -Use \\&quot;afta PRE-ELECTRIC shave lotion\\&quot; before you shave. This will make your hairs stand up for a closer shave and will leave your skin feeling just that much better.    -Use the trimmer to cut down the long hairs before you shave.    -If you do want a super close shave, simply just use a razor after using the 390cc. This should cut down on irritation from the razor since it wont have to cut as much.     -You don&#x27;t need to clean it every time you use it.    -You can make the cleaning solution with 5 3/4 oz Rubbing Alcohol, 1/2 teaspoon lemon extract, and 1/2 teaspoon Singer sewing machine oil. (Thanks for the solution goes to someone who posted this earlier.)</li>
            <li> I bought this when it was deal of the day and based on some great reviews I felt I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.  I was coming from a remington triple foil.  I&#x27;ve owned it for over a year now.  From day one it didn&#x27;t give me a close shave, but I had heard that it takes a while to break in a shaver so I kept trying.  It never did give me a close shave compared to the remington I used before.  Now it just rips hairs out and it&#x27;s totally unusable.  $100 wasted.</li>
            <li> This China-manufactured razor is lousy. Don&#x27;t buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer broke 3 months after buying this. I bought this one to replace my Braun that was made in Germany. This one is Chinese made and does not shave nearly as well as my old one. I&#x27;m sure Braun is able to make more profit by outsourcing their manufacturing to China, but not from this long time customer.  No more Braun&#x27;s for me.</li>
            <li> This shaver is OK and nothing more for me. Replaced a Norelco shaver with this hoping for better results, which I didn&#x27;t get.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a Braun Razor since 2001, it lasted for over 10 years before things started to go wrong. This Razor is now replacing what was a great long lasting braun product with hopefully another. I&#x27;ve never had problems with irritation and look forward to many more good years with a close shave from a simple easy to use electric razor.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it.  Much more quite and cleaning is a breeze.  Battery charge seems to stay up longer then his Remington did.</li>
            <li> THe Braun 390cc is an OK shaver.  However, it has several annoying features that were not a problem with the older shavers, like the Braun Activator shavers.  First of all, the shaver cannot be charged in the cleaning cradle, unless you are actually using a clean cycle.  The Activator shaver allowed me to charge my shaver without using the cleaner, it had contacts on the bottom of the charger.  Also, this newer shaver stays a bit wet after finishing the 4 hour clean cycle.  One must let it dry or else you will notice the dampness on your face.  And lastly, the sideburn/hair trimmer doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job, it seems it can only cut doing an up motion and doesn&#x27;t that well.  Also, this shaver, with the gimmicky pivot system doesn&#x27;t seem to cut my hair as close as the old one did. So, overall I cannot recommend this product.  It is unfortunate because I have been a fan of Braun for several years, but this one doesn&#x27;t cut the mustard.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001VEK1E4 Braun Series 3-390cc Men&#x27;s Shaving System] My husband&#x27;s comments.  This shaver is smooth and fast.  I always used rotary shavers and for a while thought they were the best.  This shaver gets the whiskers on the neck where the other ones either missed them or took forever.  I really like it and highly recommend this.  Well worth the money</li>
            <li> Husband loves it. We had one before and he dropped it n broke it. Wanted the same one again. Loves having the sideburn trimmer. Comes with a travel case which comes in handy. Good strong, cuts smooth.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift to replace a Braun shaver that I had for ten years. My old shaver gave me a close and comfortable shave. My new Series 3-390cc does a better job and is more comfortable to hold and use. I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> Shaver broke in a few days. Amazon does not accept returns on shavers. I have to wait 8 weeks to recieve my refund. Save yourself some frustration and buy any shaver at a regular stick and morter store where you can return it immediately. I will never use Amazon again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Shaver 14 months ago.  I was not pleased with the shave, but based on what I paid, I was stuck.  The cleaning cartridges are costly and don&#x27;t last, and the shave is poor.  Now after 14 months, the razor will no longer even charge, so it is worthless.  Don&#x27;t get stuck.  Stay away from Braun.  I bought one years ago because of the great ads, and it was terrible, then forgot over the years.  This experience was both worse and more costly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 51 years young, and I&#x27;ve been shaving since 1978 with a Norelco Rotatract - yes it still works after 35 years and only one rebuild/comb &amp; cutter replacement!  I take care of my electric razors...I did try a new Norelco rotary and the blades were shot in less than a year and I threw the whole package out... I got tired of cleaning the Norelco&#x27;s all the time - this Braun product solves that issue.  I will never go back to Norelco or any other electric razor except the Braun self cleaning product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I clean the Braun shaver every other shave when the cleaning light is on.  The cleaning solution does become stagnant / not so nice smelling after two months, so I just empty it out and replace the fluid with 91% isopropyl and Lemon Extract.  In a year I suppose I will purchase a new cleaning cartridge, since the filter in the original will probably be clogged up.  I love my new Braun electric razor!  The self cleaning Braun shavers are definitely the way to go.  I&#x27;m only 2 months into the Braun product and hope the cutter/comb assy will last at least a year - time will tell.  When it does need replacing I&#x27;ll post another comment again.  Lars.</li>
            <li> I received this shaver back in December of 2012 and it has done ok for the most part.  I had a Braun Contour 5775 shaver before this one which was also considered a Series 3 model so it appeared that this was the newer version with the addition of the cleaning base.  I ran that old shaver ragged and didn&#x27;t change the blades for a few years and it still gave me a great shave, just not that close and it had started pulling the longer hairs (dull blades and whatnot I&#x27;m sure.)  Regardless, that shaver is still kicking but last night, this new 390CC Series 3 shaver broke on me.  I went to use the trimmer and when it opened, it popped completely off.  I looked closer and somehow one of the pegs on the shaver itself that guide the trimmer when it slides broke off!  This means it isn&#x27;t possible to fix!  The normal shaver works still but I used the trimmer often so this is a setback in my book for this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, to the actual review of the trimmer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The GOOD:&lt;br /&gt;* battery life is great&lt;br /&gt;* the cleaning base worked great, if a bit noisy since the shaver &amp;#34;runs&amp;#34; while it is in the solution.&lt;br /&gt;* did give a close shave for the larger areas such as the cheeks (on my face!)&lt;br /&gt;* Nice contoured case for the shaver for travel use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BAD:&lt;br /&gt;* it did not do a great job of leaving a clean edge when it cut.  I leave the facial hair on my jawline and this shaver would not leave a clean edge, even when it was fully charged and cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;* the trimmer broke OFF after almost 2 years of use!  My old Braun of 6+ years hasn&#x27;t broke!&lt;br /&gt;* Did not give a clean shave on the facial hair on my throat area.  They would lay close to the skin and this would not catch them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand that different skin and hair types make a difference with the performance of shavers in general, and this model really just got me by...nothing more, nothing less.  I&#x27;m most likely going to just buy a replacement foil and blades for my older Brauninstead of buying a new one again for a while.</li>
            <li> try to buy a good shave. this give me some good feeling when shaving. nest time, want to try series 5 or 7, give me good impression.</li>
            <li> We gave this to our son for Christmas. He said that he tryed it the next day.&lt;br /&gt;He said that gave him the best shave he ever had!!</li>
            <li> I think the man to whom I gave the thing she loved. I am pleased that there have wasted their money.</li>
            <li> First, I used to own a Norelco triple head razor.  That razor broke.  Then I shaved with a regular manual razor that cost so much money for the re fills.&lt;br /&gt;This razor shaves so close. No more  re fills.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with Braun electric shavers since 1975. Wouldn&#x27;t consider another brand.  Then, last January, my old one died and I bought a 390cc because it was the best I could afford.  I still have it now because buying a non-Braun replacement would make a hole in my budget.  It&#x27;s terrible.  The worst of any kind I&#x27;ve ever had.  For me to get as near as possible to a close shave (not terribly near, either) I have to scrape my face with it for an hour.  This is ridiculous.  I see that on Amazon&#x27;s top-seller personal hygiene list the only Braun that makes the top-100 is the 7-790, which is the $250 top of the line that some (including me) can&#x27;t afford.  It&#x27;s obvious (and not only from their Braun shavers) that when Proctor &amp; Gamble bought the Braun shaver line they changed the company&#x27;s philosophy and said good-bye to quality.  I&#x27;ll never buy another of theirs again.  If you do, don&#x27;t say you hadn&#x27;t been warned.</li>
            <li> I bought this for Christmas gift to my husband... I can&#x27;t believe, how good is it!!!&lt;br /&gt;My husband face is so nice and soft!!!</li>
            <li> This is the first Braun Shaver I have used. So far I am a satisfied user! You need to use it for awhile, because  its different then the triple head type razor. Your face has to adjust to the new type shaver. The shave is closer and I am happy with it! Robert</li>
            <li> One of the ebst shavers I have had under $100.  I have extremely sensitve skin and was worried about this not being a wet/dry option and not allowing me to use any shaving cream.  But I haven&#x27;t needed to.  It shaves exactly as I would expect an electric shaver to and does so without irretating my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life seems excellent</li>
            <li> My son didn&#x27;t shave often enough because he was bad at razor shaving.  This make shaving easier, hence him looking better.</li>
            <li> Based on the advertising, I thought this product would be better than it is.  Perhaps the 5, or 7 series are better electric shavers, but this one is a bit of a disappointment.</li>
            <li> My experience with this purchase convinces me that Amazon reviews are rigged.  I&#x27;ve been using another electric razor for a few years but the battery has lost it&#x27;s ability to recharge fully (needs a recharge every time) so I decided to get this one when it was a \\&quot;lightning deal\\&quot; for about 40d off according to amazon.  In the lightning deal it said the regular price was ninety nine bills and the deal price was fifty nine.  Now that I&#x27;m trying to return it I notice the price is only ten more than I paid so the deal isn&#x27;t really that great a deal.  I won&#x27;t fall for that one again from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the product.  The shaver doesn&#x27;t have nearly the power as my old razor, you have to go over your face 2-3 times more often to get the same shave and even still it&#x27;s not as close.  And the whiskers trimmer almost doesn&#x27;t seem to cut at all.  I put my finger up against it and can&#x27;t even feel it, even though it does cut a few hairs when I put it to my side burns.  Overall I&#x27;m very disappointed with this product and with Amazon.  By the way, you can&#x27;t return razors on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Once upon a time, I was a shaving purist.  Not a straight edge purist, but a lather-up and shave with the best razor I could buy purist. I love a close shave.  Problem was, and still is, I hate shaving as much as I hate a beard. So more than a decade ago a bought a Norelco. It was nice for awhile, but never great and lousy for trimming. Then I switched to Braun. I loved my first Braun electric shaver, but after about a year I had to replace the foil and cutter and have done so two more times in its short, four-year lifespan.  My old Braun&#x27;s battery got so I had to charge it after every shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I am loving my new Braun Series 3-390cc Shaving System. I got a close, smooth, comfortable shave from day one. I can trim around my goatee and sideburns with ease. It is quiet, much quieter than my old Braun, and I love the cleaning system, which had better extend the life of this shaver and battery for the full, advertised six years!  When it comes time to replace the foil in 18 months (advertised), I am hoping I can just run to Walmart or the local drugstore. We&#x27;ll see...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I researched shavers extensively before buying this model. Braun makes more \\&quot;advanced\\&quot; and more expensive series 5 and 7, but for the money (especially the Amazon price) I believe I bought the best value shaver on the market. I recommend you do, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint so far is with the cleaning system.  It does it&#x27;s job, but takes about 4 hours, which means I have to be very careful I don&#x27;t use a power outlet that my wife needs to do all she wants to do each day, if you know what I mean. Although the razor is quiet, the cleaning system is certainly not for the 20-minute cycle, and the cleaning solution is citrus-smelling, but much too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great shaving system at a great value that I hope I will be using for years to come.</li>
            <li> This shaver is not good for getting a close shave fared worse than $30 shaver I bought a couple of years ago.</li>
            <li> It‘s great！I love it。Braun is professional。With the 390, I never use the trimmer, except for an occasional trim of my nearly non-existent side burns.</li>
            <li> I have had several electrics over the years ... this oe actually works, and quite well. Lasts for a month on a single charge.</li>
            <li> Great price on this razor. Thank you for offering this older model, which is every bit as nice as the newer models and much more affordable.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this electric razor. He was tired of shaving with a razor and cutting himself, and sometimes shaing twice a day. Now he shaves only once a day, and sometimes once every two days.</li>
            <li> There is no reason to buy this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A safety razor will let you shave faster.  This requires you to go over the same area a bunch of times and clogs constantly  Also, this thing won&#x27;t cut at certain angles.  It will miss some hairs completely and inexplicably leave 1 or 2 hairs in an area that is otherwise clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pulls hair more often than a razor.  Prepare for watery eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why did I waste 80 bucks on this when I need to use a safety razor after I&#x27;m done so I don&#x27;t look like a patchy faced bum?</li>
            <li> This shaver is replacing an older Series 3 that I have been using for about 4 years or so.  This newer model is considerably better than the older one.  I like the side trimmer much better, and the clean and renew system works great.  The battery life is better also.  I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This is my 5th braun shaver in probably 20 years.  I travel globally for a living so i&#x27;m pretty hard on razors and two i broke by dropping them so the number is no indication of the quality level.  I love brauns because they shave close for an electric and the blades last a very long time compared to other foil shavers (remington) i&#x27;ve owned, which is good because they are expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had hoped that changing from my 6000 series to this would reduce the razor burn i&#x27;ve been getting on my neck since this one has the automatic sterilizing cleaning system.  Unfortunately this was not the solution to the problem.  I am happy with the razor for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;-Slightly closer, quicker shave&lt;br /&gt;-more comfortable and lighter razor&lt;br /&gt;-auto clean is a nice feature&lt;br /&gt;-quieter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad thing is i find the cleaning solution to have a very strong lemon scent, too strong i think.  Also, this unit does not dry the head and because it&#x27;s sitting upside down in the holder I&#x27;ve found that 24 hours is not enough to dry it sometimes.  I solved this by either wiping the head after it&#x27;s done cleaning or by simply putting the shaver in upside down in the holder so the head is up and then it dries in time for the next use.</li>
            <li> Like the title says I am convinced that your happiness with this product will be directly related to two things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- How thick your beard comes in&lt;br /&gt;- How often you have to shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all let me say that I have been using this shaver now for a month and a half so I feel I gave my face ample time to acclimate to this shaver.  It has been a rough month and a half though.  I have a fairly thick beard that grows in rather quickly and I expected to be clean shaven every work day.  I wanted to give up on this machine so many times but I figured I should really use it for at least as long as the manual advises before I come to a conclusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so the first few weeks shaving with this thing it took me a pretty long time to shave my face with it.  I was stretching my skin as suggested in the manual and applying decent pressure.  My face was getting a decent shave, however, when it came to the hairs on my neck it was patchy mess.  I would try my best to stretch the skin and attacking the hairs from different angles but there were some damn hairs that I just could not get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that some more time has elapsed it has become quite a bit faster to shave with this but I&#x27;m still having trouble catching all the hairs on my neck.  I really have to grind away from every angle to get them.  This not only take a lot of time but it irritates your skin after a while.  As of the time of me writing this review I&#x27;m still using this but am contemplating just going back to my good ole Mach 3.  With a normal non-electric razor there is not 1/2 month acclimation time for your face.  You put that blade to your face and the hair come off.  No question about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say this:  if you have a light to moderate beard this can be a nice electric razor for you.  You will probably be able to shave in a decent amount of time and therefore won&#x27;t have your face irritated.  However, if you have a thicker beard and have to shave everyday you willmore than likely head back to the good old reliable manual razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, one last note on the cleaning part of this machine:  I think it&#x27;s a big scam.  The stupid cleaning solution runs out so fast it&#x27;s ridiculous.  I think that if you clean it with the little included brush it should be good enough.</li>
            <li> This razor works excellent.  I love the cleaning technology and the long charge life.  Easy on my son&#x27;s face.  thank you</li>
            <li> bought this for my son at a great price compared to retail stores. He loves it. would recommend this item</li>
            <li> This product is a very good shaver I get a clean shave with a smooth and fresh feel with the cleaner</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3U6MVE0BNUOWD]][[ASIN:B001VEK1E4 Braun Series 3-390cc Men&#x27;s Shaving System]]is a good shaver I&#x27;ve been using for about a year and half. It shaves well, and I use the cleaning system about once a week to give it a good cleaning, lubricate the blades, and recharge. Overall, been happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there are some things that show poor design. The first is the trimmer, which is pretty flimsy. I broke it pretty early on trimming my side burns. I think because it&#x27;s not that good a trimmer I tended to press on it to get a clean line. No big deal, but it&#x27;s needed to to prop the shaver up in the cleaner. Without it, the shaver doesn&#x27;t make enough electrical contact to work. I&#x27;m probably going to glue it in place so I don&#x27;t lose it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing is a slider that is supposed to pull two of the heads away so you can trim under your nose. It worked early on, but it no longer slides far enough to push the heads out of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the surface on the plastic housing is bubbling up. I think this caused by coming in contact with the cleaning solution in the cleaning system. Really? They didn&#x27;t think about what would happen when they came in contact?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The net effect is that an otherwise high-end feeling piece of equipment falls short of the image I think Braun would like to project. This could have been easily avoided if they&#x27;d actually tried using the product a bit more.</li>
            <li> This is my boyfriends second Braun. Great company. Quality product. Refill cleaners are readily available at the local store. I don&#x27;t know if he really needed another one but it was Christmas and so we upgraded.</li>
            <li> This shaver gives the cleanest shave I&#x27;ve experienced, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of shavers.  The entire system really works!</li>
            <li> I had to get the Braun Series 3-390cc to replace my old braun 5565.  I&#x27;m glad I did because the Norelco I got just didn&#x27;t have enough power like these Braun shavers.</li>
            <li> Maybe not as effective as the Panasonics I have, but for the price a really good deal.  The cleaner is effective, too, but I don&#x27;t know how it will hold up.</li>
            <li> My husband has always used a Norelco raiser it has a different head on it.  His died and I got a great deal on this razor for $50!  The hubby loved that it cleaned itself, and it looks like a great razor, but after we got it we realized it doesn&#x27;t work as great as the Norelco does.  He&#x27;s been using it for about 3 weeks now, thinking maybe he just needs to get used to it, but it takes him a lot longer to shave and it misses quite a few hair.  He said it&#x27;s quite frustrating.  Unfortunately this is not an item that can be returned.</li>
            <li> I have only had this shaver for a few days but so far I love it.  It is the first electric shaver I have owned in over 10 years.  I have been saving money by doing it the old fashion way.  The electric shavers I have previously owned have given me razor burn on my neck, sometimes pretty bad.  This one does make my skin a little red but it says in the instructions that it takes up to 5 days for your skin to adjust.  It is no where near as bad brand new as my old shavers were after using them for months!  I love that it charges and cleans just by puting it in the charger and pressing a button!  It comes out clean and looking new every time I shave!&lt;br /&gt;I would recomend this product to anyone who wants to spend a little less time shaving and who wants a great shaving experience.</li>
            <li> so far so good. It&#x27;s a good product. I bought it as a gift for my father, he likes it.</li>
            <li> ITS AMAZING! THE BEST GIFT I NEVER BUYED.  i BUY THIS ITEM TO MY OLDER SON, AND HE LOVE IT</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this for a couple months and has been very happy with it. Previously had the three circle blade electric razors and so far has cut and held up the same or better. Doesn&#x27;t always get every neck hair but hard to find a razor that does. Hopefully it lasts long giving a close shave.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the shaver.  It gives me a clean and close shave.  The foil head is very flexible and lets me get all areas of my face and neck.  It is a lot quicker to use than a razor and shaves just about as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using electic shavers for past 20 years. Braun is my favorite but Panasonic is also good. Norelco has a good product, it just does not work with my beard. Stay away from remington. I had one chew up my face. My last contour (which is now a 5 or 3 series I think) lasted over 6 years and so did the one before that. This shaver is very nice. The individual floating heads were odd at first but they do a great job of following the curves of your face. It also makes me not push as hard(a chronic problem I have) which leads to razor burn. I am still learning to shave with this new feature but so far it&#x27;s a great improvement. About 10 years ago they put a long hair triming blade in between the foils and I think this is the best improvement by far! I don&#x27;t shave daily and anyone who has used electric razors before can tell you that long hairs can be a major issue. Not with this trimmer blade, it mows down everything! I think the cleaning system is a little silly but it does it&#x27;s job. The more expensive models shave a little better but I don&#x27;t want to pay that much. Overall I am very happy with all of my Braun shavers and look forward to what the next 6 years will bring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1/11/13: Cleaning system stopped working. -1 star. The new design moves the cutting block and foil all inside the shaving head. It&#x27;s hard to clean with a brush but at least you can use the faucet. Still, it should not have stopped this early.</li>
            <li> Does not cut real close. Cleaning tool hard to understand how to use. Disappointed was really hoping that it would cut close because my husband is on blood thinner and is not supposed to use  a regular razor.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before buying the 390cc.  I have used a Braun shaver for years, and I wanted to upgrade.  I have used it for about a month now, and the results are spectacular.  I shave in about 4-5 minutes (completely) and the cleaning system really works.  The clean and renew cartridges supposedly last a month, but mine is still going strong, and the level indicates that i&#x27;ll get a couple more weeks out of it.  The lemon smell is nice (just watch out if you run the foil over your lips, it tastes funky).  The trimmer works well, too, and I use it every other day.</li>
            <li> Good balance of features and pricing! I am still getting accumulated to the machine, is is very much different and the same at the same time as my old on a(7 years old). I like the cleaning as needed but was suprized that the stand will not clean as a choice, but appears to clean and charge any time the button is activated with the shaver in the stand. I liked to choose when to recharge, to sometime let the shaver deplete the battery charge to the fullest before recharging to deep cycle the battery and better battery life, as the brochure states to do so for the first couple of recharges, but I cannot clean using the chemical system I must hand clean for those occasions. Small price for a good shaver and Braun has always produced good shavers.</li>
            <li> I replaced an at least 10 year old Braun shaver with this one. Holds a charge for a long time and you can shave with it right up until it finally quits. Shaves very smoothly and comfortably. Been using it for a month or so now and I have no complaints. I&#x27;m not using the whole cleaning system yet, I just run it under the water every once in a while. I&#x27;ll probably try that system after a while and see if I think it makes any difference. Well worth the money either way.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to get a straight electric razor for fears it wouldn&#x27;t be able to get the jawline well enough like a triple action razor.  Boy was I wrong!  This razor has given me the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric!  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Once i got the hang of it, all my shaves are close and last longer. Also the cleaner is great.</li>
            <li> I have long been a fan of Braun and over the years, have probably spent close on $3000 keeping the company afloat, along with others. I have to say that this shaver is the worst ever of all the Brauns I have owned. While it does an OK job on short hairs, it takes forever to pick up longer hairs on the neck and face region or, one has to resort to the trimmer or a blade. I too am critical of the specialized cord required. Don&#x27;t travel without it. Anyway, after many years being a Braun fan, I am now switching loyalty to a Panasonic wet and dry model. I will report back in due course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also object to the cost of replacements and parts for Brauns. Like another reviewer, I discovered that using rubbing alcohol as a refill works perfectly well. Buying the company&#x27;s packs is a rip off.</li>
            <li> a gift for my father. he likes it very much and used smoothly. more, the price is reasonable and the delivery is fast.</li>
            <li> This is a fine product. Bought as a gift. Friend loved it. Nothing to complain. The package is kinda big, but there is indeed a lot of accessories. So I&#x27;m fine with it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Braun Series 3 for the last 5 years. This is my second one and they are the work horse of the braun shavers, specially for this price. they work great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave it 4 star is that the Sideburn Shaver just popped out in the second week and has been loose since. I have to hold it while I shave, which is not a big deal, it&#x27;s just not very high quality!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the shave goes, you get a close shave, specially with the wet shave.</li>
            <li> After 6 months, the beard trimmer came off the shaver.  A small plastic hook (tab) on which the beard trimmer slides broke causing the beard trimmer and parts to disassemble in my hand while using it ....</li>
            <li> I use this for traveling, but still shave with a razor at home. It does the job, but if you want a close shave there is no substitute for a razor.</li>
            <li> I had to quit shaving with a razor blade due to skin irrritation. I was hesitant to buy this but I am extremely pleased with its performance. As the instructions state it takes about two weeks to train you beard. Shave almost as close as I got with the old method. No more rashe on my neck. The automatic cleaning/charging unit is great also.</li>
            <li> Our son has MS and needed a shaver that prevented the nicks made by a normal razor. He was quite happy with the performance of this product. Thanks Braun for making a product that is so easy to use and shaves so closely.</li>
            <li> I decided after 30 years I&#x27;d had enough of my old graying beard.  I&#x27;d used Schick twin blade disposables to neaten up my neck and cheeks for that entire time, so I thought I&#x27;d just upgrade to a 3-blade razor to take care of my entire face.  Huge error!  Three weeks and countless nicks and cuts later I bought the Braun 3-390.  What a difference!!  Even in the tight spots like between my upper lip and nose I&#x27;m able to get a close shave with no risk of cutting myself.  The initial cost is more and the shave doesn&#x27;t last as long as a blade, but for me, being able to put away the styptic pencil makes it all worth while.</li>
            <li> Have purchased \\&quot;Norelco\\&quot; for past 20+ years and have been very happy with a close &amp; comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;Turning 68, I found that some of the neck hairs were difficult to shave as they (like me) sagged where we had not before.&lt;br /&gt;Bought a new \\&quot;Norelco\\&quot; with all the bells and whistles including the cleaner and cleaning solution.&lt;br /&gt;That was a waste of $120.00+ as the results were the same. Oh well, was able to sell on E-Bay to a very nice fellow&lt;br /&gt;in Montevideo, Uruguay.&lt;br /&gt;Bought a Braun Series 3 (had owned Braun some 30 years ago) again with the cleaner and cleaning solution.&lt;br /&gt;WOW !!  Now this is what I call a close shave. Have had for 3 months now and advise as follows:&lt;br /&gt;1.) Smooth &amp; close shave each and every time&lt;br /&gt;2.) 2 passes provides great shaving results&lt;br /&gt;3.) Stays charged for 3 weeks&lt;br /&gt;4.) Cleans under hot tap water. Not too much need for cleaner &amp; solution&lt;br /&gt;5.) \\&quot;SOLID\\&quot; feel unlike \\&quot;Norelco\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;6.) Less expensive than \\&quot;Norelco\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FULLY RECOMMEND&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John......Springfield, Oregon</li>
            <li> The shaver is my attention for a long time, the recent decision to buy two because of my father&#x27;s birthday, I&#x27;m going to send one to him, and then keep a, this brand razor is I trust products, I was very satisfied with the shopping</li>
            <li> just perfect! my father and i like it very much&lt;br /&gt;may be i should buy more&lt;br /&gt;it is not expensive but clear and  smooth</li>
            <li> Hands down, the best shave I&#x27;ve had in years.  Cuts close, quickly, quietly, comfortably.  Had it for a couple weeks now, we&#x27;ll see how it holds up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Braun razors for about 25 years or so.  Had Norelcos before that, but never got as close a shave as with Braun.  Had a Braun 6520 that I used for nearly 20 years that finally died, which was too bad, that was a great razor too.  But this new 3-390cc works even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it on a 3 day beard, and it blasts through without a hitch.  I have a very thick beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with it so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update Aug2013:&lt;br /&gt;After almost a year of use I have to knock it down to 4 stars.  Over the course of about 9 months Ive gone through 3 cutter/foil units.  There is about 1/16 inch gap at the end of the foil between the housing and the foil.  I&#x27;ve had the same failure in each of the three foils where the edge of the foil has torn at that spot while shaving, once making a small cut on my face.  If the housing had been designed to cover the edge of the foils, this failure type would not happen.&lt;br /&gt;When working properly, it gives a great shave, but three cutter/foil units in 9 months is poor, especially since I could easily go a year or more before having to replace the cutter on prior Braun models I have owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update Spring 2014:&lt;br /&gt;Alright, 6 months after the last update, and the side-burn trimmer has busted off the unit.  Underneath the trimmer is held on by two tiny plastic tabs that broke.  Really poor for a Braun, used to be much sturdier shavers.  Knocked down to 2 stars.</li>
            <li> Works great for me, I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard and I use it twice a day. I ran the battry down on purpose and recharged and it has not needed a recharge in 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I bought the Braun Series 3-390cc electric shaver because my Norelco Triple Header was past its prime!&lt;br /&gt;I thought \\&quot;let me try something else\\&quot; after using Norelco for about 15 years.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleasantly surprised. I get the closest shave from an electric than I ever did from the Norelco!&lt;br /&gt;I had read feedback from others here that the cleaning solution was too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see it. Granted, I&#x27;ve only had mine for a month or so, but I don&#x27;t clean it but about once a week.... not daily as some have suggested and I hardly used any solution.&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: I&#x27;m happy and pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;BTW: Every time that I&#x27;ve finished cleaning.....I remove the solution cartridge from the unit and replace the caps to seal it.&lt;br /&gt;That way none of the solution evaporates between cleanings.</li>
            <li> I have never spent so much money on a razor but the promising reviews had me thinking that this may provide the golden shave... however that is not the feeling i got after using this. It literally felt like i was running a cheese grater on my face it did cut the hair after 2 or three passes but left me extremely raw. now this item was not all bad I did not have to shave for at least two days after using this product, but I believe this is due to the fact that it grates the follicle right off your face. two weeks ago if someone would have asked me if i could ever shave to close I would have laughed however this was exactly that to close</li>
            <li> For most of us, life feels like a movie we&#x27;ve arrived at forty-five minutes late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something important seems to be going on . . . maybe. I mean, good things do happen, sometimes beautiful things. You meet someone, fall in love. You find that work that is yours alone to fulfill. But tragic things happen too. You fall out of love, or perhaps the other person falls out of love with you. Work begins to feel like a punishment. Everything starts to feel like an endless routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life happens. But. It does not happen to you!&lt;br /&gt;You happen to it!&lt;br /&gt;We r not victims !&lt;br /&gt;For everything that happens in life there is a decision I can make that will make the outcome manageable. Poor decisions: sad consequences. Good decisions : Happy Consequences.&lt;br /&gt;;~PB</li>
            <li> This is the best razor ever it cuts so close and leaves your face feeling fresh and new.  Once you use it you will never go back to a blade the Germans have once again made an excellent product, it seems everything they do is top notch from razors to guns to creating the perfect race.</li>
            <li> This is the second Braun Series 3 Men&#x27;s Shaving system that I have owned. The first one lasted about eight years until the battery no longer held a charge. When the battery eventually fails to hold a charge, you can still use it plugged in. The cost of Amazon&#x27;s Lightning deal prompted me to buy a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;This one is much improved over the previous one. In particular, the trim blade cuts better on this model than on the previous one. The older one pulled and tugged on eyebrows. This model&#x27;s trim blade mows them down nicely.  The previous model had a rigid foil, this one has the Smart Foil which allows the foil to better meet the contours of your face. It is always good to see improvement on consumer products from year to year.&lt;br /&gt;The shave from an electric razor will vary from man to man depending on how the man holds the razor ,how often he shaves, how he maintains the shaver and how thick his beard is. I am fair skinned with a very light beard. I usually shave daily. I have had other brand electric shavers that couldn&#x27;t cut it. This one does the job just fine. I replace the blades as soon as I feel it pull.&lt;br /&gt;One of the reviewer&#x27;s commented that the product was made in Germany. Read the package. Braun is a German based multinational. It is right on the package that the shaver and case are made in China. The cleaning system base is made in Hungary.  The Clean and Renew cartridges are made in Ireland.&lt;br /&gt;I am ambivalent about the Clean and Renew cartridges. They are expensive (about 6 bucks a pop) and last only about six weeks. They do make cleaning and maintaining the unit very easy. It gives you the same sensation as if you splashed your face with Williams Lectric Shave or some other alcohol based pre-shave product.  The refill cartridges are not sealed. You can flush clean a used cartridge under a faucet. You can refill them with a substitute liquid using a funnel. This would be less expensive and more convenient then buying replacement cartridges. Having to recycle the cartridge is wasteful. The ingredients listed on the Clean and Renew package are SD-Alcohol 40-B (Denatured Alcohol), Perfume, Limonen and Citral. The key ingredient is denatured alcohol which is really inexpensive. Amazon sells other electric shaver cleaners that are less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;This only deserves four stars for two reasons. One, the rechargeable battery pack is not replaceable. This is a built in failure point. This product should be made so that the consumer could go into the case and replace the battery pack when it fails to no longer hold a charge. Secondly,having to replace the Clean and Renew Cartridges and their cost is both inconvenient and expensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an adequate shaver, neither the best nor the worst I&#x27;ve had in terms of closeness of shave and speed. Rather overpriced at the regular price, but I got it on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s not acceptable is the flawed construction. I read warnings in the reviews when I bought it that the plastic bits in the pop-up trimmer tend to snap easily and render the shaver useless, and that&#x27;s exactly how my previous Braun shaver died several years ago. Sure enough, with less than 12 months of use on this one, being extremely careful with the pop-up trimmer because of the warnings, an internal plastic bit snapped and it popped off. This is clearly a long-term generic design weakness with Braun shavers, and totally unacceptable in a high-priced brand. I won&#x27;t be buying any more Braun shavers.</li>
            <li> I really like the ability to clean the shaver and it seems to lubricate the shaver real well. It does take a couple of passes to get a close shave but I have a 30 minute ride to work and I have the time. If you need something to work quick then look somewhere else. I don&#x27;t like that it take 4 hours to charge and clean the shaver so make sure that you have the time do this.</li>
            <li> This is top notch shaver! I&#x27;ve always heard about Braun&#x27;s quality, so this is my first purchase from this company, and I&#x27;m not disappointed. Once broken in, the shaver gives a professional close shave. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Great control while shaving, the add on attached clippers is a plus. The shaver is easy to clean, and waterproof. The cleaning system is easy to set up, minimum of fuss. Great recharge life, and the shaver lets you know when it need to be cleaned or recharged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It will take about a week or two for your face to get use to the shaver. Also, beware of getting the cleaning solution on your hands &amp; mouth. Rinse the shaver before using. The cleaning solution is dried on, and still present. Though the solution has a pleasant lemon scent, it can leave a unpleasing taste. Make sure you wash your face &amp; hands thoroughly afterwards. The Shaver is a bit louder than I&#x27;m use to, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I would give the razor a 5 but the base a 1. I called Braun and they said all their razors are now like this and they can&#x27;t help me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun razor is the finest there is. This is my second. My first razor&#x27;s base had a button so I could *choose* whether to engage the cleaning system. The new ones do not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes if you don&#x27;t hit the button right, instead of releasing the razor you start the cleaning process. Now you can&#x27;t use the razor for 4 hours - a disaster on a work day. My son used it this morning; now I can&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun set up the new design to force us to buy fluid more regularly. Now they&#x27;ve created situations in which I can&#x27;t always use the product I purchased when I need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer service kept trying to refer me to service centers and were not interested in addressing a design problem. I was transferred to 5 people; the 4th somehow \\&quot;dropped\\&quot; my call. It was the 5th who researched and told me all Brauns are now like this.</li>
            <li> Got the Braun Series 3-390cc Shaving system for Christmas. Set it up and let it clean/charge that evening. It comes with the shaver, the charging/cleaning stand, a container of cleaning solution, a charging cable, a travel case for the shaver, and a small cleaning brush. Used the new shaver this morning and it was so smooth I had to keep checking to see if it was even cutting the hair. It did a great job. The charging stand lights up blue where the solution is and the shaver has lights on it to show charging and cleaning. Wonderful gift and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have been a razor shave ll my life and was wanting to try an electric razor instead of my disposable ones. I have used this for a month now and perhaps my expectations are too high.I would think I could get a decent close shave...not the case I can go over and over the same areas on my face a number of times and the shave is NO WHERE near that of a $1.00 disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see the stubble in the mirror and yet this razor never gets the job done no matter what..Guess I will stick with what does the job..Disposable..</li>
            <li> I recently bought this shaver for my husband for Christmas. He&#x27;d had a Braun older series&lt;br /&gt;for over 8 years and it was time to invest in a new one. I was happy when he told me it cut&lt;br /&gt;well, didn&#x27;t cause any pulling or pain (as a previous norelco had done) and seemed&lt;br /&gt;genuinely pleased with the shaver :) I&#x27;m glad we bought another Braun. We haven&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;had any issues and I&#x27;m sure this will not be our last successful purchase with this brand!</li>
            <li> I have tried several electric shavers and none of them worked for my face.  I have a really sensitive face.  I got this product several months ago and it is the only thing I have used 99% times to shave my face with... it took me a few tries to get used to it... it cleans itself. it is really a great affordable shaver.  Around Xmass time I recommended it to a lady I work with as a gift to her husband.</li>
            <li> My husband just received it yesterday.  After he charged it, he did a trial run and was quite satisfied with the results.  It produced a very close shave.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric shaver I tried after 30 years. You would think the technology would be improved, but it&#x27;s not.  Amazon had a deal on replacement cassette and cleaning refills. Bought the shaver and equipment October 2012. This is April 2013 and the shaver is DEAD. Won&#x27;t charge. Won&#x27;t run plugged in. DEAD. Threw everything into the trash bucket this morning. Used it 4-5 times a week. At least once or twice a week I HAD to use a blade shaver to clean up.</li>
            <li> I used to shave with the Gillette Fusion Pro-glide, then purchased this shaver and have never gone back to razors. The reviews that do not compliment this shaver should not be taken into consideration. The only reason to have an issue with this shaver is if it was defective. I am a man with a sensitive neck area and there have not experienced any razor burn (which i have experienced in the past with other shavers and razors). Give you get a good deal I would definitely give this shaver a try.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my son.  It&#x27;s the second shaving system that he has used and he says it&#x27;s great -- much better than the other!</li>
            <li> I gave it a few weeks like the directions say for my skin to get used shaving with this type of razor. I have always shaved my whole life with a Mach 3 and shaving cream etc, was fighting some razor burn and decided to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor burn is far less than it used to be, and I think it will only get better once my skin gets used to the electric razor.  It takes me a little longer to shave with this because of how many times you have to go over the same area, especially the curve of your jaw / neck area.  I still have to touch up very small areas on my neck sometimes if I skip a day of shaving with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, so far it is def. more convenient than lathering up with shaving cream and all that, but it def doesn&#x27;t give you a real close shave like razor, which can actually be good thing sometimes.</li>
            <li> Very good product, sharp blade and yet soft on skin, great shave over andn over, strobgly recommened it. Also good priceing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through many electric shavers, from the Norelco rotary shavers to other Braun foil shavers. This one tops them all. Most electric shavers don&#x27;t feel very good on the skin, but this one was so nice! I barely felt it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t hurt skin to shave, feels nice, cuts well&lt;br /&gt;-Self cleaning&lt;br /&gt;-Charges in an hour&lt;br /&gt;-Quiet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t seem to be very good for travel. I can&#x27;t imagine hauling the base around, especially with the liquid it uses for cleaning</li>
            <li> Love how close this shaver gets. It can be used wet, but not in the shower. Take care because one of the video reviews is for two products, one of which CAN be used &#x27;right in the shower&#x27;. This one can&#x27;t. If you&#x27;re looking for a shower safe version, pay a little more.</li>
            <li> This is my third Braun.  This one does shave fine but the cleaning method is not very user friendly.  The automatic system can be a fire hazard and it should not be used on a mirror surface so I elected not to use it.  Manual cleaning requires washing, drying and oiling.  You cannot clean the Shaver with a brush.  This is my only complaint.</li>
            <li> I have used Braun shavers for years but this was an unexpected surprise.  I never thought I would like the cleaning/charging aspect of the new shavers but this one is simple to use and has far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I think it goes through the cleaning solution too fast.</li>
            <li> I bought it in $39.99 . I have to say  With this price it&#x27;s good enough. Not matter you want to use it for yourself or you send it to your friend as a gift.</li>
            <li> Shaving clean, suitable for their own use, to give as gifts is also very good.I use for the first time, I feel very good</li>
            <li> I have only owned Braun shavers in the past.  3 previous models.  I&#x27;m very happy with the quality of this model and and great value at the price.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product and a good price. I had been looking for a replacement for my old Braun and found this and the sale prices were to good to pass up.</li>
            <li> It is probably the nicest electric shaver that I have owned. It works very well for about 90% of my face, but the other 10% I end up having to use a traditional razor to clean up. I was hoping that my facial hair would adjust and it would get better, but after 2 months it still has this issue. This is the same issue that I have always had with electric shavers though. Other than that the things cuts really close on the rest of the face, and leaves it almost as smooth as a traditional razor.</li>
            <li> had a norelco triple head...figured this has alot of hype, I&#x27;d try it....it pinched....back&lt;br /&gt;broke in short while..I mean I hated it! 1 thing was good (charged quickly) but it also&lt;br /&gt;lost power quickly!  I went back to my OLD norelco...immediate relief! Get this, just today I pulled&lt;br /&gt;out old braun...tried it yet again....pinched YET again....threw it away then came back here and I post&lt;br /&gt;like once a decade..this thing DESERVED this 1 star....it was pitiful!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this back in late 2010 and used it for about 2.5 years before the cleaning base would not longer clean the shaver; it would just charge it. The sliding mustache lever also seemed to have to be held after a few months use in order to shave my mustache area. It worked adequately enough before the cleanign stopped working, and I had great luck with previous Braun shavers, so I will get something in the 7 series and hope it lasts the typical 6-7 years I&#x27;d been getting out of their products (before I simply opt for a newer model, not because they stop working).</li>
            <li> Just as described, this is what I want at a reasonable cost. The price is not the lowest at the time I bought it, there were more discounts before. But still affordable.</li>
