    <ol>
            <li>Great to travel with!</li>
            <li>So after six moths I started this product and it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li>and it is at the best price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t help but let everyone know what a wonderful product this is!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These are perfect!</li>
            <li>very good product.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t felt this good in years!</li>
            <li>bones not achy on mile runs; that&#x27;s good!  </li>
            <li>The beautiful difference was that I used this product, and</li>
            <li>Emerita progest is a great bioidentical progesterone replacement.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think words exist to convey how happy I am with this product and the impact it has already made on my life.</li>
            <li>Christiane Northrup&#x27;s books are a great resource</li>
            <li>These are great for traveling.</li>
            <li>I bought this cream because of the great reviews.</li>
            <li>The best of its kind on the market.</li>
            <li>The order came on time and in good condition.  </li>
            <li>I had used Emerita products years ago and loved them.  </li>
            <li>Superior product.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I followed her advice!</li>
            <li>What an amazing product.  </li>
            <li>All in all though I like it as much as I liked the prescription kind.</li>
            <li>and I also noticed the changes in my skin tone (nice add-on).</li>
            <li>that at times I thought I was going to spontaneously combust.  </li>
            <li>Even before she ever started on the Pro-Gest cream of any kind, her demeanor was never like this, but with this Packet cream, I have never seen her like this.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t remember when I felt so good and more me than ever.  </li>
            <li>So I took matters into my own hands.</li>
            <li>As a teen, I had perfect skin, effortless periods and was always in a good mood.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Hope it gets better and better!</li>
            <li>The best thing, though, is that I got pregnant -- and stayed pregnant.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love Pro-Gest cream!  </li>
            <li>My doctor confirmed that the company is very reputable.</li>
            <li>Love the pre-measured packets.  </li>
            <li>I have more energy, I am in just a better mood, I&#x27;m *happier</li>
            <li>I am so grateful that this product exists and that I have had such a wonderful experience with it.</li>
            <li>For baby dust:) we will see if this helps...</li>
            <li>During peri-menopause and menopause, this product has helped me to feel better.</li>
            <li>SO GLAD</li>
            <li>Decided to try this product since I&#x27;ve had many, many hormonal issues since going off the pill, acne and weight gain being the two biggest problems.</li>
            <li>helps me with PMS, i  love it.</li>
            <li>Love the individualized portions.</li>
            <li>Could not ask for more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be sure to post when she does.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use according to directions.  </li>
            <li>Im glad to be taking this product to become a healthier me</li>
            <li>you do not need more than one a day.</li>
            <li>heartburn is better (not as strong or as often), I sleep through the night (yipee)</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price and the sanity that I have gained with sleeping better at night!</li>
            <li>packets are ideal, making it easier to apply on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>I have tried other brands but this product works the best for me.  </li>
            <li>BUT...I just found out from my OBGYN, that it isn&#x27;t such a great idea to go for more than 5 years on any hormonal supplement.  </li>
            <li>It makes easy to get through the airport lines.  </li>
            <li>It is so easy to use being in prefilled packets.  </li>
            <li>The cream is easy to use (pre-measured) in 20 mg  units.  </li>
            <li>this product was easy to use and worked well for me</li>
            <li>I am convinced that this product is the reason I have my beautiful third child, and if I could hug the people who produce it, I would!</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly!</li>
            <li>I smile more, I play with my children more, and I have a more positive outlook.</li>
            <li>Overall a great product.</li>
            <li>And it is more economical.</li>
            <li>and we keep the house temperature in a comfortable zone for all, but now not for her.</li>
            <li>I used it throughout the entire pregnancy, and felt great.  </li>
            <li>just didn&#x27;t fit into my schedule.  </li>
            <li>It has no smell and in pre-measured form it is super easy to use.</li>
            <li>Since going off the pill, I steadily gained 20 pounds over 2-3 years and watched my relatively nice skin become mottled and scarred.</li>
            <li>I was so excited at this product being delivered.</li>
            <li>The hot flashes began to diminish and I haven&#x27;t had any in the last 2 weeks, which makes life much more pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Once I saw the changes happening, I switched to 1 full packet per day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and it really works!</li>
            <li>this time-- I stayed pregnant.  </li>
            <li>Phenoxyethanol is ranked among the top 10 most likely chemicals to create allergic reactions in users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I hoped I&#x27;d be one of the lucky ones, but this product exacerbated my problems.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m beginning to dislike the medical profession more and more and agree...</li>
            <li>No unpleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use very convenient</li>
            <li>I loved that it was single packaged because I wasn&#x27;t going to sit and measure it out.</li>
            <li>Hot flashes and night sweats are gone!  </li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;ve noticed that I really have a deep sense of happiness after I apply the cream.</li>
            <li>Even if one needed 40 mg it would still be economical to use 2 packets a day.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is a risk worth taking and in my case it proved not to be.</li>
            <li>In short, this product is awesome and I highly recommend it to anyone who has suffered from what I listed above.</li>
            <li>absorbs quickly and label details how much of progesterone per serving/packet.  </li>
            <li>great product for a lot of female conditions, and overall stabilizer for hormones.</li>
            <li>Really helped with the yucky hot flashes and exhaustion!</li>
            <li>Hot flashes have lessened in intensity and frequency.  </li>
            <li>I felt so incredibly hot</li>
            <li>Ran out once and my husband gladly offered to run to our local health food store to get it for me!</li>
            <li>this makes it not only easier to be sure I&#x27;m using the correct amount, but also using a consistent amount on a day-to-day basis.  </li>
            <li>I never write reviews, especially for a product with this many reviews already.  </li>
            <li>The first month, the relief from my PMDD was noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I purchased to minimize hot flashes and have been using it a couple of months.</li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;ll buy the tube and just use more.</li>
            <li>I used to have a hot flash ever hour.  </li>
            <li>I had insomnia, hot flashes</li>
            <li>just purchased my second box today, and I don&#x27;t have enough good things to say about this product.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s certainly a testament to how much this stuff helps!</li>
            <li>Simple and easy.</li>
            <li>Love the single packets.</li>
            <li>And when it did start, I had only light cramping that was zapped by one OTC pain pill.</li>
            <li>Too much at one time can make you get morning sickness</li>
            <li>Very convenient.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say much, but it seems to be taking the edge off my PMS-</li>
            <li>But it does work great if you are not severely deficient.</li>
            <li>Con, makes me VERY irritable.</li>
            <li>My ice pack was ready on my night stand, but I never used it.  </li>
            <li>is very convenient.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t seem to do much for me.</li>
            <li>This product did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li>I also find it much easier to take on a trip in this form.</li>
            <li>I have patches of eczema on my body and Pro-Gest cream has proven gentle</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s doing what it should, but it&#x27;s really all subjective so who knows?  </li>
            <li>Very convenient in the single-use packets.  </li>
            <li>I tried to use it for a month straight</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought these though because I was not using anywhere near enough dispensing it myself from the tube.  </li>
            <li>Smells better than a lot of the other ones on the market.</li>
            <li>So far, no ill effects.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m not sure how effective it is.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and reasonably priced from Amazon versus other sources.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this product, started it on a Friday night, by Saturday night, I could count the hot flashes during the day and only had one hot flash at night.  </li>
            <li>Many of these reactions occured at moderate and even low doses.  </li>
            <li>I love it, It does make change while you sleep no more hot flashes .</li>
            <li>Needless to say, there is no way I would try to &amp;#34;push through the estrogen dominance&amp;#34; like so many people recommended, and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t since using DIM, Evening Primrose Oil and Milk Thistle have worked so much</li>
            <li>Highly reccomended.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes.</li>
            <li>Doctors typically won&#x27;t prescribe progesterone without estrogen and due to many adverse effects on the latter, this product is fast safe &amp; alternative for self prescribers.</li>
            <li>It smells kind of icky.</li>
            <li>The cream gets absorbed through the skin, obviously</li>
            <li>It is good for someone who needs only a small amount of progesterone to balance one&#x27;s hormones.  </li>
            <li>This product would be better if it had a scent of some kind and left a little less residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I discussed this with Amazon, and they were gracious and agreed to resolve this problem for us, and a new order for a tube of Pro-Gest cream was placed today.</li>
            <li>One night in the middle of the hot flush</li>
            <li>53 years old and still no menopause!</li>
            <li>Her demeanor changed, her language changed, her hot flashes came back with ferocity.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>so I am not sure if I will continue using because I don&#x27;t want a beard. :)</li>
            <li>The little packets are pretty easy to open and not messy at all.</li>
            <li>I also like the single packets because of using the right amount each time without wasting.</li>
            <li>My skin has cleared up completely, and that is not an exaggeration.</li>
            <li>My anxiety has cleared up considerably.</li>
            <li>I used to buy this at my local Whole Foods but the price there is closer to twenty-five dollars.  </li>
            <li>Works for a 50-something year old.  </li>
            <li>This helped my client with a breast abnormalady along with taking Enzogenol from Wings of Wellness and DIM.  </li>
            <li>It took about 5 days for me to notice the night sweats lessening and took about 2 weeks for them to be completely gone.  </li>
            <li>Glycols are a family of chemicals that are frequently found in paint, lacquer, and even airplane fuel.</li>
            <li>, my knees don&#x27;t hurt as much, my hair is thicker and fuller, my hair is not as oily, my blood pressure is back to where it was before all my problems started, and my blood glucose is lower.</li>
            <li>I chose it because, the natural oral progesterone (pills)</li>
            <li>I had been taking each evening, continued to make me very sleepy the following morning.</li>
            <li>I developed stretch marks on my stomach and the ones on my thighs worsened.</li>
            <li>Thought the individual packs would be economical and help with proper dosing.  </li>
            <li>It was like trying to open something sealed with concrete.  </li>
            <li>I read that people will certain hormonal imbalances are more prone to stretch marks, and whatever this did to my body had that unfortunate effect on me.</li>
            <li>Very mild smell, hardly any.</li>
            <li>Although my period returned for at least the last 3 months of use, I love the cream.</li>
            <li>The single packet packing is a plus, there was no debating on how much to squeeze out.</li>
            <li>The single use packets are convenient since you don&#x27;t need to bother with measuring or just guessing how much cream your using for each application.</li>
            <li>Does not absorb quickly and gets on your clothes and just plain does not work.</li>
            <li>Not a huge fan of the smell of the cream but its better than other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember the last time I had a wild mood swing.</li>
            <li>I buy nearly all non-food merchandise from Amazon, and there is no turning back.</li>
            <li>When I needed natural progesterone in the present, I thought of using their products again.</li>
            <li>I also rubbed it on my thighs because I read to switch up where you apply it because apparently the skin gets \\&quot;used\\&quot; to it over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am only twenty years old, I didn&#x27;t gain any weight, and now I have stretch marks that will never go away.</li>
            <li>My plan for the Pro-Gest is to use it for another few weeks at full strength and then start to cut back and see what happens.  </li>
            <li>I also noticed the first week I began using this cream that my stomach seemed visibly flatter and less bloated</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s this product alone or in combination with black cohosh, but I was having hot flashes just about hourly, day and night.  </li>
            <li>I have less hot flashes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking of purchasing this due to the ease of using packets, but see no info on how much progesterone is in each packet.  </li>
            <li>Went directly to the back of the book where a listing of all the brands of cream which actually work were.</li>
            <li>[past the &#x27;pause time as I am 65], irritability, mood swings, mental sluggness, depression, vaginal dryness and just not happy when my life is so good!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind if I feel better and perhaps the dry, dry skin will resolve, at least some.</li>

            <li> And it is more economical.</li>
            <li> and we keep the house temperature in a comfortable zone for all, but now not for her.</li>
            <li> I used it throughout the entire pregnancy, and felt great.  </li>
            <li> just didn&#x27;t fit into my schedule.  </li>
            <li> It has no smell and in pre-measured form it is super easy to use.</li>
            <li> Since going off the pill, I steadily gained 20 pounds over 2-3 years and watched my relatively nice skin become mottled and scarred.</li>
            <li> I was so excited at this product being delivered.</li>
            <li> The hot flashes began to diminish and I haven&#x27;t had any in the last 2 weeks, which makes life much more pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Once I saw the changes happening, I switched to 1 full packet per day.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and it really works!</li>
            <li> this time-- I stayed pregnant.  </li>
            <li> Phenoxyethanol is ranked among the top 10 most likely chemicals to create allergic reactions in users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hoped I&#x27;d be one of the lucky ones, but this product exacerbated my problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m beginning to dislike the medical profession more and more and agree...</li>
            <li> No unpleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use very convenient</li>
            <li> I loved that it was single packaged because I wasn&#x27;t going to sit and measure it out.</li>
            <li> Hot flashes and night sweats are gone!  </li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;ve noticed that I really have a deep sense of happiness after I apply the cream.</li>
            <li> Even if one needed 40 mg it would still be economical to use 2 packets a day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is a risk worth taking and in my case it proved not to be.</li>
            <li> In short, this product is awesome and I highly recommend it to anyone who has suffered from what I listed above.</li>
            <li> absorbs quickly and label details how much of progesterone per serving/packet.  </li>
            <li> great product for a lot of female conditions, and overall stabilizer for hormones.</li>
            <li> Really helped with the yucky hot flashes and exhaustion!</li>
            <li> Hot flashes have lessened in intensity and frequency.  </li>
            <li> I felt so incredibly hot</li>
            <li> Ran out once and my husband gladly offered to run to our local health food store to get it for me!</li>
            <li> this makes it not only easier to be sure I&#x27;m using the correct amount, but also using a consistent amount on a day-to-day basis.  </li>
            <li> I never write reviews, especially for a product with this many reviews already.  </li>
            <li> The first month, the relief from my PMDD was noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I purchased to minimize hot flashes and have been using it a couple of months.</li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;ll buy the tube and just use more.</li>
            <li> I used to have a hot flash ever hour.  </li>
            <li> I had insomnia, hot flashes</li>
            <li> just purchased my second box today, and I don&#x27;t have enough good things to say about this product.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s certainly a testament to how much this stuff helps!</li>
            <li> Simple and easy.</li>
            <li> Love the single packets.</li>
            <li> And when it did start, I had only light cramping that was zapped by one OTC pain pill.</li>
            <li> Too much at one time can make you get morning sickness</li>
            <li> Very convenient.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say much, but it seems to be taking the edge off my PMS-</li>
            <li> But it does work great if you are not severely deficient.</li>
            <li> Con, makes me VERY irritable.</li>
            <li> My ice pack was ready on my night stand, but I never used it.  </li>
            <li> is very convenient.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to do much for me.</li>
            <li> This product did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li> I also find it much easier to take on a trip in this form.</li>
            <li> I have patches of eczema on my body and Pro-Gest cream has proven gentle</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s doing what it should, but it&#x27;s really all subjective so who knows?  </li>
            <li> Very convenient in the single-use packets.  </li>
            <li> I tried to use it for a month straight</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought these though because I was not using anywhere near enough dispensing it myself from the tube.  </li>
            <li> Smells better than a lot of the other ones on the market.</li>
            <li> So far, no ill effects.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not sure how effective it is.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and reasonably priced from Amazon versus other sources.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this product, started it on a Friday night, by Saturday night, I could count the hot flashes during the day and only had one hot flash at night.  </li>
            <li> Many of these reactions occured at moderate and even low doses.  </li>
            <li> I love it, It does make change while you sleep no more hot flashes .</li>
            <li> Needless to say, there is no way I would try to &amp;#34;push through the estrogen dominance&amp;#34; like so many people recommended, and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t since using DIM, Evening Primrose Oil and Milk Thistle have worked so much</li>
            <li> Highly reccomended.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes.</li>
            <li> Doctors typically won&#x27;t prescribe progesterone without estrogen and due to many adverse effects on the latter, this product is fast safe &amp; alternative for self prescribers.</li>
            <li> It smells kind of icky.</li>
            <li> The cream gets absorbed through the skin, obviously</li>
            <li> It is good for someone who needs only a small amount of progesterone to balance one&#x27;s hormones.  </li>
            <li> This product would be better if it had a scent of some kind and left a little less residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I discussed this with Amazon, and they were gracious and agreed to resolve this problem for us, and a new order for a tube of Pro-Gest cream was placed today.</li>
            <li> One night in the middle of the hot flush</li>
            <li> 53 years old and still no menopause!</li>
            <li> Her demeanor changed, her language changed, her hot flashes came back with ferocity.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> so I am not sure if I will continue using because I don&#x27;t want a beard. :)</li>
            <li> The little packets are pretty easy to open and not messy at all.</li>
            <li> I also like the single packets because of using the right amount each time without wasting.</li>
            <li> My skin has cleared up completely, and that is not an exaggeration.</li>
            <li> My anxiety has cleared up considerably.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this at my local Whole Foods but the price there is closer to twenty-five dollars.  </li>
            <li> Works for a 50-something year old.  </li>
            <li> This helped my client with a breast abnormalady along with taking Enzogenol from Wings of Wellness and DIM.  </li>
            <li> It took about 5 days for me to notice the night sweats lessening and took about 2 weeks for them to be completely gone.  </li>
            <li> Glycols are a family of chemicals that are frequently found in paint, lacquer, and even airplane fuel.</li>
            <li> , my knees don&#x27;t hurt as much, my hair is thicker and fuller, my hair is not as oily, my blood pressure is back to where it was before all my problems started, and my blood glucose is lower.</li>
            <li> I chose it because, the natural oral progesterone (pills)</li>
            <li> I had been taking each evening, continued to make me very sleepy the following morning.</li>
            <li> I developed stretch marks on my stomach and the ones on my thighs worsened.</li>
            <li> Thought the individual packs would be economical and help with proper dosing.  </li>
            <li> It was like trying to open something sealed with concrete.  </li>
            <li> I read that people will certain hormonal imbalances are more prone to stretch marks, and whatever this did to my body had that unfortunate effect on me.</li>
            <li> Very mild smell, hardly any.</li>
            <li> Although my period returned for at least the last 3 months of use, I love the cream.</li>
            <li> The single packet packing is a plus, there was no debating on how much to squeeze out.</li>
            <li> The single use packets are convenient since you don&#x27;t need to bother with measuring or just guessing how much cream your using for each application.</li>
            <li> Does not absorb quickly and gets on your clothes and just plain does not work.</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of the smell of the cream but its better than other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember the last time I had a wild mood swing.</li>
            <li> I buy nearly all non-food merchandise from Amazon, and there is no turning back.</li>
            <li> When I needed natural progesterone in the present, I thought of using their products again.</li>
            <li> I also rubbed it on my thighs because I read to switch up where you apply it because apparently the skin gets \\&quot;used\\&quot; to it over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am only twenty years old, I didn&#x27;t gain any weight, and now I have stretch marks that will never go away.</li>
            <li> My plan for the Pro-Gest is to use it for another few weeks at full strength and then start to cut back and see what happens.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed the first week I began using this cream that my stomach seemed visibly flatter and less bloated</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s this product alone or in combination with black cohosh, but I was having hot flashes just about hourly, day and night.  </li>
            <li> I have less hot flashes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking of purchasing this due to the ease of using packets, but see no info on how much progesterone is in each packet.  </li>
            <li> Went directly to the back of the book where a listing of all the brands of cream which actually work were.</li>
            <li> [past the &#x27;pause time as I am 65], irritability, mood swings, mental sluggness, depression, vaginal dryness and just not happy when my life is so good!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind if I feel better and perhaps the dry, dry skin will resolve, at least some.</li>
            <li> But I haven&#x27;t had any problems with depression or anything else common to menopause, only maybe like three hot</li>
            <li> My wife for past few years had been using the Pro-Gest Body Cream from the tube, not the single packets, and her life was splendid, minimum hot flashes, no bursts of anger etc, no bursts of language for no apparent reason.</li>
            <li> will definitely be using this product for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have only had it for a few days and WOW!</li>
            <li> The product is a little older than I expected, as the packaging has changed and this is the old packaging, but other than that it works.</li>
            <li> Wow, what a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> so why would they want us feeling better and cutting back on doctor appointments?  </li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve tried the single use pkts, I realize that I wasn&#x27;t using enough of the product before.</li>
            <li> Some doctors (very few yet), believe women should take hormones all their lives and skip over the misery and diseases from not having decent levels of hormones.</li>
            <li> ... at 52-1/2 lost period, lost libido and started having minor heat flashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d check with my Doctor about the benefits of taking Pro-Gest over others, but also how long you should be on ANYthing.  </li>
            <li> We usually live 30 years past menopause, so why spend them suffering?</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they are causing their customers to do little more than exchange one set of serious concerns for a new set entirely.</li>
            <li> Now my Anxiety is through the roof, my skin is so dry, it burns.  </li>
            <li> I like the single packet size.  </li>
            <li> pro gest cream 48 single use packs by emerita.</li>
            <li> Other than that, the packaging is nice and the smell isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> I dreaded the anger, anxiety, physical pain, cramps -- pretty much every symptom to the extreme.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 24 year old woman who began realizing a few months ago that something was just not right with my body.</li>
            <li> This cycle, I only noticed some slight PMS symptoms for about two days before I started my period.</li>
            <li> Terrible hot flashes, so many during the course of the day....</li>
            <li> /&gt;DURING my short use of this product (about a month and a half)</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY.</li>
            <li> I am now 49 years old and I&#x27;ve been using this product for at least 5 years.  </li>
            <li> I used Plan B when I was a naive seventeen year old</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few times</li>
            <li> this was not nearly strong enough for me.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s only gotten worse), and just a general feeling of \\&quot;blah\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> no more crazy mood swings just balance and harmony :)</li>
            <li> This cream along with a couple of other supplements are bringing my hormones into balance.</li>
            <li> I use this when I feel a migraine coming on due to ovulation.</li>
            <li> BE VERY CAREFUL about what you&#x27;re putting in/on your body.</li>
            <li> I love the product, hate this packaging option.</li>
            <li> Extremely convienent!</li>
            <li> I seem less moody.....</li>
            <li> - the cream is supposedly described as &amp;#34;fragrance-free,&amp;#34; but it does have an odd, slightly medicinal smell.</li>
            <li> Put your morning application on the lower half of your body in the morning if you plan to leave the house.</li>
            <li> and if I have a migraine, it is less severe and less in duration.</li>
            <li> started off with half a packet each day for about 1 week.  </li>
            <li> The smell is different from the tube I was using previously, which is not a good thing.  </li>
            <li> Finally, I did some research on all these symptoms and figured out that I had a hormone imbalance -- probably set off by stress and poor dietary habits (in other words, college!).</li>
            <li> Keep in mind each little packet is 20 mg of Progesterone.  </li>
            <li> I even turned off my little fan.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t go down without a fight ladies!</li>
            <li> Babbies had trouble attaching in both preg.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Progesterone creams in the past, but I&#x27;m impatient and now I learn, some women need to give it 3 months before they see some results...</li>
            <li> I am 45 years old and am tired of being tired</li>
            <li> and I was constantly anxious --</li>
            <li> something small could set me off into a rage before I knew it.</li>
            <li> For the past six or seven years (basically, since I had my kids) I have been suffering from chronic fatigue, night sweats, insomnia (have always had this problem</li>
            <li> post menopausal and miserable and getting more so.</li>
            <li> A tip though is to just start with one packet and slowly move to two...</li>
            <li> After doing soul searching and discussing the situation, we agreed that the cream in the Packet was affecting her seriously.</li>
            <li> and thats just icky!</li>
            <li> frustrating truth is that manufacturers are making the switch to Phenoxyethanol to steer away from parabens and formaldehyde donors.</li>
            <li> If I failed to start, I use this for about 3 days and it would bring on my period.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical of course, but I trusted her suggestion</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> Horrible night sweats, not much sleep....</li>
            <li> I was desperate for something to help me with my menopause symptoms.</li>
            <li> I was desperate for relief.  </li>
            <li> I was so desperate to get relief that I used Emerita on a hunch</li>
            <li> After two dosages, I ballooned another 7-8 pounds over night, and felt crazy and hyper-emotional, like the pill used to make me feel.</li>
            <li> It is truly depressing.</li>
            <li> sad :(  </li>
            <li> I used another progesterone cream and it amplified the anger to the point I was afraid to use it ever again.  </li>
            <li> Its not so bad though.</li>
            <li> and I broke out extremely bad.  </li>
            <li> &gt;:(</li>
            <li> but it caused a very painful menstruated cycle.</li>
            <li> I began developing horrible cystic acne that no amount of cleansing and exfoliating could control.</li>
            <li> Smells horrible.</li>
            <li> I was completely miserable with PMDD every month.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Seems to be helping with the dryness.  Easy to use and reasonably priced from Amazon versus other sources.  Will continue using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 24 year old woman who began realizing a few months ago that something was just not right with my body. As a teen, I had perfect skin, effortless periods and was always in a good mood. That began changing about two years ago. I began developing horrible cystic acne that no amount of cleansing and exfoliating could control. My moods began to constantly swing out of control and I was constantly anxious -- something small could set me off into a rage before I knew it. PMS seemed like it lasted all month. Darker body hair began cropping up in unwanted spots. Finally, I did some research on all these symptoms and figured out that I had a hormone imbalance -- probably set off by stress and poor dietary habits (in other words, college!). I bought this and began using one packet per day after ovulation each month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started my third period today since I started using this product, and I have to say that I feel like a completely different person. My skin has cleared up completely, and that is not an exaggeration. I don&#x27;t remember the last time I had a wild mood swing. In fact, I&#x27;ve noticed that I really have a deep sense of happiness after I apply the cream. My anxiety has cleared up considerably. This cycle, I only noticed some slight PMS symptoms for about two days before I started my period. And when it did start, I had only light cramping that was zapped by one OTC pain pill. I also noticed the first week I began using this cream that my stomach seemed visibly flatter and less bloated feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just purchased my second box today, and I don&#x27;t have enough good things to say about this product.</li>
            <li> The order came on time and in good condition.  The product is a little older than I expected, as the packaging has changed and this is the old packaging, but other than that it works. I&#x27;ll order again in the future.</li>
            <li> Great to travel with! No unpleasant smell.  Absorbs quickly!</li>
            <li> It works for what I need it for. I loved that it was single packaged because I wasn&#x27;t going to sit and measure it out. Only one issue with it... It smells kind of icky. Its not so bad though. A tip though is to just start with one packet and slowly move to two... Too much at one time can make you get morning sickness and thats just icky! All in all though I like it as much as I liked the prescription kind.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands but this product works the best for me.  Love the pre-measured packets.  Very convenient.  Don&#x27;t go down without a fight ladies!</li>
            <li> I was desperate for something to help me with my menopause symptoms. I am 45 years old and am tired of being tired so i purchased this product. I was so excited at this product being delivered. Wow, what a huge disappointment. Smells horrible. Does not absorb quickly and gets on your clothes and just plain does not work. Will go to GNC and purchase their product that comes in a stand up pump dispenser. DO NOT WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY.</li>
            <li> ... at 52-1/2 lost period, lost libido and started having minor heat flashes. One night in the middle of the hot flush I remembered a book I read 20 years ago: \\&quot;What your doctor did not tell you about your menapause\\&quot; and it was still on my book shelf. Went directly to the back of the book where a listing of all the brands of cream which actually work were. A week later via Amazon started using this pre-measured product. Within 2 weeks no more Hot Flushes, libido is back and I also noticed the changes in my skin tone (nice add-on). Although my period returned for at least the last 3 months of use, I love the cream. It has no smell and in pre-measured form it is super easy to use. Thanks Emerita - I am your fan!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few times so I can&#x27;t say much, but it seems to be taking the edge off my PMS- it was delivered just in time! Very mild smell, hardly any. I apply it to my inner arms- bicep to wrist. Hope it gets better and better!</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering this product. The single packet packing is a plus, there was no debating on how much to squeeze out. Overall a great product.</li>
            <li> Emerita progest is a great bioidentical progesterone replacement.  Keep in mind each little packet is 20 mg of Progesterone.  You may need a blood test to know if you have low progesterone levels and/or how low they are and if you need supplementing with this.  I tried supplementing as directed on the box and it wasn&#x27;t enough.  I went to a homeopathic doctor to get a blood test and found out this was not nearly strong enough for me.  But it does work great if you are not severely deficient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this several times when I haven&#x27;t started my period on time. If I failed to start, I use this for about 3 days and it would bring on my period.  Con, makes me VERY irritable.</li>
            <li> Ordered this product on the recommendation of someone to help with a skin irratation&lt;br /&gt;that seems to be linked with my horomones. It does seem to be helping and the single&lt;br /&gt;use packets are ideal, making it easier to apply on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> 53 years old and still no menopause! I&#x27;ve been using this stuff&lt;br /&gt;since I was 45.  It&#x27;s easy to use and it really works!</li>
            <li> For the past six or seven years (basically, since I had my kids) I have been suffering from chronic fatigue, night sweats, insomnia (have always had this problem but it&#x27;s only gotten worse), and just a general feeling of \\&quot;blah\\&quot;. Knowing this, a friend of mine (who had been having these same problems) suggested this product that she found that had helped her. I was skeptical of course, but I trusted her suggestion and I ordered this product. I have only had it for a few days and WOW! I am so glad I followed her advice! I haven&#x27;t felt this good in years! I have more energy, I am in just a better mood, I&#x27;m *happier*! I am so grateful that this product exists and that I have had such a wonderful experience with it. I don&#x27;t think words exist to convey how happy I am with this product and the impact it has already made on my life. I smile more, I play with my children more, and I have a more positive outlook. In short, this product is awesome and I highly recommend it to anyone who has suffered from what I listed above. Even though it&#x27;s marketed to meopause/perimenopause women, it is also recommended for women who have cycle changes or want relief from PMS.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a recommendation from a friend.  I have definitely seen an improvement. Hot flashes have lessened in intensity and frequency.  I also like the single packets because of using the right amount each time without wasting.</li>
            <li> Terrible hot flashes, so many during the course of the day....I&#x27;d lost count.  Horrible night sweats, not much sleep....I&#x27;d taken to sleeping with ice packs, lying above the sheets and a fan blowing on my body, as my A/C kept the room at 78 degrees.  I felt so incredibly hot that at times I thought I was going to spontaneously combust.  I was desperate for relief.  I ordered this product, started it on a Friday night, by Saturday night, I could count the hot flashes during the day and only had one hot flash at night.  Today is Tuesday and for the last two nights, no night sweats.  My ice pack was ready on my night stand, but I never used it.  I even turned off my little fan.  I&#x27;m keeping my fingers crossed that this stuff keeps working.  I&#x27;m also taking, calcium, Vitamin E and B vitamins.  I&#x27;m still taking Estrovin even though it seems to have stopped working.  When all the Estrovin is gone I won&#x27;t buy it again.  My plan for the Pro-Gest is to use it for another few weeks at full strength and then start to cut back and see what happens.  So far, no ill effects.</li>
            <li> So I got last week on day 4. My peoriods are not regular and I&#x27;m hoping this helps. Lost two pregnancies  last year. Babbies had trouble attaching in both preg.I got the individual pkgs. Which. I like a lot. Hoping. For baby dust:) we will see if this helps...</li>
            <li> Recommended by a friend and now I recommend it too. Been on it for about 10 months and I won&#x27;t be without it. Ran out once and my husband gladly offered to run to our local health food store to get it for me! That&#x27;s certainly a testament to how much this stuff helps!</li>
            <li> During peri-menopause and menopause, this product has helped me to feel better. While not a total panacea, it has helped my sleep, energy and seems to lessen my Rosacea. I prefer the 4 oz tube over the packets - I can control the dose. And it is more economical. I recommend everyone to educate themselves on the role of progesterone especially in relation to estrogen. Christiane Northrup&#x27;s books are a great resource</li>
            <li> I am now 49 years old and I&#x27;ve been using this product for at least 5 years.  It seemed to work wonders for me during peri-menopause and now menopause.  I had suffered from postpartum depression during the childbearing years and was told by my practitioner that it could return when I got to that stage in life.  But I haven&#x27;t had any problems with depression or anything else common to menopause, only maybe like three hot flashes.&lt;br /&gt;  ***  I used to buy this at my local Whole Foods but the price there is closer to twenty-five dollars.  ***</li>
            <li> BUT...I just found out from my OBGYN, that it isn&#x27;t such a great idea to go for more than 5 years on any hormonal supplement.  I&#x27;d check with my Doctor about the benefits of taking Pro-Gest over others, but also how long you should be on ANYthing.  --Just to be safe.&lt;br /&gt;This is very convenient.</li>
            <li> Easy to use very convenient</li>
            <li> I like the single packet size.  It makes easy to get through the airport lines.  Plus there is no measuring!</li>
            <li> This product would be better if it had a scent of some kind and left a little less residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;m not sure how effective it is. It didn&#x27;t seem to do much for me.</li>
            <li> Works for a 50-something year old.  At the change of life, I had lost some desire...this product makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s this product alone or in combination with black cohosh, but I was having hot flashes just about hourly, day and night.  I read up on suggestions, and began using this product.  The hot flashes began to diminish and I haven&#x27;t had any in the last 2 weeks, which makes life much more pleasant.  I&#x27;d recommend trying this product to see if you have the same results.</li>
            <li> This product did absolutely nothing for me. I was hoping it would help with with my female issues, but I didn&#x27;t notice a change  at all.</li>
            <li> My wife for past few years had been using the Pro-Gest Body Cream from the tube, not the single packets, and her life was splendid, minimum hot flashes, no bursts of anger etc, no bursts of language for no apparent reason. When it was time to order the tube again, about a month ago, she thought to use the individual packets for convenience. Well she was on the packets for a period of 2-3 weeks, and boy has she changed. Her demeanor changed, her language changed, her hot flashes came back with ferocity. We are a family of 4 and we keep the house temperature in a comfortable zone for all, but now not for her. Even before she ever started on the Pro-Gest cream of any kind, her demeanor was never like this, but with this Packet cream, I have never seen her like this. After doing soul searching and discussing the situation, we agreed that the cream in the Packet was affecting her seriously. We agreed that the current condition must be caused by a reaction to the cream, and it must be stopped, and she is to return to the cream in the tube. I discussed this with Amazon, and they were gracious and agreed to resolve this problem for us, and a new order for a tube of Pro-Gest cream was placed today. Thank you Amazon. I buy nearly all non-food merchandise from Amazon, and there is no turning back.</li>
            <li> Could be psychosomatic ........but I think it does what it claims.  purpose of product is to balance hormones and build bones. I seem less moody.....bones not achy on mile runs; that&#x27;s good!  absorbs quickly and label details how much of progesterone per serving/packet.  Doctors typically won&#x27;t prescribe progesterone without estrogen and due to many adverse effects on the latter, this product is fast safe &amp; alternative for self prescribers.</li>
            <li> I had surgery and tried pellet therapy with side affects. So after six moths I started this product and it&#x27;s awesome. I will continue this because it WORKS and it is at the best price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use being in prefilled packets.  This cream along with a couple of other supplements are bringing my hormones into balance.</li>
            <li> Used Pro-gest once before with no discernible results.  Now that I&#x27;ve tried the single use pkts, I realize that I wasn&#x27;t using enough of the product before. This time, I am achieving the desired results.  Packaged like this makes it not only easier to be sure I&#x27;m using the correct amount, but also using a consistent amount on a day-to-day basis.  I also find it much easier to take on a trip in this form.</li>
            <li> This helped my client with a breast abnormalady along with taking Enzogenol from Wings of Wellness and DIM.  Recent Thermography shows abnormality is gone!  Yeah!</li>
            <li> very good product.  And it does have the USP stamp.</li>
            <li> Emerita Pro-Gest cream is non-greasy and fast-absorbing. Applied twice daily, it has helped balance my hormone levels. The single use packets are convenient since you don&#x27;t need to bother with measuring or just guessing how much cream your using for each application. Do follow the directions about where on your body to apply the cream and to rotate application areas. I have patches of eczema on my body and Pro-Gest cream has proven gentle and I remain rash-free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI - the cream is supposedly described as &amp;#34;fragrance-free,&amp;#34; but it does have an odd, slightly medicinal smell. Nothing noxious, but you catch a whiff even if you&#x27;re wearing perfume. Pro-Tip: Put your morning application on the lower half of your body in the morning if you plan to leave the house. This way, you aren&#x27;t smelling Pro-Gest on your chest all morning while at work and won&#x27;t be self-conscious about it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the affects of chemical estrogen/progesterone that my doctor prescribed. I would have 3- migraines. A friend suggested Pro-Gest cream. Wow! What a difference! I have less hot flashes and if I have a migraine, it is less severe and less in duration.</li>
            <li> Have been using for almost 2 months.  Hot flashes and night sweats are gone!  What an amazing product.  It took about 5 days for me to notice the night sweats lessening and took about 2 weeks for them to be completely gone.  Definitely worth the price and the sanity that I have gained with sleeping better at night!</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, especially for a product with this many reviews already.  I can&#x27;t help but let everyone know what a wonderful product this is!  I was completely miserable with PMDD every month.  I dreaded the anger, anxiety, physical pain, cramps -- pretty much every symptom to the extreme.  I used another progesterone cream and it amplified the anger to the point I was afraid to use it ever again.  What I didn&#x27;t realize is that I was using an inferior product.  I was so desperate to get relief that I used Emerita on a hunch and I AM SO GLAD I DID.  The first month, the relief from my PMDD was noticeable.  The best thing, though, is that I got pregnant -- and stayed pregnant.  I had two children, then, several years later, a series of miscarriage -- three in a year, all before 8 weeks.  The beautiful difference was that I used this product, and this time-- I stayed pregnant.  I used it throughout the entire pregnancy, and felt great.  I am convinced that this product is the reason I have my beautiful third child, and if I could hug the people who produce it, I would!</li>
            <li> These are great for traveling. I bought these so that when I am away from home I don&#x27;t have to bring the big tube.&lt;br /&gt;These are perfect!</li>
            <li> I bought this cream because of the great reviews. I stopped using it after I researched one of the ingredients, Phenoxyethanol.&lt;br /&gt;This chemical is an aromatic glycol ether. It begins as phenol, which is a toxic powder created from benzene and treated with ethylene oxide and an alkalai. Both benzene and ethylene oxide are known carcinogens. Glycols are a family of chemicals that are frequently found in paint, lacquer, and even airplane fuel. Why would we want to rub cream made from this onto our skin?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is restricted for use in Japan because it has been linked to central nervous depression, eye and lung irritation. Many of these reactions occured at moderate and even low doses.  Phenoxyethanol is ranked among the top 10 most likely chemicals to create allergic reactions in users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The frustrating truth is that manufacturers are making the switch to Phenoxyethanol to steer away from parabens and formaldehyde donors. Unfortunately, they are causing their customers to do little more than exchange one set of serious concerns for a new set entirely. Phenoxyethanol should be avoided when at all possible.</li>
            <li> Thought the individual packs would be economical and help with proper dosing.  It was like trying to open something sealed with concrete.  I love the product, hate this packaging option.</li>
            <li> Decided to try this product since I&#x27;ve had many, many hormonal issues since going off the pill, acne and weight gain being the two biggest problems. Since going off the pill, I steadily gained 20 pounds over 2-3 years and watched my relatively nice skin become mottled and scarred. I hoped I&#x27;d be one of the lucky ones, but this product exacerbated my problems. After two dosages, I ballooned another 7-8 pounds over night, and felt crazy and hyper-emotional, like the pill used to make me feel. Needless to say, there is no way I would try to &amp;#34;push through the estrogen dominance&amp;#34; like so many people recommended, and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t since using DIM, Evening Primrose Oil and Milk Thistle have worked so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would never, never try again. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I wish I had known about this product 2 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a matter of days, I have felt and seen improvements to my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My heartburn is better (not as strong or as often), I sleep through the night (yipee), my knees don&#x27;t hurt as much, my hair is thicker and fuller, my hair is not as oily, my blood pressure is back to where it was before all my problems started, and my blood glucose is lower. My TOM flooding has stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Individual results will vary.... but this product has worked wonders for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been taking this for about 1 month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started off with half a packet each day for about 1 week.  Once I saw the changes happening, I switched to 1 full packet per day.  I have not built up to 2 packets per day because I wanted to increase gradually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be using this product for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Dr. Lee for opening my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking of purchasing this due to the ease of using packets, but see no info on how much progesterone is in each packet.  anyone???????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(thus why I gave one star....haven&#x27;t used the product yet)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m post menopausal and miserable and getting more so. I&#x27;m sorry I quit Hrt about 5 years back when I moved and had to take care of ailing mother and trips to the OB/GYn just didn&#x27;t fit into my schedule.  Now my Anxiety is through the roof, my skin is so dry, it burns.  I&#x27;ve tried Progesterone creams in the past, but I&#x27;m impatient and now I learn, some women need to give it 3 months before they see some results...so I&#x27;m thinking of trying again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have some pump bottles of Estrogen cream, so I guess I&#x27;ll start using those. Emerita I understand has an Estrogen cream, so I&#x27;ll look into that when I&#x27;ve used up the pump bottles. Now to figure out how to use each hormone correctly as a post menopausal woman. Will I get a period again? I don&#x27;t mind if I feel better and perhaps the dry, dry skin will resolve, at least some. Never minded periods anyway.  Some doctors (very few yet), believe women should take hormones all their lives and skip over the misery and diseases from not having decent levels of hormones. We usually live 30 years past menopause, so why spend them suffering? I&#x27;m beginning to dislike the medical profession more and more and agree...women are cash cows so why would they want us feeling better and cutting back on doctor appointments?  &gt;:(</li>
            <li> great product for a lot of female conditions, and overall stabilizer for hormones. helps me with PMS, i  love it.</li>
            <li> This is truly a bio-identical product and makes me feel &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; again.  I especially like the packets that allow for pre-measured dosages.  Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I purchased to minimize hot flashes and have been using it a couple of months. I haven&#x27;t seen any results yet but intend to continue use for another. I have heard it takes awhile to get the affects.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s doing what it should, but it&#x27;s really all subjective so who knows?  The smell is different from the tube I was using previously, which is not a good thing.  I am glad I bought these though because I was not using anywhere near enough dispensing it myself from the tube.  Next time I&#x27;ll buy the tube and just use more.</li>
            <li> I had used Emerita products years ago and loved them.  When I needed natural progesterone in the present, I thought of using their products again. My doctor confirmed that the company is very reputable. The cost is very low.  I chose it because, the natural oral progesterone (pills) I had been taking each evening, continued to make me very sleepy the following morning. The cream gets absorbed through the skin, obviously so I didn&#x27;t have that problem. The cream is easy to use (pre-measured) in 20 mg  units.  It is good for someone who needs only a small amount of progesterone to balance one&#x27;s hormones.  Even if one needed 40 mg it would still be economical to use 2 packets a day.</li>
            <li> Superior product. Love the individualized portions. Extremely convienent! Could not ask for more. Highly reccomended. I will buy this again vey soon.</li>
            <li> I used to have a hot flash ever hour.  Now, maybe 2 a day.  Love, love, love Pro-Gest cream!  Got my sister on this; she too says its a miracle!</li>
            <li> ….and I haven&#x27;t gotten any feedback from her yet on how well it works.  I&#x27;ll be sure to post when she does.</li>
            <li> Gave me a constant headache</li>
            <li> Every woman should consider using this product to enhance the quality of her life!  I had insomnia, hot flashes [past the &#x27;pause time as I am 65], irritability, mood swings, mental sluggness, depression, vaginal dryness and just not happy when my life is so good! With in 24 hours of starting on this, ALL complaints GONE!  I can&#x27;t remember when I felt so good and more me than ever.  Dr. John Lee and Christine Northrup have my deepest graditude and Blessings for their contributions of raising the quality of life for us boomers!</li>
            <li> Very convenient in the single-use packets.  I didn&#x27;t read the directions and I broke out extremely bad.  Make sure you use according to directions.  I am taking a break from it to get my body and skin back on track.  I have also had people tell me that it can cause hair growth so I am not sure if I will continue using because I don&#x27;t want a beard. :)</li>
            <li> Seem to work quite well - use to help regulate my cycle. I noticed my cycle goes off when I don&#x27;t use it. Not a huge fan of the smell of the cream but its better than other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Im glad to be taking this product to become a healthier me no more crazy mood swings just balance and harmony :)</li>
            <li> Simple and easy. It takes the guess work out of progesterone. The little packets are pretty easy to open and not messy at all.</li>
            <li> The best of its kind on the market. Love the single packets. Correct dosing that way. Really helped with the yucky hot flashes and exhaustion! Saved my sanity. Smells better than a lot of the other ones on the market.</li>
            <li> I used Plan B when I was a naive seventeen year old and since then my periods have been all screwed up. I will bleed for an entire month and then not menstruate for another three.  This is my reality. I&#x27;ve gone to a doctor but she did not seem concerned. So I took matters into my own hands. I read that the bleeding can be caused by a hormonal imbalance, so I read up and researched and decided to purchase this product. Most of what you read on the internet about this stuff is opinion, speculation, and merely anecdotal evidence. I read somewhere to rub it on your abdomen over your ovaries (it&#x27;s almost embarrassing to type this out) for two weeks during your cycle. I also rubbed it on my thighs because I read to switch up where you apply it because apparently the skin gets \\&quot;used\\&quot; to it over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DURING my short use of this product (about a month and a half) I developed stretch marks on my stomach and the ones on my thighs worsened. I am only twenty years old, I didn&#x27;t gain any weight, and now I have stretch marks that will never go away. I read that people will certain hormonal imbalances are more prone to stretch marks, and whatever this did to my body had that unfortunate effect on me. And it didn&#x27;t help with my period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously this cream DOES have an effect on your body, but who knows if you&#x27;re wreaking havoc or restoring harmony. I don&#x27;t think it is a risk worth taking and in my case it proved not to be. BE VERY CAREFUL about what you&#x27;re putting in/on your body. I would not want this to happen to anyone else. It is truly depressing. Other than that, the packaging is nice and the smell isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> I use this when I feel a migraine coming on due to ovulation. I tried to use it for a month straight but it caused a very painful menstruated cycle. I will continue to use prior to ovulation along with Advil to relieve some of my migraines.</li>
            <li> pro gest cream 48 single use packs by emerita. this product was easy to use and worked well for me</li>
            <li> Used product for 15 days.  Broke out in hives on areas of the skin I applied the cream to.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately this did not give me time to even see if I would get any benefits out of it.&lt;br /&gt;Very sad :(  I had high hopes.</li>
            <li> I love it, It does make change while you sleep no more hot flashes . but i am using one before bed time. it&#x27;sgood you do not need more than one a day.</li>
    </ol>
