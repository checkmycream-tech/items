            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>Price is good</li>
            <li>We had another Olivia Garden brush that we thought we loved until we got this one.  </li>
            <li>Loved how it felt on my head.</li>
            <li>Somehow this brush makes my fair softer than anything else.  </li>
            <li>and they also loved it.</li>
            <li>Good hairbrush.</li>
            <li>So the company was a pleasure to work with, which was a nice experience, and the brush itself is very nice.</li>
            <li>Super happy with this one!</li>
            <li>Feels good, works well, makes hair look nice.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>I love this brush!  </li>
            <li>The design is really nice</li>
            <li>it works nicely on it.</li>
            <li>is a lot for a hair brush, but let me tell you it is worth EVERY PENNY!!!  </li>
            <li>I had great expectations for this brush considering that a $3 brush I bought before this one does a much better job at getting my hair smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this brush.</li>
            <li>Our favorite brush</li>
            <li>We call it her Magic Brush.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>SO GLAD I made this purchase.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love love love this brush.  </li>
            <li>Our family calls it \\&quot;the magic</li>
            <li>and they confirm that it is magical.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this brush.  </li>
            <li>But SO much static as result.</li>
            <li>Purchase three more for friends</li>
            <li>Had one for myself, had to get more for the family.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this one.</li>
            <li>This brush does not snag and pull at your hair and it makes it look nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Fantastic brush!</li>
            <li>Possibly the BEST hair brush I have ever had!!  </li>
            <li>I really think it is all thanks to the boars hair and this brush is a perfect combo of the two</li>
            <li>It is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for wet hair.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much I got one for my daughter also.</li>
            <li>This brush has lasted me for over 4 months and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li>the bristles and bed of the brush smelled like a strong gas or chemical smell.</li>
            <li>Purchased to replace an older one this brush is proving to be excellent so far.  </li>
            <li>This has quickly become my favorite brush.  </li>
            <li>It gets the tangles out more efficiently and quickly.</li>
            <li>I love this brush, which works great to painlessly smooth my long hair, but it is rather pricey for a plastic brush with ceramic paint.</li>
            <li>Love this brush worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>It brushes smooth and helps with tangles.</li>
            <li>She doesn&#x27;t even flinch and shes knot free witihn seconds.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t compare to the Mason Pearson which is what I really wanted but can not bring myself to spend that kind of $.  </li>
            <li>The boar bristle create shine and and helps smooth my hair when styling while the plastic bristles detangle and comb through all layers of my hair.</li>
            <li>The brush is awesome, but the picture is showing up as a round brush on my account.</li>
            <li>This brush is beyond fantastic.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>Fantastic brush.  </li>
            <li>Nicest part is that it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Love my brush and shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>Worth every dollar!</li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do a thing for static control as it claims, hence the 4 stars instead of 5, but the comfort level and bristle pull quality of this brush was exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>I tried to clean</li>
            <li>By far my favorite hairbrush!</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t feel they are great on wet hair</li>
            <li>I have purchased so many brushes just to discover that I really don&#x27;t like them.</li>
            <li>This brush does the job without leaving that static electric frizzy hair... looks like your ready for Halloween.</li>
            <li>Seriously the name fits the brush perfectly!</li>
            <li>I wanted to get something better that would provide extra shine and see the ceramic + ion magic work.</li>
            <li>It washes very well and the built up product and sebum clean off easily.  </li>
            <li>can quickly brush her hair now with no tears</li>
            <li>I love this new Olivia Garden Hair brush.</li>
            <li>and it is my favorite new hair brush.</li>
            <li>Really gets out tangles pain free.</li>
            <li>so I thought this one was worth a try for home use.</li>
            <li>Since we got this brush, she brushes her own hair several times a day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>I spent my entire life using Denman brushes because I thought they were the best for tangles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good brush just not what I expected.</li>
            <li>It detangles my very long hair beautifully, smooths and distributes natural oils.  </li>
            <li>Was on Amazon buying other brushes and red the reviews on this brush how it&#x27;s great for kids... doesn&#x27;t hurt!</li>
            <li>so much---the brushing surface is not only quite cushy but also flat enough to cover large area at once, which feels amazing.</li>
            <li>This is a very high quality brush and is my instant favorite!</li>
            <li>Your hair will feel smooth and soft after using this brush!</li>
            <li>Very gentle on the head hand it doesn&#x27;t rip your hair out</li>
            <li>It is also very gentle on my scalp.</li>
            <li>It has a smoothing action but is very gentle on fine hair.</li>
            <li>My daughter stole my other brush because she loved it so much.</li>
            <li>At first I was hesitant to buy a brush  </li>
            <li>Great hair brush for removing snarls from thick wavy hair before cleansing.</li>
            <li>This brush definitely does a better job.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold for right or left handers.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t see much difference than other brushes I own.</li>
            <li>and I keep having to do a double take because I can&#x27;t believe how easily and painlessly this got the tangles out of my hair.</li>
            <li>Great for smoothing and styling thick frizzy prone hair!</li>
            <li>I never knew a hair brush could make such a huge difference.</li>
            <li>She asked why I would spend so much $ on a hair brush.</li>
            <li>For the price I paid I expected a lot more from this brush.</li>
            <li>I just wish that someone inexperienced like me would be able to see a difference from a $30 ceramic &amp; ion brush to a Target $3 brush.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much else which maybe shouldn&#x27;t be a surprise in terms of ionic/ceramic shininess, etc.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend  !</li>
            <li>High quality!</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like this hairbrush, from the bristles and the way they are attached to the brush, and how it lays in the hand for ease of use.  </li>
            <li>The brush feels nice in your hand (not cheap but not overly heavy) and works so nice on my hair.</li>
            <li>We have since thrown the other away, since we love this one so much.</li>
            <li>It has really helped with my daughters long fine hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted, combo of natural and plastic bristles, large size, well made and glides through the hair like butter.</li>
            <li>We both have long fine to medium hair.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are the perfect balance between soft enough not to poke or jab your skull, and firm enough to get through your hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad we found each other!</li>
            <li>When you use it your hair softens and it makes your hair smoother with less static.</li>
            <li>My hair is more manageable with less fly-aways.</li>
            <li>Less breakage and keeps it smooth!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am not sure what more can I ask for, this one is pretty close to being great/</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s high quality.  </li>
            <li>The price is way to high for this brush.</li>
            <li>The soft bristle, very well works.</li>
            <li>I have very long full hair</li>
            <li>,  we refuse to use any other kind on our hair when dry.  </li>
            <li>I got this brush a few weeks ago and so far I love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Guess it is not meant to work on my fine and slightly wavy hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got the soft boars bristles that are SO good for hair and scalp - but the edition on the tiny nylon bristles are what helps with really getting through the layers of my very thick wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve thrown away my old oval bristle brush AND paddle brush.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>, I prefer one with more stiff, larger spaced bristles for detangling.</li>
            <li>I contacted the company and they immediately offered to send me a replacement at no charge, which was great, and during the process of setting that up, the silly thing arrived after all!</li>
            <li>Even if I was super gentle and brushed small sections at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was using an old wooden paddle brush and thought it might be contributing to the breakage.  </li>
            <li>Acca Kappa Professional Pro Pneumatic Hair Brush, Black Handle, Large Oval, Boar/Nylon,</li>
            <li>Hair care used to be an ongoing battle at our house - my older daughter cried every single time.  </li>
            <li>The handle is fine (although a little slick for my liking) and the brush is lightweight and as described, but I don&#x27;t think I will use this brush much because of the after-effect.</li>
            <li>I love how it can flatten or volumize my hair depending on my needs, plus I have a sensitive scalp and this brush has never made my scalp feel raw after a few minutes of brushing.</li>
            <li>Does remove tangles pretty well and with less pain.  </li>
            <li>Hard to clean.</li>

            <li> I wanted to get something better that would provide extra shine and see the ceramic + ion magic work.</li>
            <li> It washes very well and the built up product and sebum clean off easily.  </li>
            <li> can quickly brush her hair now with no tears</li>
            <li> I love this new Olivia Garden Hair brush.</li>
            <li> and it is my favorite new hair brush.</li>
            <li> Really gets out tangles pain free.</li>
            <li> so I thought this one was worth a try for home use.</li>
            <li> Since we got this brush, she brushes her own hair several times a day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> I spent my entire life using Denman brushes because I thought they were the best for tangles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good brush just not what I expected.</li>
            <li> It detangles my very long hair beautifully, smooths and distributes natural oils.  </li>
            <li> Was on Amazon buying other brushes and red the reviews on this brush how it&#x27;s great for kids... doesn&#x27;t hurt!</li>
            <li> so much---the brushing surface is not only quite cushy but also flat enough to cover large area at once, which feels amazing.</li>
            <li> This is a very high quality brush and is my instant favorite!</li>
            <li> Your hair will feel smooth and soft after using this brush!</li>
            <li> Very gentle on the head hand it doesn&#x27;t rip your hair out</li>
            <li> It is also very gentle on my scalp.</li>
            <li> It has a smoothing action but is very gentle on fine hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter stole my other brush because she loved it so much.</li>
            <li> At first I was hesitant to buy a brush  </li>
            <li> Great hair brush for removing snarls from thick wavy hair before cleansing.</li>
            <li> This brush definitely does a better job.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold for right or left handers.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t see much difference than other brushes I own.</li>
            <li> and I keep having to do a double take because I can&#x27;t believe how easily and painlessly this got the tangles out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Great for smoothing and styling thick frizzy prone hair!</li>
            <li> I never knew a hair brush could make such a huge difference.</li>
            <li> She asked why I would spend so much $ on a hair brush.</li>
            <li> For the price I paid I expected a lot more from this brush.</li>
            <li> I just wish that someone inexperienced like me would be able to see a difference from a $30 ceramic &amp; ion brush to a Target $3 brush.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much else which maybe shouldn&#x27;t be a surprise in terms of ionic/ceramic shininess, etc.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend  !</li>
            <li> High quality!</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like this hairbrush, from the bristles and the way they are attached to the brush, and how it lays in the hand for ease of use.  </li>
            <li> The brush feels nice in your hand (not cheap but not overly heavy) and works so nice on my hair.</li>
            <li> We have since thrown the other away, since we love this one so much.</li>
            <li> It has really helped with my daughters long fine hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted, combo of natural and plastic bristles, large size, well made and glides through the hair like butter.</li>
            <li> We both have long fine to medium hair.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are the perfect balance between soft enough not to poke or jab your skull, and firm enough to get through your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad we found each other!</li>
            <li> When you use it your hair softens and it makes your hair smoother with less static.</li>
            <li> My hair is more manageable with less fly-aways.</li>
            <li> Less breakage and keeps it smooth!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am not sure what more can I ask for, this one is pretty close to being great/</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s high quality.  </li>
            <li> The price is way to high for this brush.</li>
            <li> The soft bristle, very well works.</li>
            <li> I have very long full hair</li>
            <li> ,  we refuse to use any other kind on our hair when dry.  </li>
            <li> I got this brush a few weeks ago and so far I love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Guess it is not meant to work on my fine and slightly wavy hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got the soft boars bristles that are SO good for hair and scalp - but the edition on the tiny nylon bristles are what helps with really getting through the layers of my very thick wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve thrown away my old oval bristle brush AND paddle brush.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> , I prefer one with more stiff, larger spaced bristles for detangling.</li>
            <li> I contacted the company and they immediately offered to send me a replacement at no charge, which was great, and during the process of setting that up, the silly thing arrived after all!</li>
            <li> Even if I was super gentle and brushed small sections at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was using an old wooden paddle brush and thought it might be contributing to the breakage.  </li>
            <li> Acca Kappa Professional Pro Pneumatic Hair Brush, Black Handle, Large Oval, Boar/Nylon,</li>
            <li> Hair care used to be an ongoing battle at our house - my older daughter cried every single time.  </li>
            <li> The handle is fine (although a little slick for my liking) and the brush is lightweight and as described, but I don&#x27;t think I will use this brush much because of the after-effect.</li>
            <li> I love how it can flatten or volumize my hair depending on my needs, plus I have a sensitive scalp and this brush has never made my scalp feel raw after a few minutes of brushing.</li>
            <li> Does remove tangles pretty well and with less pain.  </li>
            <li> Hard to clean.</li>
            <li> Glides easily through my long, thin hair.</li>
            <li> The other hairbrush that I&#x27;ve got (Acca Kappa Professional Pro Pneumatic Hair Brush) has a narrower combing [hair/scalp contact) path, which makes it scratchy.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, very long fine hair &amp;</li>
            <li> It is worth the money so far, we will see how well it holds up being that it will be used at least 3-4 times everyday.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair and this brush doesn&#x27;t pull and break my hair.</li>
            <li> My little girls also love this brush because it manages to get the tangles out without causing the usual whining and crying that other brushes do.</li>
            <li> saver!&lt;br /&gt;It was a daily battle to brush my daughter&#x27;s long, wavy hair with other brushes.</li>
            <li> Made me wish I had long hair again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually an oval paddle brush with a cushion and little pins betwee the boar bristles.</li>
            <li> The one thing I noticed it that when I use this brush and my hair is a little dirty like 2 days without wash, it makes my hair more oily and stuck together.</li>
            <li> I was very excited based on other reviews only to be terribly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the issue is, but instead of making my hair feel smooth, it looks and feels dirty after using the brush.  </li>
            <li> My thin hair tangles when wet, but this brush makes it much easier to style.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair, long, dark and wavy.</li>
            <li> I can even use it when her hair is wet.</li>
            <li> As a 24 year old, thats not a very attractive quality.</li>
            <li> She has long thick hair and a sensitive little head.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this and the Wet Brush for my long thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> It does not pull my hair or my daughter&#x27;s hair like other brushes.  </li>
            <li> Tried to use the brush, it did not get tangles out of thick hair or thin straight hair (different members of the family tried it).</li>
            <li> have medium, average, color-treated, a bit wavy hair and this brush combs through well, shines and makes them sleek.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter hair , it may pull a little, but nothing compared to other brushes.  </li>
            <li> and I have noticed less breakage than before.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my sister, who has long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who has very long thick hair.</li>
            <li> just sent one to my boyfriend&#x27;s little sister who HATES brushing her hair.</li>
            <li> I re-gifted this pricy little brush.</li>
            <li> Little bit of a delay getting here, the company sent it out the day after I ordered it</li>
            <li> They get so bad, especially in the winter from rubbing on my coats and scarves near my neck I wanted to give up until summer.</li>
            <li> I also have the round one too.</li>
            <li> I have a ton of thick long hair, which is usually tangled up upon waking in the am and this brush removes all the tangles with out pain or breakage.  </li>
            <li> It even smooths out and blends in the previously damaged hairs!  </li>
            <li> Very odd.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, course, unruly hair that tangles EVERY single day to the point where I could cry.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness I took a chance and splurged a little on this brush!</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not using it correctly, not sure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a small miracle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a brush, no better or worse than any other brush.</li>
            <li> My hair brushes usually cost $2.99!</li>
            <li> In addition to smoothing out bed head, it doesn&#x27;t pull on tangles with curly hair (big pet peeve, hate losing half my hair to the brush).  </li>
            <li> This brush is not a good buy for people with very thick hair.</li>
            <li> Boy, this one is tough.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the plastic that the brush is made from, especially the rubber that holds the bristles, has a bad odor of petroleum.</li>
            <li> I was noticing a lot of broken hairs!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it has not worked on my hair as described.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but you&#x27;ll never use another brush again.</li>
            <li> It takes crazy bed head and smooths it out effortlessly.  </li>
            <li> It stinks, literally the brush arrived and</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I see any difference :(</li>
            <li> I tried the tangle teaser and hated it, this truly brushes out your tangles with virtually no pain.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Brush has an awful smell (even after two months).  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush. It is perfect for wet hair. I tried the tangle teaser and hated it, this truly brushes out your tangles with virtually no pain.</li>
            <li> Love this brush worth every penny.  It does not pull my hair or my daughter&#x27;s hair like other brushes.  My daughter hair , it may pull a little, but nothing compared to other brushes.  It brushes smooth and helps with tangles. This brush has lasted me for over 4 months and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li> Purchased to replace an older one this brush is proving to be excellent so far.  Good value.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love these brushes!!  Our favorite brush,  we refuse to use any other kind on our hair when dry.  However, I don&#x27;t feel they are great on wet hair, I prefer one with more stiff, larger spaced bristles for detangling.</li>
            <li> Brush has an awful smell (even after two months).  Hard to clean.</li>
            <li> My wife loves her hair brush. She asked why I would spend so much $ on a hair brush. Now she is fighting off our daughters to keep it. Lol</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a GREAT brush.  Have tons from Target, Walmart, beauty supply stores, but nothing would get through my 5 year old daughters knots without making her cry, or not really getting them out.  This is a GREAT brush. She doesn&#x27;t even flinch and shes knot free witihn seconds.  We call it her Magic Brush. I use it every day as well and it feels great on my hair.  We both have long fine to medium hair.  Can&#x27;t compare to the Mason Pearson which is what I really wanted but can not bring myself to spend that kind of $.  It is worth the money so far, we will see how well it holds up being that it will be used at least 3-4 times everyday.  I am considering getting another one just for backup..</li>
            <li> I love this new Olivia Garden Hair brush. When you use it your hair softens and it makes your hair smoother with less static. The design is really nice and it is my favorite new hair brush.</li>
            <li> I was noticing a lot of broken hairs!  I was using an old wooden paddle brush and thought it might be contributing to the breakage.  I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spend the $$ on the Mason Pearson, so after finding this Olivia Garden I decided to give it  a try.  I LOVE it!  I have a ton of thick long hair, which is usually tangled up upon waking in the am and this brush removes all the tangles with out pain or breakage.  It even smooths out and blends in the previously damaged hairs!  I use it to style while blow drying and I am very impressed.  My hair is more manageable with less fly-aways.</li>
            <li> Amazed by this brush. At first I was hesitant to buy a brush  that&#x27;s $25 but my hair is sooo shiny and it doesn&#x27;t pull on my hair either. The combination of bristled is brilliant. I&#x27;ve thrown away my old oval bristle brush AND paddle brush. Great investment</li>
            <li> Great brush for the money. Very Nice.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. Price is good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a pro when it comes to beauty products, etc. My hair brushes usually cost $2.99! I wanted to get something better that would provide extra shine and see the ceramic + ion magic work. The one thing I noticed it that when I use this brush and my hair is a little dirty like 2 days without wash, it makes my hair more oily and stuck together. I have a lot of hair, long, dark and wavy. For the price I paid I expected a lot more from this brush. Maybe I&#x27;m not using it correctly, not sure. I just wish that someone inexperienced like me would be able to see a difference from a $30 ceramic &amp; ion brush to a Target $3 brush. I can&#x27;t say I see any difference :(</li>
            <li> This brush is Amazing! It works so well to brush my daughter&#x27;s snarly/tangled hair.</li>
            <li> This has quickly become my favorite brush.  It has a smoothing action but is very gentle on fine hair. My hairdresser only uses Olivia Garden brushes so I thought this one was worth a try for home use. This brush will never snag your hair. I love this brush.</li>
            <li> Great brush! Lasted about a year, iv bought 2 and will buy again! Less breakage and keeps it smooth! Great on my toddlers tangly hair too.</li>
            <li> Hair care used to be an ongoing battle at our house - my older daughter cried every single time.  Since we got this brush, she brushes her own hair several times a day. It&#x27;s like a small miracle. SO GLAD I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, which works great to painlessly smooth my long hair, but it is rather pricey for a plastic brush with ceramic paint.</li>
            <li> This brush feels wonderful on your scalp.  We had another Olivia Garden brush that we thought we loved until we got this one.  We have since thrown the other away, since we love this one so much.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite hairbrush! Seriously the name fits the brush perfectly! The boar bristle create shine and and helps smooth my hair when styling while the plastic bristles detangle and comb through all layers of my hair. Worth every dollar!</li>
            <li> This is the best brush I&#x27;ve ever used. I have long hair and this brush doesn&#x27;t pull and break my hair. I loved it so much I got one for my daughter also. She has long thick hair and a sensitive little head. This is the ONLY brush I&#x27;ve ever used on her that doesn&#x27;t hurt her head. I can even use it when her hair is wet. Wonderful! It&#x27;s worth the price. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a couple of months since I purchased this brush.  Unfortunately it has not worked on my hair as described. I had great expectations for this brush considering that a $3 brush I bought before this one does a much better job at getting my hair smooth and silky. Guess it is not meant to work on my fine and slightly wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Does remove tangles pretty well and with less pain.  Doesn&#x27;t do much else which maybe shouldn&#x27;t be a surprise in terms of ionic/ceramic shininess, etc.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my sister, who has long, thick hair. She raves over it. She said it feels wonderful.  Made me wish I had long hair again!</li>
            <li> Feels good, works well, makes hair look nice.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, course, unruly hair that tangles EVERY single day to the point where I could cry. As a 24 year old, thats not a very attractive quality. I spent my entire life using Denman brushes because I thought they were the best for tangles. Until I tried this...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I tell you I have used this every day since I got it and I keep having to do a double take because I can&#x27;t believe how easily and painlessly this got the tangles out of my hair. They get so bad, especially in the winter from rubbing on my coats and scarves near my neck I wanted to give up until summer. Until I found this MIRACLE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just sent one to my boyfriend&#x27;s little sister who HATES brushing her hair. I&#x27;ll bet this will change her mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously...do not hesitate. Just buy it. If it doesn&#x27;t work for you, I suggest a buzz cut.</li>
            <li> The brush is awesome, but the picture is showing up as a round brush on my account. It&#x27;s actually an oval paddle brush with a cushion and little pins betwee the boar bristles. It makes my hair soft and shiny. I love it</li>
            <li> Very gentle on the head hand it doesn&#x27;t rip your hair out</li>
            <li> great brush,massages your head</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who has very long thick hair. I both addresses tangles and smooths without breaking. She loves it.</li>
            <li> Great hair brush for removing snarls from thick wavy hair before cleansing.</li>
            <li> Amazing brush!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love love love this brush.  It detangles my very long hair beautifully, smooths and distributes natural oils.  It&#x27;s high quality.  I&#x27;m glad we found each other!</li>
            <li> Our family calls it \\&quot;the magic brush\\&quot; because my children do not cry or even flinch when getting their hair brushed. It&#x27;s expensive, but you&#x27;ll never use another brush again.</li>
            <li> Boy, this one is tough. The boar bristles and plastic tines were a wonder. Loved how it felt on my head. Unfortunately, the plastic that the brush is made from, especially the rubber that holds the bristles, has a bad odor of petroleum. I had to return it. I hope they remake it without the toxic material.</li>
            <li> Heaven!  Somehow this brush makes my fair softer than anything else.  I&#x27;ve made friends try it and they confirm that it is magical.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this brush.  It&#x27;s got the soft boars bristles that are SO good for hair and scalp - but the edition on the tiny nylon bristles are what helps with really getting through the layers of my very thick wavy hair.  It washes very well and the built up product and sebum clean off easily.  This is a very high quality brush and is my instant favorite!</li>
            <li> Really gets out tangles pain free. But SO much static as result.</li>
            <li> Love my brush and shipping was very fast. Purchase three more for friends and they also loved it. I also have the round one too.</li>
            <li> Was on Amazon buying other brushes and red the reviews on this brush how it&#x27;s great for kids... doesn&#x27;t hurt! Finally my kids don&#x27;t complain while brushing out knots!!  Highly recommend  !</li>
            <li> These are great.  Had one for myself, had to get more for the family.</li>
            <li> This brush is beyond fantastic. I have very long full hair and this brush glides through and makes my scalp feel like 100 tiny fingers are massaging it. I have purchased so many brushes just to discover that I really don&#x27;t like them. This brush does the job without leaving that static electric frizzy hair... looks like your ready for Halloween. I would recommend this and anticipate purchasing another for my travel case.</li>
            <li> OMG!  I love this brush!  It takes crazy bed head and smooths it out effortlessly.  Now you may be thinking $22 is a lot for a hair brush, but let me tell you it is worth EVERY PENNY!!!  In addition to smoothing out bed head, it doesn&#x27;t pull on tangles with curly hair (big pet peeve, hate losing half my hair to the brush).  Your hair will feel smooth and soft after using this brush!</li>
            <li> High quality! I am happy.Excellent brush for a fine hair.The soft bristle, very well works. my expectations were met. Thanks</li>
            <li> Great for smoothing and styling thick frizzy prone hair!</li>
            <li> I really like this hairbrush, from the bristles and the way they are attached to the brush, and how it lays in the hand for ease of use.  I have very thick, very long fine hair &amp; it works nicely on it.</li>
            <li> I never knew a hair brush could make such a huge difference. It leaves my hair shiny and smooth. Great buy.</li>
            <li> Fantastic brush.  It has really helped with my daughters long fine hair.</li>
            <li> Best Brush I have ever owned. It can get through my frizzy hair in the morning after sleeping all night. It is also very gentle on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I had been wanting a boar bristle brush for a while now and I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this one. The brush feels nice in your hand (not cheap but not overly heavy) and works so nice on my hair. This brush does not snag and pull at your hair and it makes it look nice and smooth. I am very happy with this and I won&#x27;t ever go back to using a plastic brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is not a good buy for people with very thick hair. I was very excited based on other reviews only to be terribly disappointed. It only reached about 1/2 way through to my scalp. I re-gifted this pricy little brush.</li>
            <li> Fantastic brush! Perfect for applying oil treatments</li>
            <li> My daughter stole my other brush because she loved it so much. This is great for adults or kids who want a good quality brush that doesn&#x27;t tear your hair or scalp. Worth the price!</li>
            <li> Possibly the BEST hair brush I have ever had!!  I love how it can flatten or volumize my hair depending on my needs, plus I have a sensitive scalp and this brush has never made my scalp feel raw after a few minutes of brushing.</li>
            <li> The price is way to high for this brush. I couldn&#x27;t see much difference than other brushes I own. It&#x27;s a good brush just not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Best hairbrush I&#x27;ve owned</li>
            <li> Someone posted that this was a &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; brush.  I AGREE!  My thin hair tangles when wet, but this brush makes it much easier to style.  It is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This brush made my hair staticky. I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I never knew that there could be a brush that doesn&#x27;t pull your hair out when trying to get rid of tangles.  This brush does just that and I truly believe that my hair is shinier since using these types of brushes.  I really think it is all thanks to the boars hair and this brush is a perfect combo of the two</li>
            <li> Good hairbrush. Nicest part is that it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness I took a chance and splurged a little on this brush! It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted, combo of natural and plastic bristles, large size, well made and glides through the hair like butter. My little girls also love this brush because it manages to get the tangles out without causing the usual whining and crying that other brushes do. Super happy with this one!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the issue is, but instead of making my hair feel smooth, it looks and feels dirty after using the brush.  Very odd.  The handle is fine (although a little slick for my liking) and the brush is lightweight and as described, but I don&#x27;t think I will use this brush much because of the after-effect.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the great reviews. It stinks, literally the brush arrived and the bristles and bed of the brush smelled like a strong gas or chemical smell. I tried to clean it did not get the smell out. Tried to use the brush, it did not get tangles out of thick hair or thin straight hair (different members of the family tried it). I would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold for right or left handers. Glides easily through my long, thin hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a brush, no better or worse than any other brush. I don&#x27;t think it work like they claim</li>
            <li> This brush is a life saver!&lt;br /&gt;It was a daily battle to brush my daughter&#x27;s long, wavy hair with other brushes. Even if I was super gentle and brushed small sections at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can quickly brush her hair now with no tears and she doesn&#x27;t try to run away anymore. She actually asks me to brush her hair sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smooths hair very nicely and I have noticed less breakage than before.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this and the Wet Brush for my long thick wavy hair. This brush definitely does a better job. It gets the tangles out more efficiently and quickly.</li>
            <li> Little bit of a delay getting here, the company sent it out the day after I ordered it but then the USPS lost them...I contacted the company and they immediately offered to send me a replacement at no charge, which was great, and during the process of setting that up, the silly thing arrived after all! So the company was a pleasure to work with, which was a nice experience, and the brush itself is very nice. The bristles are the perfect balance between soft enough not to poke or jab your skull, and firm enough to get through your hair. It&#x27;s lightweight and seems well made. It doesn&#x27;t do a thing for static control as it claims, hence the 4 stars instead of 5, but the comfort level and bristle pull quality of this brush was exactly what I was looking for so I&#x27;m definitely keeping it.</li>
            <li> I got this brush a few weeks ago and so far I love it!&lt;br /&gt;(I also got [...]  Acca Kappa Professional Pro Pneumatic Hair Brush, Black Handle, Large Oval, Boar/Nylon, and that one is not as good)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush gets 4.5/5, almost 5/5---it&#x27;s very good to me :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have medium, average, color-treated, a bit wavy hair and this brush combs through well, shines and makes them sleek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure what more can I ask for, this one is pretty close to being great/perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just realized why I like this one so much---the brushing surface is not only quite cushy but also flat enough to cover large area at once, which feels amazing. The other hairbrush that I&#x27;ve got (Acca Kappa Professional Pro Pneumatic Hair Brush) has a narrower combing [hair/scalp contact) path, which makes it scratchy. But this one (Olivia Garden one) is perfect</li>
