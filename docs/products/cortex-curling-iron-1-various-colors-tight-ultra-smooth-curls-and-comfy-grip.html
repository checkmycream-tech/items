            <li>Great product, heats up quickly and holds a curl!</li>
            <li>I use this iron to get large bouncy waves curls and it works great!!!</li>
            <li>I get amazing curls with this wand</li>
            <li>After a while, it does warm the hand a bit too much...other than that ..</li>
            <li>it is the most amazing invention, it works every time and its so simple/easy to use.</li>
            <li>This clipless curling iron is by far the best curling iron I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I own many curling irons</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use too!</li>
            <li>Seriously this is the best curling wand you could own!!</li>
            <li>I really love this curling iron.  </li>
            <li>THE GLOVES MAKES UR HAIR STATIC.</li>
            <li>overall though the curler is perfect.</li>
            <li>This fortunately does the trick!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this product for about 3 years now and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I love this curling iron and get so many compliments everytime I curl my hair with it.</li>
            <li>Love this wand.....</li>
            <li>I Love my Cortex Curling Iron..  </li>
            <li>It works best on 2nd day hair.</li>
            <li>Love this iron, works fabulous!  </li>
            <li>so in love.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Since it doesn&#x27;t have a holder along the iron, you will have to hold your hair ends with your hands, to make sure they being curled as well.</li>
            <li>But after scarring myself, I must say I&#x27;m very happy with the iron because it creates beautiful wavy curls in my long straight hair extremely fast!</li>
            <li>Being on a budget myself, I was very worried that I wouldn&#x27;t like the Cortex Curling Iron, but I was very pleased once it arrived.</li>
            <li>My hair is also fine, so I think the iron is somewhat damaging, although I haven&#x27;t noticed damage yet.</li>
            <li>I found the glove to work just fine.</li>
            <li>I am african-american, but because of my native american/west indian background, my hair is fairly fine.  </li>
            <li>With that said, the product looks and feels cheap.  </li>
            <li>Also, this doesn&#x27;t have a light or a temp guage.</li>
            <li>The Cortex heats up fast, and with the use of the provided glove, is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Perfect curling iron, at first gives my tight ring curls, after about an hour they fall slightly and stay perfect curles/waves for the rest of the day!</li>
            <li>just be aware that it is VERY hot!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;this product I love it, but the first time you send me the 1.5 inch</li>
            <li>When I got this I was so excited to try it because I wanted those wavy curls or taylor swift-like curls...</li>
            <li>It gets super hot, so make sure you use the glove.</li>
            <li>I guess I just needed the right tool!</li>
            <li>In love with my new wand!</li>
            <li>My hair has never been able to hold curls, but with this product I am able to sleep in them, and wake up the next morning and still have voluminous curls.  </li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and the curls hold for hours and hours.</li>
            <li>It does get very hot</li>
            <li>so I recommend just being very aware when you are using it.</li>
            <li>Very hot, but helps it curl a lot faster.</li>
            <li>The curls stay in practially all day and you dont even really need hair spray!!</li>
            <li>To be honest, if you are careful with how you work, you&#x27;ll should be fine.</li>
            <li>very hot!&lt;br /&gt;It creates fabulous curls in almost no time at all</li>
            <li>The heat on it is amazing the curls last for days -  </li>
            <li>and it is a lot of fun to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>That being said, I think this product is completely worth it.</li>
            <li>Totally worth buying.</li>
            <li>For the dollars that you spend on this, which is minimal, btw, great price, it is so worth it--if you have stubbornly straight hair</li>
            <li>In comparison to a normal curling iron, my hair holds the curl SO much better and so much longer!</li>
            <li>: It gets SUPER hot and the swivel stick avoids tangles.</li>
            <li>The glove helps in no way, the heat burns right through</li>
            <li>your curls will not look right or even.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t love about it is that it doesn&#x27;t hold a curl as long as my last one did, but even then it still holds a curl without hairspray for almost the whole day and holds a curl with hairspray perfectly!</li>
            <li>the iron is so hot that it&#x27;ll still burn and hurt right through the glove.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is super straight and this is the first curling URL.</li>
            <li>I have very straight hair and nothing seems to keep it curly.</li>
            <li>A very fast shipment.</li>
            <li>It does a fantastic job of curlingn my fine, long hair!</li>
            <li>The results are FANTASTIC: Your hair gets beautifully smooth and shiny, and the curls stay for much longer than if you&#x27;d used a regular clip</li>
            <li>Cons  - FRYING HOT.</li>
            <li>It burned me the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li>First, I&#x27;d like to clarify that</li>
            <li>but above all I love it, and my sister keep the 1.5 inch</li>
            <li>First it wasn&#x27;t heating up like the reviews</li>
            <li>I am still learning how to use it, but out of all my friends and their other brands of wands, I have realized that the Cortex holds curls better, and longer!</li>
            <li>It gets hot like</li>
            <li>There are a lot of comments about how it does not have a heat indicator and does not say when it is hot.</li>
            <li>The barrel is the same diameter top to bottom, and the wand gets extremely hot.</li>
            <li>First of all, throw the glove away.  </li>
            <li>Mine got extremely hot, no problems whatsoever.</li>
            <li>In fact, I even used it on my moms hair even though she was sceptical at first.</li>
            <li>Heats fast, comes with the glove to keep from burning your hand!  </li>
            <li>It gets extremely hot so even putting your hand close to it, can burn you.</li>
            <li>I own the same name brand in two other sizes and love them too.</li>
            <li>NICE TIGHT CURLS, VERY FAST,</li>
            <li>While using the iron for more than 3 minutes my hand got really hot, so the gloves did not protect me as I expected and I almost got an injury because of the lack of protection.</li>
            <li>my curls are amazing, tight, and very</li>
            <li>Just a word of caution that because it gets so hot, if you have fine hair and you blow dry and straighten and then curl, I don&#x27;t recommend with this iron.  </li>
            <li>I now have a very visible scar on my forearm which can be seen from 100 feet away.</li>
            <li>She is in college and  still very picky.</li>
            <li>the wand was so much easier to use then the curling irons with clamps.</li>
            <li>searching for a reasonably priced wand.</li>
            <li>The one inch will give you a very curly/spiral look.</li>
            <li>After 5 minutes she said she wants one.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like this curling wand.</li>
            <li>Heats up so fast and works so well.  </li>
            <li>Once I straighten my hair, it is straight.</li>
            <li>I have really fine super tight curly hair</li>
            <li>Then she tried it out and found it to be way better than she expected!</li>
            <li>but careful, HOT  the clipless curling is fantastic and avoids any clampy looks of your hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The heat gets too high for your hair, and trying to twist your locks around this thing is too much work and cumbersome not to mention</li>
            <li>No handle to put it down safely and without burning where you put it.  </li>
            <li>Gets extremely hot, so definitely use the glove, I&#x27;ve already burned myself and it wasn&#x27;t pretty.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to a potential buyer :)</li>
            <li>I even got my older sister who hates unessential beauty products one</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product for anyone who wants to create amazing curls in less time.</li>
            <li>However, if you&#x27;re willing to spend at least another hundred dollars on one, there are better ones out there.</li>
            <li>The diameter is the same the length of the barrel and was just right for her taste.</li>
            <li>The Revlon, Conair and other cheap brands do not compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really liked it, the only thing is that I disliked was the pair of gloves.</li>
            <li>The only thing you might want to watch out for is that there is ONLY an on/off button and no indicator light to let you know it has heated up</li>
            <li>Overall, the product itself is easy to use, and didn&#x27;t take long to get the hang of the wrapping technique.</li>
            <li>It takes a little while to get used to using it, but once you practice, it is so easy.</li>
            <li>If you want more of a loose wave or loose curl</li>
            <li>I loved it while it worked but is too expensive to be buying new ones that often.</li>
            <li>Be careful because it gets hot!</li>
            <li>I just want to give a couple of stars, clear my order history and get on with the rest of my day.</li>
            <li>I believe Cortex fixed the safety issue on those ones.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it and says its the only curling iron she uses now.</li>
            <li>and the curl lasts the whole day, night , and NEXT day!</li>
            <li>So far...</li>
            <li>I ordered this wand and got it a week later shipping was fast...</li>
            <li>but I will have pretty wavy hair during the upcoming dry winter.</li>
            <li>I spent fifteen minutes straightening my very thick hair and even my roommates all came out to tell me how amazing my hair looked!</li>
            <li>I have now been using this wand for about 6 months and only go back to my straightener when I need to go fast!</li>
            <li>I  have very fine, thin hair and this curling wand gets</li>
            <li>but since I&#x27;m the only one that really sees it, it wasn&#x27;t a big deal!</li>
            <li>Even if I barely use hair spray!</li>
            <li>It gets a little hot and there is no holder, so need to look for one!</li>
            <li>It heats up and cools down very fast.</li>
            <li>and then it it barely curling.  </li>
            <li>450 degrees may work on super thick, coarse hair, but not on normal hair.  </li>
            <li>After each curl, I had to carefully place it on the sink&#x27;s ledge, so as to keep the hot barrel from burning my counter top, making the curling process unnecessarily complicated.      </li>
            <li>Its just a little too hot for my hair, but for others is might be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>The extreme heat, however, is what makes the curls last so long and look so sleek and pretty.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m told it loses it&#x27;s ability to heat up QUICKLY after several uses.  </li>
            <li>If you have delicate hair, this curling iron may smooth it in the short-run but will probably damage and dry out your hair in the long-run if you use it often enough and without a product to protect against heat.</li>

            <li> Perfect curling iron, at first gives my tight ring curls, after about an hour they fall slightly and stay perfect curles/waves for the rest of the day!</li>
            <li> just be aware that it is VERY hot!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;this product I love it, but the first time you send me the 1.5 inch</li>
            <li> When I got this I was so excited to try it because I wanted those wavy curls or taylor swift-like curls...</li>
            <li> It gets super hot, so make sure you use the glove.</li>
            <li> I guess I just needed the right tool!</li>
            <li> In love with my new wand!</li>
            <li> My hair has never been able to hold curls, but with this product I am able to sleep in them, and wake up the next morning and still have voluminous curls.  </li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and the curls hold for hours and hours.</li>
            <li> It does get very hot</li>
            <li> so I recommend just being very aware when you are using it.</li>
            <li> Very hot, but helps it curl a lot faster.</li>
            <li> The curls stay in practially all day and you dont even really need hair spray!!</li>
            <li> To be honest, if you are careful with how you work, you&#x27;ll should be fine.</li>
            <li> very hot!&lt;br /&gt;It creates fabulous curls in almost no time at all</li>
            <li> The heat on it is amazing the curls last for days -  </li>
            <li> and it is a lot of fun to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> That being said, I think this product is completely worth it.</li>
            <li> Totally worth buying.</li>
            <li> For the dollars that you spend on this, which is minimal, btw, great price, it is so worth it--if you have stubbornly straight hair</li>
            <li> In comparison to a normal curling iron, my hair holds the curl SO much better and so much longer!</li>
            <li> : It gets SUPER hot and the swivel stick avoids tangles.</li>
            <li> The glove helps in no way, the heat burns right through</li>
            <li> your curls will not look right or even.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t love about it is that it doesn&#x27;t hold a curl as long as my last one did, but even then it still holds a curl without hairspray for almost the whole day and holds a curl with hairspray perfectly!</li>
            <li> the iron is so hot that it&#x27;ll still burn and hurt right through the glove.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is super straight and this is the first curling URL.</li>
            <li> I have very straight hair and nothing seems to keep it curly.</li>
            <li> A very fast shipment.</li>
            <li> It does a fantastic job of curlingn my fine, long hair!</li>
            <li> The results are FANTASTIC: Your hair gets beautifully smooth and shiny, and the curls stay for much longer than if you&#x27;d used a regular clip</li>
            <li> Cons  - FRYING HOT.</li>
            <li> It burned me the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;d like to clarify that</li>
            <li> but above all I love it, and my sister keep the 1.5 inch</li>
            <li> First it wasn&#x27;t heating up like the reviews</li>
            <li> I am still learning how to use it, but out of all my friends and their other brands of wands, I have realized that the Cortex holds curls better, and longer!</li>
            <li> It gets hot like</li>
            <li> There are a lot of comments about how it does not have a heat indicator and does not say when it is hot.</li>
            <li> The barrel is the same diameter top to bottom, and the wand gets extremely hot.</li>
            <li> First of all, throw the glove away.  </li>
            <li> Mine got extremely hot, no problems whatsoever.</li>
            <li> In fact, I even used it on my moms hair even though she was sceptical at first.</li>
            <li> Heats fast, comes with the glove to keep from burning your hand!  </li>
            <li> It gets extremely hot so even putting your hand close to it, can burn you.</li>
            <li> I own the same name brand in two other sizes and love them too.</li>
            <li> NICE TIGHT CURLS, VERY FAST,</li>
            <li> While using the iron for more than 3 minutes my hand got really hot, so the gloves did not protect me as I expected and I almost got an injury because of the lack of protection.</li>
            <li> my curls are amazing, tight, and very</li>
            <li> Just a word of caution that because it gets so hot, if you have fine hair and you blow dry and straighten and then curl, I don&#x27;t recommend with this iron.  </li>
            <li> I now have a very visible scar on my forearm which can be seen from 100 feet away.</li>
            <li> She is in college and  still very picky.</li>
            <li> the wand was so much easier to use then the curling irons with clamps.</li>
            <li> searching for a reasonably priced wand.</li>
            <li> The one inch will give you a very curly/spiral look.</li>
            <li> After 5 minutes she said she wants one.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like this curling wand.</li>
            <li> Heats up so fast and works so well.  </li>
            <li> Once I straighten my hair, it is straight.</li>
            <li> I have really fine super tight curly hair</li>
            <li> Then she tried it out and found it to be way better than she expected!</li>
            <li> but careful, HOT  the clipless curling is fantastic and avoids any clampy looks of your hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The heat gets too high for your hair, and trying to twist your locks around this thing is too much work and cumbersome not to mention</li>
            <li> No handle to put it down safely and without burning where you put it.  </li>
            <li> Gets extremely hot, so definitely use the glove, I&#x27;ve already burned myself and it wasn&#x27;t pretty.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to a potential buyer :)</li>
            <li> I even got my older sister who hates unessential beauty products one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product for anyone who wants to create amazing curls in less time.</li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re willing to spend at least another hundred dollars on one, there are better ones out there.</li>
            <li> The diameter is the same the length of the barrel and was just right for her taste.</li>
            <li> The Revlon, Conair and other cheap brands do not compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really liked it, the only thing is that I disliked was the pair of gloves.</li>
            <li> The only thing you might want to watch out for is that there is ONLY an on/off button and no indicator light to let you know it has heated up</li>
            <li> Overall, the product itself is easy to use, and didn&#x27;t take long to get the hang of the wrapping technique.</li>
            <li> It takes a little while to get used to using it, but once you practice, it is so easy.</li>
            <li> If you want more of a loose wave or loose curl</li>
            <li> I loved it while it worked but is too expensive to be buying new ones that often.</li>
            <li> Be careful because it gets hot!</li>
            <li> I just want to give a couple of stars, clear my order history and get on with the rest of my day.</li>
            <li> I believe Cortex fixed the safety issue on those ones.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it and says its the only curling iron she uses now.</li>
            <li> and the curl lasts the whole day, night , and NEXT day!</li>
            <li> So far...</li>
            <li> I ordered this wand and got it a week later shipping was fast...</li>
            <li> but I will have pretty wavy hair during the upcoming dry winter.</li>
            <li> I spent fifteen minutes straightening my very thick hair and even my roommates all came out to tell me how amazing my hair looked!</li>
            <li> I have now been using this wand for about 6 months and only go back to my straightener when I need to go fast!</li>
            <li> I  have very fine, thin hair and this curling wand gets</li>
            <li> but since I&#x27;m the only one that really sees it, it wasn&#x27;t a big deal!</li>
            <li> Even if I barely use hair spray!</li>
            <li> It gets a little hot and there is no holder, so need to look for one!</li>
            <li> It heats up and cools down very fast.</li>
            <li> and then it it barely curling.  </li>
            <li> 450 degrees may work on super thick, coarse hair, but not on normal hair.  </li>
            <li> After each curl, I had to carefully place it on the sink&#x27;s ledge, so as to keep the hot barrel from burning my counter top, making the curling process unnecessarily complicated.      </li>
            <li> Its just a little too hot for my hair, but for others is might be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> The extreme heat, however, is what makes the curls last so long and look so sleek and pretty.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m told it loses it&#x27;s ability to heat up QUICKLY after several uses.  </li>
            <li> If you have delicate hair, this curling iron may smooth it in the short-run but will probably damage and dry out your hair in the long-run if you use it often enough and without a product to protect against heat.</li>
            <li> I have flat hair and my hair never holds a curl</li>
            <li> I bought the wrong size it was easy to exchange and get the one I wanted.</li>
            <li> Another reviewer claimed that you should put on a long sleeved shirt before using this iron.</li>
            <li> THE CURLER IS A LIL TOO LONG , I THINK.</li>
            <li> I did not wear long sleeves.</li>
            <li> a warning... wear the glove that comes with it, and a long sleeve shirt.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take to long to receive the curler.</li>
            <li> my hair is long (lower butt area) and it curls it in seconds  </li>
            <li> I have absolutely no idea how to curl hair and with a regular curling iron</li>
            <li> With all that aside, the curls hold for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> Just blow dry, and let this wand &amp;#34;straighten&amp;#34;  your hair as it curls it.</li>
            <li> , can get some curl bump on the bottom of my tresses, but to actually have CURLS, I mean actual CURLS, big, bouncy, almost stubborn curls??</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used a clipless iron before, it&#x27;s very different from using a typical, clipped curling iron.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviewer recommended, PLEASE WEAR A LONG SLEEVED SHIRT!     </li>
            <li> Only con I saw was that the glove should be a little thicker as to not feel heat at all.  </li>
            <li> I have two round scars now from second degree burns.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product if you are on a budget, and extremely careful.</li>
            <li> Be careful when you curl your hair to not burn yourself.</li>
            <li> I got a 2nd degree burn after the iron very slightly touched my skin in milliseconds.</li>
            <li> Even if I spent $100 this curling iron would beat every other curling iron I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> I just won&#x27;t use it everyday or hold my hair around the barrel for too long.</li>
            <li> If I would have known that the barrel is not consistently 1 inch, I would have bought the 1.5 inch curling wand instead.      </li>
            <li> If I curl my hair with any other curling iron the curls go away with in hours.</li>
            <li> I am very careful when using it</li>
            <li> but as i stated earlier, that is only because I am a noice at curling hair and that i am simply very clumsy</li>
            <li> If you are willing to pay the price for the minor, inconvenient flaws, then I would recommend buying this product.  </li>
            <li> This item is not worth purchasing.  </li>
            <li> I think writing down a review should be optional.</li>
            <li> the connection cord wasn&#x27;t black</li>
            <li> I am not talented enough to use  this on myself.</li>
            <li> I purchased this curling iron for my little sister for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for a little over a week.</li>
            <li> There is no light that will signal that it is on.</li>
            <li> There is no light that indicates if it is on (a safety issue) and there are no heat control settings.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, expect this to be a complete dud after using it 10 times.</li>
            <li> , however I did not love the price tag...</li>
            <li> have always struggled in the past with curling irons and the crimped end portion.</li>
            <li> I used to only write a review if there was something wrong.</li>
            <li> So, being an idiot, I burnt myself twice the first week I used the iron.</li>
            <li> Just remember to turn off because there is no light on it to remind you that it&#x27;s on (not good)</li>
            <li> But it eventually goes away, at least it did for me.</li>
            <li> only bad side is the possibility of burning yourself.</li>
            <li> I burnt my fore arm a few days ago and it will leave a nasty scar for a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li> The thermal glove that comes with this Cortex curling iron is almost useless--</li>
            <li> I will be returning (perhaps packaged wrong?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like using the glove because it makes it difficult to do my hair, leaving me with a couple scars.</li>
            <li> but when I opened it and saw it,it looked so fake</li>
            <li> it looked really fake</li>
            <li> The glove is difficult to maneuver in.</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s obsessed too.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the cord</li>
            <li> My niece picked this out when another curling iron was a disappointment!  </li>
            <li> You must use technique to curl your hair correctly, and you must be especially wary of burning yourself.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> cuz it burns and leaves a nasty scar.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really love this curling iron.  I have flat hair and my hair never holds a curl but with this product my hair not only curls but it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Another reviewer claimed that you should put on a long sleeved shirt before using this iron. I didn&#x27;t think I would need to, since I&#x27;ve been curling my hair for 25 years. So, being an idiot, I burnt myself twice the first week I used the iron. I have two round scars now from second degree burns. Both times, I accidentally tapped the end of the iron (it doesn&#x27;t have the plastic tip as traditional irons do.) against my arm for about a millisecond and was burnt instantly. Like the other reviewer recommended, PLEASE WEAR A LONG SLEEVED SHIRT!     But after scarring myself, I must say I&#x27;m very happy with the iron because it creates beautiful wavy curls in my long straight hair extremely fast! They still won&#x27;t hold in NYC humidity but I will have pretty wavy hair during the upcoming dry winter. (To get curls to hold, I recommend using Redken Hair Starch, it works and protects hair) My hair is also fine, so I think the iron is somewhat damaging, although I haven&#x27;t noticed damage yet. I just won&#x27;t use it everyday or hold my hair around the barrel for too long.</li>
            <li> NICE TIGHT CURLS, VERY FAST, BUT I BURN MYSELF OFTEN&gt; THE GLOVES MAKES UR HAIR STATIC. THE CURLER IS A LIL TOO LONG , I THINK.</li>
            <li> The Cortex clipless iron itself works great: It gets SUPER hot and the swivel stick avoids tangles. The results are FANTASTIC: Your hair gets beautifully smooth and shiny, and the curls stay for much longer than if you&#x27;d used a regular clip iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, note the following:&lt;br /&gt;- If you&#x27;ve never used a clipless iron before, it&#x27;s very different from using a typical, clipped curling iron. You must use technique to curl your hair correctly, and you must be especially wary of burning yourself.&lt;br /&gt;- The thermal glove that comes with this Cortex curling iron is almost useless-- the iron is so hot that it&#x27;ll still burn and hurt right through the glove.&lt;br /&gt;- There is no temperature control on this iron, so it&#x27;s either OFF or full-blast, SUUUUUPER-hot ON! If you have delicate hair, this curling iron may smooth it in the short-run but will probably damage and dry out your hair in the long-run if you use it often enough and without a product to protect against heat.</li>
            <li> The Cortex Curler is the best thing since sliced bread. it is the most amazing invention, it works every time and its so simple/easy to use. only bad side is the possibility of burning yourself. then again I&#x27;m a bit of a kluts. overall though the curler is perfect. all my friends want to use and from spanish/white/black/asain it&#x27;s great for all hair types.</li>
            <li> Cons  - FRYING HOT. It burned me the first time I tried it. I don&#x27;t put the entire blame on the product b/c I did not wear long sleeves. I got a 2nd degree burn after the iron very slightly touched my skin in milliseconds. I now have a very visible scar on my forearm which can be seen from 100 feet away. 2nd degree scar will not go away. It is permanent. The second time I used it, I almost burned my face, now I might have to wear a mask in order to use this product. I am very careful when using it but the fact that it is 1000000000000 degrees HOT, any small mistake can leave you with a scarred arm or face.  - UNSAFE. There is no light that will signal that it is on. No dial for degrees. No handle to put it down safely and without burning where you put it.  Pros  - It will definitely curl your hair.  - My curls lasted 3 days without using spray.  - Inexpensive  - Comes with a glove (not entirely reliable)  To clarify one of the reviews, the barrel does not taper on mine,.  I took 2 stars off because of its safety issue, which to me should be 50% of any reviews when it comes to electronics/hot tools.  I would recommend this product if you are on a budget, and extremely careful. Otherwise, buy the 4 in 1 barrel b/c I believe Cortex fixed the safety issue on those ones.</li>
            <li> I purchased this curling iron for my little sister for Christmas. She absolutely loves it and says its the only curling iron she uses now. She already has gorgeous hair, but this curling iron gives her gorgeous curls :)</li>
            <li> My sister purchased the \\&quot;Herstyler\\&quot; a couple years ago for over $100 and has loved it.  I did too, however I did not love the price tag... this $40 version is amazing!</li>
            <li> I  have very fine, thin hair and this curling wand gets very hot!&lt;br /&gt;It creates fabulous curls in almost no time at all and it is a lot of fun to use.&lt;br /&gt;I have always struggled in the past with curling irons and the crimped end portion. This product  prevents the crimped tip.&lt;br /&gt;The inch size is perfect for my shoulder length hair.&lt;br /&gt;I would have given this product five stars if it had a temperature control.  Its just a little too hot for my hair, but for others is might be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Just a warning... wear the glove that comes with it, and a long sleeve shirt. I burnt my fore arm a few days ago and it will leave a nasty scar for a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like this product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love it!!! It it gives me the curly look I want that stays all day with out the Shirley Temple Ringlets!Took some practice but my teenager and I love It!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take to long to receive the curler. I have very straight hair and nothing seems to keep it curly. This fortunately does the trick!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She didn&#x27;t recognize the brand and had some concerns.  Then she tried it out and found it to be way better than she expected! She is in college and  still very picky. She is very pleased and happy that I got this and at a very good price!!!</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;d like to clarify that even though it says it is a 1 inch barrel, it&#x27;s actually tapered from 1 inch to about 1/2 inch.  If I would have known that the barrel is not consistently 1 inch, I would have bought the 1.5 inch curling wand instead.      With that said, the product looks and feels cheap.  There is no light that indicates if it is on (a safety issue) and there are no heat control settings. 450 degrees may work on super thick, coarse hair, but not on normal hair.  Another issue I had with this product, which may seem small to some, was that there was no flip out stand or piece which kept the hot barrel off the bathroom counter surface.  After each curl, I had to carefully place it on the sink&#x27;s ledge, so as to keep the hot barrel from burning my counter top, making the curling process unnecessarily complicated.      With all that aside, the curls hold for a very long time.  My hair has never been able to hold curls, but with this product I am able to sleep in them, and wake up the next morning and still have voluminous curls.  Overall, the product itself is easy to use, and didn&#x27;t take long to get the hang of the wrapping technique. If you are willing to pay the price for the minor, inconvenient flaws, then I would recommend buying this product.  Otherwise, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This is the best curling iron ever! It&#x27;s the I only one that holds a curl in my hair- and the curl lasts the whole day, night , and NEXT day! Even if I barely use hair spray! My hair is super straight and this is the first curling URL. That actually works on my hair. It&#x27;s so easy to use too!</li>
            <li> I really liked it, the only thing is that I disliked was the pair of gloves. While using the iron for more than 3 minutes my hand got really hot, so the gloves did not protect me as I expected and I almost got an injury because of the lack of protection. It would be wonderful if you improve them so I can by the gloves separately. Conclusion: Gloves need improvements.</li>
            <li> I think writing down a review should be optional. Just like how it used to be. I just want to give a couple of stars, clear my order history and get on with the rest of my day. But now we can&#x27;t send a rating until we give a review on the product we ordered. I used to only write a review if there was something wrong. I f not, then I give five stars. I don&#x27;t time to write a review for everything I order so I&#x27;ll just copy and paste this on every order. MAKE THIS SECTION OPTIONAL. Thank you and have a great day!</li>
            <li> This iron was recommended to me by someone who had purchased one as well. I am delighted with it. Only con I saw was that the glove should be a little thicker as to not feel heat at all.  After a while, it does warm the hand a bit too much...other than that ..excellent product and was delivered mucho fast!</li>
            <li> I love it!! but Can you send me the correct one! I want the 1 inch!!&lt;br /&gt;this product I love it, but the first time you send me the 1.5 inch and I wanted the 1 inch but above all I love it, and my sister keep the 1.5 inch, sha has curls......thank you</li>
            <li> This curling iron is sooo good!! the wand was so much easier to use then the curling irons with clamps. The curls stay in practially all day and you dont even really need hair spray!! But becareful with your hands &amp; your skin cuz it burns and leaves a nasty scar. But it eventually goes away, at least it did for me. &amp; the curls you get are wavy &amp; its just awesome (:  But becareful what you put it on cuz sumtimes it falls off.   BUY THIS CURLING IRON ITS GREAT!! &lt;3</li>
            <li> my hair is long (lower butt area) and it curls it in seconds  but careful, HOT  the clipless curling is fantastic and avoids any clampy looks of your hair.</li>
            <li> Even if I spent $100 this curling iron would beat every other curling iron I have ever bought. my curls are amazing, tight, and very Kim Kardashian-esque. I have absolutely no idea how to curl hair and with a regular curling iron i always seem to burn and only curl my ends...this curling iron i thought was going to be a risk but because it was only thirty dollars i thought I might as well try it out. i did end up burning my arms but as i stated earlier, that is only because I am a noice at curling hair and that i am simply very clumsy and I do everything in a rush. I spent fifteen minutes straightening my very thick hair and even my roommates all came out to tell me how amazing my hair looked!</li>
            <li> This item is not worth purchasing.  I read the reviews and thought that it would work but it didn&#x27;t.  First it wasn&#x27;t heating up like the reviews said and then it it barely curling.  So as we speak it is on the way back to where I purchased it from.  I will not order another Cortex item.</li>
            <li> My niece picked this out when another curling iron was a disappointment!  The diameter is the same the length of the barrel and was just right for her taste.</li>
            <li> Love this wand! I am still learning how to use it, but out of all my friends and their other brands of wands, I have realized that the Cortex holds curls better, and longer! The Revlon, Conair and other cheap brands do not compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If searching for a reasonably priced wand. BUY THIS ONE!</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron!! It gets hot like its suppose too, the curls last forever and it&#x27;s a great price!!!  I have really fine super tight curly hair and I get my hair chemically straightened.  I use this iron to get large bouncy waves curls and it works great!!!</li>
            <li> I love it! It does a fantastic job of curlingn my fine, long hair! Be careful because it gets hot! Great deal.</li>
            <li> This Curling Wand is excellent.You don&#x27;t have to spend a hundred dollars to get a brand name wand.  The Cortex heats up fast, and with the use of the provided glove, is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Perfect curling iron, at first gives my tight ring curls, after about an hour they fall slightly and stay perfect curles/waves for the rest of the day! Gets extremely hot, so definitely use the glove, I&#x27;ve already burned myself and it wasn&#x27;t pretty. But my hair is!</li>
            <li> This clipless curling iron is by far the best curling iron I&#x27;ve ever used. It heats up quickly and the curls hold for hours and hours. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product for anyone who wants to create amazing curls in less time. I own many curling irons and I would pick this one to use over all the others. The only thing you might want to watch out for is that there is ONLY an on/off button and no indicator light to let you know it has heated up but it heats up in about 30 seconds anyway so I don&#x27;t find it to be a problem. It also comes with a glove if you need it.</li>
            <li> amazing curler!! the curls hold so well in my hair!!! just be aware that it is VERY hot!! but for the price of the curler you are getting a bargain!!</li>
            <li> This is not a 1&amp;#34; curling iron - it is much smaller. I will be returning (perhaps packaged wrong? the box says 1&amp;#34; but I&#x27;ve owned a 1&amp;#34; before &amp; this is significantly smaller in width of the barrel)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for about 3 years now and I absolutely love it. There are a lot of comments about how it does not have a heat indicator and does not say when it is hot. To be honest, if you are careful with how you work, you&#x27;ll should be fine. It does get very hot so I recommend just being very aware when you are using it. That being said, I think this product is completely worth it. It heats up and cools down very fast. I get amazing curls with this wand and I recommend it to anyone! It takes a little while to get used to using it, but once you practice, it is so easy.</li>
            <li> Great product, heats up quickly and holds a curl!</li>
            <li> Love the wand, when it works! Unfortunately, expect this to be a complete dud after using it 10 times. Also, this doesn&#x27;t have a light or a temp guage.</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful. The barrel is the same diameter top to bottom, and the wand gets extremely hot. I would definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Would be a 5 but I&#x27;m told it loses it&#x27;s ability to heat up QUICKLY after several uses.  Well made.</li>
            <li> First of all, throw the glove away.  It&#x27;s only there to protect the company from any responsibility if you burn yourself which you will do.  The glove helps in no way, the heat burns right through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heat gets too high for your hair, and trying to twist your locks around this thing is too much work and cumbersome not to mention your curls will not look right or even.  I threw it out in frustration.  I&#x27;ll use the glove to dust the apartment with.</li>
            <li> When I got this I was so excited to try it because I wanted those wavy curls or taylor swift-like curls...And it came  out the way I wanted it! I love this. Very hot, but helps it curl a lot faster.</li>
            <li> I purchased the one inch and it does not seem tapered to me at all. I read another review that said it was tappered. The one inch will give you a very curly/spiral look. If you want more of a loose wave or loose curl I would get the 1.5 inch. If you want both looks you will need both the 1 inch and the 1.5. There is also one that comes with interchangable barrels that costs around $88.00 (Check it out) Mine got extremely hot, no problems whatsoever. Just remember to turn off because there is no light on it to remind you that it&#x27;s on (not good) I found the glove to work just fine. You can still feel the heat but you wont get burned while wearing it. I love this curling iron and get so many compliments everytime I curl my hair with it. Oh and the curls last all day even for another day or two. If I curl my hair with any other curling iron the curls go away with in hours. Hope this helos.</li>
            <li> A very fast shipment. Love this wand.....heats up in no time, seems like good quality... great results. In fact, I even used it on my moms hair even though she was sceptical at first. After 5 minutes she said she wants one. Now I have to get her this wand. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I Love my Cortex Curling Iron..  The heat on it is amazing the curls last for days -  Totally worth buying.</li>
            <li> My hair never held curl before this curling wand! I could try gel, hairspray, etc. I have thin/fine hair and this is the only thing that will curl my hair and stay all day! I&#x27;m really impressed. It works best on 2nd day hair.</li>
            <li> It holds the curls longer, even when I don&#x27;t put any product. Loved it! It gets a little hot and there is no holder, so need to look for one!</li>
            <li> Love this iron, works fabulous!  Highly recommend! Heats fast, comes with the glove to keep from burning your hand!  Curls hold for days!</li>
            <li> I really like this curling wand.It gets super hot, so make sure you use the glove. The curls are beautiful!</li>
            <li> Heats up so fast and works so well.  I have always considered myself someone whose hair just won&#x27;t curl, otherwise I just couldn&#x27;t do it myself.  Well, I am a pro, and my hair stays when I use this.  I guess I just needed the right tool!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good curling wand. It heats up very quickly and does a great job curling my hair. The only thing I don&#x27;t love about it is that it doesn&#x27;t hold a curl as long as my last one did, but even then it still holds a curl without hairspray for almost the whole day and holds a curl with hairspray perfectly!</li>
            <li> I have had this product for a little over a week. So far...so in love.  I am african-american, but because of my native american/west indian background, my hair is fairly fine.  I blow-dry, straighten, can get some curl bump on the bottom of my tresses, but to actually have CURLS, I mean actual CURLS, big, bouncy, almost stubborn curls?? Never.  Once I straighten my hair, it is straight. It refuses to hold a curl regardless of hairspray, setting lotion, you name it.  For the dollars that you spend on this, which is minimal, btw, great price, it is so worth it--if you have stubbornly straight hair and you are wondering whether you need to get this, stop wondering and get it. I&#x27;m glad I did.  Just a word of caution that because it gets so hot, if you have fine hair and you blow dry and straighten and then curl, I don&#x27;t recommend with this iron.  Just blow dry, and let this wand &amp;#34;straighten&amp;#34;  your hair as it curls it.</li>
            <li> This is definitely one of the exceptions to &amp;#34;You get what you pay for.&amp;#34; For the price, this is an amazing product! However, if you&#x27;re willing to spend at least another hundred dollars on one, there are better ones out there. Being on a budget myself, I was very worried that I wouldn&#x27;t like the Cortex Curling Iron, but I was very pleased once it arrived. It was at my door within about a week. I don&#x27;t like using the glove because it makes it difficult to do my hair, leaving me with a couple scars. It gets extremely hot so even putting your hand close to it, can burn you. The extreme heat, however, is what makes the curls last so long and look so sleek and pretty. I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the cord but since I&#x27;m the only one that really sees it, it wasn&#x27;t a big deal! In comparison to a normal curling iron, my hair holds the curl SO much better and so much longer! I&#x27;ve always used a Chi straightener to curl my hair, it works the best for me. I have now been using this wand for about 6 months and only go back to my straightener when I need to go fast! I would definitely recommend this product to a potential buyer :)</li>
            <li> I ordered in 2013, its now 2015 and it does not work anymore. I loved it while it worked but is too expensive to be buying new ones that often.</li>
            <li> Great product. 2 downsides:&lt;br /&gt;1. Be careful when you curl your hair to not burn yourself. I already have 3 burned spots on my body which thankfully are healing ok.&lt;br /&gt;2. Since it doesn&#x27;t have a holder along the iron, you will have to hold your hair ends with your hands, to make sure they being curled as well.</li>
            <li> I bought the wrong size it was easy to exchange and get the one I wanted. In love with my new wand!</li>
            <li> I ordered this wand and got it a week later shipping was fast...but when I opened it and saw it,it looked so fake the connection cord wasn&#x27;t black it was like a red rope it looked really fake so I returned it.</li>
            <li> I am not talented enough to use  this on myself. The glove is difficult to maneuver in. Gave it away.</li>
            <li> Seriously this is the best curling wand you could own!! I own the same name brand in two other sizes and love them too. I even got my older sister who hates unessential beauty products one and she&#x27;s obsessed too. If your considering, just make the purchase and you will not regret it.</li>
