            <li>Works better than the AS SEEN ON TV kit.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The more you practice the better you get.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>

            <li>I loved the price and it got here fast.</li>
            <li>So easy to use..</li>
            <li>really easy to use.</li>
            <li>it is easy everyone loves it</li>
            <li>This is my first nail stamping kit, and I&#x27;m absolutely loving it.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and the price is right.</li>
            <li>Here are some tips I found most useful:  1)</li>
            <li>I love this set, It&#x27;s fun</li>
            <li>This is an okay set to get if you&#x27;re starting out in nail stamping, and looking to get a good deal on Konad polishes and plates.</li>
            <li>i will recoment this item as a toy good for kids under 10 years old ,after i bougth it i put it in the garbage can</li>
            <li>Great product that will save you lots of money in the long run with this do it yourself nail art machine</li>
            <li>The kit is really nice if you want to give something new a try for decorating nails, computers, ipods...</li>
            <li>easy and fun</li>
            <li>fun and easy</li>
            <li>but nothing else was right!</li>
            <li>This allowed me to try them and get a really good bargain at the same time.</li>
            <li>she love it so much</li>
            <li>This set is great for a beginner or if you want a cheap way to get the stamping polish along with a few plates.</li>
            <li>and I think that helped a lot in learning the stamping process quickly.</li>
            <li>This is a really good started kit, best advice I can give is PRACTICE, plus do not use regular polish, the regular polish does not dry as fast, with that said, speed becomes an advantage when transferring design to stamper and then the nail.</li>
            <li>The product is fun to use &amp; works as described in the instructions.</li>
            <li>It has 4 good plate selections and two of the three colors I use most, red and white.</li>
            <li>They immediately shipped out fresh polish and solved the problem.</li>
            <li>The images are pretty generic, mostly florals, butterflies, and patterns, but I feel these are sufficient for a starter kit, good for practicing (which is the key to using this stamping system).</li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast</li>
            <li>so it has not been used yet, but I have seen this exact product in use and that is why I purchased it for my daughter.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found these are easier to use, and work well with many standard nail polishes.</li>
            <li>This friend of my daughters tried our plates out and she wasn&#x27;t able to get them to work entirely either.  </li>
            <li>fast shipping!...</li>
            <li>Product is exactly as pictures.  </li>
            <li>This was the first kit I bought because I wanted to learn how to use konad.  </li>
            <li>It will take some practice, but even my first attempt received lots of compliments.  </li>
            <li>First one of the bottles of the &amp;#34;special&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I should mention that I also was able to stamp with regular nail polish just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly, the two colors you&#x27;ll probably use the most for stamping are white and black.</li>
            <li>Its easy to use and is a must have for teenage girls</li>
            <li>It was pretty decent</li>
            <li>The only place this is mentioned is under Important Instructions.</li>
            <li>So... you don&#x27;t HAVE to use their polishes, but it does make it a whole lot easier to use the stamps.</li>
            <li>it fo anyone that wants to try it out.</li>
            <li>This really works--and works well.  </li>
            <li>Stamper works very well.  </li>
            <li>Either you have too much polish and it makes a blob, or nothing comes off the stamp, or</li>
            <li>Use only pure acetone to clean up</li>
            <li>I have found a few instant dry polishes that are ok, but they&#x27;re never as good as this brand.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for helping me solve the problem with polish that was old and would not allow me to stamp it on.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t paint the whole image, just half and then scrape it in the direction of the side you didn&#x27;t paint lightly.  </li>
            <li>I find an old giftcard cut in half works better.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new to stamping, I would recommend getting the [[ASIN:B004GFR3GY</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait until school starts to show off this new to her idea for nails.</li>
            <li>so i can keep up with new trends and styles to hoildays.</li>
            <li>I am looking forward to new polish colors and new plates.</li>
            <li>This producted arrived 2 days after the purchase was made, in great conditions, nail polishes were not dryed out and as soon as my Fiance opened the mailbox and saw it she went crazy painting nails and doing designs.  </li>
            <li>and my daughter really wanted this same product for Christmas</li>
            <li>This is a gift for a young girl in Norway.  </li>
            <li>The polish will stick and dry quickly into the design causing parts not to stamp properly.</li>
            <li>Obviously I cannot really review it properly.  </li>
            <li>It comes with a standard stamper and scraper; three 11 ml special polishes in white, red, and green (Christmas anyone?); and four image plates- m21, m4, m8, and m15.</li>
            <li>just press with medium pressure and the whole image comes up and sticks (as long as both the plate and the stamper are dry)  </li>
            <li>I just wish it came with more neutral colors (i.e. black, silver, gold) since I&#x27;ve only used the white polish and will probably never use the red or green.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The polishes themselves are only for stamping, they can&#x27;t really be applied to nails normally as they&#x27;re quite thick and have a shortish brush.</li>
            <li>The red stamping polish is not opaque and will not show on dark backgrounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two things to be aware of with this set - it comes with red, white and black polish, not green.</li>

            <li> Also it shows that it comes with red, white, and green polish</li>
            <li> you really don&#x27;t have to press down hard.  </li>
            <li> Have a different design every week or every other day!!</li>
            <li> so I am used to doing nails, but this was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> HARDER THAN IT LOOKS.</li>
            <li> Thanks for standing behind this product.</li>
            <li> Works well even with other polishes.  </li>
            <li> the items are endless.</li>
            <li> I wished the kit came with a black polish.</li>
            <li> so i ordered the black polish too.  </li>
            <li> 3) same thing goes for the stamp, don&#x27;t press down hard!  </li>
            <li> so I order the black also, will when the kit arrived the black was included but not the green.</li>
            <li> Stamper doesn&#x27;t last very long as once you get polish on it, it makes it very difficult to pull up the next one off the of disk.</li>
            <li> it came with black polish instead of the green</li>
            <li> and she says it takes a little bit of practice.</li>
            <li> It takes a little practice to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> VERY MESSY AND NOT MANY OF THE PATTERNS I WANTED, MOSTLY SMALL ONES, NOT THE ONES THAT COVER THE ENTIRE NAIL.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time, it don&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> Before using the kit, I watched few nail stamping video in youtube</li>
            <li> - I received a black polish instead of the green, which in my opinion is an improvement!</li>
            <li> I was sooo disappointed when it came because I could not get it right.  </li>
            <li> If not I am not sure what we are going to do.  </li>
            <li> She has used it EVERYDAY!!!</li>
            <li> I got this on Thursday and practiced about 4 times with manicures that I was not happy with.  </li>
            <li> She was not happy and will never use this product again.</li>
            <li> After your base coat is already applied, the actual stamping process takes about 3-5 minutes for both hands.  </li>
            <li> so you need basic polish for the base coat</li>
            <li> I got one Purple nail polish, and 2 random image plates.</li>
            <li> Made the girl mad when I ordered it on Amazon while standing in front of her.  </li>
            <li> And then it is very difficult to get the stamp to work.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the way it stamps.</li>
            <li> I ordered these as a gift for my daughter and was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very difficult to use!  </li>
            <li> She was soon very frustrated.  </li>

            <li> Not the best thing I have ever bought. I was disappointed with the way it stamps. I am a cosmetologist so I am used to doing nails, but this was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I received this product on time and was very pleased with it!  I have never done any type of nail stamping and was very pleased with the product and the way it went on which made me love stamping and I have used it several time and will continue using it I love it!!</li>
            <li> So easy to use..my teen daughter is having a blast doing her nails and those of mine and her friends..</li>
            <li> Great product that will save you lots of money in the long run with this do it yourself nail art machine</li>
            <li> This producted arrived 2 days after the purchase was made, in great conditions, nail polishes were not dryed out and as soon as my Fiance opened the mailbox and saw it she went crazy painting nails and doing designs.  Would definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> We saw it in a kiosk at Vegas.  Made the girl mad when I ordered it on Amazon while standing in front of her.  Yeah, you should have seen the stink eye that I was getting.</li>
            <li> This item was purchased for a birthday in December so it has not been used yet, but I have seen this exact product in use and that is why I purchased it for my daughter.  It is so fun!!!</li>
            <li> This is an okay set to get if you&#x27;re starting out in nail stamping, and looking to get a good deal on Konad polishes and plates. The polishes, plates, stamper and scraper all work okay. I&#x27;ve found there&#x27;s a bit of a learning curve with Konad plates. If you&#x27;re new to stamping, I would recommend getting the [[ASIN:B004GFR3GY Konad Staming Nail Art Stamp &amp; Scraper Set Ii]], and going for the [[ASIN:B005VX8S4G Red Angel (tm) Nail Art Nailart Polish Stamp Stamping Manicure Image Plates Accessories Set Kit 21pc]] or [[ASIN:B006OMHR1S 2012 Collection Is Here!!! Stamping Nail Art Image Plates Bundle of 26 Nailart Image Plates with 160 Designs By Cheeky.]] instead. I&#x27;ve found these are easier to use, and work well with many standard nail polishes. The red stamping polish is not opaque and will not show on dark backgrounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two things to be aware of with this set - it comes with red, white and black polish, not green. The only place this is mentioned is under Important Instructions. Also, the stamper that comes with this set comes with a pink tip, not a white one. This product would benefit from an updated picture and description.</li>
            <li> I bought this after rave reviews on Konad all over the internet.  I was sooo disappointed when it came because I could not get it right.  There is a bit of a learning curve when it comes to this and I had to look up some tips and tricks to help me out.  I got this on Thursday and practiced about 4 times with manicures that I was not happy with.  By Saturday, though, I got my nails just how I wanted them!  Here are some tips I found most useful:  1) Use only pure acetone to clean up (if you do this, filing your stamp will not be necessary)  2) don&#x27;t paint the whole image, just half and then scrape it in the direction of the side you didn&#x27;t paint lightly.  you really don&#x27;t have to press down hard.  3) same thing goes for the stamp, don&#x27;t press down hard!  just press with medium pressure and the whole image comes up and sticks (as long as both the plate and the stamper are dry)  There are tons of sites and blogs with tips and tricks.  I highly recommend them.  There are many more tips, these are just the ones that helped me out the most when i was struggling.  Good luck, nail lovers!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product!! Being that I am not at all artistic this is a great to do nail art. Why I didn&#x27;t rate this product with 5 stars, is that from the picture it show&#x27;s the red, green, and white polish so I order the black also, will when the kit arrived the black was included but not the green. The shipping was super fast it took like 3 days from when I placed my order to reach me.</li>
            <li> Konad is the best when it comes to nail stamps. There is a learning curve but there are plenty of YouTube tutorials that can show you how to use the stamps properly. I just wish it came with more neutral colors (i.e. black, silver, gold) since I&#x27;ve only used the white polish and will probably never use the red or green. Konad also sells different plates and colors separately.</li>
            <li> So... you don&#x27;t HAVE to use their polishes, but it does make it a whole lot easier to use the stamps. The only thing is, Konad polish is not cheep!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time, it don&#x27;t work at all. My daughter was so upset about it, she had all her friends over and it did&#x27;t work. She was not happy and will never use this product again.</li>
            <li> Got this for my nieces haven&#x27;t found out if they like it yet but I have been told it is the rage for teens. I loved the price and it got here fast.</li>
            <li> A friend of my daughters had received this same product for a gift several years ago. Her nails always look so nice and my daughter really wanted this same product for Christmas so I purchased it for her.  When she opened it up on Christmas Day she couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.  She was soon very frustrated.  We aren&#x27;t sure if it&#x27;s something she is doing incorrectly or if there is something wrong with the plates.  This friend of my daughters tried our plates out and she wasn&#x27;t able to get them to work entirely either.  We are going to order some different plates and hope they work.  If not I am not sure what we are going to do.  I will probably contact the company we purchased them from.</li>
            <li> fast shipping!... got this for my niece. she just loves it and uses it all the time for her and friends! perfect. also purchased the 13 pc pastel, and she loves those too.</li>
            <li> Daughter loves it.  Product is exactly as pictures.  Only wished the jars were bigger so it would last for a while.</li>
            <li> This is a good starter kit for those who&#x27;ve never used Konad. It comes with a standard stamper and scraper; three 11 ml special polishes in white, red, and green (Christmas anyone?); and four image plates- m21, m4, m8, and m15. The images are pretty generic, mostly florals, butterflies, and patterns, but I feel these are sufficient for a starter kit, good for practicing (which is the key to using this stamping system). When you become more proficient at the process, you can order more plates. I wished the kit came with a black polish. Honestly, the two colors you&#x27;ll probably use the most for stamping are white and black. The kit comes in a sturdy box, good for shipping.</li>
            <li> If you want to try out stamping, this is the kit to get.  You may want to get more plates, but this is a good tryout</li>
            <li> I had this purchased for me off of my wishlist, along with the M14 imagine plate extra. I received the m14 plate but nothing else was right! I got one Purple nail polish, and 2 random image plates. (m65 and s9)That is it! No stamper, No scraper, no leaflet. What the hell am I supposed to do with some imagine plates now? Not like I can use them! I advise you not to buy this product, and instead find a store to buy it at so you know that what you are paying for, you are getting!</li>
            <li> This works real good we love it an us it all the time . my daughter thinks its the best.</li>
            <li> The product is fun to use &amp; works as described in the instructions. I got it to use with my nieces &amp; they love it.</li>
            <li> HARDER THAN IT LOOKS. VERY MESSY AND NOT MANY OF THE PATTERNS I WANTED, MOSTLY SMALL ONES, NOT THE ONES THAT COVER THE ENTIRE NAIL.</li>
            <li> I love it I love the stamp and the design on the stamp. everything about it is awesome. I would recommend it again</li>
            <li> Very difficult to use!  Stamp isn&#x27;t very easy to lift off the disk.  Stamper doesn&#x27;t last very long as once you get polish on it, it makes it very difficult to pull up the next one off the of disk.</li>
            <li> Our granddaughter lives in Boise Idaho and had never seen the nail stamping.  We had a ball doing nails a couple of times while I was there.  Can&#x27;t wait until school starts to show off this new to her idea for nails.</li>
            <li> This set is great for a beginner or if you want a cheap way to get the stamping polish along with a few plates.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this for 3 people now and they all love it!  I&#x27;ve read about learning curves, but it&#x27;s easier to understand by seeing somebody else do it (watch a youtube vid).  VERY EASY, VERY NEAT, and VERY CUTE!  After your base coat is already applied, the actual stamping process takes about 3-5 minutes for both hands.  Have a different design every week or every other day!!</li>
            <li> Wanted to get some of the nail art polish but didn&#x27;t care for the price.  This allowed me to try them and get a really good bargain at the same time.</li>
            <li> This kit is awesome. It is very easy to use and the price is right.I got compliments and people thought that I got my nails done in salon. Before using the kit, I watched few nail stamping video in youtube and I think that helped a lot in learning the stamping process quickly.</li>
            <li> great starter it fo anyone that wants to try it out. easy and fun i already bought more plates so i can keep up with new trends and styles to hoildays. fun and easy</li>
            <li> I got one of these for each of my nieces for Christmas and they both loved it! I have a set for myself too :)</li>
            <li> This was the first kit I bought because I wanted to learn how to use konad.  I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This really works--and works well.  It will take some practice, but even my first attempt received lots of compliments.  I am very happy and can&#x27;t wait to try more designs!</li>
            <li> This kit is awesome.  Works well even with other polishes.  Works better than the AS SEEN ON TV kit.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter&#x27;s 14th bday and she has used it 3 times and loves it! We will buy again as gifts for others.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She has used it EVERYDAY!!! She loves it and it works just like it is supposed to!</li>
            <li> I gave it as a gift and she says it takes a little bit of practice. Very good quality and has everything that you need.</li>
            <li> I prefer konad for stamping. I have found a few instant dry polishes that are ok, but they&#x27;re never as good as this brand. This was a great starter kit. It has 4 good plate selections and two of the three colors I use most, red and white. I don&#x27;t care for the scraper though. I find an old giftcard cut in half works better. Doesn&#x27;t scratch the plates.</li>
            <li> This is amazing item! really easy to use. fair price and a lot of fun for me and my 12 year daughter!</li>
            <li> I am now hooked on Konad :D I do all my friends nails and it comes out amazing, they have cheaper versions but honestly Konad works the best! I recommend this 100%!!!</li>
            <li> Thanks for helping me solve the problem with polish that was old and would not allow me to stamp it on.They immediately shipped out fresh polish and solved the problem. Would recommend this seller to everyone. Honest and easy to do business with. Thanks for standing behind this product.</li>
            <li> Stamper works very well.  Only thing is you need to use the &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; polish sold for this product.  I don&#x27;t understand why.</li>
            <li> This is a really good started kit, best advice I can give is PRACTICE, plus do not use regular polish, the regular polish does not dry as fast, with that said, speed becomes an advantage when transferring design to stamper and then the nail.</li>
            <li> i will recoment this item as a toy good for kids under 10 years old ,after i bougth it i put it in the garbage can</li>
            <li> This is a gift for a young girl in Norway.  Obviously I cannot really review it properly.  I am just hoping the item is what she was talking about.  It is sure to be a wonderful gift and she will enjoy doing the designs on her nails.</li>
            <li> I got this as a birthday gift for my wife and she loves it. She couldn&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
            <li> The kit is really nice if you want to give something new a try for decorating nails, computers, ipods... the items are endless. It takes a little practice to get the hang of it. I also recommend cleaning the plate after each nail. The polish will stick and dry quickly into the design causing parts not to stamp properly. I am looking forward to new polish colors and new plates. The polish that also comes with the kit is thicker then regular polish so you need basic polish for the base coat then you use the polish for the plates that came with the kit.</li>
            <li> Its really good i gave it to my wife she love it so much i didnt find any problem with this item</li>
            <li> I love this set, It&#x27;s fun and you can use it over and over again . The more you practice the better you get. I love it</li>
            <li> I bought this for my niece and she loves it! Its easy to use and is a must have for teenage girls</li>
            <li> I ordered these as a gift for my daughter and was disappointed.  First one of the bottles of the &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; polish did not have a brush in the bottle.  And then it is very difficult to get the stamp to work.  Either you have too much polish and it makes a blob, or nothing comes off the stamp, or only a portion of the pattern comes through.</li>
            <li> This is my first nail stamping kit, and I&#x27;m absolutely loving it. It&#x27;s very easy to use and gives cute results! The package itself is elegant and impressive - it would make a great gift!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One difference in the set from what&#x27;s described on Amazon - I received a black polish instead of the green, which in my opinion is an improvement! My set does say &amp;#34;B set&amp;#34; on it, just as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The polishes themselves are only for stamping, they can&#x27;t really be applied to nails normally as they&#x27;re quite thick and have a shortish brush. I should mention that I also was able to stamp with regular nail polish just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plates all have cute designs, and the ones I&#x27;ve tried transferred well.</li>
            <li> It was pretty decent I use it every day of I need a touch up it is easy everyone loves it they can&#x27;t seem to get enough of it</li>
            <li> I thought the design would be bigger that what it was.  on the YouTube videos the designs cover the entire area you were working with.  Mine did NOT. the design was VERY tiny.  Also it shows that it comes with red, white, and green polish so i ordered the black polish too.  it came with black polish instead of the green and now i have two black polishes and no green.</li>
