            <li>so creative!</li>
            <li>i love the idea!</li>
            <li>Nothing says &amp;#34;date night&amp;#34; like lathering up with a nice IPA.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for an unusual gift for my husband for Valentine&#x27;s Day and this was perfect!  </li>
            <li>but the presentation is not so nice.  </li>
            <li>really happy with it, it makes for a really unique gift.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t smell very strong through the packaging.  </li>
            <li>People love this kind of stuff.</li>
            <li>He and his wife really enjoy it!</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Looking forward to buying more.</li>
            <li>Funky item that can easily be gifted to your favorite beer-loving friend, as part of groomsmen gifts (or bridesmaids for that matter), etc.</li>
            <li>When he opened this for Christmas he was very excited to have soap that smelled like beer and hops.</li>
            <li>but apparently it&#x27;s his favorite kind of beer, just my luck! :)</li>
            <li>Lathers well washes easily.</li>
            <li>A nice bar of soap with a real beer smell.</li>
            <li>The bar definitely smells like a great IPA, but it doesn&#x27;t make you smell like beer after you use it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a cute present for the guy who has almost everything-and it actually is a good soap.</li>
            <li>A fun gift for the beer lovers!</li>
            <li>I feel clean and my wife says I smell manly...</li>
            <li>packaging is cool and kitschy</li>
            <li>Not overly beer smelling and not overly sweet smelling.</li>
            <li>my younger brother, for whom the gift was for, loved it.</li>
            <li>Both the IPA and the Belgian Witbier are incredibly fresh and leave my skin feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>Came fairly quick.</li>
            <li>(And delivered quickly.)</li>
            <li>Very pleased overall.</li>
            <li>That being said it does not smell like fresh ground hops as i was hoping for.</li>
            <li>I had been searching for something more satisfying than using your average men&#x27;s body wash, and oh boy did I hit a home run with this soap.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s used the IPA one and said it works real well, I assume it&#x27;s good for his skin since he&#x27;s got quite dry skin.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>As an avid homebrewer, I reuse a lot of what can of everything I make.</li>
            <li>Very clever.  </li>
            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t want to later up in some fine beer and soap.  </li>
            <li>This soap smells sweet and works fairly well, though it makes my skin feel dry and tight.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend loves it too, the scent is very gender neutral,</li>
            <li>I gave one bar of beer soap to a friend as a gift and it was received really well.</li>
            <li>) ships FAST</li>
            <li>Theyre much better than standard soaps on the market thats full of chemicals you dont know or can do more wrong than right to your body and skin.</li>
            <li>The soap is high quality, better than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Cool, kitchy present.</li>
            <li>I like the product for 3 main reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>but I was really surprised to find how much I like this soap.</li>
            <li>I like that they use all natural ingredients!</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m going to get more of these for other people for birthdays and christmas next year!</li>
            <li>Had some very cordial and professional interaction with the seller about bulk orders for my country store in  western PA.</li>
            <li>It lasted a long time - even with consistent use.</li>
            <li>Good, bit way too expensive.</li>
            <li>I ordered the IPA for my girlfriend, who really likes craft beer (though I may have picked the IPA for more selfish reasons...).</li>
            <li>Just a little hoppy fresh, if that makes sense, ha.</li>
            <li>This is an all natural soap, that actually does help your skin and body during washing.</li>
            <li>Plus, this is a solid small business worthy of backing.</li>

            <li> It was a total disappointment.</li>
            <li> The subtle beer-ish fragrances (I have both the outmeal stout and the apricot wheat varieties) drastically improved my bathing experience.</li>
            <li> Disappointed as it was a gift for my hop head hubby.</li>
            <li> and we both hate it.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great gift for the beer lover in your life.  Which could be yourself of course.  Nothing says &amp;#34;date night&amp;#34; like lathering up with a nice IPA.  Just resist the urge to take a bite and you&#x27;ll be all good.</li>
            <li> This was a big hit for my boyfriend&#x27;s birthday! Very clever.  He hasn&#x27;t actually used it yet but it doesn&#x27;t smell very strong through the packaging.  Came fairly quick.</li>
            <li> Shipped when specified. Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> We gave this as a gift to my brother in law. He and his wife really enjoy it!</li>
            <li> Great stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> Loved it. It didn&#x27;t last long enough tho.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband&#x27;s stocking this past Christmas and we both hate it.  It didn&#x27;t smell like beer (or hops) at all.  It had no smell whatsoever.  The texture was really strange.  I also had an allergic reaction to it:  hives.  It was a total disappointment.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves the smell and it&#x27;s great in the shower.</li>
            <li> I had been searching for something more satisfying than using your average men&#x27;s body wash, and oh boy did I hit a home run with this soap.  Both the IPA and the Belgian Witbier are incredibly fresh and leave my skin feeling clean.  I like that they use all natural ingredients! My girlfriend loves it too, the scent is very gender neutral, just really deliciously fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve ordered these in bulk, I&#x27;ll be washing with them for quite some time!</li>
            <li> This is a great soap however its says it is made with ground hops. That being said it does not smell like fresh ground hops as i was hoping for. Smells like a good IPA. I will definitely be trying their other products</li>
            <li> I was looking for an unusual gift for my husband for Valentine&#x27;s Day and this was perfect!  He was impressed with the originality of this gift and is looking forward to showing it off to his craft-beer drinking club, &amp;#34;The Beer Reverends&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> No scent that either my husband or I can detect. Disappointed as it was a gift for my hop head hubby.</li>
            <li> This soap smells sweet and works fairly well, though it makes my skin feel dry and tight. I bought it for my beer-loving husband and he seems to like it.</li>
            <li> I already have the Vanilla Porter soap i picked up from local brew supply shop.  I got it to use as a shave soap and it is perfect  good lather and great smell.  Cant wait to try the IPA.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not just that the smell is great, it&#x27;s a GREAT soap for my skin . Lathers well washes easily. I have like 4 of them I rotate between!</li>
            <li> A nice bar of soap with a real beer smell. A fun gift for the beer lovers!</li>
            <li> It smells great and was the perfect &amp;#34;just because&amp;#34; surprise gift for my guy! Would recommend this to my friends</li>
            <li> Good, bit way too expensive.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I think IPAs are terrible - but I was really surprised to find how much I like this soap. I prefer a liquid soap for washing my hands, so this is my shower soap - I&#x27;ve had compliments on how it smells several times, and people never believe me when I tell them it&#x27;s beer soap. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is a quality, hard soap. It lasted a long time - even with consistent use. The subtle beer-ish fragrances (I have both the outmeal stout and the apricot wheat varieties) drastically improved my bathing experience. Plus, this is a solid small business worthy of backing. I gave one bar of beer soap to a friend as a gift and it was received really well. People love this kind of stuff.</li>
            <li> It smells like as manly beer soap- it&#x27;s a cute present for the guy who has almost everything-and it actually is a good soap.</li>
            <li> Have the apricot wheat beer one in the shower now...smells soooo good.</li>
            <li> so creative! i love the idea! perfect for gifts:)</li>
            <li> My Husband loves all sorts of craft beers. When he opened this for Christmas he was very excited to have soap that smelled like beer and hops. He is very satisfied with this product and I would order again!</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd order of Swag soap- I like the product for 3 main reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) awesome, creative, CHEAP gift. I usually buy the six packs and distribute among my guy friends.&lt;br /&gt;2) ships FAST&lt;br /&gt;3) packaging is cool and kitschy</li>
            <li> Had some very cordial and professional interaction with the seller about bulk orders for my country store in  western PA. The soap is high quality, better than other brands I&#x27;ve tried. Very pleased overall. I will be looking forward to future products from this company.</li>
            <li> I bought a couple of these for a friend for Christmas. He&#x27;s used the IPA one and said it works real well, I assume it&#x27;s good for his skin since he&#x27;s got quite dry skin. He has yet to try the Porter soap but apparently it&#x27;s his favorite kind of beer, just my luck! :)</li>
            <li> The soap smells excellent! Not overly beer smelling and not overly sweet smelling. Perfect for the guy in your life that likes a good oatmeal stout!</li>
            <li> Kind of disappointing.  I hope the person I give it to enjoys it but the presentation is not so nice.  No little gift box to show it off a little.</li>
            <li> Smells good conditions skin well too</li>
            <li> got the ipa scent as a christmas present for my beer-loving stepdad, and it was a hit! he loved it. the soap is sort of a solid, yet gel-like texture, and smells faintly like hops but not too much.. asked him if it was weird washing his face with it and he said no, it&#x27;s great! really happy with it, it makes for a really unique gift. i&#x27;m going to get more of these for other people for birthdays and christmas next year!</li>
            <li> I ordered the IPA for my girlfriend, who really likes craft beer (though I may have picked the IPA for more selfish reasons...). The bar definitely smells like a great IPA, but it doesn&#x27;t make you smell like beer after you use it. Just a little hoppy fresh, if that makes sense, ha. It&#x27;s great in the shower, but we decided to leave it by the sink where we can smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great gift! (And delivered quickly.)</li>
            <li> Not just a gimic. Its also very good for the skin.</li>
            <li> Smells great, scrubs and suds well! I feel clean and my wife says I smell manly... Love it</li>
            <li> Was a gift that I would happily order again as the recipient loved it!</li>
            <li> I purchased the IPA soap as a test run and loved it. I went back and purchased the Vanilla Porter soap and the Belgian Witbier soap and they have been just as great. Looking forward to buying more.</li>
            <li> Great gift for the craftbeer lover!</li>
            <li> Got these as Christmas gifts for some co-workers and they loved them. Funky item that can easily be gifted to your favorite beer-loving friend, as part of groomsmen gifts (or bridesmaids for that matter), etc.</li>
            <li> Ive received a couple of these soaps. Theyre much better than standard soaps on the market thats full of chemicals you dont know or can do more wrong than right to your body and skin. This is an all natural soap, that actually does help your skin and body during washing. Beer is good not just for drinking. Its good for skin and hair. As an avid homebrewer, I reuse a lot of what can of everything I make. If you&#x27;re wondering or trying to decide on thiz product, I say do it! You wont regret your purchase.</li>
            <li> Awesome Product.  Smelled great and my younger brother, for whom the gift was for, loved it. Cool, kitchy present.</li>
            <li> This stuff is terrific.  Who doesn&#x27;t want to later up in some fine beer and soap.  Very nice product.  Buy some!</li>
