            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>Came quickly and at a good price!</li>
            <li>Its amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing stuff.  </li>
            <li>The results have been amazing.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what kind of shampoo this is, but it is NOT Nioxin.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable-I&#x27;m very happy with my find.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is really nice.</li>
            <li>Excellent product for thinning hair - shampoo has a nice fragrance and lathers really well.  </li>
            <li>so any improvement is nice.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell.</li>
            <li>At any rate it fills out the hair nicely and no damaged hair results.</li>
            <li>am using it for more than 12 months and steel believe it was a good purchase.</li>
            <li>Really refreshing in the scalp, that looks good without washing for two hole days with this shampoo (wouldnÂ´t dare before).</li>
            <li>The shampoo works best for me if I lather thoroughly and leave it on for a minute of two so it can really do its thing (get rid of DHT).</li>
            <li>An excellent shampoo, and very concentrated</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great shampoo as well, my hair feels clean.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping, great price.</li>
            <li>Love nioxin makes my hair so nice</li>
            <li>Great product, absolutely worth the money.</li>
            <li>I heard about this system from my dental hygienist who has been using it for more than a year and is absolutely thrilled with her results.  </li>
            <li>Great product at the right price compared at the stores.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair.</li>
            <li>We both LOVE LOVE LOVE it!</li>
            <li>But in a good way, totally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was originally turned onto the Nioxin system by my mother&#x27;s hairdresser when I went home for a visit.</li>
            <li>We keep on using this shampoo because we like how it leaves our hair feeling, its a very light shampoo</li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly, and appears to be good.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>No shine, no body, more hair loss.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your hair feel healthy.  </li>
            <li>Being able to order it through Amazon makes it easier than trying to find it in a salon and the price is better.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed that my hair is growing more course than what it was doing before.</li>
            <li>I am going to continue to use this product and hopefully see more and better changes with the texture and</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Would love to try but all shampoos have sulfates which are well known to strip color from dyed hair.</li>
            <li>&amp; I do truly love it.  </li>
            <li>so glad I found it here.</li>
            <li>I thought it was never going to run out! :-)</li>
            <li>And what&#x27;s more he has been able to stop using his dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off buying vitamins formulated for hair growth, the ingredients in this will also make your fall out.</li>
            <li>but when both hands are covered in hair you have to worry...no more clogging the shower and my hair</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>What is interesting, I tried many others shampoos, and I see I start loosing hair rapidly.</li>
            <li>Then to top it off</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so much more affordable at Amazon.</li>
            <li>I am re-ordering though because a shampoo has never made my hair look as shiny and healthy as this product has.</li>
            <li>I feel more confidant using Nioxin to protect against hairloss and hair thinning.  </li>
            <li>We always use more shampoo than the conditioner</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many shampoos for body and they didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I love this and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>Conditioner makes hair seem fuller and more manageable.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo/conditioner.  </li>
            <li>The product was sent fast and everything turned out great.</li>
            <li>and I was on the verge of buying a hair piece to deal with the baldness on the top of my head.  </li>
            <li>Fast service, Great Price.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell whether it&#x27;s regrowing or not, but my hair looks thicker than it was when I started, plus the condition is so much better.</li>
            <li>I will keep using and hopefully will see more improvement as time goes by.</li>
            <li>Every day I have many hair dropping off.</li>
            <li>Make sure to use with the Nioxin scalp treatment.</li>
            <li>If you color your hair make sure to purchase the #4 for chemically treated hair.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo &amp; this</li>
            <li>Mine seems thicker and is growing out better now.</li>
            <li>have to type some more words</li>

            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>After using this shampoo my hair is a lot better</li>
            <li>I love both the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I noticed more hair loss.  </li>
            <li>The Nioxin line of hair treatments are top notch but not inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>Fast service, great product</li>
            <li>The hair does looks better, and feels better.</li>
            <li>Love my Nioxin products.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>Good shampoo,  Makes my hair full and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>love this product, really works great on my fine</li>
            <li>I like the coolness of this shampoo and my hair feels very clean after using it and helps with the itching too.</li>
            <li>Best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
            <li>I am trying this product for the first time and so far I am very happy with the results of this product.</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t use conditioner, our hair has more body without conditioner, but there is a conditioner available if you want it.</li>
            <li>It smells good and it has really thickened up my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair feels very clean, smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>I love the minty clean smell.</li>
            <li>I like this product because of the DHT fighting ability and because it gets my hair clean and is safe for color treated hair.  </li>
            <li>Nioxin 4, along with the Nioxin 4 Scalp foam are showing  a noticeable difference from touch of full body hair, to a healthy appearance, noticed by others.</li>
            <li>The scent is not bad or overpowering, it&#x27;s thick--not diluted, and does an outstanding job cleaning, plumping up my hair and giving it shine.</li>
            <li>Also, the price of this large size is fantastic--no more picking it up at Ulta for me!</li>
            <li>and I have fine hair, and tend to fall when I&#x27;m stressed out.</li>
            <li>If you have fine and/or thinning hair and it is chemically treated this product is for you.  </li>
            <li>Makes my fine hair look and feel fuller.</li>
            <li>This is what I use for fine and highlighted hair</li>
            <li>wish Nioxin would develop a one-step product for fine hair</li>
            <li>highly recommend this cleanser to every guy and girl who tells me about hair thinning issues and highly recommend buying it from Amazon.com; the price is very good for the 33.8 oz bottle</li>
            <li>I use regular conditioner and still get great results</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product with absolutely noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>I used Nioxin&#x27;s System 1 for years, switched to System 2 when it became available, and switched over to System 4 when I started highlighting my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair looks great and it&#x27;s growing back!</li>
            <li>This product is also available for non color treated hair, I just don&#x27;t recall what system number it is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and effective.</li>
            <li>I love Nioxin, BUT I am 99% sure that the product I received when ordering from this listing (\\&quot;DNA Fulfillment\\&quot;) is 1) expired or 2) very diluted or 3)</li>
            <li>Item exactly as listed!!</li>
            <li>This is really worth it!</li>
            <li>I originally purchased it after I read</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair shiny clean and manageable.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo keeps my hair clean looking for up to 3 days.  </li>
            <li>Feels clean.  </li>
            <li>It cleans my hair very well, and it seems to stay clean for almost three days, which is surprising with my very oily hair.</li>
            <li>I love the tingly clean feeling from this shampoo, and really feel that my hair grows faster and healthier when I use Nioxin system 4.  </li>
            <li>This product is a great mild cleanser for colored or dry hair.  </li>
            <li>Additionally it works amazing on providing a soft and manageable hair</li>
            <li>The 33.8 ounce bottle is huge and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t go without this shampoo, adding to it the conditioner and scalp treatment, my hair now looks full at the scalp level,</li>
            <li>What I notice the most with this product is that I stop losing so much hair.  </li>
            <li>Just love this stuff, my hair is so much thicker</li>
            <li>I bought this at the recommendation of my hair stylist who said she&#x27;d heard only good things about Nioxin products.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo really helps to give my hair more fullness &amp; body.</li>
            <li>lets hope this continues to work, everyone only has good things to say about it</li>
            <li>my hair seems to be in good condition as possible.</li>
            <li>This is the best stuff on the market for thin and fine hair.  </li>
            <li>She experienced hair thinning and loss after extreme dieting and this has restored it for her.  </li>
            <li>Leaves it fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Better yet get the whole product line, it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser recommended this product years ago when it first became available.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product, have used for years, of course, if it wasn&#x27;t used we donot know if it really has helped that is not possible to tell, but it is worth the money and continued use....</li>
            <li>No unpleasant aroma.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended daily shampoo great for cleansing oily skin also</li>
            <li>She has been using nioxin products for 4 months and grows so much hair!!</li>
            <li>This shampoo is the best for a sensitive scalp with less irritants causing itch and hair loss.</li>
            <li>After blow drying my hair it looks 2-3 times thicker, well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>me, this product has been worth the price.  </li>
            <li>so I think it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Nioxin is worth trying</li>
            <li>For the first time in over 12 years, I have a full head of hair.  </li>
            <li>Later I found maybe system 4 should fit to me better</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>worth the cost.  </li>
            <li>WELL WORTH the money it costs</li>
            <li>Will continue to use until depleted but don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>It is worth a try.</li>
            <li>It may tingle a bit, but leaves the scalp, and hair feeling very clean and natural.</li>
            <li>We received their conditioner, not the cleanser,  We would like to have the right product</li>
            <li>It rinses out clean &amp; fast, unlike store bought products.  </li>
            <li>The price is reasonable for such a large bottle of good shampoo.</li>
            <li>It is the same quality as she would buy from the salons, but for a much less price which makes me happy!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s shiny, full and looks so much healthier.</li>
            <li>Then a couple weeks ago I noticed that I have a significant new curl of hair at my widow&#x27;s peak!  </li>
            <li>nice large bottle it should last me a while.</li>
            <li>It is more expensive, but it works, and on Amazon I get a great deal and price</li>
            <li>Seems like a good cleanser, but so far I&#x27;ve only used it for about a month</li>
            <li>and super fast delivery</li>
            <li>Even though my hair isn&#x27;t too thin, I love the way this shampoo makes my hair feel - clean, full, and healthy.  </li>
            <li>Nioxin is very gentle on hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li>I like this shampoo very much.</li>
            <li>the new formula, after using the other for many, many years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using it for years and it never fails me.  </li>
            <li>The only shame of it all is that I could have been diagnosed and treated ten years ago before I lost most of the hair on top of my head.  </li>
            <li>and it really works!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have bought &amp; used this shampoo</li>
            <li>You have to use the shampoo regularly, but I am pleased.</li>
            <li>The first set is about 6 inches now</li>
            <li>This allows the regular shampoo to do a better job after the Nioxin has dissolved hair spray, spritz, mousse, etc.  </li>
            <li>My first purchase of Nioxin was to resolve a thinning hair problem.</li>
            <li>I have been using the product (along with the conditioner) for over a year now and really like the way that it has helped to thicken up my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again!</li>
            <li>Although I accredit that mostly to the supplements, which are now off the market, I continue to use the shampoo, conditioner and also the thermal bliss spray and extra hold hair spray.</li>
            <li>I used this shampoo several times, assuming that per the label,  it was safe for color treated hair.</li>
            <li>I really believe my hair is healthier and thicker!</li>
            <li>So I kept using the shampoo and sure enough, my hair stopped falling out.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>and I was able to buy it for a fraction of the cost at the local beauty supply store.</li>
            <li>This is the first product I have ever found to improve the thickness of my hair.</li>
            <li>It took about 2 weeks to really see a difference!</li>
            <li>is so concentrated that the last bottle I got lasted me for 9 WHOLE MONTHS!!!!</li>
            <li>I suggest it all as they even have products for normal hair, check them out!!</li>
            <li>Smells good, leaves hair clean and not dry, and I have noticed that I&#x27;m losing less hair.</li>
            <li>At first I missed the sweet fragrance of previous shampoos, but now I love the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; fragrance of this product.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants healthy hair especially if they have thinning hair.</li>
            <li>I use with other system 4 products--the conditioner, and the therapy treatment, which at first I wasn&#x27;t too enthusiastic about, not seeing any improvement, but after a fair trial, I feel that if the condition isn&#x27;t being reversed with re-growth, at least it is holding steady,  and I&#x27;m not losing ground.</li>
            <li>I was losing my hair, not in large bits, but every day.  </li>
            <li>Got my product on time as advertised, and it has certainly helped in my hair regrowth attempt.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and wear it very short.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do much if anything for hair loss in the front, but what a difference everywhere else.  </li>
            <li>and it really works.</li>
            <li>but she really like this one.</li>
            <li>and it really reduces the amount of hair loss, breakage.  </li>
            <li>changing your diet, or using a product that is really created to target that issue, don&#x27;t buy this shampoo if you&#x27;re expecting something else than well cleaned hair.</li>
            <li>My beautician said that it can be drying, bur for me that is a plus, as I have very oily hair.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo is clear, does not take out my hair dye, and smells fresh.  </li>
            <li>I have absolutely nothing else to attribute it to so</li>
            <li>and then that really defeats the volume you get from the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used the whole Nioxin system (cleanser + conditioner + serum) but it is the cleanser that really does the trick for me</li>
            <li>and I have rarely been able to find it cheaper in my local salons or big box stores.</li>
            <li>I tried several products from cheap, to not-so-cheap.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product highly!</li>
            <li>I really think it is the combination of the two products.  </li>
            <li>It really does work</li>
            <li>The smell is  mediciney but it doesn&#x27;t really bother us.  </li>
            <li>Who really knows but we like it so whatever.</li>
            <li>Works really well.  </li>
            <li>and I noticed that I did not lose as much hair as I used to..  </li>
            <li>I really think these products help keep my hair from losing volume</li>
            <li>My wife is satisfied with the product with minimal hair loss.</li>
            <li>Not as much seems to be coming out when I comb or brush after shampooing.</li>
            <li>It is very invigorating also.</li>
            <li>Nioxin was recommended, I tried it and it has worked very well for me.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>They really help with thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>really like this brand for my hair</li>
            <li>Try it and you will begin to see a real difference in your hair.  </li>
            <li>you can really see the change .</li>
            <li>My hair seems healthier, grows faster and definitely not as thin.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo to help thin hair look thicker.</li>
            <li>Packaged very well.</li>
            <li>I have thinning hair and these products have made it look much fuller than it is.</li>
            <li>shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Really does make your hair feel much thicker</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo along with the Nioxin 4-conditioner for several months now and my hair has completely changed for the better.</li>
            <li>Nioxin (Matrix) products have turned out to be exactly what they should be--hair saving and new re-growth from the product line.</li>
            <li>The other products that claim to grow hair must be used continually in order to keep hair looking full, (as per my stylist) but if I run out of this product or use other shampoos in between, my hair is still full and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>Nioxin works better than any of the other products</li>
            <li>Nioxin works better than any other brand.  </li>
            <li>My daughter pointed out to me the actual information on the higher numbers such as 4 in relation to the better results that can be achieved.</li>
            <li>It gets the hair clean, smells nice, isn&#x27;t harsh and my hair looks healthier than it has in a long time.</li>
            <li>the only this shampoo is good for my hair, and I notice less hair fall out.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for as long as I can remember, I have very fine hair, and I find color and perms last longer with Nioxine products.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend no longer has to use it, it worked so good for her, at least for awhile!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have used Nioxin for years and can still credit it for stopping hairloss when on high doses of prednisone some years ago.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a little upset that it claims to be color safe</li>
            <li>Alone with their Volumizing Effects Bliss Thermal Protector spray, my fine, thin hair has had more body than usual, but this is not working any more.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed a difference in the amount of hair lost when I stopped using this product; give it a few weeks of non-regular use and there&#x27;s a lot more hair shedding than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cleans hair like normal shampoo.  </li>
            <li>shampoo has really helped when I&#x27;ve been going through shedding related to surgery onset telogen effluvium as well; it can&#x27;t stop the hair loss but it does still keep the remaining bits looking good and again, I&#x27;ve noticed that much less hair is lost when I use the shampoo on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In fact, it came back right after I started using this and Rogain.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say whether I have new hair growth anywhere else on my head but wanted to mention my experience.  </li>
            <li>Oh well, live and learn.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s kinda premature to see if NEW hair is growing.  </li>
            <li>And sure enough, it \\&quot;bleached\\&quot; out the freshly done dark blonde color in my hair.</li>
            <li>I got their System 4, not because my hair is thinning, but because I&#x27;ve been on so many medications this past year that I want to remove the chemicals that have gotten into my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it first and then shampoo with regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I noticed my hair stopped shedding almost completely!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 63 years old and cannot believe what a wonder this shampoo has been to my hair &amp; scalp!</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I started using Nioxin in Dec of 2013 and in a year my hair is back to normal plus some!!</li>
            <li>Recently it has been harder to locate an easy supply.  </li>
            <li>My hair is so fine that I cannot wash it everyday.  </li>
            <li>Was in a plastic bag luckily, so didn&#x27;t damage other products in box</li>
            <li>Based on these pros and cons, I remained undecided about whether I would reorder when the bottle is empty and really hadn&#x27;t thought much about it since.      </li>
            <li>I used this product after nearly going bald after two surgeries in a row.</li>
            <li>my hair is SO SOFT, my head so refreshed and scalp</li>
            <li>This is now the only shampoo she wants to use.  </li>
            <li>My color fades faster with the frequent shampooing.</li>
            <li>I have tried natural products and Bosley.  </li>
            <li>My wife has been using this product for about 4 weeks now, and likes the Niozin Cleanser quite well, however it&#x27;s too early to judge if the product does anything for thinning hair.</li>
            <li>When it finally thawed out at room temperature the consistency and texture were really wierd.</li>
            <li>Works well so far.</li>
            <li>Makes hair feel full, but not weighted down.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve made this course of treatment part of my everyday care because the result is absolutely worth it!</li>
            <li>It just feels extra clean compared to any other shampoo ive used.  </li>
            <li>The large size of this bottle goes well with the kits if you don&#x27;t use the other products as regularly as the cleanser, or even if you use all the products at the same time but tend to use more cleanser than the other products.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t do without it as long as I can find it at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and thin</li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin hair</li>
            <li>and I can see improvement in the health of my very fine and thin hair.</li>
            <li>My new female dermatologist did a biopsy and diagnosed me with \\&quot;scarring alopecia\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>It seems to stabilize my hair lost, and possible help in new growth.</li>
            <li>Last week, my hairdresser actually commented on how much thicker my hair seems now.  </li>
            <li>On occasion, I&#x27;d try other brands that were developed for thinning hair, but they never helped as much as Nioxin.</li>
            <li>Since he&#x27;s been using it a few years back his hairline hasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;stopped&amp;#34; receding but it has slowed significantly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slow, and fine, but it&#x27;s there.</li>
            <li>#34;what the heck?&amp;#34; and picked it up for a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am SO glad these come in big bottles, because I seriously adore this cleanser.</li>
            <li>I have a friend who recommended this to help make my hair grow faster and and make it feel more full because it was falling out so bad.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the rest of the Nioxin line as I have found so far that the shampoo is enough.</li>
            <li>, it arrived sooner that I expected it and very well packed</li>
            <li>I dislike the scent (peppermint/Mentholatum vibe) and my hair coloring hasn&#x27;t lasted nearly as long since I began using it, but I immediately liked the texture it gives my (thin and thinning) hair.  </li>
            <li>I had completely forgotten about new hair growth being an alleged possibility with this shampoo and struggled to come up with an explanation.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use much at all so this size bottle will last me for a very long time (year(s)).  </li>
            <li>This shampoo works OK, not really sure if this is working, can&#x27;t tell one way or the other.  </li>
            <li>Wife and hair stylist say this has kept my hair thick and slowed thinning significantly.</li>
            <li>After having several surgeries last year, my naturally thinning hair reached an all time low.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an older lady and have had issues with thinning hair, due in part to the sebum in my scalp thickening.  </li>
            <li>It rinses completely out of your hair without making your hair dry.</li>
            <li>bottle is large enough that it could also be used as a refiller for smaller bottles if previously purchased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 60ish and have always had fine thin hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair has always been extremely fine and thin.  </li>

            <li> This formula, Number 4, is also marketed on Nioxin web site as being safe for color treated hair!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> Came quickly and at a good price!</li>
            <li> Its amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing stuff.  </li>
            <li> The results have been amazing.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what kind of shampoo this is, but it is NOT Nioxin.</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable-I&#x27;m very happy with my find.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is really nice.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for thinning hair - shampoo has a nice fragrance and lathers really well.  </li>
            <li> so any improvement is nice.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> At any rate it fills out the hair nicely and no damaged hair results.</li>
            <li> am using it for more than 12 months and steel believe it was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Really refreshing in the scalp, that looks good without washing for two hole days with this shampoo (wouldnÂ´t dare before).</li>
            <li> The shampoo works best for me if I lather thoroughly and leave it on for a minute of two so it can really do its thing (get rid of DHT).</li>
            <li> An excellent shampoo, and very concentrated</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great shampoo as well, my hair feels clean.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, great price.</li>
            <li> Love nioxin makes my hair so nice</li>
            <li> Great product, absolutely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I heard about this system from my dental hygienist who has been using it for more than a year and is absolutely thrilled with her results.  </li>
            <li> Great product at the right price compared at the stores.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair.</li>
            <li> We both LOVE LOVE LOVE it!</li>
            <li> But in a good way, totally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was originally turned onto the Nioxin system by my mother&#x27;s hairdresser when I went home for a visit.</li>
            <li> We keep on using this shampoo because we like how it leaves our hair feeling, its a very light shampoo</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly, and appears to be good.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> No shine, no body, more hair loss.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your hair feel healthy.  </li>
            <li> Being able to order it through Amazon makes it easier than trying to find it in a salon and the price is better.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed that my hair is growing more course than what it was doing before.</li>
            <li> I am going to continue to use this product and hopefully see more and better changes with the texture and</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Would love to try but all shampoos have sulfates which are well known to strip color from dyed hair.</li>
            <li> &amp; I do truly love it.  </li>
            <li> so glad I found it here.</li>
            <li> I thought it was never going to run out! :-)</li>
            <li> And what&#x27;s more he has been able to stop using his dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off buying vitamins formulated for hair growth, the ingredients in this will also make your fall out.</li>
            <li> but when both hands are covered in hair you have to worry...no more clogging the shower and my hair</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> What is interesting, I tried many others shampoos, and I see I start loosing hair rapidly.</li>
            <li> Then to top it off</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so much more affordable at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am re-ordering though because a shampoo has never made my hair look as shiny and healthy as this product has.</li>
            <li> I feel more confidant using Nioxin to protect against hairloss and hair thinning.  </li>
            <li> We always use more shampoo than the conditioner</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many shampoos for body and they didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I love this and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Conditioner makes hair seem fuller and more manageable.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo/conditioner.  </li>
            <li> The product was sent fast and everything turned out great.</li>
            <li> and I was on the verge of buying a hair piece to deal with the baldness on the top of my head.  </li>
            <li> Fast service, Great Price.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell whether it&#x27;s regrowing or not, but my hair looks thicker than it was when I started, plus the condition is so much better.</li>
            <li> I will keep using and hopefully will see more improvement as time goes by.</li>
            <li> Every day I have many hair dropping off.</li>
            <li> Make sure to use with the Nioxin scalp treatment.</li>
            <li> If you color your hair make sure to purchase the #4 for chemically treated hair.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo &amp; this</li>
            <li> Mine seems thicker and is growing out better now.</li>
            <li> have to type some more words</li>
            <li> The Thinning Shampoo makes my hair more manageable and appears fuller.  </li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for years and continue to be pleased with it.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> After using this shampoo my hair is a lot better</li>
            <li> I love both the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I noticed more hair loss.  </li>
            <li> The Nioxin line of hair treatments are top notch but not inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> Fast service, great product</li>
            <li> The hair does looks better, and feels better.</li>
            <li> Love my Nioxin products.  </li>
            <li> LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Good shampoo,  Makes my hair full and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> love this product, really works great on my fine</li>
            <li> I like the coolness of this shampoo and my hair feels very clean after using it and helps with the itching too.</li>
            <li> Best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
            <li> I am trying this product for the first time and so far I am very happy with the results of this product.</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t use conditioner, our hair has more body without conditioner, but there is a conditioner available if you want it.</li>
            <li> It smells good and it has really thickened up my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair feels very clean, smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li> I love the minty clean smell.</li>
            <li> I like this product because of the DHT fighting ability and because it gets my hair clean and is safe for color treated hair.  </li>
            <li> Nioxin 4, along with the Nioxin 4 Scalp foam are showing  a noticeable difference from touch of full body hair, to a healthy appearance, noticed by others.</li>
            <li> The scent is not bad or overpowering, it&#x27;s thick--not diluted, and does an outstanding job cleaning, plumping up my hair and giving it shine.</li>
            <li> Also, the price of this large size is fantastic--no more picking it up at Ulta for me!</li>
            <li> and I have fine hair, and tend to fall when I&#x27;m stressed out.</li>
            <li> If you have fine and/or thinning hair and it is chemically treated this product is for you.  </li>
            <li> Makes my fine hair look and feel fuller.</li>
            <li> This is what I use for fine and highlighted hair</li>
            <li> wish Nioxin would develop a one-step product for fine hair</li>
            <li> highly recommend this cleanser to every guy and girl who tells me about hair thinning issues and highly recommend buying it from Amazon.com; the price is very good for the 33.8 oz bottle</li>
            <li> I use regular conditioner and still get great results</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product with absolutely noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> I used Nioxin&#x27;s System 1 for years, switched to System 2 when it became available, and switched over to System 4 when I started highlighting my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair looks great and it&#x27;s growing back!</li>
            <li> This product is also available for non color treated hair, I just don&#x27;t recall what system number it is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> I love Nioxin, BUT I am 99% sure that the product I received when ordering from this listing (\\&quot;DNA Fulfillment\\&quot;) is 1) expired or 2) very diluted or 3)</li>
            <li> Item exactly as listed!!</li>
            <li> This is really worth it!</li>
            <li> I originally purchased it after I read</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair shiny clean and manageable.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo keeps my hair clean looking for up to 3 days.  </li>
            <li> Feels clean.  </li>
            <li> It cleans my hair very well, and it seems to stay clean for almost three days, which is surprising with my very oily hair.</li>
            <li> I love the tingly clean feeling from this shampoo, and really feel that my hair grows faster and healthier when I use Nioxin system 4.  </li>
            <li> This product is a great mild cleanser for colored or dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Additionally it works amazing on providing a soft and manageable hair</li>
            <li> The 33.8 ounce bottle is huge and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t go without this shampoo, adding to it the conditioner and scalp treatment, my hair now looks full at the scalp level,</li>
            <li> What I notice the most with this product is that I stop losing so much hair.  </li>
            <li> Just love this stuff, my hair is so much thicker</li>
            <li> I bought this at the recommendation of my hair stylist who said she&#x27;d heard only good things about Nioxin products.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo really helps to give my hair more fullness &amp; body.</li>
            <li> lets hope this continues to work, everyone only has good things to say about it</li>
            <li> my hair seems to be in good condition as possible.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff on the market for thin and fine hair.  </li>
            <li> She experienced hair thinning and loss after extreme dieting and this has restored it for her.  </li>
            <li> Leaves it fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Better yet get the whole product line, it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this product years ago when it first became available.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product, have used for years, of course, if it wasn&#x27;t used we donot know if it really has helped that is not possible to tell, but it is worth the money and continued use....</li>
            <li> No unpleasant aroma.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended daily shampoo great for cleansing oily skin also</li>
            <li> She has been using nioxin products for 4 months and grows so much hair!!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is the best for a sensitive scalp with less irritants causing itch and hair loss.</li>
            <li> After blow drying my hair it looks 2-3 times thicker, well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Worth it.</li>
            <li> me, this product has been worth the price.  </li>
            <li> so I think it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Nioxin is worth trying</li>
            <li> For the first time in over 12 years, I have a full head of hair.  </li>
            <li> Later I found maybe system 4 should fit to me better</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> worth the cost.  </li>
            <li> WELL WORTH the money it costs</li>
            <li> Will continue to use until depleted but don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> It is worth a try.</li>
            <li> It may tingle a bit, but leaves the scalp, and hair feeling very clean and natural.</li>
            <li> We received their conditioner, not the cleanser,  We would like to have the right product</li>
            <li> It rinses out clean &amp; fast, unlike store bought products.  </li>
            <li> The price is reasonable for such a large bottle of good shampoo.</li>
            <li> It is the same quality as she would buy from the salons, but for a much less price which makes me happy!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shiny, full and looks so much healthier.</li>
            <li> Then a couple weeks ago I noticed that I have a significant new curl of hair at my widow&#x27;s peak!  </li>
            <li> nice large bottle it should last me a while.</li>
            <li> It is more expensive, but it works, and on Amazon I get a great deal and price</li>
            <li> Seems like a good cleanser, but so far I&#x27;ve only used it for about a month</li>
            <li> and super fast delivery</li>
            <li> Even though my hair isn&#x27;t too thin, I love the way this shampoo makes my hair feel - clean, full, and healthy.  </li>
            <li> Nioxin is very gentle on hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li> I like this shampoo very much.</li>
            <li> the new formula, after using the other for many, many years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using it for years and it never fails me.  </li>
            <li> The only shame of it all is that I could have been diagnosed and treated ten years ago before I lost most of the hair on top of my head.  </li>
            <li> and it really works!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have bought &amp; used this shampoo</li>
            <li> You have to use the shampoo regularly, but I am pleased.</li>
            <li> The first set is about 6 inches now</li>
            <li> This allows the regular shampoo to do a better job after the Nioxin has dissolved hair spray, spritz, mousse, etc.  </li>
            <li> My first purchase of Nioxin was to resolve a thinning hair problem.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product (along with the conditioner) for over a year now and really like the way that it has helped to thicken up my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again!</li>
            <li> Although I accredit that mostly to the supplements, which are now off the market, I continue to use the shampoo, conditioner and also the thermal bliss spray and extra hold hair spray.</li>
            <li> I used this shampoo several times, assuming that per the label,  it was safe for color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I really believe my hair is healthier and thicker!</li>
            <li> So I kept using the shampoo and sure enough, my hair stopped falling out.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> and I was able to buy it for a fraction of the cost at the local beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> This is the first product I have ever found to improve the thickness of my hair.</li>
            <li> It took about 2 weeks to really see a difference!</li>
            <li> is so concentrated that the last bottle I got lasted me for 9 WHOLE MONTHS!!!!</li>
            <li> I suggest it all as they even have products for normal hair, check them out!!</li>
            <li> Smells good, leaves hair clean and not dry, and I have noticed that I&#x27;m losing less hair.</li>
            <li> At first I missed the sweet fragrance of previous shampoos, but now I love the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; fragrance of this product.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who wants healthy hair especially if they have thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I use with other system 4 products--the conditioner, and the therapy treatment, which at first I wasn&#x27;t too enthusiastic about, not seeing any improvement, but after a fair trial, I feel that if the condition isn&#x27;t being reversed with re-growth, at least it is holding steady,  and I&#x27;m not losing ground.</li>
            <li> I was losing my hair, not in large bits, but every day.  </li>
            <li> Got my product on time as advertised, and it has certainly helped in my hair regrowth attempt.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and wear it very short.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do much if anything for hair loss in the front, but what a difference everywhere else.  </li>
            <li> and it really works.</li>
            <li> but she really like this one.</li>
            <li> and it really reduces the amount of hair loss, breakage.  </li>
            <li> changing your diet, or using a product that is really created to target that issue, don&#x27;t buy this shampoo if you&#x27;re expecting something else than well cleaned hair.</li>
            <li> My beautician said that it can be drying, bur for me that is a plus, as I have very oily hair.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo is clear, does not take out my hair dye, and smells fresh.  </li>
            <li> I have absolutely nothing else to attribute it to so</li>
            <li> and then that really defeats the volume you get from the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the whole Nioxin system (cleanser + conditioner + serum) but it is the cleanser that really does the trick for me</li>
            <li> and I have rarely been able to find it cheaper in my local salons or big box stores.</li>
            <li> I tried several products from cheap, to not-so-cheap.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product highly!</li>
            <li> I really think it is the combination of the two products.  </li>
            <li> It really does work</li>
            <li> The smell is  mediciney but it doesn&#x27;t really bother us.  </li>
            <li> Who really knows but we like it so whatever.</li>
            <li> Works really well.  </li>
            <li> and I noticed that I did not lose as much hair as I used to..  </li>
            <li> I really think these products help keep my hair from losing volume</li>
            <li> My wife is satisfied with the product with minimal hair loss.</li>
            <li> Not as much seems to be coming out when I comb or brush after shampooing.</li>
            <li> It is very invigorating also.</li>
            <li> Nioxin was recommended, I tried it and it has worked very well for me.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> They really help with thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> really like this brand for my hair</li>
            <li> Try it and you will begin to see a real difference in your hair.  </li>
            <li> you can really see the change .</li>
            <li> My hair seems healthier, grows faster and definitely not as thin.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo to help thin hair look thicker.</li>
            <li> Packaged very well.</li>
            <li> I have thinning hair and these products have made it look much fuller than it is.</li>
            <li> shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Really does make your hair feel much thicker</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo along with the Nioxin 4-conditioner for several months now and my hair has completely changed for the better.</li>
            <li> Nioxin (Matrix) products have turned out to be exactly what they should be--hair saving and new re-growth from the product line.</li>
            <li> The other products that claim to grow hair must be used continually in order to keep hair looking full, (as per my stylist) but if I run out of this product or use other shampoos in between, my hair is still full and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> Nioxin works better than any of the other products</li>
            <li> Nioxin works better than any other brand.  </li>
            <li> My daughter pointed out to me the actual information on the higher numbers such as 4 in relation to the better results that can be achieved.</li>
            <li> It gets the hair clean, smells nice, isn&#x27;t harsh and my hair looks healthier than it has in a long time.</li>
            <li> the only this shampoo is good for my hair, and I notice less hair fall out.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for as long as I can remember, I have very fine hair, and I find color and perms last longer with Nioxine products.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend no longer has to use it, it worked so good for her, at least for awhile!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have used Nioxin for years and can still credit it for stopping hairloss when on high doses of prednisone some years ago.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little upset that it claims to be color safe</li>
            <li> Alone with their Volumizing Effects Bliss Thermal Protector spray, my fine, thin hair has had more body than usual, but this is not working any more.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference in the amount of hair lost when I stopped using this product; give it a few weeks of non-regular use and there&#x27;s a lot more hair shedding than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cleans hair like normal shampoo.  </li>
            <li> shampoo has really helped when I&#x27;ve been going through shedding related to surgery onset telogen effluvium as well; it can&#x27;t stop the hair loss but it does still keep the remaining bits looking good and again, I&#x27;ve noticed that much less hair is lost when I use the shampoo on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In fact, it came back right after I started using this and Rogain.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say whether I have new hair growth anywhere else on my head but wanted to mention my experience.  </li>
            <li> Oh well, live and learn.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s kinda premature to see if NEW hair is growing.  </li>
            <li> And sure enough, it \\&quot;bleached\\&quot; out the freshly done dark blonde color in my hair.</li>
            <li> I got their System 4, not because my hair is thinning, but because I&#x27;ve been on so many medications this past year that I want to remove the chemicals that have gotten into my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it first and then shampoo with regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I noticed my hair stopped shedding almost completely!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 63 years old and cannot believe what a wonder this shampoo has been to my hair &amp; scalp!</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I started using Nioxin in Dec of 2013 and in a year my hair is back to normal plus some!!</li>
            <li> Recently it has been harder to locate an easy supply.  </li>
            <li> My hair is so fine that I cannot wash it everyday.  </li>
            <li> Was in a plastic bag luckily, so didn&#x27;t damage other products in box</li>
            <li> Based on these pros and cons, I remained undecided about whether I would reorder when the bottle is empty and really hadn&#x27;t thought much about it since.      </li>
            <li> I used this product after nearly going bald after two surgeries in a row.</li>
            <li> my hair is SO SOFT, my head so refreshed and scalp</li>
            <li> This is now the only shampoo she wants to use.  </li>
            <li> My color fades faster with the frequent shampooing.</li>
            <li> I have tried natural products and Bosley.  </li>
            <li> My wife has been using this product for about 4 weeks now, and likes the Niozin Cleanser quite well, however it&#x27;s too early to judge if the product does anything for thinning hair.</li>
            <li> When it finally thawed out at room temperature the consistency and texture were really wierd.</li>
            <li> Works well so far.</li>
            <li> Makes hair feel full, but not weighted down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made this course of treatment part of my everyday care because the result is absolutely worth it!</li>
            <li> It just feels extra clean compared to any other shampoo ive used.  </li>
            <li> The large size of this bottle goes well with the kits if you don&#x27;t use the other products as regularly as the cleanser, or even if you use all the products at the same time but tend to use more cleanser than the other products.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t do without it as long as I can find it at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and thin</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair</li>
            <li> and I can see improvement in the health of my very fine and thin hair.</li>
            <li> My new female dermatologist did a biopsy and diagnosed me with \\&quot;scarring alopecia\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> It seems to stabilize my hair lost, and possible help in new growth.</li>
            <li> Last week, my hairdresser actually commented on how much thicker my hair seems now.  </li>
            <li> On occasion, I&#x27;d try other brands that were developed for thinning hair, but they never helped as much as Nioxin.</li>
            <li> Since he&#x27;s been using it a few years back his hairline hasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;stopped&amp;#34; receding but it has slowed significantly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slow, and fine, but it&#x27;s there.</li>
            <li> #34;what the heck?&amp;#34; and picked it up for a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am SO glad these come in big bottles, because I seriously adore this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have a friend who recommended this to help make my hair grow faster and and make it feel more full because it was falling out so bad.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the rest of the Nioxin line as I have found so far that the shampoo is enough.</li>
            <li> , it arrived sooner that I expected it and very well packed</li>
            <li> I dislike the scent (peppermint/Mentholatum vibe) and my hair coloring hasn&#x27;t lasted nearly as long since I began using it, but I immediately liked the texture it gives my (thin and thinning) hair.  </li>
            <li> I had completely forgotten about new hair growth being an alleged possibility with this shampoo and struggled to come up with an explanation.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use much at all so this size bottle will last me for a very long time (year(s)).  </li>
            <li> This shampoo works OK, not really sure if this is working, can&#x27;t tell one way or the other.  </li>
            <li> Wife and hair stylist say this has kept my hair thick and slowed thinning significantly.</li>
            <li> After having several surgeries last year, my naturally thinning hair reached an all time low.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an older lady and have had issues with thinning hair, due in part to the sebum in my scalp thickening.  </li>
            <li> It rinses completely out of your hair without making your hair dry.</li>
            <li> bottle is large enough that it could also be used as a refiller for smaller bottles if previously purchased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 60ish and have always had fine thin hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair has always been extremely fine and thin.  </li>
            <li> I sent a complaint right away and never heard back.  </li>
            <li> I have only used this product twice, so too early to tell if my thin hair will start growing back in again, but even if not this shampoo and conditioner after my first use brought my hair back to life.</li>
            <li> She has me on monthly shots of medication to try to stimulate hair growth, as my hair is very thin now on top.  </li>
            <li> At this point, after only eight months of usage, not sure if my hair is thicker, but I don&#x27;t seem to be loosing as much as I was before I used it.  </li>
            <li> Curious, I ordered some of this in place of my usual shampoo, not really expecting anything but clean and hopefully volumized hair.  </li>
            <li> The bigger bottles last a long time!</li>
            <li> Not sure this is the real stuff</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes my hair feel super-thin, flat and lifeless.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit pricey but does last a long time</li>
            <li> My hair was just flat as a pancake.</li>
            <li> Have not used it long enough to see any differance</li>
            <li> as of December this product has actually increased oil in my scalp and caused my hair to become extremely dry.</li>
            <li> Afterwards, my hair actually seemed thinner and lifeless; even dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li> Pretty much what I expected from an expensive shampoo.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice a big difference, and the smell is a little different, but I do like the shine</li>
            <li> I also tried Nioxin Intensive Therapy Recharging Complex too and that made my hair worse; it actually caused more hair loss, breaking and brittleness.  </li>
            <li> when i took a shower my long hair would come out in hand-full,,i</li>
            <li> I have been using Nioxin for a long time and when I saw it in Amazon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 40+ yrs, female with alarmingly thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product as long as I have hair</li>
            <li> and I should have hair as long as I use this product.  </li>
            <li> so it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Item is exactly what I wanted, and at half the price I usually pay at the salon.</li>
            <li> If you have thin, fine, limp hair, this is what you need.</li>
            <li> will likely continue using this and may investigate other products in the line.</li>
            <li> And it LASTS for so long!</li>
            <li> The volume only lasts 1 day.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoos and other Nioxin products</li>
            <li> I bought this based on a friend&#x27;s recommendation and the many positives reviews I read on here, but I have to admit I was a little skeptical about whether anything could stop my hair from thinning.</li>
            <li> My hair is thinning due to a medication I&#x27;m currently on, &amp; my husband&#x27;s thinning is hereditary.</li>
            <li> This shampoo cleared up my dry scalp problem, leaves my  hair manageable and also does not compromise my hair color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it will &amp;#34;grow&amp;#34; hair that&#x27;s gone, as I&#x27;m not missing any hair.</li>
            <li> know you loose hair</li>
            <li> I use Nioxin System 4, which actually breaks down the sebum and unclogs the pores in my scalp, which has helped me to regrow some of my hair.  </li>
            <li> The only negative is that the recommended usage calls for daily shampooing; I let it go 2 days instead.</li>
            <li> The tingle isn&#x27;t harsh, the peppermint smell is divine and definitely wakes you up in the morning, and afterwards...</li>
            <li> My hair started thinning a few years back</li>
            <li> Received it faster than expected.</li>
            <li> Shipping was faster than expected.</li>
            <li> Tried everything, no real luck.</li>
            <li> Received as expected.</li>
            <li> When I first started using the shampoo, I could tell it helped my hair look a little less thin because it left the hair cleaner than the other shampoos I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Using the so called conditioner only weighed my hair down and made it flat and dull looking.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use this shampoo my hair is so fine it is impossible to style</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years which reversed my hair loss due to genetic hormonal changes.  </li>
            <li> even when I was thinning due to genetics.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nioxin does not test on animals, which is why I use it instead of the other stuff.</li>
            <li> Before I used Nioxin 5 from other seller.</li>
            <li> My hair is thinning due to age and hereditary.</li>
            <li> Also has eliminated any dandruff that I used to have with other shampoos.  </li>
            <li> My BFF used this product, also due to a hereditary condition, so recommended it to us.</li>
            <li> I use this product every other day.</li>
            <li> My hair is falling out worse than ever, and the \\&quot;New and Improved\\</li>
            <li> It is thicker and fluffier and there is new hair growth in the thin spots.</li>
            <li> It might be a little drying for someone with very dry hair, but if that&#x27;s the case, try using it every other day or so.</li>
            <li> I have also been using Nioxin Recharging Complex (the vitamins) and taking them daily and still no improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had read several negative reviews</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the mint / peppermint smell and while it does what it should, it makes my hair very flyaway and difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> my hair is thick and the hair that I lost along my hairline is back.</li>
            <li> This product has not stopped or slowed down my husband&#x27;s hair loss.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair loss is way down from a month ago.  </li>
            <li> Does not weigh down hair.  </li>
            <li> I dye my hair platinum blonde and it regrows out in less than two weeks!!!</li>
            <li> I have an inch to two inches grow out in less than a month.</li>
            <li> The last couple of years, it wasn&#x27;t only thin, it was THINNING!  </li>
            <li> This seems to be working for me, as I have noticed a slight change in the amount of hair loss when brushing my hair.</li>
            <li> Nioxin cleanser is a shampoo for thin hair, they also have other shampoos and conditioners for different types of hair,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , it dried it out and matted the hair down to my scalp.</li>
            <li> so though it&#x27;s expensive, it last a long time.</li>
            <li> A little pricy</li>
            <li> We only use the Cleanser, because even my hair dresser says that the conditioner is unnecessary, and just an added expense.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always been thin but this was different.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair, some due to constantly dying it and some to genetics.</li>
            <li> I had a small patch of alopecia a few years ago and it seemed to&lt;br /&gt;help.</li>
            <li> my hairdresser sees improvement and new hair growth.. been using it faithfully for 7 months... don&#x27;t be afraid to try it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for the past three or so months</li>
            <li> so i was skeptical, but after having used it for just a short time</li>
            <li> I have hair just past my shoulders and this shampoo</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure about the regrowth.  </li>
            <li> No more peek-a-boo scalp.  </li>
            <li> no more flat thin looking hair with my scalp showing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried switching to other shampoos just to see what will happen, and every time I&#x27;ve done that, my hair goes back to falling out again really bad.</li>
            <li> It DOES seem like that small bald spot is SLOWLY filling in.  </li>
            <li> That is a hard thing to gauge</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for at least a year</li>
            <li> I do not like to leave negative reviews.</li>
            <li> It is just like a common shampoo.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t recommend it unless you dont mind spend a lot money for a common shampoo.</li>
            <li> which is a negative.</li>
            <li> Falling out like crazy, getting noticeably thin, dull, dried out, broken, flat, limp, coated, frizzy...</li>
            <li> Have tried other expensive brands, but they don&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> It was dull and dry and just awful before, but after one use my hair is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> My hair was getting so thin, it was unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> Considering I&#x27;ve got some seriously thinning patches along my hairline, I thought &amp;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it worked, but the difference is dramatic and I won&#x27;t be changing shampoos anytime soon.</li>
            <li> will continue using (at least until it&#x27;s gone!).</li>
            <li> and you just have to use a bit of the shampoo, since it&#x27;s very thick.</li>
            <li> Very slowly though.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this product for my thin hair.  </li>
            <li> I think it helps my thin hair.  </li>
            <li> The frizzies and broken ends are gone.</li>
            <li> was always so dried out or raw or flaking terribly.  </li>
            <li> &quot; Bliss Thermal Protector spray is lousy.  </li>
            <li> Give it a try, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Definitely expensive, but in my view?</li>
            <li> In fact, my hair (the density of the hair strands) is WORSE!  </li>
            <li> Why pay overpriced prices for lousy results?</li>
            <li> WE RECEIVED THE WRONG PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Scary.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist is completely skeptical</li>
            <li> Expensive product.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very thin.</li>
            <li> My hair has grown like crazy.</li>
            <li> If you have poor health and are loosing your hair this is a product for you!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this company &amp; AMAZON for the lack of response.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed to discover this contains Sodium Lauryl Sulfate and methyparaben.</li>
            <li> But very disappointed on this.</li>
            <li> this shampoo is horrible.</li>
            <li> the worst hair product i have ever used.</li>
            <li> Before I got this, my hair was in horrible shape.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using this product for some time and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, and the price is great with this Amazon vendor.  We only use the Cleanser, because even my hair dresser says that the conditioner is unnecessary, and just an added expense.  I use regular conditioner and still get great results and it keeps my hair growing back in where it otherwise starts thinning.  Nioxin works better than any of the other products my husband and I have tried!</li>
            <li> This does work for the side and upper back of your head.  It doesn&#x27;t do much if anything for hair loss in the front, but what a difference everywhere else.  A buddy at work told me about this product and I took the chance and I&#x27;m glad I did.  I now have it on regular order so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> If you have thin, fine, limp hair, this is what you need. I use this and the conditioner. After blow drying my hair it looks 2-3 times thicker, well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Using this for years.  Wife and hair stylist say this has kept my hair thick and slowed thinning significantly.</li>
            <li> Nioxin works better than any other brand.  Even though my hair isn&#x27;t too thin, I love the way this shampoo makes my hair feel - clean, full, and healthy.  Have tried other expensive brands, but they don&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> Will never buy from this seller again.  I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin shampoo for about 12 years.  I don&#x27;t know what kind of shampoo this is, but it is NOT Nioxin.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use this shampoo my hair is so fine it is impossible to style</li>
            <li> My niece who is a hairdresser recommended this product.  Nioxin is very gentle on hair and scalp.  I got their System 4, not because my hair is thinning, but because I&#x27;ve been on so many medications this past year that I want to remove the chemicals that have gotten into my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle is large enough that it could also be used as a refiller for smaller bottles if previously purchased.</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now and it really works.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nioxin System 4 shampoo for years.  Alone with their Volumizing Effects Bliss Thermal Protector spray, my fine, thin hair has had more body than usual, but this is not working any more.  My hair is falling out worse than ever, and the \\&quot;New and Improved\\&quot; Bliss Thermal Protector spray is lousy.  No shine, no body, more hair loss.  I am looking for another product.</li>
            <li> I used this product after nearly going bald after two surgeries in a row. I began to see improvement in my hair and scalp within two weeks. I use it all the time now. Great peppermint scrub!</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair, some due to constantly dying it and some to genetics. Since being deployed I decided to try this product. I also use the conditioner as well. Also another part of the system. The bigger bottles last a long time! Well worth the price. I dye my hair platinum blonde and it regrows out in less than two weeks!!! Its amazing. I have an inch to two inches grow out in less than a month. My hair has grown like crazy. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love nioxin makes my hair so nice</li>
            <li> Nioxin is a wonderful shampoo and conditioner.  It leaves your hair feel healthy.  At this point, after only eight months of usage, not sure if my hair is thicker, but I don&#x27;t seem to be loosing as much as I was before I used it.  At first I missed the sweet fragrance of previous shampoos, but now I love the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; fragrance of this product.  I initially wanted to just \\&quot;try\\&quot; it, and now I plan to \\&quot;stay\\&quot; with it.  Being able to order it through Amazon makes it easier than trying to find it in a salon and the price is better.  Give it a try, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my hair is growing more course than what it was doing before. I am going to continue to use this product and hopefully see more and better changes with the texture and how it progresses my stop hair loss.</li>
            <li> When I received this product, it was in a box way too big &amp; it had leaked all over the box.  I sent a complaint right away and never heard back.  Very disappointed in this company &amp; AMAZON for the lack of response.  I know this was a while ago, but I just had another item sent that was damaged &amp; I came across the photos I took of this order--and realized there hadn&#x27;t been any resolution.</li>
            <li> This is a really good product.  I have been using it for a couple of years, and can tell my hair is healthier.</li>
            <li> love this product, really works great on my fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;and the value is really good too. used to have to buy this from beauty&lt;br /&gt;supply shop.</li>
            <li> But in a good way, totally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was originally turned onto the Nioxin system by my mother&#x27;s hairdresser when I went home for a visit. Considering I&#x27;ve got some seriously thinning patches along my hairline, I thought &amp;#34;what the heck?&amp;#34; and picked it up for a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am SO glad these come in big bottles, because I seriously adore this cleanser. I&#x27;ve been using it for the past three or so months and I *am* seeing regrowth. It&#x27;s slow, and fine, but it&#x27;s there. But more than that, I can&#x27;t even describe how amazing my scalp feels after I&#x27;ve washed and conditioned my hair with this stuff! The tingle isn&#x27;t harsh, the peppermint smell is divine and definitely wakes you up in the morning, and afterwards... my hair is SO SOFT, my head so refreshed and scalp all tingleriffic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even my husband has converted to using this system (he uses System 6 because his hair is coarser) and he loves it. Definitely expensive, but in my view? Worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she is really happy with the results. She bought lot of products over the years but she really like this one.</li>
            <li> Great product, absolutely worth the money. I have been using this product for years and it really reduces the amount of hair loss, breakage.  My hair is colored and the cleanser does not fade or change any color I use.</li>
            <li> Pretty much what I expected from an expensive shampoo.</li>
            <li> Me and my husband have been using this shampoo for almost 3 years now. My husband is going bald and I have fine hair, and tend to fall when I&#x27;m stressed out. We keep on using this shampoo because we like how it leaves our hair feeling, its a very light shampoo but, if you&#x27;re expecting your hair to re-grow or get thicker this is not the rout. This product has not stopped or slowed down my husband&#x27;s hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try changing your diet, or using a product that is really created to target that issue, don&#x27;t buy this shampoo if you&#x27;re expecting something else than well cleaned hair.</li>
            <li> Item is exactly what I wanted, and at half the price I usually pay at the salon.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  It rinses completely out of your hair without making your hair dry.</li>
            <li> If you have fine and/or thinning hair and it is chemically treated this product is for you.  I have been using it for years and it never fails me.  It leaves your hair shiny clean and manageable.  Better yet get the whole product line, it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist.  My beautician said that it can be drying, bur for me that is a plus, as I have very oily hair.  My hair has been thinning for quite some time, and I was mistakenly diagnosed ten years ago with \\&quot;male pattern baldness\\&quot;.  My new female dermatologist did a biopsy and diagnosed me with \\&quot;scarring alopecia\\&quot;.  She has me on monthly shots of medication to try to stimulate hair growth, as my hair is very thin now on top.  She also feels that this product will help my hair grow back in.  The only shame of it all is that I could have been diagnosed and treated ten years ago before I lost most of the hair on top of my head.  The shampoo is clear, does not take out my hair dye, and smells fresh.  It cleans my hair very well, and it seems to stay clean for almost three days, which is surprising with my very oily hair.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo very much. It gets the hair clean, smells nice, isn&#x27;t harsh and my hair looks healthier than it has in a long time. I will buy this product, again. The price is reasonable for such a large bottle of good shampoo.</li>
            <li> Would love to try but all shampoos have sulfates which are well known to strip color from dyed hair. What a shame because they insist some of their shampoos are good for color treated hair, not if they have sulfates.</li>
            <li> this shampoo is horrible. the worst hair product i have ever used. it made my hair do nothing but frizz. i would return it but i dont feel like dealing with the hassle. will never buy this brand of hair products again</li>
            <li> I heard about this system from my dental hygienist who has been using it for more than a year and is absolutely thrilled with her results.  She experienced hair thinning and loss after extreme dieting and this has restored it for her.  (She uses the entire system.)      Curious, I ordered some of this in place of my usual shampoo, not really expecting anything but clean and hopefully volumized hair.  I dislike the scent (peppermint/Mentholatum vibe) and my hair coloring hasn&#x27;t lasted nearly as long since I began using it, but I immediately liked the texture it gives my (thin and thinning) hair.  Based on these pros and cons, I remained undecided about whether I would reorder when the bottle is empty and really hadn&#x27;t thought much about it since.      Then a couple weeks ago I noticed that I have a significant new curl of hair at my widow&#x27;s peak!  I had completely forgotten about new hair growth being an alleged possibility with this shampoo and struggled to come up with an explanation.  I have absolutely nothing else to attribute it to so will likely continue using this and may investigate other products in the line. I can&#x27;t say whether I have new hair growth anywhere else on my head but wanted to mention my experience.  (Note that results appeared after about 7-8 weeks of near-daily shampooing.)</li>
            <li> All I have used for over a year now and it really works!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have bought &amp; used this shampoo &amp; I do truly love it.  It rinses out clean &amp; fast, unlike store bought products.  My hair is so fine that I cannot wash it everyday.  This shampoo keeps my hair clean looking for up to 3 days.  It&#x27;s amazing stuff.  My hair loss is way down from a month ago.  Very pleased.  Thank you Nioxin!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 6 months now and I see NO improvement whatsoever.  In fact, my hair (the density of the hair strands) is WORSE!  This shampoo makes my hair feel super-thin, flat and lifeless.  I have also been using Nioxin Recharging Complex (the vitamins) and taking them daily and still no improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not be buying anything by Nioxin again.  Why pay overpriced prices for lousy results?</li>
            <li> Makes my fine hair look and feel fuller. My hairdresser even noticed without me telling her. definitely recommend this stuff!</li>
            <li> BUYER BEWARE!! I love Nioxin, BUT I am 99% sure that the product I received when ordering from this listing (\\&quot;DNA Fulfillment\\&quot;) is 1) expired or 2) very diluted or 3) not actually Nioxin at all. I happen to have some Nioxin #4 shampoo left from what I got at Ulta, and both the color, consistency, and scent are different. I have also noticed that my hair seems to have started lightening since I started using it. I wish I had just shelled out the $ at Ulta. Oh well, live and learn.</li>
            <li> I love the tingly clean feeling from this shampoo, and really feel that my hair grows faster and healthier when I use Nioxin system 4.  I was paying twice the amount for the same product at Ulta--I&#x27;m so glad I found it here.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I had read several negative reviews so i was skeptical, but after having used it for just a short time, I&#x27;ve discovered that it indeed makes my hair fuller and easier to deal with. The price is very reasonable-I&#x27;m very happy with my find.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t go without this shampoo, adding to it the conditioner and scalp treatment, my hair now looks full at the scalp level, no more flat thin looking hair with my scalp showing! The other products that claim to grow hair must be used continually in order to keep hair looking full, (as per my stylist) but if I run out of this product or use other shampoos in between, my hair is still full and healthy looking. This is an amazing product with absolutely noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> It seems to stabilize my hair lost, and possible help in new growth. My husband and I both uses this product.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is excellent for giving my hair lots of fullness and for keeping my hair from falling out! The scent is not bad or overpowering, it&#x27;s thick--not diluted, and does an outstanding job cleaning, plumping up my hair and giving it shine. And it LASTS for so long! I have hair just past my shoulders and this shampoo is so concentrated that the last bottle I got lasted me for 9 WHOLE MONTHS!!!! I thought it was never going to run out! :-) I&#x27;ve tried switching to other shampoos just to see what will happen, and every time I&#x27;ve done that, my hair goes back to falling out again really bad. So I switch back again to Nioxin System 4, and my hair gets healthier again. This is really worth it!</li>
            <li> This product does give thinning hair some extra volume but it drys the hair out so you almost have to use the conditioner and then that really defeats the volume you get from the shampoo.  The volume only lasts 1 day.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoos and other Nioxin products DID NOT stop my hair loss or regrow any hair.</li>
            <li> I have a severe case of PCOS and the unfortunate side effect of hair loss took a toll on my formerly lovely locks.  This shampoo has been a godsend and has helped to keep the hair on my head thicker and healthier. I have noticed a difference in the amount of hair lost when I stopped using this product; give it a few weeks of non-regular use and there&#x27;s a lot more hair shedding than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo has really helped when I&#x27;ve been going through shedding related to surgery onset telogen effluvium as well; it can&#x27;t stop the hair loss but it does still keep the remaining bits looking good and again, I&#x27;ve noticed that much less hair is lost when I use the shampoo on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the whole Nioxin system (cleanser + conditioner + serum) but it is the cleanser that really does the trick for me and I&#x27;ve taken to just ordering and using the cleanser alone with my conditioner of choice.  I used Nioxin&#x27;s System 1 for years, switched to System 2 when it became available, and switched over to System 4 when I started highlighting my hair. All have worked well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this cleanser to every guy and girl who tells me about hair thinning issues and highly recommend buying it from Amazon.com; the price is very good for the 33.8 oz bottle and I have rarely been able to find it cheaper in my local salons or big box stores.</li>
            <li> This formula definitely helps my husband with his receding hairline. Since he&#x27;s been using it a few years back his hairline hasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;stopped&amp;#34; receding but it has slowed significantly. And what&#x27;s more he has been able to stop using his dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> Formula has been changed. Even though this WILL grow your hair. You&#x27;re better off buying vitamins formulated for hair growth, the ingredients in this will also make your fall out. So make sense out of that.</li>
            <li> I was losing my hair, not in large bits, but every day.  I had not heard of this product until my hairdresser mentioned it.  I began to use it and take a vitiam B tablet every day and have not lost any hair since.</li>
            <li> Product was as described and on time.  Great product.  I am a Nioxin fan.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this product for my thin hair.  6 weeks and I have great results!  I will continue using.</li>
            <li> This product has kept what hair we have in great shape and condition.  We swear it ios why we still have the hair we do!!</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years. Seems to help.</li>
            <li> when i took a shower my long hair would come out in hand-full,,i know you loose hair but when both hands are covered in hair you have to worry...no more clogging the shower and my hair growing back healther then before i have about 5 layers that show it still is working,i i&#x27;m on a maintance now..i still color my hair, and feel good about my hair,and on amazon you can not beat the price...</li>
            <li> My hairdresser told me about this shampoo. I have fine hair and wear it very short. I had noticed a couple of areas where my hair seemed to be thinning. It took about 6 wks, but I definitely noticed a difference. You have to use the shampoo regularly, but I am pleased.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. I take this in conjunction with biotin and it has truly done wonders for my hair. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> WE RECEIVED THE WRONG PRODUCT. We received their conditioner, not the cleanser,  We would like to have the right product</li>
            <li> This is what I use for fine and highlighted hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years which reversed my hair loss due to genetic hormonal changes.  I use the shampoo and creme rinse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 60ish and have always had fine thin hair.  The last couple of years, it wasn&#x27;t only thin, it was THINNING!  I tried several products from cheap, to not-so-cheap.  This cleanser I&#x27;ve been using for about 3 months now and what a difference!  I HAVE HAIR!!  I recommend this product highly!</li>
            <li> I like the coolness of this shampoo and my hair feels very clean after using it and helps with the itching too.</li>
            <li> Cleans hair like normal shampoo.  A little pricy but it lasts 6 months to a year.. My hair dresser recommended it and I have been using it for about one year.  I think it helps my thin hair.  Sometimes you can find it at TJX.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read all the reviews and I guess to summarize, everyone is very different.  My daughter at 17 I noticed her hair looking like spider webs. It&#x27;s always been thin but this was different. She has been using nioxin products for 4 months and grows so much hair!! The first set is about 6 inches now but she has constant baby hairs growing. Her hair is noticeably thicker and I recommend this product to everyone I know. It truly has amazed me</li>
            <li> This shampoo is awesome!  My hair was getting so thin, it was unbelievable.  I started using this shampoo and a supplement with Biotin in it at the same time.  The results have been amazing.  I really think it is the combination of the two products.  Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in slowing my hair loss or thickening my hair with this shampoo. Can&#x27;t tell a difference between this and the Head &amp; Shoulders I used prior to switching to Nioxin</li>
            <li> the only this shampoo is good for my hair, and I notice less hair fall out.  What is interesting, I tried many others shampoos, and I see I start loosing hair rapidly.</li>
            <li> Nioxin (Matrix) products have turned out to be exactly what they should be--hair saving and new re-growth from the product line. If you have poor health and are loosing your hair this is a product for you!! It really does work--I&#x27;ll continue to use it and to share it with others!</li>
            <li> History of thinning hair in women in my family. Then to top it off I had four surgeries and such trauma made my hair fall out at the rate of over 1,000 hairs a day. Scary. The day I started using Nioxin was the day it stopped falling out. My dermatologist is completely skeptical but I&#x27;m convinced. Two years later I&#x27;m still using it and my hair is thicker now than before...even when I was thinning due to genetics. I only was my hair 2-3 times a week so though it&#x27;s expensive, it last a long time.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo. I&#x27;ve used this for at least a year and it&#x27;s so much more affordable at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I order this regularly.  It is a great product which removes all residue of hair products from your hair.  I use it first and then shampoo with regular shampoo.  This allows the regular shampoo to do a better job after the Nioxin has dissolved hair spray, spritz, mousse, etc.  I originally purchased it after I read claims that it would stop hair loss with age.  That is a hard thing to gauge but I don&#x27;t believe I have lost any additional hair since using Nioxin.  However, because of its cleansing ability I would continue to use it even if it didn&#x27;t stop hair loss.</li>
            <li> Nioxin products have been a part of my hair routine for over 10 years. My daughter pointed out to me the actual information on the higher numbers such as 4 in relation to the better results that can be achieved. I have very fine hair. My first purchase of Nioxin was to resolve a thinning hair problem. Nioxin 4, along with the Nioxin 4 Scalp foam are showing  a noticeable difference from touch of full body hair, to a healthy appearance, noticed by others. I will repurchase this product</li>
            <li> This is a very good product at a really, really great price!!!</li>
            <li> they have changed the formula, it is now made in Mexico, and my hair was like hay&lt;br /&gt;with the new formula, after using the other for many, many years.&lt;br /&gt;AWFUL!!!  AVOID.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait two weeks before posting a review. I&#x27;ve come to this conclusion. This shampoo is really nice. However, it&#x27;s not going to help your hair grow, it&#x27;s just not. I am re-ordering though because a shampoo has never made my hair look as shiny and healthy as this product has. It&#x27;s like I have someone else&#x27;s beautiful hair on my head. An enormous improvement in hair health. I like it a lot, just don&#x27;t expect it I help your hair grow -update jan 14 as of December this product has actually increased oil in my scalp and caused my hair to become extremely dry. It just stopped working?</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this product years ago when it first became available.  My hair has always been extremely fine and thin.  What I notice the most with this product is that I stop losing so much hair.  If I cease using it for a week or so, I begin to notice the difference.  My hair starts showing up on the floor and in the shower again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this product has been worth the price.  I don&#x27;t use the rest of the Nioxin line as I have found so far that the shampoo is enough.</li>
            <li> I feel more confidant using Nioxin to protect against hairloss and hair thinning.  It&#x27;s a great shampoo as well, my hair feels clean.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a gift for my daughter.  I started using this shampoo cause my hair was thinning and at that time my daughter began using it also.  This is now the only shampoo she wants to use.  It is a bit pricey but does last a long time so I think it is worth it.  The smell is  mediciney but it doesn&#x27;t really bother us.  We always use more shampoo than the conditioner so we just bought the cleanser this time.  Does it work?  Who really knows but we like it so whatever.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner was recommended by my hair dresser. It is the only type I&#x27;ll use. Have used the number 3 for 1 1/2 years and just bought the number 4. I love them both!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed to discover this contains Sodium Lauryl Sulfate and methyparaben. So buyer beware because it&#x27;s not returnable.</li>
            <li> My hair has been thinning for years. This is the only product I&#x27;ve found to be helpful. In any case, it is a good, pleasant,  shampoo that also seems to thicken the hair a bit. I use the recommended # 4 scalp conditioner. The only negative is that the recommended usage calls for daily shampooing; I let it go 2 days instead. My color fades faster with the frequent shampooing.</li>
            <li> I bought this product by mistake. I meant to get the 3 strength. It still works and I will continue to buy nioxin</li>
            <li> Got my product on time as advertised, and it has certainly helped in my hair regrowth attempt. Additionally it works amazing on providing a soft and manageable hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many shampoos for body and they didn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m not sure it will &amp;#34;grow&amp;#34; hair that&#x27;s gone, as I&#x27;m not missing any hair. My hair was just flat as a pancake. The shampoo does create body that lasts all day and you just have to use a bit of the shampoo, since it&#x27;s very thick. I love this and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for 2 years. Every time I go to the saloon the stylist ask me what do I use to care my hair that make it looks so great!</li>
            <li> I have been using Nioxin for a long time and when I saw it in Amazon I did not hesitate.  A great product.for thinning  hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for thinning hair - shampoo has a nice fragrance and lathers really well.  Conditioner makes hair seem fuller and more manageable.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, great price. Item exactly as listed!!</li>
            <li> I have been using the product (along with the conditioner) for over a year now and really like the way that it has helped to thicken up my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again!</li>
            <li> Been using Nioxin for over 25 years.  love it and it does grow hair!  My husband and my son use.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nioxin for about 15 years.  I have exzema and my scalp was always so dried out or raw or flaking terribly.  The Nioxin healed my scalp and has kept it in very good condition all these years.</li>
            <li> Works really well.  Makes hair feel full, but not weighted down.</li>
            <li> I use all the Nioxin products for cleansing hair, etc.  My hair is very fine and thin and I thought this would help me in styling efforts as well as regrowth.  I do believe it helps add volume to your hair but I&#x27;m not sure about the regrowth.  We&#x27;ll wait and see.</li>
            <li> Nioxin....did not my hair to grow and thicken.  It has slowed hair loss.  I have tried natural products and Bosley.  Bosley worked for 2 years...them my hair started falling out.  Nioxin seems to condition my hair and reduce fall out.  I am using the entire Nioxin product line.  All of the system helps me to style my thining hair...&lt;br /&gt;Nioxin is worth trying</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an older lady and have had issues with thinning hair, due in part to the sebum in my scalp thickening.  I use Nioxin System 4, which actually breaks down the sebum and unclogs the pores in my scalp, which has helped me to regrow some of my hair.  It feels tingly and works well, so I am very happy with it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It smells good and it has really thickened up my hair.</li>
            <li> Super-fast delivery. Everything just as presented!</li>
            <li> Just love this stuff, my hair is so much thicker</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo/conditioner.  It is more expensive, but it works, and on Amazon I get a great deal and price</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t notice any difference</li>
            <li> The product was sent fast and everything turned out great. I will be ordering this product again once I am finished with this bottle.</li>
            <li> My hair looks great and it&#x27;s growing back!</li>
            <li> My hair is thinning and I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now.  I&#x27;m hoping to see a difference soon.</li>
            <li> Have used this for several years. Works great!</li>
            <li> My wife and I have used Nioxin Cleanser as our standard shampoo for 8+ years.  As our hair thins in our aging years we have moved from one system to the next with the same satisfaction.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 40+ yrs, female with alarmingly thinning hair. I started using the Nioxin system after a friend recommended it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this along with the conditioner and the supplements. I noticed my hair stopped shedding almost completely! Although I accredit that mostly to the supplements, which are now off the market, I continue to use the shampoo, conditioner and also the thermal bliss spray and extra hold hair spray. They work best for my hair overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nioxin does not test on animals, which is why I use it instead of the other stuff.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my &amp;#34;old lady hair.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Nioxin cleanser is a shampoo for thin hair, they also have other shampoos and conditioners for different types of hair,&lt;br /&gt;I use this and I noticed that I did not lose as much hair as I used to..  I have auto immune diseases that cause loss of hair&lt;br /&gt;so this product helps me.  I suggest it all as they even have products for normal hair, check them out!!</li>
            <li> Have been using this in combination with Nioxin Scalp Therapy for about 5 years.  Does everything I would expect it to do.  Do not think there is a comparable product of system on the market for people with fine/thinning hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish Nioxin would develop a one-step product for fine hair so I don&#x27;t have to carry 2 bottles when I travel.</li>
            <li> Nioxin has a wonderful minty fragrance and feel. And I can always tell a difference in my hair when using it. It is thicker and fluffier and there is new hair growth in the thin spots.</li>
            <li> My hair had gotten progressively thinner with age and I was on the verge of buying a hair piece to deal with the baldness on the top of my head.  I bought this at the recommendation of my hair stylist who said she&#x27;d heard only good things about Nioxin products.  For over 4 months now, I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin System 4 Cleanser and Conditioner, along with a generic form of topical Rogaine; Hair, Skin, and Nails formula vitamins; and Oil of Evening Primrose.  For the first time in over 12 years, I have a full head of hair.  No more peek-a-boo scalp.  I am so grateful that my condition has responded to this regimen and I have no idea whether it&#x27;s the combination of all the products or specifically just one or two items.  Personally, I don&#x27;t care.  I&#x27;ve made this course of treatment part of my everyday care because the result is absolutely worth it!</li>
            <li> I tried this shampoo and have to say that I saw none of the results promised.  Afterwards, my hair actually seemed thinner and lifeless; even dry and brittle.  I am done trying anything that Nioxin puts out.  I also tried Nioxin Intensive Therapy Recharging Complex too and that made my hair worse; it actually caused more hair loss, breaking and brittleness.  NO THANK YOU NIOXIN!!!</li>
            <li> nice large bottle it should last me a while.</li>
            <li> Please read the list of ingredients. It contains sodium laureth sulfate. Just google this ingredient. Theres a lot of unbiased information on the Internet. Oh and it contains methyl and propyl paraben, if that is of any interest. The description reads \\&quot;color shield\\&quot;, don&#x27;t believe it. This formula, Number 4, is also marketed on Nioxin web site as being safe for color treated hair!  I used this shampoo several times, assuming that per the label,  it was safe for color treated hair. And sure enough, it \\&quot;bleached\\&quot; out the freshly done dark blonde color in my hair. Not only that, it dried it out and matted the hair down to my scalp. Could not get a comb thru it. Using the so called conditioner only weighed my hair down and made it flat and dull looking. You decide. I&#x27;m a little upset that it claims to be color safe when its so obviously not. I do not like to leave negative reviews. Thank you.</li>
            <li> this has helped my wife&#x27;s thinning hair</li>
            <li> Great product. My hair started thinning a few years back and that is when I started it. It definitely reversed some of the hair loss.</li>
            <li> Does not weigh down hair.  Leaves it fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> After having several surgeries last year, my naturally thinning hair reached an all time low.  I had used Nioxin products before and restarted the regime....great results!  I really think these products help keep my hair from losing volume and I won&#x27;t go without!</li>
            <li> Great. Fast service, Great Price. Will continue to order from this vendor.</li>
            <li> I really believe my hair is healthier and thicker!</li>
            <li> It just feels extra clean compared to any other shampoo ive used.  its quite expensive, but i love it.  would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Noticed a definite improvement in noticeable hair loss in about 6 months.  When I stopped using it, the hair loss returned - will never stop using again!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is wonderful. Leaves the hair, looking, feeling, and smelling good too.</li>
            <li> My wife is satisfied with the product with minimal hair loss.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo for thinning hair.  Smells good.  Feels clean.  I have used for years</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think its a miracle worker, but i believe my hair thinning situation has improved.</li>
            <li> Got this Nioxin System 4 Cleanser for my wife which she wanted and loves. It is the same quality as she would buy from the salons, but for a much less price which makes me happy!</li>
            <li> Great Cleanser, I have a problem with thinning hair and this works wonders.</li>
            <li> Received it faster than expected. Very pleased, thank you.</li>
            <li> The Nioxin Cleanser Systym 4 appears to make my hair cleaner, softer and, perhaps, a bit fuller.</li>
            <li> Seems like a good cleanser, but so far I&#x27;ve only used it for about a month so it&#x27;s kinda premature to see if NEW hair is growing.  It DOES seem like that small bald spot is SLOWLY filling in.  Very slowly though.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and it does make a difference.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for as long as I can remember, I have very fine hair, and I find color and perms last longer with Nioxine products.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on a friend&#x27;s recommendation and the many positives reviews I read on here, but I have to admit I was a little skeptical about whether anything could stop my hair from thinning. I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo along with the Nioxin 4-conditioner for several months now and my hair has completely changed for the better. It&#x27;s like night and day. Before I got this, my hair was in horrible shape. Falling out like crazy, getting noticeably thin, dull, dried out, broken, flat, limp, coated, frizzy...it was a disaster. When I first started using the shampoo, I could tell it helped my hair look a little less thin because it left the hair cleaner than the other shampoos I&#x27;ve used. So I kept using the shampoo and sure enough, my hair stopped falling out. I can&#x27;t tell whether it&#x27;s regrowing or not, but my hair looks thicker than it was when I started, plus the condition is so much better. It&#x27;s shiny, full and looks so much healthier. The frizzies and broken ends are gone. I get compliments now instead of wanting to hide my hair under a hat. I&#x27;m not sure how it worked, but the difference is dramatic and I won&#x27;t be changing shampoos anytime soon. It might be a little drying for someone with very dry hair, but if that&#x27;s the case, try using it every other day or so. The minty scent is very refreshing too! The 33.8 ounce bottle is huge and worth every penny. Best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
            <li> Good product would buy again.  The product works as advertised and is good quality for the money. . . . . .</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for and I was able to buy it for a fraction of the cost at the local beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> This seems to be working for me, as I have noticed a slight change in the amount of hair loss when brushing my hair. Not as much seems to be coming out when I comb or brush after shampooing. I have very fine, thin hair so any improvement is nice. I will keep using and hopefully will see more improvement as time goes by.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product twice, so too early to tell if my thin hair will start growing back in again, but even if not this shampoo and conditioner after my first use brought my hair back to life. It was dull and dry and just awful before, but after one use my hair is soft and shiny. It looks twenty years younger. Now, if it stops falling out and starts growing back in, then that will just be the icing on the cake.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a number of years and have found it to be beneficial part of my regimen in slowing hair loss</li>
            <li> Before I used Nioxin 5 from other seller. It works for me. Later I found maybe system 4 should fit to me better so I bought this one in Jan. But very disappointed on this. It is just like a common shampoo. 11 months passed. Every day I have many hair dropping off. Don&#x27;t recommend it unless you dont mind spend a lot money for a common shampoo. I will switch.</li>
            <li> This product is a great mild cleanser for colored or dry hair.  It can also be used as a body wash- which is convenient for travel.  My husband is also using this product and I feel his hair has become thicker as a result.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who wants healthy hair especially if they have thinning hair. It is very invigorating also.</li>
            <li> this product helps my problem...I notice the difference in my hair when I do not use the product.....which is a negative.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works OK, not really sure if this is working, can&#x27;t tell one way or the other.  It has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> Smells good, leaves hair clean and not dry, and I have noticed that I&#x27;m losing less hair.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this product for about 4 weeks now, and likes the Niozin Cleanser quite well, however it&#x27;s too early to judge if the product does anything for thinning hair.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of a bottle this big from Amazon. Last week, my hairdresser actually commented on how much thicker my hair seems now.  I am not kidding folks...this Nioxin System 4 is great shampoo/conditioner if you have fine, color treated, noticeably thinning hair!  This product is also available for non color treated hair, I just don&#x27;t recall what system number it is.</li>
            <li> For fine colored treated hair this product is awesome, I would have bought the conditioner as well. Shipping was faster than expected.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is the best for a sensitive scalp with less irritants causing itch and hair loss.</li>
            <li> After a lengthy illness I experienced a noticeable thinning of my hair.  Nioxin was recommended, I tried it and it has worked very well for me.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice a big difference, and the smell is a little different, but I do like the shine I end up with so will continue using (at least until it&#x27;s gone!).</li>
            <li> Excellent Product.  Works very well.</li>
            <li> The best product for my hair.</li>
            <li> Good shampoo,  Makes my hair full and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> Does what we expect, but still don&#x27;t understand all the different versions of the product. This was the largest bottle I could find and wanted, but is for chemically treated hair and for us was not necessary. At any rate it fills out the hair nicely and no damaged hair results.</li>
            <li> My hair is thinning due to age and hereditary. Plus not to mention coloring it for years.  I use Nioxin scalp treatment, cleanser,hair booster and scalp therapy. I had stopped using it saying my hair looked great and I didn&#x27;t need these products any longer.  I started to find strands of hair in the sink and shower. I only stopped for a week but it showed me these products work.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, it works great to help prevent hair loss. I love the minty clean smell.</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly, and appears to be good.  Very good price.  I would probably purchase this again since I like Nioxin products.</li>
            <li> I had gastric bypass in June of 12. As a result I lost a lot of hair. I started using Nioxin in Dec of 2013 and in a year my hair is back to normal plus some!! I don&#x27;t have bald spots anymore!</li>
            <li> Nioxin is the only hair product I use.  I believe that it has helped to retain the hair that I have and helps to reduce hair loss compared to regular shampoo.  Also has eliminated any dandruff that I used to have with other shampoos.  My hair feels very clean, smooth and silky.  Make sure to use with the Nioxin scalp treatment.</li>
            <li> I am a woman. I started losing hair in my mid-twenties. Tried everything, no real luck. Started using this and Rogain and now that I am 36 years of age...my hair is thick and the hair that I lost along my hairline is back. In fact, it came back right after I started using this and Rogain.  I have to say I wouldn&#x27;t be a believer of this product had I not used it myself.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair but it&#x27;s very thin. This shampoo really helps to give my hair more fullness &amp; body. If you color your hair make sure to purchase the #4 for chemically treated hair.</li>
            <li> works well - good shampoo</li>
            <li> Great savings on a great product!</li>
            <li> We have been using Nioxin products for several years.  They really help with thinning hair.  Recently it has been harder to locate an easy supply.  Thank goodness for Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> really like this brand for my hair</li>
            <li> The best product when you are losing your hair, I won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo &amp; this is the best price around!!</li>
            <li> Nioxin Cleanser System 4 stops hair loss by deep cleansing the scalp harmful toxins and buildup that causes hair loss. Highly recommended daily shampoo great for cleansing oily skin also</li>
            <li> My shampoo arrived frozen solid. When it finally thawed out at room temperature the consistency and texture were really wierd. Doubt it has the same potency if any to work the way it&#x27;s supposed to on my hair. Bummed.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist told me about his cleaner.  Try it and you will begin to see a real difference in your hair.  Mine seems thicker and is growing out better now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Nioxin Cleanser for years, along with the conditioner.  My husband also uses these products.  We both like them a lot.</li>
            <li> lets hope this continues to work, everyone only has good things to say about it and I have been using for a while and things seemed to have leveled off</li>
            <li> Expensive product. So far it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> Same stuff used at the salon I go to. Works well.&lt;br /&gt;I have to type some more words so I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this shampoo as I was experiencing hair loss. Hair loss has stopped and it leaves hair shiny.</li>
            <li> it is an excellent product I&#x27;ve been using it for more than 1 year and I can see the results, it arrived sooner that I expected it and very well packed</li>
            <li> like the product... my hairdresser sees improvement and new hair growth.. been using it faithfully for 7 months... don&#x27;t be afraid to try it.</li>
            <li> Excellent service!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 63 years old and cannot believe what a wonder this shampoo has been to my hair &amp; scalp! The shine and volume you can really see the change .</li>
            <li> Have not used it long enough to see any differance</li>
            <li> This product is a great buy.  It appears just as shown in photo. Great quality. I will order again from this company.</li>
            <li> This shampoo does a great job of cleaning your scalp without being drying either to your scalp or you hair.  Adds body without making it frizzy.</li>
            <li> Great product. Bottle was open upon delivery, product spilled. Was in a plastic bag luckily, so didn&#x27;t damage other products in box</li>
            <li> I am trying this product for the first time and so far I am very happy with the results of this product.</li>
            <li> This is the first product I have ever found to improve the thickness of my hair. My hair seems healthier, grows faster and definitely not as thin. I have been using this product for about a year now after receiving it as a gift.  I received an email from the company I purchased from and chose to write a review (in case Amazon is questioning my review).</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  Good for color treated hair.  The large size of this bottle goes well with the kits if you don&#x27;t use the other products as regularly as the cleanser, or even if you use all the products at the same time but tend to use more cleanser than the other products.</li>
            <li> As promised work perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again, price is great also.&lt;br /&gt;I am using it for more than 12 months and steel believe it was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Have used these products before and they do help stimulate hair growth and health.&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the cost.  Good to use all three products together.</li>
            <li> Not a baldness cure, but appears to help preserve what hair you have left.</li>
            <li> love it! and super fast delivery</li>
            <li> I have used Nioxin for quite a few years and I really like it.  You don&#x27;t have to use much at all so this size bottle will last me for a very long time (year(s)).  The Thinning Shampoo makes my hair more manageable and appears fuller.  I would recommend to anyone who has thinning hair, or even if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Great product! Has helped maintain the color and I can see improvement in the health of my very fine and thin hair.</li>
            <li> Really refreshing in the scalp, that looks good without washing for two hole days with this shampoo (wouldnÂ´t dare before).</li>
            <li> WOW! Speedy delivery. Best pricing. Good product. Sold on this hair shampoo. My wife and I have been using for years.</li>
            <li> I like this product because of the DHT fighting ability and because it gets my hair clean and is safe for color treated hair.  I&#x27;m not a fan of the mint / peppermint smell and while it does what it should, it makes my hair very flyaway and difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> Been using for five months.  Can see no change.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for years and continue to be pleased with it. On occasion, I&#x27;d try other brands that were developed for thinning hair, but they never helped as much as Nioxin. The shampoo works best for me if I lather thoroughly and leave it on for a minute of two so it can really do its thing (get rid of DHT). Also, the price of this large size is fantastic--no more picking it up at Ulta for me!</li>
            <li> My hair is thinning due to a medication I&#x27;m currently on, &amp; my husband&#x27;s thinning is hereditary. My BFF used this product, also due to a hereditary condition, so recommended it to us. We both LOVE LOVE LOVE it! And it works GOOD, over time. My girlfriend no longer has to use it, it worked so good for her, at least for awhile! WELL WORTH the money it costs, you can \\&quot;feel\\&quot; it working. We don&#x27;t use conditioner, our hair has more body without conditioner, but there is a conditioner available if you want it.</li>
            <li> i fried my hair back in november. I have a friend who recommended this to help make my hair grow faster and and make it feel more full because it was falling out so bad. it has done wonders on the volume of my hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo cleared up my dry scalp problem, leaves my  hair manageable and also does not compromise my hair color. I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Not sure this is the real stuff or maybe it&#x27;s expired?</li>
            <li> Been using this shampoo for about 2 years now and I love it. I have curly hair that is noticeably thinning. After using this shampoo my hair is a lot better and it&#x27;s fuller. Great product at the right price compared at the stores. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This is my second giant bottle! I love both the shampoo and conditioner. I had a small patch of alopecia a few years ago and it seemed to&lt;br /&gt;help. Been using it ever since. It smells great!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo to help thin hair look thicker.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nioxin for about 10 years now.  The one time I stopped using it for a couple of weeks I noticed more hair loss.  It works if you use it on a regular basis.  Once you start you must be committed to continue to use it.  I will continue to use this product as long as I have hair and I should have hair as long as I use this product.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference in hair thickness after using for several months now.  Will continue to use until depleted but don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> The Nioxin line of hair treatments are top notch but not inexpensive.  I use this product every other day. It is worth a try.</li>
            <li> Fast service, great product</li>
            <li> Great shampoo!!  Made my hair look and feel fuller and stronger.  Packaged very well.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is awesome.  I&#x27;ve bought this product several times.  I&#x27;ve only been using this shampoo for some time now and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a lot of years and this is the best price I can find.  Very good shampoo!</li>
            <li> came as advertised.  Works well so far.</li>
            <li> Time makes this work wonders</li>
            <li> This is a great product, have used for years, of course, if it wasn&#x27;t used we donot know if it really has helped that is not possible to tell, but it is worth the money and continued use....my hair seems to be in good condition as possible.</li>
            <li> An excellent shampoo, and very concentrated so it goes a long way. It may tingle a bit, but leaves the scalp, and hair feeling very clean and natural. NO dandruff problems.  No unpleasant aroma. I use with other system 4 products--the conditioner, and the therapy treatment, which at first I wasn&#x27;t too enthusiastic about, not seeing any improvement, but after a fair trial, I feel that if the condition isn&#x27;t being reversed with re-growth, at least it is holding steady,  and I&#x27;m not losing ground. The hair does looks better, and feels better.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and at a good price!</li>
            <li> Love my Nioxin products.  I have thinning hair and these products have made it look much fuller than it is.</li>
            <li> Received as expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a big bottle! My boyfriend seems to like this stuff, so I&#x27;ll give it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> It works for my oily hair.</li>
            <li> I have used Nioxin for years and can still credit it for stopping hairloss when on high doses of prednisone some years ago.  It&#x27;s gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff on the market for thin and fine hair.  I&#x27;ve tried lots, nothing compares to this stuff.  I will never feel the need to try something else.</li>
            <li> shipped fast. came as promised!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t do without it as long as I can find it at a reasonable price.  I can&#x27;t rationalize spending the price at the salon.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Lathers well, great scent, cleans hair nicely.</li>
            <li> IT really is wonderful and help me with fine colored hair. In fact I think it help it grow too. LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Really does make your hair feel much thicker and I can&#x27;t see my scalp anymore. It took about 2 weeks to really see a difference! I have it on auto delivery!</li>
