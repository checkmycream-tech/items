            <li>I love it and get seriously more compliments about my light &amp; sporty smell then with any other perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for all the comments guys they were quite helpful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume, Subtle and not overpowering but very nice and lingers.</li>
            <li>the way, this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever ordered anything online!</li>
            <li>My order came before the estimated time and it was exactly what I had ordered!</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li>I was a little worried that the freezing temps here in the Great Lakes region may have ruined the perfume (since the box was sitting on my porch for awhile before I knew a package had arrived), but all is well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great fragrance to wear everyday or on a date.</li>
            <li>but I have to say that it really smells like cheap perfume; just like I would expect Paris to.  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not really into Paris, but this one smells really good.</li>
            <li>It provides a freshness &amp; fun aspect that appeals to all ages.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend makes fun of me for using this...</li>
            <li>what if people laugh at you when you answer their question with \\&quot;Paris</li>
            <li>: GO FOR IT AND BUY IT cuz its worth it.</li>
            <li>I am not crazy about Paris or her promescuity</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s actually quite nice.</li>
            <li>But I was pleasantly surprised to find that the Paris Hilton perfume is much better than the Paris Hilton persona.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>For me the most important is that if you give me a date, the same is met.</li>
            <li>The product is as described and well worth the price.</li>
            <li>love it, my wife loves it and people are surprised when they ask what she is wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipped super fast!</li>
            <li>I love how it smells fresh but sweet at the same time.</li>
            <li>She did do something right this time.</li>
            <li>i said i know right</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t smell right...</li>
            <li>This is a nice perfume, it does stay on for quite a while but nothing overly special about it, it reminds me of other perfumes.</li>
            <li>I purchased this Paris Hilton Perfumed right after finishing the first one I got for Christmas</li>
            <li>This is a nice light fragrance, which is not over-baring or heavy.</li>
            <li>My sister and I use the same Paris Hilton perfume and even though it smells great, it distinctively smells different on us.</li>
            <li>This purchase was my second bottle of Paris Hilton perfume, due to the fact that I absolutely LOVED my first bottle (probably my favorite scent).  </li>
            <li>The first time I ordered, the product never came.  </li>
            <li>Its a light frangrance no harsh at all.</li>
            <li>Very feminine!</li>
            <li>but i just gave it the extra bonus :)</li>
            <li>But congrats to Paris and her team they really kick it with this one!</li>
            <li>And the price is reasonable, can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li>, its legit, the real thing, THANK YOU AMAZON!</li>
            <li>The only thing I am uncertain of is whether or not this perfume is authentic?</li>
            <li>the first day i got it everyone complimented my perfum.</li>
            <li>will order again and highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>Only for the most simple-minded.  </li>
            <li>&#x27;That&#x27;s Hot&#x27;?  </li>
            <li>it smells funny...</li>
            <li>wife wears this perfume religiously and I&#x27;m sure she plans to get another bottle under the tree this year.  </li>
            <li>BUT I absolutely looooove it!</li>
            <li>I thought for sure this would smell like a sweaty club skank, or perhaps a giant hussy.</li>
            <li>Definitely one of my favorite perfumes now.</li>
            <li>This perfume smells great and is long lasting.  </li>
            <li>Really!  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would last on me.</li>
            <li>through amazon I have been able to collect many different perfumes at a very low cost!!!!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s most definitely a head turner.</li>
            <li>Fast Delivery!</li>

            <li>it do not know the first time that I it buy</li>
            <li>I love This perfume, it delivered in several days</li>
            <li>Accidently stumbled upon it and now it&#x27;s my little cheap trick :-)</li>
            <li>this perfume has an awesome smell but it doesn&#x27;t last long enough I wish it did!</li>
            <li>The scent of this fragrance is mainly fruity, fresh, floral.</li>
            <li>It took me about almost 30 minutes to decide but my nose and heart really settled on the first one, which I assume to be named Paris Hilton by Paris Hilton. ;)&lt;</li>
            <li>The perfume is not too overwhelming, but strong enough to last the whole day through.</li>
            <li>That being said, when my girls and I are ready for a weekend out to either a club/bar, we always know exactly what scent to</li>
            <li>Smells slightly differently than I remember from last time, but nonetheless, very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Its not harsh and smells very pretty.  </li>
            <li>I loved the smell of this perfume -- but it does not last very long.</li>
            <li>I was really taking a chance to buy something from this brand name..</li>
            <li>ON IT ,MY VERY FAV.</li>
            <li>A very floral and powdery girly smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I spray it in the morning and the sexy smell lasts longer than I expected.</li>
            <li>Lasts throughout the day and is a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>And just like the real Paris Hilton...</li>
            <li>Usually I&#x27;m really really picky.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>who can complain about a 3.4oz REAL designer brand perfume for what, 20$?</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>VERY GOOD&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;</li>
            <li>I really like the scent</li>
            <li>Very pleasing fragrance.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to spray much.  </li>
            <li>very much&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did not like because the smell go fast</li>
            <li>She really likes the fragrance.</li>
            <li>The product was exactly as described, brand new in the box.</li>
            <li>I suffer from migraines and all of my other perfumes give me a headache I can sure do without.  </li>
            <li>Seriously, it smells that good.  </li>
            <li>The only downside is that it stays with you so long that you kind of get hooked into smelling yourself every so often.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, unbroken, packaged very well and the bottle was larger than I was expecting for the money.  </li>
            <li>THE HECK OUTTA ANY OTHER PRICE AROUND ESPECIALLY MACYS.MY VERY FAVORITE ,SMELLS LIKE IM HERE</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re looking for something more mature, it&#x27;s definitely not mumsy or old fashioned at all.</li>
            <li>It lasts forever and seems more concentrated than others so a little goes a long way, it&#x27;s a bit too easy to overdo this one.</li>
            <li>Hands down, my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>While the analogies may not be accurate for the purchase of a simple bottle of perfume, I assure you that the feeling that you&#x27;ve ignored your moral compass and abandoned your ethical sensibilities is very real.  </li>
            <li>but I just live how it smells too much to stop using it.</li>
            <li>This particular scent reminds you of Liz Clairborne.</li>
            <li>sure enough it smells different.</li>
            <li>Very peach and melon heavy on the top note with apple and jasmine on the midnotes.</li>
            <li>I love to shop at Amazon more exclusive and if something happens or I get something wrong</li>
            <li>Just a few dollars more I could of gotten a real bottle of Paris Hilton Perfume....</li>
            <li>My daughter received this fragrance as a birthday present last year and we all fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>Lucky for future operations.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly care for Paris Hilton herself</li>
            <li>I have to admit, that even though I really love the scent, you may not expect the aftermath and inner turmoil that occurs after purchasing a product created and endorsed by such a detestable skank as Paris Hilton.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this perfume.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.........</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend Paris Hilton by Paris Hilton.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Recommended Highly</li>
            <li>WOW!!</li>
            <li>I love how this scent is very sweet and girly--you really can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because of its low price but more because other buyers&#x27; positive review.</li>
            <li>I do not think it is real, and if it is maybe it is old?</li>
            <li>and it smelled pretty similar on all of them, so body chemistry doesn&#x27;t really alter this one too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not easy to find a perfume you love.</li>
            <li>I first bought this back when I was in high school about 5-6 years ago..</li>
            <li>they sent a replacement but still new one was fake.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I just wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li>It was brand new in a box and sealed.</li>
            <li>The scent is amazing, but it is too subtle for my liking.</li>
            <li>It is not too strong and has a slight fruity smell but not over powering.</li>
            <li>Soft, sensual and not a strong over-powerful scent that leaves an easy, clean and memorable fragrance behind.</li>
            <li>and it be the exact same as I remember!</li>
            <li>Plus, delivery was a day early cant beat that!</li>
            <li>I have ordered several of these over the years because they are very affordable and have a lasting fresh scent.</li>
            <li>the scent lasts a long time and its definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>When I first sprayed it, I didn&#x27;t notice a big difference.</li>
            <li>This perfume smells amazing and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>this is the only great smelling perfume i have ever found its seriously intoxicating i can spray it on my shirt persay and three days later when i pick it up to wash it</li>
            <li>The bottle is pretty (clear with pink perfume and black embossing on the bottle) and will look cute on the dresser/</li>
            <li>I am a frequent Amazon customer, yet this is my first time writing an Amazon review, so obviously I feel motivated to do so.  </li>
            <li>and I was so excited to find it for much less on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who likes fruity soft smells.</li>
            <li>I regret not ordering one for myself, and I would definetly recommend this scent to any young woman!&lt;br /&gt;By</li>
            <li>Soft and sensual scent for any lady.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Everyone would ask me who I was wearing &amp; when I would tell them they would look at me surprised.  </li>
            <li>Always get compliments on this very lite yet lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li>I loved it but have been unable to find it in any stores since.</li>
            <li>It does bring back a familiar scent, but its definitely not the same.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It lasts forever and seems more concentrated than others so a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like stuff what flies by too fast or if it&#x27;s too sweet, grandma-ish or simply too heavy.</li>
            <li>I love the perfume, it is fruity and subtle.  </li>
            <li>For some reason I recently thought of this particular scent and was so ecstatic when i ordered it.</li>
            <li>I feel the need to spray more than usual to get a scent that will last all day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a sweet scent, not cloying or heavy at all.  </li>
            <li>She ran out around christmas time and has been begging for a new bottle since, so I decided to buy her this larger 3 ounce bottle for her 15th</li>
            <li>light enough to wear everyday.</li>
            <li>My only con of it is that it doesn&#x27;t last very long--only a couple hours max.</li>
            <li>It was so much cheaper here on Amazon, and it&#x27;s actually authentic unlike the perfume I bought on ebay that was fake.</li>
            <li>really trusted that amazon sells real perfumes, big let down.</li>
            <li>On top of that, the scent wears off fairly quickly and is very faint.. unless you dont mind spraying about 10</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last very long though and it always give me a headache and makes me a little dizzy when I first put it on, but it&#x27;s definately worth it.</li>
            <li>Great for covering up bad odor</li>
            <li>For me, there&#x27;s a chemical note in Paris Hilton that when I sniff it, it&#x27;s almost like it jabs my sensitive back molars.</li>
            <li>I frequently have problems with white florals, but it&#x27;s not the jasmine &amp; tuberose causing it.</li>
            <li>Then the sprayer stopped working and now sprays a stream which will ruin your clothes if you are not careful.</li>
            <li>I sprayed it right after the product arrived and a few friends asked me the brand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been complimented so much wearing any other perfume.&lt;br</li>
            <li>She ran out of it not long ago</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wear any of her other scents just this particular one.  </li>
            <li>I really like it because it&#x27;s long lasting and it slightly changes scent once mixed with your natural odor.</li>
            <li>Bought this and the cool water, both fakes, big difference with the real one and fake one.</li>
            <li>; if that&#x27;s not good enough, perfume arrived in all original perfume packaging (not a knock off-</li>

            <li> I think it&#x27;s better to spend a bit more and purchase it at the store where you can actually return a faulty product.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, just as described.</li>
            <li> Came quickly.</li>
            <li> and I received more compliments with This particular Product</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to all the women out there who are looking for a very pretty scent.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this present I bought for my mom for Christmas.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a fruity clean scent that is soft and sexy..</li>
            <li> I love it and get seriously more compliments about my light &amp; sporty smell then with any other perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for all the comments guys they were quite helpful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume, Subtle and not overpowering but very nice and lingers.</li>
            <li> the way, this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever ordered anything online!</li>
            <li> My order came before the estimated time and it was exactly what I had ordered!</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li> I was a little worried that the freezing temps here in the Great Lakes region may have ruined the perfume (since the box was sitting on my porch for awhile before I knew a package had arrived), but all is well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great fragrance to wear everyday or on a date.</li>
            <li> but I have to say that it really smells like cheap perfume; just like I would expect Paris to.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not really into Paris, but this one smells really good.</li>
            <li> It provides a freshness &amp; fun aspect that appeals to all ages.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend makes fun of me for using this...</li>
            <li> what if people laugh at you when you answer their question with \\&quot;Paris</li>
            <li> : GO FOR IT AND BUY IT cuz its worth it.</li>
            <li> I am not crazy about Paris or her promescuity</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s actually quite nice.</li>
            <li> But I was pleasantly surprised to find that the Paris Hilton perfume is much better than the Paris Hilton persona.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Well worth it.</li>
            <li> For me the most important is that if you give me a date, the same is met.</li>
            <li> The product is as described and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> love it, my wife loves it and people are surprised when they ask what she is wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shipped super fast!</li>
            <li> I love how it smells fresh but sweet at the same time.</li>
            <li> She did do something right this time.</li>
            <li> i said i know right</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t smell right...</li>
            <li> This is a nice perfume, it does stay on for quite a while but nothing overly special about it, it reminds me of other perfumes.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Paris Hilton Perfumed right after finishing the first one I got for Christmas</li>
            <li> This is a nice light fragrance, which is not over-baring or heavy.</li>
            <li> My sister and I use the same Paris Hilton perfume and even though it smells great, it distinctively smells different on us.</li>
            <li> This purchase was my second bottle of Paris Hilton perfume, due to the fact that I absolutely LOVED my first bottle (probably my favorite scent).  </li>
            <li> The first time I ordered, the product never came.  </li>
            <li> Its a light frangrance no harsh at all.</li>
            <li> Very feminine!</li>
            <li> but i just gave it the extra bonus :)</li>
            <li> But congrats to Paris and her team they really kick it with this one!</li>
            <li> And the price is reasonable, can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li> , its legit, the real thing, THANK YOU AMAZON!</li>
            <li> The only thing I am uncertain of is whether or not this perfume is authentic?</li>
            <li> the first day i got it everyone complimented my perfum.</li>
            <li> will order again and highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Only for the most simple-minded.  </li>
            <li> &#x27;That&#x27;s Hot&#x27;?  </li>
            <li> it smells funny...</li>
            <li> wife wears this perfume religiously and I&#x27;m sure she plans to get another bottle under the tree this year.  </li>
            <li> BUT I absolutely looooove it!</li>
            <li> I thought for sure this would smell like a sweaty club skank, or perhaps a giant hussy.</li>
            <li> Definitely one of my favorite perfumes now.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells great and is long lasting.  </li>
            <li> Really!  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would last on me.</li>
            <li> through amazon I have been able to collect many different perfumes at a very low cost!!!!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s most definitely a head turner.</li>
            <li> Fast Delivery!</li>
            <li> The pic looked like a plastic bottle, it is glass, packaged really well!</li>
            <li> I first bought this fragrance at kohls department store.</li>
            <li> I have bought several bottles and will buy more.</li>
            <li> it do not know the first time that I it buy</li>
            <li> I love This perfume, it delivered in several days</li>
            <li> Accidently stumbled upon it and now it&#x27;s my little cheap trick :-)</li>
            <li> this perfume has an awesome smell but it doesn&#x27;t last long enough I wish it did!</li>
            <li> The scent of this fragrance is mainly fruity, fresh, floral.</li>
            <li> It took me about almost 30 minutes to decide but my nose and heart really settled on the first one, which I assume to be named Paris Hilton by Paris Hilton. ;)&lt;</li>
            <li> The perfume is not too overwhelming, but strong enough to last the whole day through.</li>
            <li> That being said, when my girls and I are ready for a weekend out to either a club/bar, we always know exactly what scent to</li>
            <li> Smells slightly differently than I remember from last time, but nonetheless, very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Its not harsh and smells very pretty.  </li>
            <li> I loved the smell of this perfume -- but it does not last very long.</li>
            <li> I was really taking a chance to buy something from this brand name..</li>
            <li> ON IT ,MY VERY FAV.</li>
            <li> A very floral and powdery girly smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I spray it in the morning and the sexy smell lasts longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> Lasts throughout the day and is a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> And just like the real Paris Hilton...</li>
            <li> Usually I&#x27;m really really picky.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> who can complain about a 3.4oz REAL designer brand perfume for what, 20$?</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;</li>
            <li> I really like the scent</li>
            <li> Very pleasing fragrance.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to spray much.  </li>
            <li> very much&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not like because the smell go fast</li>
            <li> She really likes the fragrance.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly as described, brand new in the box.</li>
            <li> I suffer from migraines and all of my other perfumes give me a headache I can sure do without.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, it smells that good.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that it stays with you so long that you kind of get hooked into smelling yourself every so often.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, unbroken, packaged very well and the bottle was larger than I was expecting for the money.  </li>
            <li> THE HECK OUTTA ANY OTHER PRICE AROUND ESPECIALLY MACYS.MY VERY FAVORITE ,SMELLS LIKE IM HERE</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re looking for something more mature, it&#x27;s definitely not mumsy or old fashioned at all.</li>
            <li> It lasts forever and seems more concentrated than others so a little goes a long way, it&#x27;s a bit too easy to overdo this one.</li>
            <li> Hands down, my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> While the analogies may not be accurate for the purchase of a simple bottle of perfume, I assure you that the feeling that you&#x27;ve ignored your moral compass and abandoned your ethical sensibilities is very real.  </li>
            <li> but I just live how it smells too much to stop using it.</li>
            <li> This particular scent reminds you of Liz Clairborne.</li>
            <li> sure enough it smells different.</li>
            <li> Very peach and melon heavy on the top note with apple and jasmine on the midnotes.</li>
            <li> I love to shop at Amazon more exclusive and if something happens or I get something wrong</li>
            <li> Just a few dollars more I could of gotten a real bottle of Paris Hilton Perfume....</li>
            <li> My daughter received this fragrance as a birthday present last year and we all fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> Lucky for future operations.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly care for Paris Hilton herself</li>
            <li> I have to admit, that even though I really love the scent, you may not expect the aftermath and inner turmoil that occurs after purchasing a product created and endorsed by such a detestable skank as Paris Hilton.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this perfume.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.........</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend Paris Hilton by Paris Hilton.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Recommended Highly</li>
            <li> WOW!!</li>
            <li> I love how this scent is very sweet and girly--you really can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of its low price but more because other buyers&#x27; positive review.</li>
            <li> I do not think it is real, and if it is maybe it is old?</li>
            <li> and it smelled pretty similar on all of them, so body chemistry doesn&#x27;t really alter this one too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy to find a perfume you love.</li>
            <li> I first bought this back when I was in high school about 5-6 years ago..</li>
            <li> they sent a replacement but still new one was fake.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I just wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li> It was brand new in a box and sealed.</li>
            <li> The scent is amazing, but it is too subtle for my liking.</li>
            <li> It is not too strong and has a slight fruity smell but not over powering.</li>
            <li> Soft, sensual and not a strong over-powerful scent that leaves an easy, clean and memorable fragrance behind.</li>
            <li> and it be the exact same as I remember!</li>
            <li> Plus, delivery was a day early cant beat that!</li>
            <li> I have ordered several of these over the years because they are very affordable and have a lasting fresh scent.</li>
            <li> the scent lasts a long time and its definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> When I first sprayed it, I didn&#x27;t notice a big difference.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells amazing and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> this is the only great smelling perfume i have ever found its seriously intoxicating i can spray it on my shirt persay and three days later when i pick it up to wash it</li>
            <li> The bottle is pretty (clear with pink perfume and black embossing on the bottle) and will look cute on the dresser/</li>
            <li> I am a frequent Amazon customer, yet this is my first time writing an Amazon review, so obviously I feel motivated to do so.  </li>
            <li> and I was so excited to find it for much less on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who likes fruity soft smells.</li>
            <li> I regret not ordering one for myself, and I would definetly recommend this scent to any young woman!&lt;br /&gt;By</li>
            <li> Soft and sensual scent for any lady.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Everyone would ask me who I was wearing &amp; when I would tell them they would look at me surprised.  </li>
            <li> Always get compliments on this very lite yet lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li> I loved it but have been unable to find it in any stores since.</li>
            <li> It does bring back a familiar scent, but its definitely not the same.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It lasts forever and seems more concentrated than others so a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like stuff what flies by too fast or if it&#x27;s too sweet, grandma-ish or simply too heavy.</li>
            <li> I love the perfume, it is fruity and subtle.  </li>
            <li> For some reason I recently thought of this particular scent and was so ecstatic when i ordered it.</li>
            <li> I feel the need to spray more than usual to get a scent that will last all day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a sweet scent, not cloying or heavy at all.  </li>
            <li> She ran out around christmas time and has been begging for a new bottle since, so I decided to buy her this larger 3 ounce bottle for her 15th</li>
            <li> light enough to wear everyday.</li>
            <li> My only con of it is that it doesn&#x27;t last very long--only a couple hours max.</li>
            <li> It was so much cheaper here on Amazon, and it&#x27;s actually authentic unlike the perfume I bought on ebay that was fake.</li>
            <li> really trusted that amazon sells real perfumes, big let down.</li>
            <li> On top of that, the scent wears off fairly quickly and is very faint.. unless you dont mind spraying about 10</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last very long though and it always give me a headache and makes me a little dizzy when I first put it on, but it&#x27;s definately worth it.</li>
            <li> Great for covering up bad odor</li>
            <li> For me, there&#x27;s a chemical note in Paris Hilton that when I sniff it, it&#x27;s almost like it jabs my sensitive back molars.</li>
            <li> I frequently have problems with white florals, but it&#x27;s not the jasmine &amp; tuberose causing it.</li>
            <li> Then the sprayer stopped working and now sprays a stream which will ruin your clothes if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> I sprayed it right after the product arrived and a few friends asked me the brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been complimented so much wearing any other perfume.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She ran out of it not long ago</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wear any of her other scents just this particular one.  </li>
            <li> I really like it because it&#x27;s long lasting and it slightly changes scent once mixed with your natural odor.</li>
            <li> Bought this and the cool water, both fakes, big difference with the real one and fake one.</li>
            <li> ; if that&#x27;s not good enough, perfume arrived in all original perfume packaging (not a knock off-</li>
            <li> My mother bought the smaller bottle of this perfume for my then thirteen year old sister a year and a half ago.</li>
            <li> Hi Everyone, I love this perfume but when I received the package was bigger than I expected and expensive</li>
            <li> gripe is that it doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> This perfume is also long lasting.</li>
            <li> It last all day long.</li>
            <li> Considering it is not the &amp;#34;parfum&amp;#34; spray it last really really long.</li>
            <li> but the smell didn&#x27;t last long at all</li>
            <li> It last long, and attracks men!</li>
            <li> Just to let you guys know, Paris Hilton perfume does not last very long at all.</li>
            <li> The scent lasts all day long...</li>
            <li> when i open carton box , package is protected carefully .this</li>
            <li> (excuse the typos) -</li>
            <li> I went to a few retailers to buy this product but little to my suprise, it was way more expensive than the price Amazon offers it for.</li>
            <li> When I was younger I used to borrow and barter stationery from my other girl friends.</li>
            <li> OTHER THAN BURBERRY AND STILL BY J.LO THE 3.4 OZ WITH DAILY USE</li>
            <li> We knew each other back then</li>
            <li> and I definitely recommend it to other people .....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several friends and family wear this one at the height of it&#x27;s popularity a few years back</li>
            <li> I was honestly a liiiittle disappointed..</li>
            <li> I had been looking for something new to wear (perfume), but quickly became frustrated with the prices in the mall.  </li>
            <li> Like buying a towel from Walmart to save 20cents, when the mom and pop shop next door is shutting down and their employees of 30 years are laid off.  </li>
            <li> With that being said, it does not smell the same as my previous Paris Hilton perfume.</li>
            <li> recommend them and stays for a long time like other brands der fragrances</li>
            <li> The only thing i wish, was that it had a little handle to wrap around my wrist.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s old school and hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> This is not real.</li>
            <li> Money well spent.  </li>
            <li> it was not what I expected</li>
            <li> So when I was at a perfume counter at the mall I was choosing between Paris&#x27;s Heiress version and the other self-named version.</li>
            <li> Also look up her other perfumes.</li>
            <li> like I can smell some of my other perfumes).  </li>
            <li> so beware if you don&#x27;t like smelling like other women you are around.</li>
            <li> However, the perfume arrived and smells just like any other bottle I&#x27;ve purchased at department stores.</li>
            <li> But I recommend buying the perfume + the lotion, they compliment each other.</li>
            <li> just what i expected!</li>
            <li> Other girls comment on it as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other perfumes with nothing like this sort of response.</li>
            <li> , it was on average $32, and for the size I purchased from here, on average it was about $44.</li>
            <li> but really couldn&#x27;t go wrong with the affordable price.</li>
            <li> i have been wearing this for years and hands down</li>
            <li> Like you&#x27;ve just kicked an orphan, stolen its puppy, and burnt down the orphanage.</li>
            <li> Even after I wash my clothes, there&#x27;s still a slight sent of it.</li>
            <li> After reading several recent reviews claiming this product is a fake, I have to say I was nervous about my order.  </li>
            <li> BUT AFTER A HALF HOUR I DONT SMELL IT ON ME ANYMORE.</li>
            <li> Smells just like Ralph, Ralph Lauren; but half the price.</li>
            <li> Little goes along way.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant because in store this bottle is twice if not</li>
            <li> COMPLETE FAKE.</li>
            <li> SO DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li> I WONT  WASTE MY CASH BY</li>
            <li> ILL STICK TO THE OLD SCHOOL PERFUMES THAT STAYS ON ALLDAY</li>
            <li> I wear Paris Hilton everyday.  </li>
            <li> I bought it for a friend and the spray broke after a few uses .</li>
            <li> but it was recommended to me by a few friends</li>
            <li> not a strong scent.</li>
            <li> Paris Hilton is not easy to wear, imo.</li>
            <li> and she swore it didn&#x27;t smell like it usually does.</li>
            <li> and they responded within a few hours and mailed me a brand-new one with one-day shipping!  </li>
            <li> For the first time, I am disappointed with Amazon.  </li>
            <li> i decided to usually shopping on amazon every month.</li>
            <li> Not sure why the wife likes it</li>
            <li> I have never bought perfume online before and Paris Hilton perfume is something I usually don&#x27;t wear.</li>
            <li> Got this for my mom for this past Christmas.</li>
            <li> I use as an everyday perfume and get compliments from strangers who ask me what perfume I&#x27;m wearing!</li>
            <li> What it all boils down to...is that I smell fantastic, but I am a terrible person.  </li>
            <li> When she told me what she wanted this year, she made it very plain that she wanted this one, not the heiress.  </li>
            <li> and I had a hard time finding it - except on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t get this perfume because of some of the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> only used a few times then threw it out :(</li>
            <li> you want to smell like a million bucks and not give in to the ridiculous prices of the perfume industry, I suggest...</li>
            <li> serious.</li>
            <li> But as time went on, I did notice a subtle change in the way I remembered it.</li>
            <li> However was disappointed that the scent was very faint and does not smell like the original..</li>
            <li> This is the first time i got one that is SO FAKE!!!</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed when it arrived (I was anxiously counting the days), as it smells nothing like the bottle I bought at a department store a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> Not Happy at all....</li>
            <li> My secret.</li>
            <li> But mellows after a few hours it gave me a headache and made me feel sick.</li>
            <li> Disappointed and a waste of money...</li>
            <li> Weird.</li>
            <li> I never would of thought to buy a perfume by Paris Hilton, but the designer has proven me wrong.</li>
            <li> At the price you definitely can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> , i dont see nothin wrong with this piece</li>
            <li> i dont know why anyone would say this is fake</li>
            <li> I usually shy away from celebrity products.</li>
            <li> and I was skeptical about it</li>
            <li> This perfume are 100% fake</li>
            <li> Amazon fails at perfumes.</li>
            <li> When I opened the box and sprayed it, something was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Hence it is my belief that only terrible people buy Paris Hiltons perfume.  </li>
            <li> Use it  on the evenings and casual dates</li>
            <li> Within an hour it actually stinks..</li>
            <li> one of the reviewers said &amp;#34; It would seem the shelf life has expired, or it came from a bad batch.</li>
            <li> BAD BATCH.</li>
            <li> It would seem the shelf life has expired, or it came from a bad batch.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I bought from a bad batch</li>
            <li> but it does smell like it went bad.  </li>
            <li> Its cheaper here because its a bad batch.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am always disappointed that it is Paris Hilton&#x27;s perfume.</li>
            <li> a disappointment!</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> :-(</li>
            <li> I hate her getting my money</li>
            <li> I was fully prepared to hate this perfume.  </li>
            <li> and I was very disappointed</li>
            <li> SMELLS HORRIBLE!</li>
            <li> \\&quot;ew, who smells like whore - oh crap!</li>
            <li> It smells horrible.</li>
            <li> The smell is horrible and doesn&#x27;t at all smell like Paris Hilton.</li>

            <li> All Perfect, 100% recommended</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loved it!!!</li>
            <li> Great for covering up bad odor</li>
            <li> This perfume smells amazing and a little goes a long way. Even after I wash my clothes, there&#x27;s still a slight sent of it. It&#x27;s sexy and feminine and I always get compliments.</li>
            <li> COMPLETE FAKE. Not even wrapped. DONT BUY. smells like rubbing alcohol. and it looks like a knock off.&lt;br /&gt;as one of the reviewers said &amp;#34; It would seem the shelf life has expired, or it came from a bad batch. It smells like most perfumes eventually do after sitting for some time- cheap and like rubbing alcohol.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;100% on point.  BAD BATCH. they sent a replacement but still new one was fake.&lt;br /&gt;I really trusted that amazon sells real perfumes, big let down.</li>
            <li> Great, the best undoubtedly brought everything indicated by the publication, is great quality, has exceeded my expectations. Great buy. From Venezuela recommend</li>
            <li> This perfume is fabulous and I have used it since the day it came out! I get many compliments and asked a lot what I am wearing! :) it&#x27;s a fruity clean scent that is soft and sexy.. It&#x27;s easy on the nose and not overbearing no matter how much you spray on! And is a good perfume for any season and scent stays all day! You must try and the mens version is 5 star too! :)</li>
            <li> This is a very mild but nice smelling perfume, I really love it.  I could use it every day.  Really nice!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and did myself a great favor. She smells so nice when she uses it. I was really taking a chance to buy something from this brand name..I was really surprised how good this is!! Ladies..do yourself a favour and buy this.. You will not be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000C1W2DK Paris Hilton By Paris Hilton For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray 3.4 Ounces]]</li>
            <li> Paris Hilton Fragrance Smells sooo sweet and florally too. It&#x27;s a great fragrance to wear everyday or on a date.</li>
            <li> When I was younger I used to borrow and barter stationery from my other girl friends. It would be a nice collection of perfumed stationery and after a while the stationeries would make their own scent after being mixed together for so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was reading reviews about Paris Hilton&#x27;s perfumes and some guy said it actually smelled good. So when I was at a perfume counter at the mall I was choosing between Paris&#x27;s Heiress version and the other self-named version. It took me about almost 30 minutes to decide but my nose and heart really settled on the first one, which I assume to be named Paris Hilton by Paris Hilton. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not really into Paris, but this one smells really good. It does not smell tacky at all, it smells kind of girly. I am a self-confessed perfume connoisseur and I know what I am talking about.</li>
            <li> I JUST LOVE PARIS PERFUME AND AMAZONS PRICE ON IT ,MY VERY FAV. OTHER THAN BURBERRY AND STILL BY J.LO THE 3.4 OZ WITH DAILY USE LAST ME ABOUT 2 TO 3 MONTHS AND AMAZON HERE I COME ,BEATS THE HECK OUTTA ANY OTHER PRICE AROUND ESPECIALLY MACYS.MY VERY FAVORITE ,SMELLS LIKE IM HERE IM SEXY I HAVE ARRIVED KINDA SWEET KINDA SEXY KINDA PARIS!!!!BUY- IF U HAVE NEVER TRIED TRY!!!!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best perfumes ever! I have all of Paris scents and I get so many compliments! This along with Siren are one of my favorites. I will never stop wearing this scent. This particular scent reminds you of Liz Clairborne. Its very light and has a sweet smell to it. The perfumes last all day.</li>
            <li> Paris Hilton is not easy to wear, imo. If you can wear this, congratulations. The apple and melon are REALLY nice, reminding me of the best quality of Coty&#x27;s Exclamation &amp; Coty&#x27;s Forbidden Fruit. I like smelling this on others, even if I can&#x27;t stand the egomaniacal celeb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is something freaky about the juice that doesn&#x27;t sit well. For me, there&#x27;s a chemical note in Paris Hilton that when I sniff it, it&#x27;s almost like it jabs my sensitive back molars. There&#x27;s a metallic taste to it too. I frequently have problems with white florals, but it&#x27;s not the jasmine &amp; tuberose causing it. It&#x27;s something else. If it wasn&#x27;t for that freaky note, I would wear this regularly, in spite of the white florals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I so wish that this worked for me, even if the flacon is 1970s Avon tacky. Thankfully, the bottle was really cheap but I ended up giving the bottle away.</li>
            <li> wonderful bargains on Amazon</li>
            <li> Not to impressed with this perfume..</li>
            <li> I went to a few retailers to buy this product but little to my suprise, it was way more expensive than the price Amazon offers it for. For a smaller bottle, I believe it was 1.7 oz., it was on average $32, and for the size I purchased from here, on average it was about $44. My wife loves this fragrance, and I would deffinately recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this perfume and I loved amazon came in very good condition with good packaging recommend&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> One of my favorite perfumes...</li>
            <li> This perfume is very strong at first. But mellows after a few hours it gave me a headache and made me feel sick. If you like light scented perfumes stay away from this one! It smells okay but its too strong!!!</li>
            <li> This Paris Hilton perfume was bought for my fiance that has worn it for years. I gave it to her for Christmas and she swore it didn&#x27;t smell like it usually does. I kept telling her she was nuts and she kept insisting it didn&#x27;t smell the same so I went to a local retail store and bought a bottle today and sure enough it smells different. Amazon is ripping people off! It also makes sense now as to why the box wasn&#x27;t shrink wrapped. Weird. According to Amazon it is considered \\&quot;hazardous\\&quot; to ship back and receive a refund so I am calling customer service tomorrow and insisting on one. DON&#x27;T BUY!!!</li>
            <li> absolutely exquisite is a phrase I never thought I&#x27;d use in reference to Paris Hilton but her perfume smells so lovely I have begun to overlook how obnoxious she is.  Seriously, it smells that good.  I, like, LIKE her now.</li>
            <li> My sweetheart bought me this fragrance and I love it!!! The scent lasts all day long...Love, Love, Love It!!!..lol</li>
            <li> Excelente, 100% Recomendado!</li>
            <li> This is the perfume that started the obsession. I love this perfume! It smells sooooooooooooooooooooo good. It is very fruity but really good. I really recommend this perfume to anyone who likes to smell good. Also look up her other perfumes. Her others are really good.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume! A very floral and powdery girly smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only gripe is that it doesn&#x27;t last long (like I cannot smell it throughout the day, or when I sweat at the gym like I can smell some of my other perfumes).  You do get a lot for the price though.</li>
            <li> Men always comment when I wear this! It&#x27;s cheap so beware if you don&#x27;t like smelling like other women you are around.</li>
            <li> My favorite smell. Shipped super fast!</li>
            <li> This is a nice light fragrance, which is not over-baring or heavy. It provides a freshness &amp; fun aspect that appeals to all ages. I would recommend it to women of all ages.</li>
            <li> I questioned this purchase before I ordered until I read some of the reviews which at the end of the day I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase, it smells great, its not to strong and the scent lasts for a really long time. Ordering it online at Amazon was was a piece of cake, I didnt have to drive out to a department store and pick it up, god bless online shopping :)If you haven&#x27;t tried this fragrance, please do so.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend makes fun of me for using this... But he loves the way I smell. I may not be a Paris Hilton fan, but her perfume is sweet, fruity, and my type of fragrance.</li>
            <li> Smells great, and if you buy it at the mall it comes with gift bag.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this for me and I hope he doesnt see this review but I have to say that it really smells like cheap perfume; just like I would expect Paris to.  I guess that means its authentic.  I tried it on two different occasions and I just couldnt take it anymore.  Maybe a lot of people like it but I dont see how.</li>
            <li> The first time I ordered, the product never came.  But I e-mailed Amazon.com about the problem and they responded within a few hours and mailed me a brand-new one with one-day shipping!  I love the perfume, it is fruity and subtle.  It is not one of those over-powering perfumes that some people like.</li>
            <li> love the product and price, vendor shipped as promised, would do business with them again</li>
            <li> EXCELENTE PRODUCTO RECOMENDADO</li>
            <li> This is the third time I ordered this perfume!! and I LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> Great smell awesome packaging my gf loves it!! I can&#x27;t get enough of the smell I just want to smell her all day !! lol but yeah I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of its low price but more because other buyers&#x27; positive review. I sprayed it right after the product arrived and a few friends asked me the brand. I spray it in the morning and the sexy smell lasts longer than I expected. Good buy!</li>
            <li> one of my favorite perfumes.. and the price was awesome :)</li>
            <li> Lovely scent and always gets compliments.It lasts forever and seems more concentrated than others so a little goes a long way, it&#x27;s a bit too easy to overdo this one. the body lotion is particularly nice.</li>
            <li> This purchase was my second bottle of Paris Hilton perfume, due to the fact that I absolutely LOVED my first bottle (probably my favorite scent).  I was so disappointed when it arrived (I was anxiously counting the days), as it smells nothing like the bottle I bought at a department store a few years ago.  It would seem the shelf life has expired, or it came from a bad batch.  It smells like most perfumes eventually do after sitting for some time- cheap and like rubbing alcohol.  I would have sent it back, but Amazon does not allow for perfume returns.  I am a frequent Amazon customer, yet this is my first time writing an Amazon review, so obviously I feel motivated to do so.  For the first time, I am disappointed with Amazon.  Shucks.</li>
            <li> I was christmas shopping and came across the bottle, I decided to smell it, and fell in love with the scent. I told the girl to ring it up because I liked it that much. Then I realized it came in a huge Paris Hilton box, I almost told her to take it back because I didn&#x27;t want to buy a celebrity product, but it smells so nice it makes you feel good. Its a light frangrance no harsh at all. I would recommend it to anyone who likes fruity soft smells.</li>
            <li> Before buying this perfume, you should know that it is definitely not a regular \\&quot;day\\&quot; perfume. It does have a stronger scent to it which isn&#x27;t always appropriate in the work environment. That being said, when my girls and I are ready for a weekend out to either a club/bar, we always know exactly what scent to use!&lt;br /&gt;Paris smells so fantastic and I always receive compliments for how nice I smell! I never go out without applying some Paris Hilton.&lt;br /&gt;While this isn&#x27;t a perfume for everybody, if you&#x27;re looking for a fun, flirty, sexy perfume for going out, Paris Hilton is perfect for you.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the seller was great! I received the product almost the very next day! VERY impressive.</li>
            <li> I have worn this perfume before. When I received this from amazon I was very pleased with the packaging and the fact that it arrived in a prompt manner. With that being said, it does not smell the same as my previous Paris Hilton perfume. Just to let you guys know, Paris Hilton perfume does not last very long at all. But this scent from amazon is practically non existent after 5 minutes. (no exaggeration). It definitely makes me question the authenticity and my loyalty to Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this but can&#x27;t find it in the store.  I have to admit, it smells pretty good on her too!</li>
            <li> This a great buy! It smells so good would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this scent! I never would of thought to buy a perfume by Paris Hilton, but the designer has proven me wrong. My friend has this perfume and I fell in love with it. It is feminine and can go from day to night easily. It is my staple scent and I get compliments on it every day that I wear it. Lasts throughout the day and is a reasonable price. Thank you Paris!</li>
            <li> This has been out for a while and used to cost a lot more than it does now. This has always been my favorite smelling perfume on what is now my wife. At the price you definitely can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume!!! Best one out of all Paris Hilton&#x27;s collections in my opinion!! Great deal!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Will order another one soon :)</li>
            <li> Found it on my niece&#x27;s Amazon Wish List.  She loved it - just what she wanted and it was sooo easy using her list.</li>
            <li> I brought this as a gift for my wife for christmas and she was very excited because she loves Paris Hilton . So if your lady love Paris Hilton this would make a great gift .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of Paris Hilton&#x27;s morals, BUT, the Heiress has done well for this product. It is the best perfume I have ever worn. I stacked up on 3 of these. The cream is not the greatest, but the perfume stands on its own as beautiful and lady like indeed.</li>
            <li> This is my signature scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been wearing the scent of whoredom by Paris Hilton for years.  I am always complimented on how good I smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key is to douse yourself in this scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really does smell wonderful.  And just like the real Paris Hilton...I even ensure I spray it on the pillows of anyone Ive slept with so they remember my scent and that I was there.</li>
            <li> I found the cost great.. The ordering was easy and delivery was exactly as promised. However was disappointed that the scent was very faint and does not smell like the original.. I have tried spraying on extra and still not the same . Within an hour it actually stinks.. This was a lessoned learned . I will not ever purchase perfume here on line. I would rather pay more and get the scent I love and the compliments..</li>
            <li> this perfume smell great and the price was good for the size my wife like it very mouch</li>
            <li> excelente producto esto va para mis amigo los venezolanos que siempre hay dudas de los paquetes personas serias y todo es como sale compre con seguridad soy muy delicado con mis compras y quede fino ciando vi los paquetes</li>
            <li> Buy it every year for Christmas!</li>
            <li> Smells like a dream!! Shipped quick, packed perfect, looks and smells great!!!</li>
            <li> I had been looking for something new to wear (perfume), but quickly became frustrated with the prices in the mall.  I decided to check out Amazon and was quite pleased to see the savings! I read the reviews for this Paris Hilton spray and decided to take a chance. Mind you, I have never bought perfume before without first trying it out, but with such great prices, what&#x27;s to lose?  Anyway, my purchase arrived only 3 days after my order, and I&#x27;m LOVING this scent! I was a little worried that the freezing temps here in the Great Lakes region may have ruined the perfume (since the box was sitting on my porch for awhile before I knew a package had arrived), but all is well. The perfume wasn&#x27;t frozen despite the -30 wind chill temps. The perfume is not too overwhelming, but strong enough to last the whole day through. The scent has a hint of fruityness to it, which is what I like. Very feminine! And my husband likes it, too. :)</li>
            <li> Amazing price. I&#x27;ve never been complimented so much wearing any other perfume.&lt;br /&gt;So what if people laugh at you when you answer their question with \\&quot;Paris Hilton\\&quot;, they&#x27;re just jealous they don&#x27;t smell as good!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to smell like a million bucks and not give in to the ridiculous prices of the perfume industry, I suggest...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curious-Britney Spears (clean and sophisticated)&lt;br /&gt;Fantasy-Britney Spears (sweet girlie-ness)&lt;br /&gt;Circus Fantasy-Britney Spears (amazing)&lt;br /&gt;Paris Hilton-original (this one)&lt;br /&gt;Heiress-Paris Hilton (great light flower smell)&lt;br /&gt;Can Can-Paris Hilton (pure sexiness)&lt;br /&gt;Live Luxe-Jennifer Lopez (fruity)&lt;br /&gt;Hidden Fantasy-Britney Spears (sweet apricot)</li>
            <li> Just got in today, I thought it would be a flake because it was sold from some company that I never thought of, but it&#x27;s definitely real and definitely smells really good! I&#x27;ve gotten a couple compliments today already and it&#x27;s only been 4 hours wearing it! Great buy! The only downside is that it stays with you so long that you kind of get hooked into smelling yourself every so often. I almost gave 4 stars but I realized how inaccurate that would be! Definitely a 4.75 star but i just gave it the extra bonus :)</li>
            <li> bought to give gift to relative, she liked it good products. rest of the words for amazon 20 counts one two three</li>
            <li> WOW!! THIS IS NOT A ORGINAL PARIS HILTON SCENT.. SMELLS HORRIBLE! WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY FROM THEM THE SMELL IS NOT THE SAME!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I WILL RETURN THIS ITEM BACK</li>
            <li> Very peach and melon heavy on the top note with apple and jasmine on the midnotes. Lovely scent and always gets compliments. It might be a bit \\&quot;young\\&quot; if you&#x27;re looking for something more mature, it&#x27;s definitely not mumsy or old fashioned at all. I&#x27;ve had several friends and family wear this one at the height of it&#x27;s popularity a few years back and it smelled pretty similar on all of them, so body chemistry doesn&#x27;t really alter this one too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasts forever and seems more concentrated than others so a little goes a long way, it&#x27;s a bit too easy to overdo this one. The bottle is pretty (clear with pink perfume and black embossing on the bottle) and will look cute on the dresser/vanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The matching toiletries also match the scent perfectly (which often doesn&#x27;t happen), the body lotion is particularly nice.</li>
            <li> After reading several recent reviews claiming this product is a fake, I have to say I was nervous about my order.  However, the perfume arrived and smells just like any other bottle I&#x27;ve purchased at department stores.</li>
            <li> OMG I bought this perfume (without test-smelling) just after reading all the comments here at amazon. Since it comes with a really good price I thought I should give it a try. Usually I&#x27;m really really picky. I don&#x27;t like stuff what flies by too fast or if it&#x27;s too sweet, grandma-ish or simply too heavy. But congrats to Paris and her team they really kick it with this one! I love it and get seriously more compliments about my light &amp; sporty smell then with any other perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for all the comments guys they were quite helpful.&lt;br /&gt;So if you ask me, theres no doubt: GO FOR IT AND BUY IT cuz its worth it. (Once sprayed, it&#x27;ll stay like forever. I use the 3.4ounce bottle for 6 months yet!! I use it every day.)</li>
            <li> I got this for my girlfriend for christmas. She loves it and I love it on her! I would recommend it to buy for your girlfriend/wife!</li>
            <li> Very nice soft scent will by more soon</li>

            <li> excellent product, excelent seller</li>
            <li> Love it will be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> I purchased Paris H Perfume 1 month ago . when i open carton box , package is protected carefully .this perfume is edp concentration . I was spray on a piece of paper and it&#x27;s last 1 week . it&#x27;s work well , and the code on the box matched with the code on the bottle . very good .thank you amazon .  i decided to usually shopping on amazon every month.</li>
            <li> I had a sample years back but refused to buy it because of the name. Ladies forget the name. This perfume is sophisticated and sexy! It doesn&#x27;t smell cheap at all. And the price is reasonable, can&#x27;t beat that! But I recommend buying the perfume + the lotion, they compliment each other.</li>
            <li> i dont know why anyone would say this is fake, i been buying this perfume retail for years now, and i notice not ONE thing different about this one sold on here. who can complain about a 3.4oz REAL designer brand perfume for what, 20$? i love it, its legit, the real thing, THANK YOU AMAZON!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I bought from a bad batch but it does smell like it went bad.  I ended up buying another bottle from Kohl&#x27;s and it is the BEAUTIFUL fragrance that I love.</li>
            <li> this is the only great smelling perfume i have ever found its seriously intoxicating i can spray it on my shirt persay and three days later when i pick it up to wash it it still smells just as good.  infact i think my clothes with this perfume on come out of the washer/dryer  not smelling as good as when they went in &amp;#60;3 love love love smelling myself all day long with this on &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Its a good one I love it</li>
            <li> Good seller and product</li>
            <li> Smells good and that&#x27;s all I care about is that my wife smells great.</li>
            <li> Loved it. Better price than anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Now my wife have a great smile... she is very happy with this fragance ...</li>
            <li> Always a favorite of mine</li>
            <li> My opinion of Paris Hilton is the lowest, but her perfume is A1 in my book.  I usually shy away from celebrity products. This one I received as a gift and loved it.  I keep it in stock now. She did do something right this time.</li>
            <li> The perfume box looked like it had served in dessert storm. Did not come in wrapping to protect the box. The mechanism spray does not work.</li>
            <li> excellent product, excellent service</li>
            <li> Excellent, widely recommended from Venezuela.</li>
            <li> I love this scent. I am always disappointed that it is Paris Hilton&#x27;s perfume. I hate her getting my money but I just live how it smells too much to stop using it. It&#x27;s not easy to find a perfume you love.</li>
            <li> Great scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its my go to bed scent, very mild and sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pleased!</li>
            <li> My mother bought the smaller bottle of this perfume for my then thirteen year old sister a year and a half ago. She was in love with it, as was anyone who smelled her. She ran out around christmas time and has been begging for a new bottle since, so I decided to buy her this larger 3 ounce bottle for her 15th birthday.&lt;br /&gt;I placed the order on Monday 3/17, and it arrived on my doorstep noon today! (Tuesday 3/18) I was very satisfied because I had decided to use the free super saving shipping option which told me that I wouldn&#x27;t recieve it until  April 3rd! I regret not ordering one for myself, and I would definetly recommend this scent to any young woman!&lt;br /&gt;By the way, this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever ordered anything online!</li>
            <li> smells very nice and its the exact size its not a mini bottle</li>
            <li> Love this it smell so good on me my daughters asking mom whats that smell i said paris that said wow that smell good i said i know right</li>
            <li> I remember years ago when my best friend had this perfume I absolutely adored it! I would constantly take it from her and use it throughout the day. For some reason I recently thought of this particular scent and was so ecstatic when i ordered it. Within the week of ordering, I received the perfume. (ordered on a Mon, got it the following Fri) When i sprayed it, it wasn&#x27;t as i had remembered it. It does bring back a familiar scent, but its definitely not the same. On top of that, the scent wears off fairly quickly and is very faint.. unless you dont mind spraying about 10 x&#x27;s. I was honestly a liiiittle disappointed..</li>
            <li> this perfume has an awesome smell but it doesn&#x27;t last long enough I wish it did! aroma 5 stars lasting effect 2</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my sister and she loved it. I honestly thought the packaging was gonna be cheap feeling but it&#x27;s actually quite nice. And the scent is so sweet and beautiful!</li>
            <li> Excellent Product and sealer</li>
            <li> I first bought this back when I was in high school about 5-6 years ago.. I loved it but have been unable to find it in any stores since. I was so happy to order this and it be the exact same as I remember! Love this smell. No it does not smell like cheap vodka &amp; vicodin LOL. i love it!</li>
            <li> excellent product merchandise shipped on time, arrived before the date I needed as it was for a gift, and very well packed and in perfect condition. thanks</li>
            <li> Soft and sensual scent for any lady.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend them and stays for a long time like other brands der fragrances</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with this fragrance!!! It smells great during fall/spring seasons. This perfume is also long lasting. The only thing I am uncertain of is whether or not this perfume is authentic? Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This product was awesome! I loved the fragrance, but did not want to spend what stores were asking for it.Amazon had it for a fraction of the price AND it qualified for free shipping! I would recommend this product AND Amazon.com to anyone!</li>
            <li> this was a gift for my mom  she loves it</li>
            <li> When sprayed on my skin, I couldn&#x27;t detect any of the fruity nor floral notes what-so-ever....&lt;br /&gt;What a disappointment!</li>
            <li> Its the same color as appears on the monitor. I like it a lot ! the first day i got it everyone complimented my perfum. Its really good for all ocassion. The only thing i wish, was that it had a little handle to wrap around my wrist. Its good and the seller shipped it here in IN in an ample amount of time.</li>
            <li> Hands down, my favorite perfume. I love the fact that it is not too much for day use, and it is not too light for night use. It really is just a great daily perfume. It smells incredible. &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Love this perfume and user fast shipping</li>
            <li> Perfume is spectacular, a thousand and a thousand thanks, was perfect, it&#x27;s great, thank you very much. Good, good, good.</li>
            <li> i have been wearing this for years and hands down this is the cheapest i can find it! fast shipping and smells amazing!! will order again and highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Excellent buy, very good quality and perfect</li>
            <li> For $17, this is definetely an amazing perfume. Smells slightly differently than I remember from last time, but nonetheless, very satisfied. Plus, delivery was a day early cant beat that!</li>
            <li> I loved the smell of this perfume -- but it does not last very long.</li>
            <li> I was fully prepared to hate this perfume.  Paris HIlton has never been one of my favorite celebrities.  Not that I have many favorite celebrities.  But if I did, Paris Hilton would definitely not make my list.  The Simple Life?  Only for the most simple-minded.  &#x27;That&#x27;s Hot&#x27;?  So not.  But I was pleasantly surprised to find that the Paris Hilton perfume is much better than the Paris Hilton persona.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find Paris HIlton the perfume to be the antithesis of Paris Hilton the person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a sweet scent, not cloying or heavy at all.  It&#x27;s light and airy, easy to wear and easy to smell.  It&#x27;s great for the office or for a night out, and doesn&#x27;t come across as cheap or tacky at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think Paris at night.  Not Paris Hilton at night.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and I regret it. It smells too sweet it makes me dizzy. She hates it too.</li>
            <li> Excellent retail management.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Packaged perfectly! LOVE this perfume, smells clean and fresh!  Not too strong, shower fresh!</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift and I was skeptical about it but when it ran out I was bummed about it.  After a year or two I decided to buy one on my own.</li>
            <li> Love this scent! Fast shipping and great price for this size bottle. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> excellent product I recommend it 100%</li>
            <li> very good the product</li>
            <li> Came fast and I love love love this perfume</li>
            <li> I was happy to get this for xmas, I had always wanted to try it. It has a very strong smell to it, and smells like something an older women would wear. Not for me, if your under thirty I do not recomend getting this.</li>
            <li> I dont like Paris Hilton but the smell is amazing. 1 sniff and men would be all over you .</li>
            <li> PERFECT, my wife love her gift</li>
            <li> My favorite day-to-day perfume. Soft, sensual and not a strong over-powerful scent that leaves an easy, clean and memorable fragrance behind.</li>
            <li> WIFE LOVES IT!! PARIS HILTON HAS A GREAT COLLECTION. IT SMELLS WONDERFUL.. I WAS VERY HAPPY WITH THIS BUY, WILL BE BUYING MORE!!</li>
            <li> Product arrived in great shape and very quickly.  No problems or complaints at all and my wife is very pleased with the product.</li>

            <li> got this for a gift because is my nieces favorite fragrance, i loved the price and i got it on the time promise</li>
            <li> If you want your significant other to smell great at a very reasonable price, Paris Hilton will fit the bill.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! It last long, and attracks men! It was so much cheaper here on Amazon, and it&#x27;s actually authentic unlike the perfume I bought on ebay that was fake.</li>

            <li> The product meets all my expectations and my experience of this purchase is exceptional.</li>
            <li> The price was amazing and it is ine of my favorite fragrances. The package arrived in time and in good conditions. Definitely will order again</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume, Subtle and not overpowering but very nice and lingers. Don&#x27;t like strong scents but love something I don&#x27;t have to reapply often. Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance!! Great gift for her Christmas gift!! I would recommend this product to all of my friends wife&#x27;s or girlfriends!!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this perfume.</li>
            <li> Smells sweet I jus love the smell this perfume is a excellent choice. Paris Hilton did a good job by making this fragrance</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking when I purchased this. I thought it smelled good in the store, but when I got it home and started wearing it, it kept making me feel queasy. I would catch whiffs of myself throughout the day and think, \\&quot;ew, who smells like whore - oh crap! It&#x27;s me!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pass. Maybe it just didn&#x27;t jive with my body chemistry.</li>
            <li> Great. Got one for my mom and one for my sister. They are both happy with it.</li>
            <li> Smells great, lil on the sweeter side than anything tho</li>
            <li> It smells so good, I love it. Yes I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> Excellent shop and head</li>
            <li> Awesome rating I&#x27;m giving because I got the real product that i wanted and it satisfied me very well.  I recommend this product to all the women out there who are looking for a very pretty scent.</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT, GOOD SELLLER!!</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t smell right... it smells funny... only used a few times then threw it out :(</li>
            <li> I really like the scent, I also thought the price was a pretty good price for it and the bottle is pretty too!!</li>
            <li> The best way to switch my ol lady&#x27;s likes</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume and I was so excited to find it for much less on Amazon. I purchased the perfume one and I was very disappointed once I put it on. I put it on before leaving with my mom and sister. An hour later when we were in the car the scent was gone. I think it&#x27;s better to spend a bit more and purchase it at the store where you can actually return a faulty product.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many Paris Hilton Perfume bottles from Amazon. This is the first time i got one that is SO FAKE!!! This is not real. It smells horrible. The top of bottle doesn&#x27;t even stay on. I should of known why it was so cheap. Just a few dollars more I could of gotten a real bottle of Paris Hilton Perfume.... Disappointed and a waste of money... Not Happy at all....</li>
            <li> I only wear Paris Hilton. I suffer from migraines and all of my other perfumes give me a headache I can sure do without.  I&#x27;m so happy I discovered Paris.  I can&#x27;t wear any of her other scents just this particular one.  Its not harsh and smells very pretty.  I&#x27;m not a teenager, but anyone can wear this perfume.  Thank you Paris you are a lifesaver!  :)</li>
            <li> This smells sooo good. No complaints. Arrived quickly, just as described. Is the true product. This is not a replica.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item.  I had purchased it and I am very satisfied with this purchase.  I will reorder if needed again.</li>
            <li> Excelente producto, cumple totalmente con el requerimiento, escelente entrega, buen negocio, muy agradecido.  Llego en buen estado y perfectas condiciones</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter. She loves this and I had a hard time finding it - except on Amazon. Arrived quickly and she loved it as she thought I could not find it for her.</li>
            <li> Entrega en tiempo establecido por el vendedor, producto nuevo y en perfecto estado y correctamente embalado. Compre con toda confianza</li>
            <li> buy this perfume for my wife as a small detail and the fragrance smells good and she survives him is good</li>
            <li> My all time favorite scent.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is great fast shipment thanks</li>
            <li> PERFECT!!! Thank you...Bought 3.4 oz perfume for $20-30 cheaper compared to any store &amp;amp; if that&#x27;s not good enough, perfume arrived in all original perfume packaging (not a knock off- I know this perfume too well). Excellent buy, price, perfume, &amp;amp; perfect 2 day delivery! :-)</li>
            <li> Very pleasing fragrance. Suitable for all occassions. Scent lasts all day. Always gets compliments,</li>
            <li> Say what you want about her lifestyle or her celebrity status, Paris Hilton knows a good perfume when she smells it!  When I asked my wife last year what she wanted for Christmas, I almost fell out of my chair when she said she wanted Paris Hilton perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is light, sweet, and not overbearing.  I&#x27;m no expert on perfumes, so I&#x27;ll just say that it smells like \\&quot;a lady who still remembers what it&#x27;s like to be a girl.\\&quot;  I realize that that is about as helpful as a paperbag, but it&#x27;s the best way I know to describe the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife wears this perfume religiously and I&#x27;m sure she plans to get another bottle under the tree this year.  I highly recommend Paris Hilton by Paris Hilton.  It smells good!</li>
            <li> The scent is amazing, but it is too subtle for my liking. I feel the need to spray more than usual to get a scent that will last all day. But the size is nice and it does have a nice aroma.</li>
            <li> I purchased this perfume as a gift for my girlfriend, and also for my brother&#x27;s wife for christmas. They seemed to love it. It has an amazing smell. Its a winner!! Worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this cologne. My daughter and I wear it and both of us get cmpliments on it all the time.</li>
            <li> This perfume are 100% fake&gt; Don t believe the good opinion probably people who buy them never smell the original.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume on her and it just smells so fantastic. Valentine&#x27;s Day is coming up and this would be the perfect gift for your special someone before this gets discontinued at some point. Well worth it.</li>
            <li> Received my product in a timely manner. The product was exactly as described, brand new in the box. Love this perfume! Fun and flirty smell!</li>
            <li> Who would&#x27;ve thought this woman could make an excellent perfume. I get compliments ALL THE TIME when I wear it. Accidently stumbled upon it and now it&#x27;s my little cheap trick :-)</li>
            <li> Not sure why the wife likes it but she does.</li>
            <li> Gift for my sister. She was very happy and continues to buy this same one.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really sure I would like this perfume. I have never bought perfume online before and Paris Hilton perfume is something I usually don&#x27;t wear. BUT I absolutely looooove it! It last all day long. Considering it is not the &amp;#34;parfum&amp;#34; spray it last really really long. (excuse the typos) - Buy buy buy it!! You will love it. If you like sweet perfumes, you will love it. It is kind of strong at first, but my husband told me he can smell it on me when I walk by at the end of the day!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, it was very fast delivery. I would recommend this to anyone who wants there man to always notice how good you smile. My husband walks up and hugs me and say &amp;#34;you smell sooo good&amp;#34; I have never changed ever since. you get this from everyone. this is the best one perris made</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell as strong as my first one!</li>
            <li> Buyer Beware! Save your money and buy from the store. Its cheaper here because its a bad batch. the store are better quality and real, btw if u don&#x27;t like it u can always return..</li>
            <li> I thought for sure this would smell like a sweaty club skank, or perhaps a giant hussy. But it actually smells great. How do I describe a smell over the net? I have no idea. But if you are in a department store like I was, test it. You will find that Amazon has the best prices.</li>
            <li> i LOVE this scent. I got it for my wife because she had it years ago before we started dating. We knew each other back then and i would always get a woody just smelling this on her haha. still smells just as amazing.</li>
            <li> This perfume rocks! I get complimented on it all the time, and its just amazing. Its fruity, and very light, but lasts most of the day. Don&#x27;t be discouraged if you&#x27;re a Hilton-Hater, definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> My order came before the estimated time and it was exactly what I had ordered! It was in perfect condition. It smells great and I highly recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> My mom loves it, my cousin loves it, my friend loves it. What more can I say. Ah, you get it here for 1/3 the retail price.</li>
            <li> My daughter received this fragrance as a birthday present last year and we all fell in love with it. She ran out of it not long ago so I purchased this bottle for her for Christmas! We all love the fragrance!</li>
            <li> Got this for my mom for this past Christmas. Smells great and she loved it.</li>
            <li> Always will be my FAV, Ive been wearing this for over 15 years.</li>
            <li> surprisingly this is a great fragrance! love it! and it&#x27;s a great price. light enough to wear everyday. not a strong scent. seller delivered with no problems!</li>
            <li> excellent, I highly recommend it. serious. excellent product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, the smell lasts me all the time even after bath, I like it as floral. For all occasions</li>
            <li> Excelente producto, y precio. Recibi en muy buen estado. Estoy CONFORME con el mismo, he recomendando a mis familiares y amigos.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied! recommend</li>
            <li> This is a nice perfume, it does stay on for quite a while but nothing overly special about it, it reminds me of other perfumes.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this perfume!!! It is my signature smell, and i was extremely excited to find it while shopping on Amazon and even more excited with the price!!! I&#x27;ll definitely be stocking up on this item!</li>
            <li> It was a gift to my wife and she love it</li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it. The fragrance lasts all day and is really lovely. Definitely one of my favorite perfumes now.</li>
            <li> very good service, delivery was on time as promised, excellent&lt;br /&gt;I found very fulfilled. For me the most important is that if you give me a date, the same is met.</li>
            <li> Buenas, el producto me llego en buenas condicion y como lo esperaba! muy buena atencion! es una excelente marca! !</li>
            <li> received in perfect condition</li>
            <li> Bought this and the cool water, both fakes, big difference with the real one and fake one. Must have diluted with water or something because the perfume does not attach to you. If you are happy with an air freshner get this, but buy the perfume from a trusted dealer. Amazon fails at perfumes. Maybe one is real, but most of them are diluted with some substance.</li>
            <li> Recieved in perfect condition and it has an amazing smell!</li>
            <li> my all time favorite! just what i expected! must buy!</li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t get this perfume because of some of the negative reviews.  I&#x27;m so glad I bought it.  This perfume smells great and is long lasting.  All day!  You don&#x27;t have to spray much.  Really!  Money well spent.  Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE SMELL BUT AFTER A HALF HOUR I DONT SMELL IT ON ME ANYMORE. I HAVE TO KP SPRAYING EVRY HOUR. SO DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY. I KNOW I WONT  WASTE MY CASH BY BUYIN HER PERFUME . ILL STICK TO THE OLD SCHOOL PERFUMES THAT STAYS ON ALLDAY SUCH AS LIZ TAYLOR GIVENCY  273 AND JADORE.  THESE 2K PERFUMES  ARE GARBAGE.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this present I bought for my mom for Christmas. It arrived early and was it great shape! Excited to get such a good deal, very happy!</li>
            <li> I have ordered several of these over the years because they are very affordable and have a lasting fresh scent. This perfume is my go-to perfume. I definately recomend it if you already like paris hilton perfumes.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. I would recommend this to my friends and family. All of her perfumes are great. Try it and you will like it.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed.  I wear Paris Hilton everyday.  When I opened the box and sprayed it, something was wrong.  The smell is horrible and doesn&#x27;t at all smell like Paris Hilton.</li>
            <li> Bought for a friend and she loves it! Great price and good size bottle!!</li>
            <li> el perfume es realmente exquisito lo compre como regalo para mi esposa y le encanto comentario enviado desde venezuela tx</li>
            <li> Awesome i didn&#x27;t even think it would smell that good!!!</li>
            <li> where are the products that zoom miami q told me I communicate with you to where they left the order</li>
            <li> Excellent, it is recommended to the community. Lucky for future operations.</li>
            <li> IT WAS A GIFT FOR MY DAUGHTER. IT IS A 5 STAR  BECAUSE IT IS A WONDERFUL PERFUME  EVEN THE BOTTLE IS NICE ..</li>
            <li> Good fragrances. Nice for nights. But never take more of two touch. I say 4/5 stars. Es the Best of Par&amp;iacute;s.</li>
            <li> i bought this because i used to use it time ago and i always loved it. it is sweet and everyone likes it</li>
            <li> elegi esta clasificacion porque el producto es muy bueno, lo que mas me gusto es que todo fue rapido, recomendado 100%</li>
            <li> i Love the smell of this perfume is lajet the nice smell stays on for 24hrs and great price and size &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> arrive in very good conditions</li>
            <li> Great product, it was delivered on time.  I have ordered several times from this seller, and I have always been happy.</li>
            <li> The scent of this fragrance is mainly fruity, fresh, floral. I really like it because it&#x27;s long lasting and it slightly changes scent once mixed with your natural odor. My sister and I use the same Paris Hilton perfume and even though it smells great, it distinctively smells different on us.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume and an awesome price</li>
            <li> excellent item and good seller</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like the authentic Paris Hilton perfume. I am extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Smells great, one of my favs for my wife</li>
            <li> My daughters love this fragrance very much, they use it almost every day.  I would recomend it, but it is up to each one to decide wich fragrances are best in each case.</li>
            <li> I love how this scent is very sweet and girly--you really can&#x27;t go wrong with it. My only con of it is that it doesn&#x27;t last very long--only a couple hours max. I have to spray it on twice a day sometimes. Otherwise, it&#x27;s very worth the money.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand Paris Hilton, but this perfume really is amazing. It reminds me of Tommy Girl, but better. It doesn&#x27;t last very long though and it always give me a headache and makes me a little dizzy when I first put it on, but it&#x27;s definately worth it.</li>
            <li> I love the way this perfume smells, it&#x27;s one of my favorites. I searched for the best price and it was here on amazon.</li>
            <li> I got this perfume around 3 years ago and decided that I wanted it again. It was just as amazing as before. I love it.</li>
            <li> excellent product, fit this classification because it seems a good product and I definitely recommend it to other people .....</li>
            <li> This is the best. Nothing like it out their. One of her best perfumes. You go Paris Hilton. I fell in love immediately the first time I put this perfume on. It smelled wonderful through the bottle. And the bottle is big. Came quickly. I recommend this seller wholeheartedly. I will be back again. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I really love the smell of it at the mall but once I seen it on Amazon I ordered one but the smell didn&#x27;t last long at all it actually smells different....:-(</li>
            <li> Hi Everyone, I love this perfume but when I received the package was bigger than I expected and expensive so I won&#x27;t buy with this seller anymore.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume. Not over powering at all.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume lasts several hours in the skin, its aroma is fascinating. I would return to buy</li>
            <li> Wife loves it smells just like she remembers</li>
            <li> Soy venezolano.. la colonia me llego sin problemas&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m from venezuelan I get no problems ... the colony is very good ...</li>
            <li> Durable sweet and elegant for me! I think it is a great fragrance for the price. Use it  on the evenings and casual dates</li>
            <li> and I have the product in my hands. all in perfect condition .thanks</li>
            <li> Love the fresh smell!!!</li>
            <li> excellent product as it appears on the page and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;thank you very much&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;more attentive to Cart</li>
            <li> Legit. I love this fragrance I&#x27;ve been wearing it since highschool. A definite buy. I bought two because this is a deal</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this perfume I was a little hesitant because in store this bottle is twice if not three times more money. Great deal!!</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume one day on a whim. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would last on me. But, I was surprised when at the end if the day I was still getting compliments on how good I smelled. Everyone would ask me who I was wearing &amp; when I would tell them they would look at me surprised.  Most of them didn&#x27;t know she even had a perfume out like this one. This is one if my favorite perfumes that I have &amp; I have a lot. I would definitely recommend this product if you want something that smells good &amp; stays on.</li>
            <li> Ive looked for this in department stores and I think they are over priced!!! through amazon I have been able to collect many different perfumes at a very low cost!!!! I love amazon!!!</li>
            <li> i bought it for my daughter, i think it was just what a paid for, it have a good price</li>
            <li> Paris Hilton perfume is my favorite and it is all I ever wear.  It smells wonderful. It arrived fairly quickly and was an excellent value.</li>
            <li> Great product, shipped quickly. Thanks!</li>
            <li> it was not what I expected</li>
            <li> excelente producto original funciona sin problemas gracias recomiendo para este vendedor el producto fue despachado dentro de la estimacion propuesta</li>
            <li> Excelente producto, me gusta mucho la fragancia y entregado a tiempo y en optimas condiciones, recomiendo al vendedor y el producto</li>
            <li> this is a gift, but is a fragance really good, durable, female, i think complet .my expectative.  my mother say thank&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on which perfumes men like the best, and ran across this one. I found a tester bottle at Walmart and tried it out, and sure enough my boyfriend and all the guys I swing dance with started saying how great I smelled! Other girls comment on it as well. I&#x27;ve used other perfumes with nothing like this sort of response. People are stunned when I say it&#x27;s Paris Hilton! Great price, but I&#x27;d pay much more for a reaction like this!</li>
            <li> excelente producto y envi&amp;oacute; r&amp;aacute;pido muy contenta gracias</li>
            <li> Smells great and it&#x27;s most definitely a head turner.</li>

            <li> absolutely amazing! i love the scent and i will continue to buy this until i cant buy it anymore. the scent lasts a long time and its definitely worth it. i receive so many compliments when i wear this perfume. girls its a must have !</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the name. The reviews were pretty good and I just wanted to try something new. The scent is beautiful. I can think it can work for a person of any age and at any time of day. It&#x27;s never too overpowering.</li>
            <li> Always get compliments on this very lite yet lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li> Great value for a scent that I really enjoy.</li>
            <li> This was actually purchased for my granddaughter for Christmas.  I had bought this and the Heiress perfume for her and her sister last year.  She got the Heiress last year.  When she told me what she wanted this year, she made it very plain that she wanted this one, not the heiress.  She wears it daily and loves it!</li>
            <li> I did not like because the smell go fast</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the scent.</li>
            <li> Amazing. My wife is soooo happy.</li>
            <li> wao muy rica fragancia, el empaque llego completamente en prefecto estado, sin da&amp;ntilde;os, me complazco plenamente en recomendarlo. bueno bueno</li>
            <li> Was shipped and not damaged. It smells like it should and it smells great! Glad I bought it here. :)</li>
            <li> Love it. One of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for years. Great price! Cant find any where else cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Large bottle. must buy if you like the smell.</li>
            <li> Smells just like Ralph, Ralph Lauren; but half the price. This smells so good! The pic looked like a plastic bottle, it is glass, packaged really well!</li>
            <li> I first bought this fragrance at kohls department store. I bought a 1.7 oz bottle for 48$.  I loved the light and airy sweet scent.  I have since found an outlet in Floriday that sold this frangrance for 35$ for 3.4 ozs.  I thought that was a good deal but theprice it sells for on amazon is awesome!!  It arrived pretty quickly in brand new packaging and in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended Highly********</li>
            <li> excellent my wife likes</li>
            <li> Buenos d&amp;iacute;as, gracias por la pronta respuesta.&lt;br /&gt;Le escribo con la finalidad de saber en que tiempo me reintegran el dinero y saber cual sera la gesti&amp;oacute;n realizadas por ustedes para la reintegraci&amp;oacute;n del dinero. Esto es un encargo que tengo que solventar lo mas pronto posible y necesito la compra del articulo inmediatamente.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;le agradezco el inter&amp;eacute;s y espero solventar la situaci&amp;oacute;n lo mas breve posible..</li>
            <li> I love the scent and I received more compliments with This particular Product Then others I have tried before.The biggest comment was,&amp;#34; What kind of Perfume is that? I love it!&amp;#34;The best part is scent doesn&#x27;t drown You in Fragrance that You can&#x27;t breath in or make You sneeze.The Fragrance last as well.So You don&#x27;t have to re-spray Yourself several times threw out the day.</li>
            <li> Excelente producto de acuerdo a lo esperado, el env&amp;iacute;o fue acorde a la fecha se&amp;ntilde;alada, estoy muy satisfecha con el producto, lo recomiendo</li>
            <li> I wore Paris Hilton for 6 years. I stopped wearing it a while ago. Recently I thought I would go back to wearing it. I received it quickly which was great. When I first sprayed it, I didn&#x27;t notice a big difference. But as time went on, I did notice a subtle change in the way I remembered it. This one smells more syrupy if that makes sense. Then the sprayer stopped working and now sprays a stream which will ruin your clothes if you are not careful. I do not think it is real, and if it is maybe it is old? I don&#x27;t know if perfume expires.</li>
            <li> Excelente. Buen precio. Se la compr&amp;eacute; a mi hermana le encant&amp;oacute;. Lleg&amp;oacute; en el tiempo estimado. Buen vendedor. Es la propia.</li>
            <li> This was an easy buy since it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve had before. It was a great value for the size and money.</li>
            <li> very good product I recommend it.</li>
            <li> met my expectations, I loved it, too beautiful. I will buy thanks, smells very rich and I love this colony</li>
            <li> This fragrance is not overpowering.  I use as an everyday perfume and get compliments from strangers who ask me what perfume I&#x27;m wearing!</li>
            <li> I received the Paris Hilton perfume with in 2 days and products seems fine.  Very satisfied with my order</li>
            <li> My GF loves this fragance.</li>
            <li> I love this sent! I dont care for the person its named after but the sent is something else. Im a huge perfume person constanly buying new and exotic perfume but this has become almost a signature sent. Love it!</li>
            <li> Good cologne but the bottle was very cheap. I bought it for a friend and the spray broke after a few uses .</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my cousin its her favorite fragrance</li>
            <li> Great Price, shipped faster than expected.  Love this perfume - it&#x27;s old school and hard to find in stores and you cannot beat the price!! I ALWAYS get tons of compliments on this perfume from both men &amp; women!!</li>
            <li> Great product and a great price. My wife loves this fragrance and won&#x27;t use anything else. She recommends this product to all women. The product is as described and well worth the price. I have bought several bottles and will buy more.</li>
            <li> Considering its Paris Hilton...I was hesitant, but this perfume smells awesome! Would buy it again...one of my favorites. Her newer fragrances aren&#x27;t that great. One of her best!!!</li>
            <li> my girlfriend loved it !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good seller. Recomended.</li>
            <li> What can I say about this perfume?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it, my wife loves it and people are surprised when they ask what she is wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a very sweet smell but not over powering.&lt;br /&gt;The price is amazing and shipping times are also great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care for Paris Hilton but her colognes and perfumes are legit.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! I don&#x27;t particularly care for Paris Hilton herself but it was recommended to me by a few friends so I bit the bullet and purchased it. I am so glad I did! It is not too strong and has a slight fruity smell but not over powering. I wore it today and I swear every person I talked to asked me what I was wearing and received so many compliments. I will be buying this again once I run out!</li>
            <li> I love the way this perfume smells.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, that even though I really love the scent, you may not expect the aftermath and inner turmoil that occurs after purchasing a product created and endorsed by such a detestable skank as Paris Hilton.  If you&#x27;re like me and are thoroughly repulsed by this woman and yet still decide to buy her fragrance, you may experience a feeling as if you&#x27;ve just purchased a novel created expressly from trees deforested from the Amazon Rainforest.  Like you&#x27;ve just kicked an orphan, stolen its puppy, and burnt down the orphanage. Like buying a towel from Walmart to save 20cents, when the mom and pop shop next door is shutting down and their employees of 30 years are laid off.  While the analogies may not be accurate for the purchase of a simple bottle of perfume, I assure you that the feeling that you&#x27;ve ignored your moral compass and abandoned your ethical sensibilities is very real.  What it all boils down to...is that I smell fantastic, but I am a terrible person.  Hence it is my belief that only terrible people buy Paris Hiltons perfume.  I am complimented on it daily and tell them it&#x27;s Dove Body spray instead.  It is my shame. My secret. Don&#x27;t be like me. You won&#x27;t smell as good, but you&#x27;ll probably get into heaven.  If you do decide to buy it...might as well do it here on Amazon.  The 3.4oz is offered at a price that INCLUDES shipping what I paid for a 1 oz bottle in a dept. store.</li>
            <li> One of my all time favs! I always get compliments on this perfume! i can&#x27;t ever run out!</li>
            <li> There are many perfumes paris hilton of woman that they are good, I do not have all, but co this one already they are 3, I it do not know the first time that I it buy</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift. I didn&#x27;t get any complaints so I assumed it was satisfactory. The person asked for it.</li>
            <li> My husband and I are not Paris Hilton fans but when someone gave me a bottle of this as a gift he was hooked on the smell.</li>
            <li> My wife love this fragance and is a very good price compared whit the stores, i definitly bougth another one soon</li>
            <li> I love this fragance. It was a great gift for my mother on her birthday. I got another for me</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter. She really likes the fragrance. I was hesitant about buying it but really couldn&#x27;t go wrong with the affordable price.</li>
            <li> I love This perfume, it delivered in several days and I&#x27;m Very happy with it. It was brand new in a box and sealed. What a deal!</li>
            <li> excellent product, excellent seller, recommend</li>
