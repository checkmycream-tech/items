            <li>Very good</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>This product smells good and has great staying power.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product is good for use with curling irons.</li>
            <li>Hot Sets is the best product that I have tried and I have stopped trying anything else.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>This product is great if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li>It would be better if you pinned it til it cools I have to order some clips</li>
            <li>I consider it one of the better products Redken has designed.</li>
            <li>but overall it&#x27;s a great spray!!</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>So many of the products out there offer protection from the heat of the irons but do not help the curl to hold.</li>
            <li>Product&#x27;s spray top was clogged.</li>
            <li>OK now.</li>
            <li>so I am very familiar with it.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and really doesn&#x27;t hold a curl on its own, even with the iron set at a hot temperature.</li>
            <li>Had to soak the top spray cap in hot water to get it to dispense.</li>
            <li>but it coats your curling iron and you have to clean it.</li>
            <li>Very smooth and fast.</li>
            <li>If you have fine hair like I do, I think you will like Hot Sets 22 by Redken.  </li>
            <li>I recommend to everyone, it really does the job!</li>
            <li>I really love this spray the only part I don&#x27;t like</li>
            <li>The girls don&#x27;t especially care for the application method and say the product feels more like a hair spray than a heat protectant.  </li>
            <li>Hot Sets 22 does both.</li>
            <li>I was so upset i would curl my hair and by the time im done everythings pretty much straight.</li>
            <li>Good product for hard to curl hair like mine.</li>
            <li>But with this i cant believe it really lasts.</li>
            <li>one is the real deal.</li>
            <li>This product absolutely does not work for me.</li>
            <li>This product works great for curling irons and flat irons, but it leaves your hair a little on the sticky side.</li>
            <li>My hair is very difficult to curl and this has worked the best of all of the products I have tried.  </li>
            <li>My daughters both use high heat on their hair and I want to prevent the damage associated with that.  </li>
            <li>It gives your curling iron sets a nice long lasting hold without being too stiff and/or becoming sticky like some setting lotion do to your hair.  </li>
            <li>If you just can&#x27;t get by with just mousse for hold your curling iron set in this will really help your set to last a lot longer than ever before, plus if you really like this product, you can buy it in a refill 16.2 oz bottle to help offset the price of sending away for it.</li>
            <li>This spray is a bit sticky and heavy but is nice if you need extra hold.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, keeps your hair from being fried by hot irons and curling irons, and holds my curls better then curling alone when I want moredefined, less crazy natural curls.</li>
            <li>This happens most of the time and is frustrating.</li>
            <li>I got this after reading the good reviews but I am not happy with it because it is sticky and heavy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional beauty and use this product when I want the hairstyle lasts for a long time!</li>

            <li> I ordered this pink Hot Sets, but received a black ones.  </li>
            <li> I flat iron my hair and use this on the ends to give the curl</li>
            <li> My kid loves it too for when he flat irons his rock star hair!</li>
            <li> Product took 7 days to arrive once it was shipped; a little long.</li>
            <li> This product was not the same strength that I have always used and ordered in the past.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is the spray nozzle tends to get clogged.</li>
            <li> Gives hair body, blow dry hair as usual, then by sections spray this on and use curling iron.</li>
            <li> I always return to this product as it truly adds volume to my very thin hair making styling so much easier</li>
            <li> I ordered an expensive curler (Nume) because I thought that would fix the problem getting a more expensive curler</li>
            <li> The black container seems to be a thicker spray.  </li>
            <li> I spray this and curl my hair, hold it in my hand for a few seconds and let go.</li>
            <li> I used it a few time before using hair straightener.</li>
            <li> Can give you dramatic looks if you want to flat iron or curl and it will hold the curl!</li>
            <li> And worse, it leaves my hair looking dull and dry.</li>
            <li> it have alcohol which is not good for my hair</li>
            <li> Very thick and sticky.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a professional beauty and use this product when I want the hairstyle lasts for a long time! I recommend to everyone, it really does the job!</li>
            <li> OMG this thing is the answer if you have hair that wont hold a curl like mine!! I ordered an expensive curler (Nume) because I thought that would fix the problem getting a more expensive curler and it didnt! I was so upset i would curl my hair and by the time im done everythings pretty much straight. But with this i cant believe it really lasts. I spray this and curl my hair, hold it in my hand for a few seconds and let go. It would be better if you pinned it til it cools I have to order some clips so I can do that. But get this, it will hold your curls!</li>
            <li> It gives your curling iron sets a nice long lasting hold without being too stiff and/or becoming sticky like some setting lotion do to your hair.  If you just can&#x27;t get by with just mousse for hold your curling iron set in this will really help your set to last a lot longer than ever before, plus if you really like this product, you can buy it in a refill 16.2 oz bottle to help offset the price of sending away for it.</li>
            <li> I always return to this product as it truly adds volume to my very thin hair making styling so much easier</li>
            <li> Use it every day. Protects my hair from the heat of the curling iron.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and will continue to use it.  I consider it one of the better products Redken has designed.</li>
            <li> This product was not the same strength that I have always used and ordered in the past.  The bottle was different and I am wondering if it is a knock-off product since it came from a different supplier. The bottle shown is how it should look but the bottle received was different.</li>
            <li> Very thick and sticky.  I used my sister&#x27;s last year, and it worked well.  Don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;ve changed the formula, but it definitely did not feel the same.  I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I really love this spray the only part I don&#x27;t like it have alcohol which is not good for my hair but overall it&#x27;s a great spray!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years so I am very familiar with it. I will continue to use it in the future.</li>
            <li> I got this after reading the good reviews but I am not happy with it because it is sticky and heavy. I used it a few time before using hair straightener. It makes my hair too sticky and I can&#x27;t even brush it afterward.</li>
            <li> I ordered this pink Hot Sets, but received a black ones.  I don&#x27;t think they are the same product.  The black container seems to be a thicker spray.  Was very disappointed I didn&#x27;t get what I ordered.</li>
            <li> This is a good product is good for use with curling irons.</li>
            <li> Up do season is coming and I am giddy! This is a must have as a stylist. Rock on all night hold. Nothing like it.</li>
            <li> This product smells good and has great staying power.  My hair is very difficult to curl and this has worked the best of all of the products I have tried.  It doesn&#x27;t make crusty curls either if you spray from about a foot away.</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair like I do, I think you will like Hot Sets 22 by Redken.  It helps hold my fly-away hair without stiffness.</li>
            <li> My daughters both use high heat on their hair and I want to prevent the damage associated with that.  I read reviews for several heat protectants before settling on the Redken because of the review and cost.  The girls don&#x27;t especially care for the application method and say the product feels more like a hair spray than a heat protectant.  Therefore, neither used it for any length of time.  I cannot make any statements about its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Very good but it coats your curling iron and you have to clean it.</li>
            <li> Good product for hard to curl hair like mine. A bit pricy but cheaper brands leave my silver hair yellow.</li>
            <li> This product is great if you have fine hair.Gives hair body, blow dry hair as usual, then by sections spray this on and use curling iron.</li>
            <li> This product works great for curling irons and flat irons, but it leaves your hair a little on the sticky side.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, keeps your hair from being fried by hot irons and curling irons, and holds my curls better then curling alone when I want moredefined, less crazy natural curls. My kid loves it too for when he flat irons his rock star hair! :) lol</li>
            <li> I use a curling iron virtually every day. My hair is very fine and really doesn&#x27;t hold a curl on its own, even with the iron set at a hot temperature. So many of the products out there offer protection from the heat of the irons but do not help the curl to hold. Hot Sets 22 does both. Hot Sets is the best product that I have tried and I have stopped trying anything else.&lt;br /&gt;This one is the real deal.</li>
            <li> It met my expectations and I will order again.</li>
            <li> This spray is a bit sticky and heavy but is nice if you need extra hold. Can give you dramatic looks if you want to flat iron or curl and it will hold the curl! I flat iron my hair and use this on the ends to give the curl/flip at the ends some hold and to prevent fly-away. Use sparingly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the spray nozzle tends to get clogged. This happens most of the time and is frustrating. Wish Redken would fix that!</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly.  Item as described.</li>
            <li> Product&#x27;s spray top was clogged. Had to soak the top spray cap in hot water to get it to dispense. OK now. Product took 7 days to arrive once it was shipped; a little long.</li>
            <li> This product absolutely does not work for me. It did not help my hair to hold a curl at all. And worse, it leaves my hair looking dull and dry. I will be going back to Biolage Thermal Setting Spray!</li>
            <li> Very smooth and fast. Thank you.</li>
