            <li>Really really nice quality wig.  </li>

            <li>And I believe I got free shipping unless somehow I didn&#x27;t... :P</li>
            <li>I have the red wig in this style which fits perfectly and is gorgeous...</li>
            <li>Super full wig!!!</li>
            <li>and I can wear it in so many ways.</li>
            <li>I will buy more colors from this company.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not TERRIBLE but seems this color is more like a $10-15 wig not $20.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this wig.</li>
            <li>You are able to wear it as soon as you get it and are able to do what you want with the bangs.</li>
            <li>I ordered this wig for my Cinderella costume thinking I could use the detachable side ponytails as the top curls for Cinderellas hair.</li>
            <li>ok.  </li>
            <li>4 stars because of the thinness on top.</li>
            <li>The cap does stretch a lot, however, so I still may be able to wear it.</li>
            <li>It is very full and adorable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also arrived 2 weeks early!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>though I wouldn&#x27;t run around TOO much with it on :P</li>
            <li>I am so excited to wear this with my Harley Quinn cosplay!</li>
            <li>The whole wig is full of beautiful curly hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shed much, which is a plus, and the fiber is good.  </li>
            <li>It fit perfectly and looks very real and natural.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t see the wig cap, and the clip on ponytails stay in place, they&#x27;re super easy to clip in and take out!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to take care of them</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll note it DID get here very quickly.</li>
            <li>The Wig is so pretty and and it looks nice on every one who submitted pictures like mellanie, ect.</li>
            <li>First it came with a bend in the wig cap, a spot that kind of pokes out, and some of the hair in the bang area stuck up kind of funny.</li>
            <li>Okay, it&#x27;s not BAD</li>
            <li>The wig is Verry comfortable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit heavier with the ponies but still comfortable.  </li>
            <li>This wig is super soft and nice!</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same color and volume as showed, which is nice!</li>
            <li>a week AFTER it was originally supposed to be delivered.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I am not the best at styling hair but the thickness and quality of this wig is true to what the other Reviewers are saying.</li>
            <li>such a good price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I really wanted to many of the wigs of theirs that I have seen on Amazon.</li>
            <li>SOOOOOOOOOO THICK and PERFECT for all kinds of Cosplays!</li>
            <li>Seriously one of the best wigs I&#x27;ve bought!</li>
            <li>I cut the main part to make it look more like just pigtails.</li>
            <li>will most likely buy from this seller again :)</li>
            <li>So this was my very first wig purchase</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased and will be ordering from them again for all my cosplay needs.</li>
            <li>I honestly bought this wig because of the other customer reviews and pictures, but I am not as satisfied as others seem to have been.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very surprised and pleased at the quality of this wig and like that the option exists to use hair clips separately.</li>
            <li>You get allot of wig for a little bit of money, great</li>
            <li>But I was just glad to have it, so I could wear it next time, but when I tried it on it didn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>so they sat right...</li>
            <li>The hair is soft and easy to style.</li>
            <li>This is my first wig.</li>
            <li>Just be aware.</li>
            <li>This is the second wig I&#x27;ve ordered from this seller, and I am extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li>I ordered it for a Harley Quinn cosplay I&#x27;m doing at comic con and it arrived with plenty of time to spare.</li>
            <li>I have many wigs which I wear regularly, and this one is...</li>
            <li>First of all, when I received the wig, it came in a package much too large for it, so the wig was sliding all around inside.</li>
            <li>I wish I could get a replacement that DOESN&#x27;T SMELL BAD because it&#x27;s a beautiful adorable cosplay wig</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s a pretty decent wig for the $20ish I paid.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it ;)</li>
            <li>For the money, it is better than I expected.</li>
            <li>and I really hope that will solve the problem and that it wont ruin the styling and the curls.</li>
            <li>really revoked this product!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I may even get this in other colors :)</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s rare to find one with so much hair, especially for</li>
            <li>(Though on the model it was allot fuller and had allot more volume, but you could get the same effect if you brushed it out.)</li>
            <li>I feel it&#x27;s a little stringy and such and not as nice quality and material.</li>
            <li>The ponytails are nice, I think, but because the wig is so thin, the clips are very visible.</li>
            <li>The clips in the ponytails are easy to take on and off, and stay on firmly-</li>
            <li>The cap isn&#x27;t lace, which looks a little cheap</li>
            <li>it was really long and the curls held up really well!</li>
            <li>This wig is so soft and beautiful,its just as pictured and came with 2 wig caps</li>
            <li>Also obviously the model is tiny, the wig is not as full or long looking on an adult sized person..</li>
            <li>got the blonde and the color is the same as the picture, looks natural and the hair is very full.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lovely wig, but my experience was not good.</li>
            <li>It would probably be cute with a hat on top, but don&#x27;t plan on wearing the base wig by itself.</li>
            <li>The bangs are a little hard to position to where the black bald cap doesn&#x27;t show underneath, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;d be fine with a nude-colour.</li>
            <li>Its extremely soft and thick and full.</li>
            <li>The fibers are nice, but very thin.</li>
            <li>Color and thickness is accurate but it seems like it&#x27;s actually sorta small!</li>
            <li>In no way would I consider this a lolita wig, as lolita typically has a much higher standard.</li>
            <li>The wig cap it came with was black and only showed through a little bit, but I just brushed the hair over and it covered it fine.</li>
            <li>The curls are soft and loose.</li>

            <li> The curls are soft and loose.</li>
            <li> Though I have very thick long hair, and the wig just manages to fit on my head with all my hair tied up.</li>
            <li> came with a little fake tattoo which was unexpected but cute.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thin on top, so I may steal some wefts from the pigtails to fill it in.  </li>
            <li> In comparison this is a different sorta cruddier size and fit, and there are places in the bangs where it&#x27;s hard to make you not able to see the wig cap through the parted hair.  </li>
            <li> The two detachable pig tails are very long and soft and the base wig is soft and very long too unlike most wigs in this style</li>
            <li> Not a good first impression.</li>
            <li> The wig came much earlier than expected</li>
            <li> It came allot sooner than I expected, too - it was supposed to be here on the 17th but got to me by the 2nd -</li>
            <li> Needless to say I was less than satisfied.</li>
            <li> I usually buy wigs in this price range and have never gotten one at such low quality.</li>
            <li> and the wig doesn&#x27;t look as synthetic as I expected.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t tangle unless you actually try to, and it&#x27;s not cheaply made!</li>
            <li> I ended up glueing down the hairs</li>
            <li> I use this wig for my Shay Van Buren cosplay, and I have found myself using it for other cosplays too!</li>
            <li> was using this for an alois trancy cosplay from a show called black butler and this wig was perfect!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have put it on at least a handful of times to try and get my parting for the bangs down and just to get a feel of how it looks and it has hardly shed at all with my constant messing with it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit heavy.</li>
            <li> Very thick and long.</li>

            <li> This wig is so cute and great to use for cosplay. I do warn you though about the actual curls. I honestly don&#x27;t know how to maintain or take care of curls. XD I&#x27;ll Google it later but it&#x27;s very beautiful and the shipping was very quick. I highly recommend it ;)</li>
            <li> Really really nice quality wig.  For the money, it is better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Seriously one of the best wigs I&#x27;ve bought! Its extremely soft and thick and full. I bought it for a Harley Quinn cosplay and I can wear it in so many ways. The two detachable pig tails are very long and soft and the base wig is soft and very long too unlike most wigs in this style were its just a bob cut,</li>
            <li> This is my first wig. I liked how the wig &amp;ponies were in separate hairnets. It came with a wig cap too. The wig is Verry comfortable. It&#x27;s a bit heavier with the ponies but still comfortable.  I will buy more colors from this company.</li>
            <li> The wig came much earlier than expected so the shipping time was great; and the wig itself is just beautiful! You can wear it with or without the two side bumps (or ponytails If you want to call it that). I&#x27;m choosing to wear it without and it&#x27;s just so beautiful! Goes great with my costume for Halloween and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone :)</li>
            <li> So this was my very first wig purchase and I absolutely love it! I paied an extra $22 to have it Expedia shipped to me so i have it in time for a Con and I&#x27;m so happy i did. I have put it on at least a handful of times to try and get my parting for the bangs down and just to get a feel of how it looks and it has hardly shed at all with my constant messing with it. I am so excited to wear this with my Harley Quinn cosplay! Even without the pigtails the wig is totally awesome. Would recommend 100%!!! I may even get this in other colors :)&lt;br /&gt;Mine came with a little fake tattoo which was unexpected but cute.</li>
            <li> This wig is adorable! I cut the main part to make it look more like just pigtails. It worked well for my Harley Quinn cosplay!</li>
            <li> I tried to find a way to contact the seller to get a replacement before posting this review but found no way to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sad to only give this three stars. I adore this wig. It is very full and adorable. But it arrived SMELLING so horrible, like the worst sort of mildew, like it had been stored in mold. It made me itchy. I am going to try to wash it and I really hope that will solve the problem and that it wont ruin the styling and the curls. I wish I could get a replacement that DOESN&#x27;T SMELL BAD because it&#x27;s a beautiful adorable cosplay wig and it&#x27;s rare to find one with so much hair, especially for such a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope all of MapofBeauty&#x27;s wigs don&#x27;t smell like this, I really wanted to many of the wigs of theirs that I have seen on Amazon. This bums me out.</li>
            <li> PERFECT. Very thick and long. Beautiful curls.</li>
            <li> This wig is super soft and nice! It doesn&#x27;t tangle unless you actually try to, and it&#x27;s not cheaply made! You can&#x27;t see the wig cap, and the clip on ponytails stay in place, they&#x27;re super easy to clip in and take out! I use this wig for my Shay Van Buren cosplay, and I have found myself using it for other cosplays too! I Definitely recommend this wig!!</li>
            <li> Super full wig!!! I ended up straightening mine in order for a cosplay. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using a straightener, but the hot water method works perfectly! I didn&#x27;t want to take the wig off. It fit perfectly and looks very real and natural.</li>
            <li> SOOOOOOOOOO THICK and PERFECT for all kinds of Cosplays! From Kaoti from Your lie in April to Apple jack from MLP, They run small though so if ur heads much bigger the 22 id look elswhere for a wig.</li>
            <li> Love love love it!! Worth the money! Comes with hair nets and packaged separately so it&#x27;s easy to take care of them so they don&#x27;t get tangled up. Does not feel synthetic at all. The hair is soft and easy to style. The curls are soft and loose. I&#x27;m very surprised and pleased at the quality of this wig and like that the option exists to use hair clips separately.</li>
            <li> Okay, it&#x27;s not BAD it&#x27;s just not all that great.  I feel it&#x27;s a little stringy and such and not as nice quality and material. Color and thickness is accurate but it seems like it&#x27;s actually sorta small! I have the red wig in this style which fits perfectly and is gorgeous... In comparison this is a different sorta cruddier size and fit, and there are places in the bangs where it&#x27;s hard to make you not able to see the wig cap through the parted hair.  It&#x27;s not TERRIBLE but seems this color is more like a $10-15 wig not $20. I&#x27;ll note it DID get here very quickly. I think 7-10 days or so. And I believe I got free shipping unless somehow I didn&#x27;t... :P but it was scheduled to come in after like 30-40 days so that&#x27;s nice!</li>
            <li> The Wig is so pretty and and it looks nice on every one who submitted pictures like mellanie, ect.</li>
            <li> Very awesome wig. It&#x27;s the same color and volume as showed, which is nice! (Though on the model it was allot fuller and had allot more volume, but you could get the same effect if you brushed it out.) It came allot sooner than I expected, too - it was supposed to be here on the 17th but got to me by the 2nd - and the wig doesn&#x27;t look as synthetic as I expected. It&#x27;s not too shiny or dull. The clips in the ponytails are easy to take on and off, and stay on firmly- though I wouldn&#x27;t run around TOO much with it on :P Though I have very thick long hair, and the wig just manages to fit on my head with all my hair tied up. The wig cap it came with was black and only showed through a little bit, but I just brushed the hair over and it covered it fine. You get allot of wig for a little bit of money, great buy- will most likely buy from this seller again :)</li>
            <li> I am in love with this wig. You are able to wear it as soon as you get it and are able to do what you want with the bangs. The whole wig is full of beautiful curly hair. Great look even without the clip in pigtails.</li>
            <li> This product us amazing!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I was using this for an alois trancy cosplay from a show called black butler and this wig was perfect!&lt;br /&gt;I got the blonde and the color is the same as the picture, looks natural and the hair is very full.&lt;br /&gt;I really revoked this product!&lt;br /&gt;It also arrived 2 weeks early!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig for my Cinderella costume thinking I could use the detachable side ponytails as the top curls for Cinderellas hair. It worked great. Unfortunately I am not the best at styling hair but the thickness and quality of this wig is true to what the other Reviewers are saying. It is good quality. It is really bright! Just be aware. It is really really blonde.</li>
            <li> I really liked it! it was really long and the curls held up really well!</li>
            <li> This is the second wig I&#x27;ve ordered from this seller, and I am extremely satisfied. I ordered it for a Harley Quinn cosplay I&#x27;m doing at comic con and it arrived with plenty of time to spare. This wig is beautiful and very full and bouncy. It&#x27;s a LOT of hair, especially with the pigtails clipped on, so it&#x27;s a bit heavy. But it is great quality. The bangs are a little hard to position to where the black bald cap doesn&#x27;t show underneath, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;d be fine with a nude-colour. Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased and will be ordering from them again for all my cosplay needs.</li>
            <li> I have many wigs which I wear regularly, and this one is... ok.  It&#x27;s a little thin on top, so I may steal some wefts from the pigtails to fill it in.  Oddly, it&#x27;s quite thick otherwise.  The cap isn&#x27;t lace, which looks a little cheap and I personally don&#x27;t care for (although it may be a nitpick).  It doesn&#x27;t shed much, which is a plus, and the fiber is good.  4 stars because of the thinness on top.</li>
            <li> First of all, when I received the wig, it came in a package much too large for it, so the wig was sliding all around inside. Not a good first impression. The wig itself is VERY small -- probably child sized. The cap does stretch a lot, however, so I still may be able to wear it. The fibers are nice, but very thin. The cap is also visible through the hair in the back. The ponytails are nice, I think, but because the wig is so thin, the clips are very visible. I usually buy wigs in this price range and have never gotten one at such low quality. In no way would I consider this a lolita wig, as lolita typically has a much higher standard. I honestly bought this wig because of the other customer reviews and pictures, but I am not as satisfied as others seem to have been.</li>
            <li> This wig is flawless. I used it for my Agitha Cosplay from Hyrule Warriors at NYCC this year, and it was so well received buy all the Zelda fans. It&#x27;s so wonderful, buy it.</li>
            <li> This wig is so soft and beautiful,its just as pictured and came with 2 wig caps</li>
            <li> First it came with a bend in the wig cap, a spot that kind of pokes out, and some of the hair in the bang area stuck up kind of funny. I ended up glueing down the hairs so they sat right... Also obviously the model is tiny, the wig is not as full or long looking on an adult sized person.. The wig cap showed unless I wore all of the base wig pushed back over my shoulders and only had the pigtails in front. It would probably be cute with a hat on top, but don&#x27;t plan on wearing the base wig by itself. I know this all sounds negative but I think it&#x27;s a pretty decent wig for the $20ish I paid.</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig and had it shipped rush so I could wear it to a convention the later that week, but the shipment was delayed, so I paid for rush and ended up getting the wig a week AFTER it was originally supposed to be delivered. But I was just glad to have it, so I could wear it next time, but when I tried it on it didn&#x27;t fit. I couldn&#x27;t get it onto my head. Needless to say I was less than satisfied. It&#x27;s a lovely wig, but my experience was not good.</li>
