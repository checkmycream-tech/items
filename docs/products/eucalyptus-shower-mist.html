    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It&#x27;s an awesome addition to my morning routine.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because of all the wonderful steam baths I have had here in Northern California.</li>
            <li>Very pleasant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>spray.&lt;br /&gt;first time scent was great and the spray worked well.&lt;br /&gt;last</li>
            <li>If this makes her happy, then I know it works well.</li>
            <li>your packaging, because you have a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr.</li>
            <li>good for nasal congestion  </li>
            <li>This has a great strong sent and lasts for a fair amount of time.</li>
            <li>Still works well like but don&#x27;t love it!</li>
            <li>I love the smell of it!</li>
            <li>I sometimes combine both sprays and am in scent heaven :-)!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I will buy more of this!</li>
            <li>By far the best scent to have in the bathroom!</li>
            <li>It was once cheaper however it is better than some cheaper knockoffs.</li>
            <li>the spray top doesn&#x27;t like to work all the time</li>
            <li>- they need to invest in a better spray.&lt;br /&gt;even</li>
            <li>a more reliable spray.</li>
            <li>The more steam you have the better it works.  </li>
            <li>If you have a atomizer type bottle you can pour the contents of this bottle in and perhaps be able to use it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this eucalyptus mist.  </li>
            <li>Wish I could find it more places.</li>
            <li>Smells great and really opens up my sinuses.</li>
            <li>I love this spray.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several eucalyptus sprays out there, and this is the best I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>OK, not as strong as the oil can be, I am now buying the oil.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe it would be as good as the real thing -</li>
            <li>This makes my whole room smell so good.  </li>
            <li>easy to use just a couple sprays and aroma</li>
            <li>I am breathing just fine.</li>
            <li>great for waking up in the morning the only problem is</li>
            <li>I liked it so much that I also bought their peppermint shower mist.</li>
            <li>I love eucalyptus&#x27; fresh, clean smell.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even more powerful, so don&#x27;t spray it right under your nose</li>
            <li>The pump bottle needs improvement, as you can only get one good pump out.</li>
            <li>One quick spritz of this into the air is all that&#x27;s needed for plenty of coverage.</li>
            <li>The smell quickly dissipates from the shower, so I wish it were stronger.</li>
            <li>three purchases - scent was still good - but first of the three&lt;br /&gt;deliveries arrived leaking - also all three recent purchases - the spray</li>
            <li>So worth the money.</li>
            <li>It energizes right away.</li>
            <li>Smells great but sometimes too strong and doesn&#x27;t smell as expensive as I thought it would have and it has a cheap quality to it</li>
            <li>I was looking for a eucalyptus spray, and this is exactly what I had in mind.  </li>
            <li>Oh and deodorizing when you need that too ;)</li>
            <li>in my shower - so by the time I have my first cup of coffee</li>
            <li>It smells great, long lasting and my apartment smells like eucalyptus.  </li>
            <li>Adds so much to a steam room!</li>
            <li>Gave to my friend who is a lover of all things eucalyptus, but she is very particular about what actually smells like eucalyptus...and she is looking to order more herself.  </li>
            <li>Refreshing, natural, masculine.</li>
            <li>The little plastic cap that is supposed to protect the pump plunger is to large and will just rest on the top of the bottle and free falls off once the bottle is tilted or turned over.</li>
            <li>My bathroom is really small and has no window, but when I spray this into the hot shower, it&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li>but when I got it - it was the real thing.</li>
            <li>and I found that this really helped me to breathe in the morning -</li>
            <li>I sprayed way to much.  </li>
            <li>When it arrived in the mailbox, the whole mailbox smelled like eucalyptus.  </li>
            <li>Eucalyptus  aroma fades fast so doesnt scent the rest of the home.</li>
            <li>I thought when I first received it, wow, this will go fast.  </li>
            <li>Long lasting and strong.</li>
            <li>All essential oil the label said and it was soooo very powerful that my one little bottle lasted more that 6 months using it everyday.</li>
            <li>However, you can buy eucalyptus oil much cheaper and do the same thing.  </li>
            <li>The Ecalyptus Shower Mist with has a nice scent but poor quality</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s pretty powerful stuff and will make you cough if you inhale it instantly, I let it settle for a few seconds.</li>
            <li>I played Mr. Optimistic the first time, blaming a rough UPS delivery.</li>

            <li> Long lasting and strong. Makes my shower smell like a spa with just two sprays.</li>
            <li> I ordered these spray bottles because of the small size bottle to keep in the shower, because I wanted a labeled bottle and I planned on refilling them with the large bottle of oil I purchased.&lt;br /&gt;But, the sprayers do not work. They arrived broken.&lt;br /&gt;I have contacted Amazon and I&#x27;m waiting on their reply.</li>
            <li> in my shower or hotels! One for home and one stays packed  just spritx in the shower spray   ahhhh  good for nasal congestion  So worth the money.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a eucalyptus spray, and this is exactly what I had in mind.  I love eucalyptus&#x27; fresh, clean smell.  One quick spritz of this into the air is all that&#x27;s needed for plenty of coverage. I&#x27;m sure I will buy more of this!</li>
            <li> By far the best scent to have in the bathroom! It&#x27;s an awesome addition to my morning routine. Refreshing, natural, masculine. Oh and deodorizing when you need that too ;)</li>
            <li> This has a great strong sent and lasts for a fair amount of time. It was once cheaper however it is better than some cheaper knockoffs.</li>
            <li> great for waking up in the morning the only problem is the spray top doesn&#x27;t like to work all the time</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of all the wonderful steam baths I have had here in Northern California. I couldn&#x27;t believe it would be as good as the real thing - but when I got it - it was the real thing. All essential oil the label said and it was soooo very powerful that my one little bottle lasted more that 6 months using it everyday. I have sinus problems and I found that this really helped me to breathe in the morning - in my shower - so by the time I have my first cup of coffee I am breathing just fine.</li>
            <li> A little goes a loooooooooooong way.  I thought when I first received it, wow, this will go fast.  I sprayed it in the shower and it over powered me.  I sprayed way to much.  It smells great, long lasting and my apartment smells like eucalyptus.  It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I spray 2 drops on shower door in the middle of my shower. Smells great but sometimes too strong and doesn&#x27;t smell as expensive as I thought it would have and it has a cheap quality to it I can&#x27;t put my finger on. Still works well like but don&#x27;t love it!</li>
            <li> The Ecalyptus Shower Mist with has a nice scent but poor quality spray.&lt;br /&gt;first time scent was great and the spray worked well.&lt;br /&gt;last three purchases - scent was still good - but first of the three&lt;br /&gt;deliveries arrived leaking - also all three recent purchases - the spray&lt;br /&gt;did not work after a couple uses - they need to invest in a better spray.&lt;br /&gt;even though the scent is terrific - I am looking for another product&lt;br /&gt;with a more reliable spray.</li>
            <li> Adds so much to a steam room!</li>
            <li> OK, not as strong as the oil can be, I am now buying the oil.</li>
            <li> Smell &#x3D; 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;Spray bottle &#x3D; 3 stars. The spritzer fell apart after several uses.</li>
            <li> my shower smells like a spa. the spray pump is a little difficult, but overall this was what i wanted.</li>
            <li> When I saw this on line I thought I would try it.  It works quite well.  The more steam you have the better it works.  It helps with my sinus problems, especially in the morning.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Stuff smells like pine sol not eucalyptus I would have just left a pine sol bottle open had I known.  What a joke. Garbage.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of it! I use it before I enter the shower. Since it&#x27;s pretty powerful stuff and will make you cough if you inhale it instantly, I let it settle for a few seconds. As soon as I enter the shower, I&#x27;ll be wide awake! It energizes right away. I liked it so much that I also bought their peppermint shower mist. It&#x27;s even more powerful, so don&#x27;t spray it right under your nose... I sometimes combine both sprays and am in scent heaven :-)!</li>
            <li> Gave to my friend who is a lover of all things eucalyptus, but she is very particular about what actually smells like eucalyptus...and she is looking to order more herself.  She says that everyone comments about the spa smell in her house.  If this makes her happy, then I know it works well.</li>
            <li> The pump bottle needs improvement, as you can only get one good pump out. The smell quickly dissipates from the shower, so I wish it were stronger.</li>
            <li> When it arrived in the mailbox, the whole mailbox smelled like eucalyptus.  Bottle had leaked.  The pump does not work, one pump then it is stuck in the down position.  The little plastic cap that is supposed to protect the pump plunger is to large and will just rest on the top of the bottle and free falls off once the bottle is tilted or turned over. If you have a atomizer type bottle you can pour the contents of this bottle in and perhaps be able to use it. However, you can buy eucalyptus oil much cheaper and do the same thing.  The only reason I bought this product was the spray bottle it came in and that is useless.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this eucalyptus mist.  My bathroom is really small and has no window, but when I spray this into the hot shower, it&#x27;s amazing.  I&#x27;m a spa girl, and this conjures images of having a spa experience.  Wish I could find it more places.</li>
            <li> We use this as an air freshener around the house, and we also spray it on pillows / bed sheets from time to time. Very pleasant. It is a little expensive, but this is pure eucalyptus essence, not watered down stuff.</li>
            <li> Bought this to use in the steam room at the gym. Smells great and really opens up my sinuses. I spray the pipe the steam comes out of a couple of time and a couple of puffs in the air and it does the trick.</li>
            <li> This makes my whole room smell so good.  I spray it on a Kleenx and put it under my pillowcase to help with my allergies and stopped up nose.</li>
            <li> easy to use just a couple sprays and aroma lasts till shower finish. Eucalyptus  aroma fades fast so doesnt scent the rest of the home. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I love this spray. I&#x27;ve tried several eucalyptus sprays out there, and this is the best I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the packaging of this spray is absolutely awful. I&#x27;ve bought it twice, and both times, it has arrived leaking. I played Mr. Optimistic the first time, blaming a rough UPS delivery. Now it&#x27;s obvious, THIS SPRAY HAS THE WORST PACKAGING EVER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fix your packaging, because you have a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. My Mailbox Now Smells Like an Australian Forest until I Wash It</li>
