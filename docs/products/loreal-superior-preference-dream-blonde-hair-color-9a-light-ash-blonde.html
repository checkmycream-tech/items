            <li>L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s BEST haircolor: DISCONTINUED!!!!</li>

            <li>What a great bargain for the best product!!  </li>
            <li>this one is great</li>
            <li>LOL)</li>
            <li>Comes with great shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Altogether, I was happy and plan on stocking up.</li>
            <li>wish they still made this color, evened out my many colors and looks great!</li>
            <li>when you are on a budget you have to trim the fat and usuing a good haircolor helps.</li>
            <li>Then I used this light ash and it looks just perfect.</li>
            <li>hope that it works well with good results</li>
            <li>Habitually discontinuing their most popular products does not seem to be a good business plan to me!</li>
            <li>And I get so many compliments from people!</li>
            <li>Will definetly try to buy more!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve tried many, many products!)</li>
            <li>VERY TIMELY DELIVERED AND IN GREAT SHAPE.</li>
            <li>Still on the search for the best blonde dye for my practiular head of hair!!</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with this hair dye.</li>
            <li>I managed to fix it, for the most part, with purple shampoo and Wella toner, but paying $50 to have that color renewed every 6 weeks was no bueno in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most hair colorants, even in salons, leave a reddish tint and/or damage my hair</li>
            <li>No brassy, bluish, gray, or purple undertone that so many others have and no damage.</li>
            <li>It comes with a pre-treatment and be sure to use it.</li>
            <li>The regular L&#x27;Oreal Superior Preference which is on the shelves in stores doesn&#x27;t do as well- still a great color but dries out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love this.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I was very happy with this product for several reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li>Most don&#x27;t realize that you get the pre color protector, a nice size tube of both shampoo and conditioner that keeps your hair in super condition.</li>
            <li>This product is one of the best in the shade of light ash blonde...</li>
            <li>This hair color is the most beautiful and affective of all the blonde hair color I have ever used.</li>
            <li>another indicator of how popular it was, and how rare it is rapidly becoming).</li>
            <li>even when they were producing it, it FLEW of the store shelves (I once ended up convincing a store manager to \\&quot;special</li>
            <li>I may have to go one shade lighter next time, since my roots are still a bit darker than the rest of my hair, but the color blended with my highlights beautifully.</li>
            <li>My hair was already light to begin with.</li>
            <li>Obviously L&#x27;Oreal knows this was a very popular product...</li>
            <li>great color result...and generous amount of product for my long hair....</li>
            <li>Dream Blondes is by far the BEST and is the only product I use.  </li>
            <li>Really, my hair feels in better condition after I color.    </li>
            <li>(Cool Ashy Blonde)...wonderful product...sold like \\&quot;hotcakes\\&quot;....</li>
            <li>My roots blend in great with the rest of my hair (which I wasn&#x27;t expecting due to the contrast)</li>
            <li>I have used this product before; it is great hair color but is hard to find in stores any more --</li>
            <li>so now I feel more confident to try out the even lighter shades the Dream Blonde range has to offer.</li>
            <li>All the rest always give me a golden look even though they are labeled as ash or cool toned.</li>
            <li>I refuse to pay high prices at the salon when I&#x27;m capable of dying my own hair.  </li>
            <li>In anticipation of many adventures in haircoloring with new products...</li>
            <li>Like many of you, my favorite color was the Light Ash Blonde (9A), and my experience with it was very similar to what many of you have described.</li>
            <li>This kit was great and at great value, but the color was not perfect on me; I have med/darkish blonde hair that dies easely.</li>
            <li>so thanks to Champion Liquidators for the price and quick shipping</li>
            <li>It made a beautiful ash blonde and didn&#x27;t dry out my hair.  </li>
            <li>The color was pretty darn close to what was shown on the box,</li>
            <li>However, having my roots bleached out  first is going to make new roots show quickly.</li>
            <li>It contains a pre-color conditioner, enough color for long hair (no more having to purchase two boxes of other coloring), and CONSISTENTLY provides beautiful color with excellent conditioning.  </li>
            <li>Looks kind of like a child&#x27;s natural blonde color, my color as a child.</li>
            <li>--my hair became more of a dark golden color than ash blonde.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Cons: Turned VERY orange.</li>
            <li>AFter repeated washes, a wash with dish soap (strips color), &amp; vineger rinses (brightens blondes), there wasn&#x27;t much improvement.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine but very long.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any brassiness like other reviewers mentioned, and my hair normally does turn brassy/yellow-orangeish with most dyes that claim to be ashy.</li>
            <li>I normally use this as a one step process and it turns out very well.      </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m once again embarking on searching and researching for my next favorite ash blonde haircolor...not too dark...not too light...and not too brassy.</li>
            <li>I have been going gray/white, and this light ash blonde color blends so well with my roots, and looks so natural with color variances throughout.</li>
            <li>I was hopeful after reading other reviews that this would indeed give me a nice ash blonde color</li>
            <li>I got highlights for the first time in years, and though I love being light blonde (my natural color is a dark, mousy blonde)</li>
            <li>I also love all of the little products it comes with to help maintain your hair&#x27;s health.</li>
            <li>so I guess I just did not want to pick the lightest color, but I am pretty please with the overall color of my hair, though it does have more of a \\&quot;strawberry\\&quot; blonde tint to it than I thought it would, next time I will be ordering the #10 peony one considering it</li>
            <li>Love the added pre-conditioner that protects ends of your hair, and the creme sample that i add to my wet hair on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>It did not end up as light as the color on the front of the box (obviously since that depends on starting color)</li>
            <li>&quot; do me (\\&quot;us\\&quot;) a favor and let me (\\&quot;us\\&quot;) know if you find a product comparable to the Dream Blonde 9A (light ash blonde) or provide an update if you find another solution?</li>
            <li>Therefore, next time I will use this but not bleach my hair out first.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions directly and my hair came out orange!</li>
            <li>This product and color is wonderful but this vendor is way too expensive compared to other vendors I have purchased it from before.</li>
            <li>early 2000&#x27;s with another L&#x27;Oreal color: Feria 81</li>
            <li>No green and no brass.</li>
            <li>I used the  lightest blonde shade first in this color and it did not help enough.  </li>
            <li>I have dark ash blonde hair and this is the first ash blonde color that truly ends up being light ash blonde on me.</li>
            <li>The reviews for this product left me with high hopes to lighten my med.</li>
            <li>Bleaching out first is just too much trouble for me and too high maintenance.</li>
            <li>Thanks in advance of any future replies!!)Thanks in advance of any future replies!!)</li>
            <li>My hair was left feeling very soft -- hardly noticeable damage, if any, and my hair is extremely fine and fragile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If your hair is not too dark , you might want to try it with just the one step, without bleaching first,  to see if it works for you.    </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like a young child&#x27;s blonde!  </li>
            <li>This time I had lightened my hair first to pale yellow shade and it had that bleached look without the softness of shading.</li>
            <li>With just enough yellow but the softness of the ash but NO grey  to it at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried light blonde box colors in the past, and they&#x27;ve always left my hair various shades of weird yellow, but this one actually gives me what it says: light ash blonde.</li>

            <li> My natural color is a dark \\&quot;dishwater blonde\\&quot; with some gray.</li>
            <li> I have been using Dream Blonde in this shade for a long time.</li>
            <li> only complaint was that the dye didn&#x27;t blend with my roots very well.</li>
            <li> I naturally have medium brown hair, but have been dying it blonde for a few years now.</li>
            <li> Most dyes seem to lighten my uncolored roots as well as the colored blonde ends; however, this dye left a weird darkish stripe where my roots met my previously dyed hair.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT- HARD TO GET.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally a dark ash blonde, but for whatever reason, coloring it always pulls out the red.</li>
            <li> and I was amazed at how soft my hair was especially since dying it lighter usually gives me straw-like locks.</li>
            <li> (Even now...when the last few boxes of Dream Blonde are appearing online for sale...the light ash blonde 9A is inordinately expensive compared to the others:</li>
            <li> I have not done at home die in a long time</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried a ton of blonde brands (as well as an array of other colors) over the years, and tend to be happiest with L&#x27;oreals blond section.</li>

            <li> when you are on a budget you have to trim the fat and usuing a good haircolor helps. this one is great</li>
            <li> I have used home blonding hair color for over 30 years, having used every imaginable product on the market.  Dream Blondes is by far the BEST and is the only product I use.  It contains a pre-color conditioner, enough color for long hair (no more having to purchase two boxes of other coloring), and CONSISTENTLY provides beautiful color with excellent conditioning.  The Amazon price is 1/3 of the discount or drug store price! I purchased a case when I saw the price and am going to order another!!!!  What a great bargain for the best product!!  Thank you Amaon!!</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT- HARD TO GET. VERY TIMELY DELIVERED AND IN GREAT SHAPE.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried a ton of blonde brands (as well as an array of other colors) over the years, and tend to be happiest with L&#x27;oreals blond section. The reviews for this product left me with high hopes to lighten my med. dark dirty blond hair to a closer match to my daughter&#x27;s light ash blond. Pros: Love the added pre-conditioner that protects ends of your hair, and the creme sample that i add to my wet hair on a daily basis. Cons: Turned VERY orange. AFter repeated washes, a wash with dish soap (strips color), &amp; vineger rinses (brightens blondes), there wasn&#x27;t much improvement. Bought and used [[ASIN:B001BPFQF2 Ardell Red Gold Corrector Plus .25 oz.]], mixig half a single packet w/a small amount of thick condidioner and left on hair for 15 miutes. Pulled a lot of orange out, but still not happy with orange tinge in back. Will never buy this practicular color again, but will possibly try another color in the line in the future... Still on the search for the best blonde dye for my practiular head of hair!! ;o</li>
            <li> PLEASE REMEMBER TO LEAVE FEEDBACK...IT IS SO HELPFUL FOR FELLOW AMAZONITES    I normally use this as a one step process and it turns out very well.      My natural color is a dark \\&quot;dishwater blonde\\&quot; with some gray. This time I had lightened my hair first to pale yellow shade and it had that bleached look without the softness of shading. Lady GAGA yellow...Too yellow.  I used the  lightest blonde shade first in this color and it did not help enough.  Then I used this light ash and it looks just perfect. With just enough yellow but the softness of the ash but NO grey  to it at all. Looks kind of like a child&#x27;s natural blonde color, my color as a child. Very beautiful. However, having my roots bleached out  first is going to make new roots show quickly. Therefore, next time I will use this but not bleach my hair out first. I&#x27;ll just do touch ups to root area for about an hour then put on rest of hair for 5 minutes. That way my roots will continue to grow out just a wee bit darker than the ends so not as noticeable as my hair grows and I like it that way. One step to blonde! Bleaching out first is just too much trouble for me and too high maintenance. If your hair is not too dark , you might want to try it with just the one step, without bleaching first,  to see if it works for you.    This hair color is the most beautiful and affective of all the blonde hair color I have ever used. It is a bargain as well.  Most don&#x27;t realize that you get the pre color protector, a nice size tube of both shampoo and conditioner that keeps your hair in super condition. Really, my hair feels in better condition after I color.    My hair is fine but very long. One box is enough for me to do all over color.  I still use one box for my roots alone though.    The price on Amazon , with shipping, is still less price  than the stores.</li>
            <li> This product is one of the best in the shade of light ash blonde...not yellowing...it&#x27;s like a young child&#x27;s blonde!  The conditioner and shampoo that come with it are wonderful.  The sad thing is they don&#x27;t make this product anymore...So after I deplete my supply, I&#x27;ll have to shop around for something different or maybe I&#x27;ll just quit coloring my hair!  That would be the easiest.  Anyway the product is just wonderful and the best (I&#x27;ve tried many, many products!)....I will miss it!</li>
            <li> I refuse to pay high prices at the salon when I&#x27;m capable of dying my own hair.  This hair dye is the best I&#x27;ve found.  Other products turned my hair to bronzy or orangey.  This one is great! And I get so many compliments from people! Definitely recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this hair dye. I have dark ash blonde hair and this is the first ash blonde color that truly ends up being light ash blonde on me. All the rest always give me a golden look even though they are labeled as ash or cool toned. It did not end up as light as the color on the front of the box (obviously since that depends on starting color) so now I feel more confident to try out the even lighter shades the Dream Blonde range has to offer.</li>
            <li> This kit was great and at great value, but the color was not perfect on me; I have med/darkish blonde hair that dies easely. I have not done at home die in a long time so I guess I just did not want to pick the lightest color, but I am pretty please with the overall color of my hair, though it does have more of a \\&quot;strawberry\\&quot; blonde tint to it than I thought it would, next time I will be ordering the #10 peony one considering it is half the price and I want a lighter color next time. Also, when ordering one box from balagio exports, it came in the mail so the box was a little smashed but no leakage.</li>
            <li> My hair was already light to begin with. I followed the instructions directly and my hair came out orange! It smelled horrible too. I&#x27;d leave dying hair to professionals.</li>
            <li> I was hopeful after reading other reviews that this would indeed give me a nice ash blonde color but, even with the addition of &amp;#34;red-out,&amp;#34; the results are still way too orangy/golden. My hair is naturally a dark ash blonde, but for whatever reason, coloring it always pulls out the red. Sadly I&#x27;ll have to keep looking for a color that will give me better results.</li>
            <li> I got highlights for the first time in years, and though I love being light blonde (my natural color is a dark, mousy blonde) I left the stylist $140 poorer with yellow hair. I managed to fix it, for the most part, with purple shampoo and Wella toner, but paying $50 to have that color renewed every 6 weeks was no bueno in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried light blonde box colors in the past, and they&#x27;ve always left my hair various shades of weird yellow, but this one actually gives me what it says: light ash blonde. I brushed it onto my roots, waited 20 minutes, then put it on the rest of my hair, then got caught up in a TV show for 30 minutes, then washed it out. It looks perfect. I may have to go one shade lighter next time, since my roots are still a bit darker than the rest of my hair, but the color blended with my highlights beautifully. I also love all of the little products it comes with to help maintain your hair&#x27;s health.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before; it is great hair color but is hard to find in stores any more -- so thanks to Champion Liquidators for the price and quick shipping</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sad to see that this isn&#x27;t in store anymore :(&lt;br /&gt;I had some pretty bad dark blonde/light brunette roots going on against my chemically lightened hair and was skeptical this was going to blend everything together and lighten my roots without being orange, but this did the trick. My roots blend in great with the rest of my hair (which I wasn&#x27;t expecting due to the contrast) and I was amazed at how soft my hair was especially since dying it lighter usually gives me straw-like locks. If you&#x27;re looking for something that isn&#x27;t damaging, this is the one to get.</li>
            <li> wish they still made this color, evened out my many colors and looks great! Will definetly try to buy more!</li>
            <li> Very impressed! Most hair colorants, even in salons, leave a reddish tint and/or damage my hair but this product gave a perfect result. No brassy, bluish, gray, or purple undertone that so many others have and no damage.</li>
            <li> This product and color is wonderful but this vendor is way too expensive compared to other vendors I have purchased it from before. The problem is that they are the only one who has this product and color in stock.</li>
            <li> I had colored my hair with another product (Ash brown and it came out RED).&lt;br /&gt;It seemed every over the counter product was lifting my hair red, including Sally Beauty supply line of color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews on this and gave it a try..  I finally have blonde highlights.  It made a beautiful ash blonde and didn&#x27;t dry out my hair.  It comes with a pre-treatment and be sure to use it. I think that makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can only find this product online.  The regular L&#x27;Oreal Superior Preference which is on the shelves in stores doesn&#x27;t do as well- still a great color but dries out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love love this.  Bought the next shade lighter to see if it will lift all the red out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;jacki</li>
            <li> i never try blonde hair so i&#x27;ll give it a go at it hope that it works well with good results</li>
            <li> I am yet another person grieving the demise of the Late/Great L&#x27;Oreal Dream Blonde line. Like many of you, my favorite color was the Light Ash Blonde (9A), and my experience with it was very similar to what many of you have described. I&#x27;ve been using it for years...and stocked up on it whenever I could, but, alas: there is no more. Obviously L&#x27;Oreal knows this was a very popular product...even when they were producing it, it FLEW of the store shelves (I once ended up convincing a store manager to \\&quot;special order\\&quot; a case for me! LOL) and I eventually turned to hunting online for it. L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s BEST haircolor: DISCONTINUED!!!! (Even now...when the last few boxes of Dream Blonde are appearing online for sale...the light ash blonde 9A is inordinately expensive compared to the others: another indicator of how popular it was, and how rare it is rapidly becoming). I had exactly the same experience in the late nineties/early 2000&#x27;s with another L&#x27;Oreal color: Feria 81 (Cool Ashy Blonde)...wonderful product...sold like \\&quot;hotcakes\\&quot;....great color result...and generous amount of product for my long hair....DISCONTINUED!!!! WHAT IN THE HECK IS WRONG WITH L&#x27;OREAL??!!! Habitually discontinuing their most popular products does not seem to be a good business plan to me! So now...I&#x27;m once again embarking on searching and researching for my next favorite ash blonde haircolor...not too dark...not too light...and not too brassy. Sigh :-( In anticipation of many adventures in haircoloring with new products...I&#x27;m going to stock up on that \\&quot;Brass Banisher\\&quot; stuff.  SO HERE&#x27;S AN IDEA:  Could you fellow fans of the \\&quot;Dream Blonde that is no more\\&quot; do me (\\&quot;us\\&quot;) a favor and let me (\\&quot;us\\&quot;) know if you find a product comparable to the Dream Blonde 9A (light ash blonde) or provide an update if you find another solution? Until then, I (like lots of us) will be wandering about in the wilderness of haircolor...mumbling to myself, \\&quot;WHAT THE HECK IS WRONG WITH THAT L&#x27;OREAL COMPANY??!!!\\&quot;. Regards, Chris (PS: Thanks in advance of any future replies!!)Thanks in advance of any future replies!!)</li>
            <li> I have been using Dream Blonde in this shade for a long time. I love it! I have been going gray/white, and this light ash blonde color blends so well with my roots, and looks so natural with color variances throughout. I wish it was not a discontinued product :-(</li>
            <li> Best hair dye...ever. Comes with great shampoo and conditioner. No green and no brass. LOVE this product. Will order again.</li>
            <li> I have dark blonde hair and used this product in attempt to lighten it up a bit. I didn&#x27;t get what I wanted--my hair became more of a dark golden color than ash blonde.&lt;br /&gt;I also received the package in awful condition. The middle was smashed and the corners were torn off with one of the tubes broken and leaking.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this product for several reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1) It came with PLENTY of dye. I have very long hair and I had enough to cover all of it with only the one bottle.&lt;br /&gt;2) Pre-conditioning treatment, after-color shampoo, after-color conditioner, and smoothing cream came with the dye package, and they all seemed high-quality.&lt;br /&gt;3) My hair was left feeling very soft -- hardly noticeable damage, if any, and my hair is extremely fine and fragile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint was that the dye didn&#x27;t blend with my roots very well. I naturally have medium brown hair, but have been dying it blonde for a few years now. Most dyes seem to lighten my uncolored roots as well as the colored blonde ends; however, this dye left a weird darkish stripe where my roots met my previously dyed hair. I was a little disappointed with that, but figure a toner will even it out. I didn&#x27;t notice any brassiness like other reviewers mentioned, and my hair normally does turn brassy/yellow-orangeish with most dyes that claim to be ashy. The color was pretty darn close to what was shown on the box, just a little darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Altogether, I was happy and plan on stocking up. I feel that since this product has been discontinued in stores, there may not be much left from this seller.</li>
