    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> we have used this soap for at least 5 years. It works on rashes, pimples any type of skin irritation. It lathers up quickly and each bar lasts 2-3 weeks of daily use.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell of these soaps and how it cleared up facial acne I had!  I am now addicted to them!!! Absolutely love the smell!! Oh wait I did already say that!!! :)</li>
            <li> My fiance LOVES this stuff.  He bought a bar at a farmers market and became addicted.  I purchase it now in large lots on Amazon, so he always has a stash.  I have read reviews where people say it smells too medicinal and I simply DO NOT understand this, but to each his own.  We believe the soap smells natural and clean.  The scent actually travels down the hall when either of us is in the shower, making the house smell as if it too has gotten a bath.  The smell does not linger on the skin though, so for all you guys out there, don&#x27;t worry.  :-)&lt;br /&gt;I should probably mention that my fiance purchased this out of desperation because he has some kind of skin sensitivity that the dermatologist is unable to diagnose.  Medimix is the only soap he has found that keeps his skin rash at bay.</li>
            <li> I use this soap regularly, and when I do not I use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful soap. I keep it as an occasional treat. I would use it all of the time, but it tends to dry out my skin with prolonged usage. It&#x27;s so refreshing in the summer time.</li>
            <li> This brand of Medimix soaps are really wonderful for your skin. This soap contains 18 herbs to heal your skin. Medimix has other selections of soaps which all work well and I use them all too. Awesome product. Take care and stay safe.</li>
            <li> To start with, the soap smells terrible. I bought it because I have sensitive skin and thought I won&#x27;t go wrong with with all natural herbal soap.  I was wrong! It is not a big investment so I am tossing it away.</li>
            <li> This herbal soap is wonderful. I love the smell and the silky way it makes my skin feel. If you are having any breakout problems this helps a lot. It can be a little drying so you don&#x27;t have to overuse. If you have been exposed to any buggy areas while gardening or plants that irritate you this soap works great on any inflammation. Love it and give it away to friends as gifts![[ASIN:B001G7PZAG Medimix Ayurvedic Herbal Soap with 18 Herbs 125g Unit  (Pack of 12)]]</li>
            <li> i will not use another soap ever again if i get the chance!!!!! Its healed scars, and keeps my skin nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!</li>

            <li> Great Amazon Seller. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I first learned about this soap traveling in India. So I was very  happy to be able to buy it on line at a reasonable price. This soap can be used on dry or oily skin, to shampoo hair, cleanse private parts, etc.  I has no animal products and smells good.</li>

            <li> So far so good! I love the smell and it works great for my entire body and face!</li>
            <li> The soap seems to be working more/less.Note,this package doesn&#x27;t have expiration date printed on the boxes as it normaly is with this particular soap.I contacted the retailer.They didn&#x27;t have satisfactory explanations why the date is not there.However,they assured me their stock is always fresh.And,they told me the soap is far from the expiration date.See it yourself if it&#x27;s OK with you.Also,the sticker on the pack says it&#x27;s  not for single box sale.I&#x27;d prefer they still print the expiration date.But,it is what it is.</li>
            <li> This soap is by far the best ones for acne.  Its all natural which makes it even better.  It cleans my face completely without drying it out.  It smells really good too.  Will buy again!</li>

            <li> this soap is very good for the overall health of your skin. i strongly recommend using a moisturizer with it because it does pull alot of toxins from the skin.. This soap does not contain a battery of synthetic crap. Concerning skin care we always have to nourish and moisturize most soaps that dont dry your shin out are also polluting it but it is our jobs to moisturize and this soap you will need to. the benefits far out weight this risk with this soap</li>
