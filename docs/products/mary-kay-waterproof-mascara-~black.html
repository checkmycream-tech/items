            <li>I will buy Mary Kay mascara again but not this exact kind.</li>
            <li>One of my absolute favorite waterproof mascaras!</li>
            <li>this is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>So this product seems to fit the bill for my purpose for me.</li>
            <li>It is super easy to put on and doesn&#x27;t clump.  </li>
            <li>So far I am very pleased with the product and recommend it..</li>
            <li>Mascara goes on clean, dries quickly, stays clean.  </li>

            <li>This mascara lengthen my lashes like no other, adds a ton of volume to my lashes and makes me feel like I&#x27;m wearing falsies.</li>
            <li>But as far as it staying on and lasting all day I give it a 5.</li>
            <li>Out of all the waterproof mascaras on the market, this one wins hands down!!  </li>
            <li>This must be a new formula, or else this was a really old, dried out tube.</li>
