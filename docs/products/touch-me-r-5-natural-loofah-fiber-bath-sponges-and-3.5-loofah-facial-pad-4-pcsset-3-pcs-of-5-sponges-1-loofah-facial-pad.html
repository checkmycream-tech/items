            <li>Love!</li>

            <li>These are replacement pads for those popular loofah brushes that slip off the handle (ad should express that).</li>
            <li>I liked it.</li>
            <li>The peppermint is particularly nice and invigorating in the morning shower and it&#x27;s soothing on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Also, great price and quick shipment.</li>
            <li>One of these sponges I got was HUGE, a good 7-8\\&quot; around.</li>
            <li>Too strong!</li>
            <li>Very cheap loofah.</li>
            <li>received quickly and was a good value.</li>
            <li>It is definitely one of the best products i have brought from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>love these.  </li>
            <li>I am so pleased with these.</li>
            <li>They have a good texture to them which allows good old skin removal when showering.  </li>
            <li>Does what it is supposed to do and is of top quality.</li>
            <li>We love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>like it better than the nylon.</li>
            <li>Ask your pharmacist as to which exfoliating cleanser would be best for you and DON&#x27;T perform this if you have a sunburn or open cuts.  </li>
            <li>If it wasn&#x27;t so cheap i would be pissed!</li>
            <li>hers is wayy better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>B001ET77YI Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps Pure-Castile Soap, 18-in-1 Hemp Peppermint, 32-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]] or [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>B001ET77P2 Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps Pure-Castile Soap,</li>
            <li>These natural fiber sponges are the perfect size because they fit well in my hand.  </li>
            <li>I love loofah sponges, they are the best thing for dry skin that needs exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice sturdy loofah made from a quality sponge and it&#x27;s a nice large size.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for the name, but I do for accurate advertisement. : )</li>
            <li>this is a great product, its worth it, I would recommend to anyone that is interested and wondering they should purchase</li>
            <li>After shower, i feel cleaner and more comfortable.</li>
            <li>I give it 2 stars because there were some debris inside, but it was easily removed.</li>
            <li>Takes a while to soften in the shower, but it is fine for me.</li>
            <li>Bath sponges are quite harsh on the skin, face pad is excellent</li>
            <li>they are a nice handful size so you can really grab them and scrub away, After using these for about 4 days</li>
            <li>they work great as a sponge.. still have 2 left to use. .</li>
            <li>great product for a low price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a simple product, but I&#x27;m completely happy with it.ut at this price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a simple product, but I&#x27;m completely happy with it.</li>
            <li>These are great and I can never seem to find them at my local store.</li>
            <li>They were incredibly smooth and conical and not what I expect from a loofah.</li>
            <li>These work just as good as loofahs and they are all natural.  </li>
            <li>So overall this is a very nice scrubber for exfoliation and surfacing ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>this is definitely worth buying!</li>
            <li>But at this price they are a very good deal (Less than $6 for three.)</li>
            <li>they are a very good deal (Less than $6 for three.)</li>
            <li>These are just right!</li>
            <li>I make sure I rinse them well after soaking and that seems to work very well for keeping them clean.  </li>
            <li>Probably only good for callus removal.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great but take some wearing down before they&#x27;re comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>These things are more suitable for scrubbing that stubborn dried up oatmeal out of your favorite cereal bowl.</li>
            <li>items were exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li>Moreover, the price is right and they arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>My wife uses them for her feet, but they are aren&#x27;t very good for the rest of your body and they are too hard so suds up with soap.</li>
            <li>Also, Gorilla glue works wonderfully to attach a new loofah to the old wooden handle.</li>
            <li>I was impressed with how soft and fluffy they are.</li>
            <li>I got all 3 sponges for so cheap, and they were the real deal..</li>
            <li>This product works great to scrub off all the dead skin when your feet knees and elbows.</li>
            <li>I have 11 words to write--now five; hoe exciting, my friends.</li>
            <li>because I want to smell like my own body wash, not some gross chemicals.</li>
            <li>Natural Loofahs are far superior to the plastic mesh found in the stores.</li>
            <li>But what I like about them is that they&#x27;re naturally kind of scratchy and do a great job of exfoliating dry and flaky skin and leaving the soft new skin cells which naturally look brighter and feel really smooth.  </li>
            <li>For some people looking for ones with a rope: it is easy to add your own, just punch a hole through the side about an inch down with a knife or screwdriver, then add rope.</li>
            <li>I can always tell when I need to do a loofah scrub because my skin feels kind of dry and has a certain fine roughness to it.</li>
            <li>They are just about the right size.  </li>
            <li>and this slides right onto it...</li>
            <li>but as soon as they get wet they soften up and are pretty good scrubbing tool.</li>
            <li>Much finer-grained than the last loofahs I got under this item page, and I think I prefer the coarser kind.</li>
            <li>the prices is very reasonable</li>
            <li>I soak them first in hot water to make them softer, so they aren&#x27;t too scratchy, and when they soften up they also work for the face.  </li>
            <li>I use these to replace the loofah on the stick and pad of the Loofah back scrubber so many years ago.</li>
            <li>this is my first experience with these natural loofahs, and their alright.&lt;br /&gt;i always used those round cheap ones and they were good too.&lt;br /&gt;all</li>
            <li>Each loofah is individually wrapped, so that spares can be safely stored until a replacement is needed.  </li>
            <li>I am glad to have found an inexpensive online alternative to what 1 would have cost me at a local store!</li>
            <li>It feels good if I&#x27;ve been out working and have a lot of sweat and grime, but I swear that even after that I feel like I&#x27;ve lost a few layers of skin.</li>
            <li>The fibers wear down and they feel more smooth than scratchy.  </li>
            <li>so I can do a pretty good job of scrubbing over the same areas several times.  </li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s pediatrician recommended a loofah for my daughter&#x27;s skin and so I bought these, when I first got them I was surprised at how small they were but with a little water the perked right up and fit right in your palm, perfect size and texture.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing like a loofah sponge to make your skin feel clean and alive when you shower.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I really ended up liking Big Bear Bath Products Loofah better and have since switched.  </li>
            <li>It is well worth the price, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>When I buy a natural loofah I do expect more texture and give such that they actually absorb moisture and have more texture to exfoliate.</li>
            <li>I believe it is pretty useful to soft my skin in winter.</li>
            <li>like the fact thy come as a 3 pack,these are strong and last for awhile.</li>
            <li>These natural sponges work great and last a long time.</li>
            <li>However, this is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>and he really likes these.</li>
            <li>These never softened enough to feel comfortable on my skin.  </li>
            <li>It also does not retain soap very well, or suds up.</li>
            <li>and there isn&#x27;t really a need to use it that often.</li>
            <li>&quot; length sponges but much to my surprise</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t soften up much at all in the water.</li>
            <li>I got to have my loofah in the shower, it&#x27;s so gentle on your skin</li>
            <li>eventually they will become soft, but if you wish to exfoliate your skin the right way this is it.</li>
            <li>B0072EXF8G Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s Clean Day Liquid Hand Soap, Rhubarb, 12.5 Fluid Ounce (Pack of 2)]] or [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I HAVE USED LOOFAHS IN THE PAST AND NEVER HAD THAT KIND OF EXPERIENCE.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>IT IS MUCH TOO HARD AND DOESN&#x27;T SOFTEN EVEN AFTER LEAVING IT IN WARM WATER FOR A WHILE.  </li>
            <li>I would not recommend this particular loofah to anyone.</li>
            <li>This a very natural scrubber, no so rough but strong enough to feel a really clean skin and</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>They are not too hard and scratchy so that is nice.</li>
            <li>A little rough, but good for exfoliating.</li>
            <li>It looks like new.</li>
            <li>They came in a  3 pack, so we have a new one for each bathroom.</li>
            <li>The Latin Products Loofah is more rigid, harder (I&#x27;m assuming this would be Chinese Loofah) and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for exfoliating the body, but when it comes to absorbing soap and creating a suds-y lather it fails.</li>
            <li>rex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s possible that you don&#x27;t mind sanding the first four layers of your skin off while bathing</li>
            <li>I have used these sponges in times past, and am always glad I did.</li>
            <li>They are what they are, when you, or someone you know needs gentle exfoliation, it&#x27;s the only decent way to go.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m certain that these will do very well for me for a ver long time.</li>
            <li>I was excited about the natural fiber and exfoliating properties of the loofah; however, I have been frustrated with how much liquid soap is needed to actually get a good lather in the shower.</li>
            <li>Pieces were large, evenly shaped and texture is firm but with a fine mesh quality, not as coarse as some I&#x27;ve had before.</li>
            <li>MIght be too large for some people as I have used smaller loofah sponges before.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s average loofa sponges, nothing special.</li>
            <li>I have been using the natural loofah for about 2 weeks</li>
            <li>Nothing natural about it</li>
            <li>Works really well on all those spots that you just don&#x27;t want to put that luggy back brush.</li>
            <li>A natural loofah sponge comes from the Ocean or a farm, not from a factory in china, so not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Over time the natural loofah degrades and has to be replaced.</li>
            <li>I use this instead of a wash cloth, it leaves my skin so soft and refresh everyone should have one</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a natural loofah fiber bath sponge for over a year.</li>
            <li>All natural.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really need it as much, only from time to time, but for the price, why not buy it.</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t too sensitive</li>
            <li>Since they are a natural product</li>
            <li>It really worth to buy, and the actual thing is much bigger than I thought.</li>
            <li>Using them every day would probably be kind of irritating on my skin</li>
            <li>The Fibers are flat and compressed so much that the loofah just slides over skin.</li>
            <li>The other 2 were the right size though.</li>
            <li>They plump up after they get wet the first time.  </li>
            <li>The Loofah´s are smaller than what I am accustomed to, but maybe you don´t really need a big hunk.</li>
            <li>People saying these are hard maybe aren&#x27;t as familiar with natural loofah.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if they make good bath sponges because they are fairly hard, but my gerbils seemed to like them.</li>
            <li>these have been used daily in my shower and cleaned frequently and haven&#x27;t had one mold yet</li>
            <li>stiff and hard,  good for a back scrub if you put it on a stick.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this, clean you dead skin and remember this is not very soft...</li>
            <li>Overall, these were exactly what I expected from the listing!</li>
            <li>Years ago I bought a relatively expensive back scrubbing Loofah with a nice long handle.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> love these.  </li>
            <li> I am so pleased with these.</li>
            <li> They have a good texture to them which allows good old skin removal when showering.  </li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do and is of top quality.</li>
            <li> We love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> like it better than the nylon.</li>
            <li> Ask your pharmacist as to which exfoliating cleanser would be best for you and DON&#x27;T perform this if you have a sunburn or open cuts.  </li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t so cheap i would be pissed!</li>
            <li> hers is wayy better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> B001ET77YI Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps Pure-Castile Soap, 18-in-1 Hemp Peppermint, 32-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]] or [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> B001ET77P2 Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps Pure-Castile Soap,</li>
            <li> These natural fiber sponges are the perfect size because they fit well in my hand.  </li>
            <li> I love loofah sponges, they are the best thing for dry skin that needs exfoliating.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice sturdy loofah made from a quality sponge and it&#x27;s a nice large size.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the name, but I do for accurate advertisement. : )</li>
            <li> this is a great product, its worth it, I would recommend to anyone that is interested and wondering they should purchase</li>
            <li> After shower, i feel cleaner and more comfortable.</li>
            <li> I give it 2 stars because there were some debris inside, but it was easily removed.</li>
            <li> Takes a while to soften in the shower, but it is fine for me.</li>
            <li> Bath sponges are quite harsh on the skin, face pad is excellent</li>
            <li> they are a nice handful size so you can really grab them and scrub away, After using these for about 4 days</li>
            <li> they work great as a sponge.. still have 2 left to use. .</li>
            <li> great product for a low price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a simple product, but I&#x27;m completely happy with it.ut at this price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a simple product, but I&#x27;m completely happy with it.</li>
            <li> These are great and I can never seem to find them at my local store.</li>
            <li> They were incredibly smooth and conical and not what I expect from a loofah.</li>
            <li> These work just as good as loofahs and they are all natural.  </li>
            <li> So overall this is a very nice scrubber for exfoliation and surfacing ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> this is definitely worth buying!</li>
            <li> But at this price they are a very good deal (Less than $6 for three.)</li>
            <li> they are a very good deal (Less than $6 for three.)</li>
            <li> These are just right!</li>
            <li> I make sure I rinse them well after soaking and that seems to work very well for keeping them clean.  </li>
            <li> Probably only good for callus removal.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great but take some wearing down before they&#x27;re comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> These things are more suitable for scrubbing that stubborn dried up oatmeal out of your favorite cereal bowl.</li>
            <li> items were exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li> Moreover, the price is right and they arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> My wife uses them for her feet, but they are aren&#x27;t very good for the rest of your body and they are too hard so suds up with soap.</li>
            <li> Also, Gorilla glue works wonderfully to attach a new loofah to the old wooden handle.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with how soft and fluffy they are.</li>
            <li> I got all 3 sponges for so cheap, and they were the real deal..</li>
            <li> This product works great to scrub off all the dead skin when your feet knees and elbows.</li>
            <li> I have 11 words to write--now five; hoe exciting, my friends.</li>
            <li> because I want to smell like my own body wash, not some gross chemicals.</li>
            <li> Natural Loofahs are far superior to the plastic mesh found in the stores.</li>
            <li> But what I like about them is that they&#x27;re naturally kind of scratchy and do a great job of exfoliating dry and flaky skin and leaving the soft new skin cells which naturally look brighter and feel really smooth.  </li>
            <li> For some people looking for ones with a rope: it is easy to add your own, just punch a hole through the side about an inch down with a knife or screwdriver, then add rope.</li>
            <li> I can always tell when I need to do a loofah scrub because my skin feels kind of dry and has a certain fine roughness to it.</li>
            <li> They are just about the right size.  </li>
            <li> and this slides right onto it...</li>
            <li> but as soon as they get wet they soften up and are pretty good scrubbing tool.</li>
            <li> Much finer-grained than the last loofahs I got under this item page, and I think I prefer the coarser kind.</li>
            <li> the prices is very reasonable</li>
            <li> I soak them first in hot water to make them softer, so they aren&#x27;t too scratchy, and when they soften up they also work for the face.  </li>
            <li> I use these to replace the loofah on the stick and pad of the Loofah back scrubber so many years ago.</li>
            <li> this is my first experience with these natural loofahs, and their alright.&lt;br /&gt;i always used those round cheap ones and they were good too.&lt;br /&gt;all</li>
            <li> Each loofah is individually wrapped, so that spares can be safely stored until a replacement is needed.  </li>
            <li> I am glad to have found an inexpensive online alternative to what 1 would have cost me at a local store!</li>
            <li> It feels good if I&#x27;ve been out working and have a lot of sweat and grime, but I swear that even after that I feel like I&#x27;ve lost a few layers of skin.</li>
            <li> The fibers wear down and they feel more smooth than scratchy.  </li>
            <li> so I can do a pretty good job of scrubbing over the same areas several times.  </li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s pediatrician recommended a loofah for my daughter&#x27;s skin and so I bought these, when I first got them I was surprised at how small they were but with a little water the perked right up and fit right in your palm, perfect size and texture.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing like a loofah sponge to make your skin feel clean and alive when you shower.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I really ended up liking Big Bear Bath Products Loofah better and have since switched.  </li>
            <li> It is well worth the price, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> When I buy a natural loofah I do expect more texture and give such that they actually absorb moisture and have more texture to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> I believe it is pretty useful to soft my skin in winter.</li>
            <li> like the fact thy come as a 3 pack,these are strong and last for awhile.</li>
            <li> These natural sponges work great and last a long time.</li>
            <li> However, this is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> and he really likes these.</li>
            <li> These never softened enough to feel comfortable on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It also does not retain soap very well, or suds up.</li>
            <li> and there isn&#x27;t really a need to use it that often.</li>
            <li> &quot; length sponges but much to my surprise</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t soften up much at all in the water.</li>
            <li> I got to have my loofah in the shower, it&#x27;s so gentle on your skin</li>
            <li> eventually they will become soft, but if you wish to exfoliate your skin the right way this is it.</li>
            <li> B0072EXF8G Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s Clean Day Liquid Hand Soap, Rhubarb, 12.5 Fluid Ounce (Pack of 2)]] or [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED LOOFAHS IN THE PAST AND NEVER HAD THAT KIND OF EXPERIENCE.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> IT IS MUCH TOO HARD AND DOESN&#x27;T SOFTEN EVEN AFTER LEAVING IT IN WARM WATER FOR A WHILE.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend this particular loofah to anyone.</li>
            <li> This a very natural scrubber, no so rough but strong enough to feel a really clean skin and</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> They are not too hard and scratchy so that is nice.</li>
            <li> A little rough, but good for exfoliating.</li>
            <li> It looks like new.</li>
            <li> They came in a  3 pack, so we have a new one for each bathroom.</li>
            <li> The Latin Products Loofah is more rigid, harder (I&#x27;m assuming this would be Chinese Loofah) and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for exfoliating the body, but when it comes to absorbing soap and creating a suds-y lather it fails.</li>
            <li> rex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s possible that you don&#x27;t mind sanding the first four layers of your skin off while bathing</li>
            <li> I have used these sponges in times past, and am always glad I did.</li>
            <li> They are what they are, when you, or someone you know needs gentle exfoliation, it&#x27;s the only decent way to go.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m certain that these will do very well for me for a ver long time.</li>
            <li> I was excited about the natural fiber and exfoliating properties of the loofah; however, I have been frustrated with how much liquid soap is needed to actually get a good lather in the shower.</li>
            <li> Pieces were large, evenly shaped and texture is firm but with a fine mesh quality, not as coarse as some I&#x27;ve had before.</li>
            <li> MIght be too large for some people as I have used smaller loofah sponges before.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s average loofa sponges, nothing special.</li>
            <li> I have been using the natural loofah for about 2 weeks</li>
            <li> Nothing natural about it</li>
            <li> Works really well on all those spots that you just don&#x27;t want to put that luggy back brush.</li>
            <li> A natural loofah sponge comes from the Ocean or a farm, not from a factory in china, so not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Over time the natural loofah degrades and has to be replaced.</li>
            <li> I use this instead of a wash cloth, it leaves my skin so soft and refresh everyone should have one</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a natural loofah fiber bath sponge for over a year.</li>
            <li> All natural.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really need it as much, only from time to time, but for the price, why not buy it.</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t too sensitive</li>
            <li> Since they are a natural product</li>
            <li> It really worth to buy, and the actual thing is much bigger than I thought.</li>
            <li> Using them every day would probably be kind of irritating on my skin</li>
            <li> The Fibers are flat and compressed so much that the loofah just slides over skin.</li>
            <li> The other 2 were the right size though.</li>
            <li> They plump up after they get wet the first time.  </li>
            <li> The Loofah´s are smaller than what I am accustomed to, but maybe you don´t really need a big hunk.</li>
            <li> People saying these are hard maybe aren&#x27;t as familiar with natural loofah.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if they make good bath sponges because they are fairly hard, but my gerbils seemed to like them.</li>
            <li> these have been used daily in my shower and cleaned frequently and haven&#x27;t had one mold yet</li>
            <li> stiff and hard,  good for a back scrub if you put it on a stick.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this, clean you dead skin and remember this is not very soft...</li>
            <li> Overall, these were exactly what I expected from the listing!</li>
            <li> Years ago I bought a relatively expensive back scrubbing Loofah with a nice long handle.</li>
            <li> I love Loofah sponges but this order was a major disappointment.  </li>
            <li> Not for someone sensitive they are very rough</li>
            <li> A couple of weeks ago I cut off the old Loofah and sanded down and applied polyurethane to the handle and wooden pad the loofah is glued to.</li>
            <li> Should last a long time.</li>
            <li> Yes, the loofah is stiff and scratchy when dry, but it hydrates quickly and stays a little rough when wet, without being abrasive even for sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li> Really gets dead skin and dirt off skin, but be careful not to hurt your skin and scrub too much and too hard.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t very spongy at all its just overall pretty unpleasant.</li>
            <li> However, the ones I received were indeed 5&amp;#34; long (2.5-3&amp;#34</li>
            <li> l.7\\&quot; long each.  </li>
            <li> This item is not natural as stated in the listed but is manufactured.</li>
            <li> I finally tried cutting them in half and that seems better, but I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin not sure if  is the product for you.</li>
            <li> They eventually loose their \\&quot;scratch\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Loofahs are firm and should last a long time.  </li>
            <li> These are some really neat little Loofah sponges, I usually purchase one on a stick for a back brush, but have never used these little ones,</li>
            <li> The natural fibers in these sponges feels hard when dry, but they soften up some in the shower or tub after they&#x27;ve been wet for a while.  </li>
            <li> we like loofa&#x27;s, and these are a little smaller than the ones we&#x27;ve seen before.  </li>
            <li> Extra firm.</li>
            <li> I use a loofah every day and this isn&#x27;t what I expected or wanted but will give them a try.</li>
            <li> These loofahs are not what I expected.</li>
            <li> ; wide), so perhaps that review was for another product.  </li>
            <li> not flexible like I expected.</li>
            <li> I bought these, hoping that they would soften just a bit...but even after soaking for almost 2 weeks straight,these loofah sponges are still too bristly and rough.</li>
            <li> In the past when they are this hard they never soften up as much as I would like.</li>
            <li> I have also used the other fiber sponges from the store, but they have dye on them and don&#x27;t want to use dye on my face and</li>
            <li> (so the other two are still in the packaging).  </li>
            <li> I have used other oofahs  that exfoliated but did not flay my skin.</li>
            <li> Very rough on the skin.</li>
            <li> rid of dry or dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They were very very firm and actually shaved down or sanded or something.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s VERY hard and softens up only a little bit after daily.</li>
            <li> too big, hard to grib.</li>
            <li> for half an hour or so every so often.  </li>
            <li> not too stiff, or rough, but still does the trick!  </li>
            <li> Not a single complaint!</li>
            <li> Not good quality either as they break apart into tiny specs while in use.</li>
            <li> A little change in pace...</li>
            <li> Also, for men using this product, your little body hairs get caught in all of the pores of the sponge.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use a little bit of liquid or bar soap that helps to soften the loofah sponge.  </li>
            <li> I soak them in a little</li>
            <li> They feel really hard before you get them wet</li>
            <li> My wife didn&#x27;t like these at all, as they are stiff and hard to the touch, not fun to shower with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This thing is HARSH!</li>
            <li> THEY SEEM  VERY STIFF AND SCRATCHY</li>
            <li> Even after soaking for 2 weeks it stayed as hard as a brick.</li>
            <li> THAT MAKES IT QUITE UNYIELDY AND HARD TO MANIPULATE.</li>
            <li> its too hard on skin..</li>
            <li> too hard for my face and too small and inflexible for showering.  </li>
            <li> I found them to be very hard and very stiff.  </li>
            <li> There is a gross weird chemical smell all over these, I&#x27;m not impressed with that</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very hard, and hurt your skin.</li>
            <li> These loofahs are very hard.</li>
            <li> Not happy when I get a crappy product from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m cutting my skin, that&#x27;s how harsh these loofah sponges are.</li>
            <li> Was not impressed.  </li>
            <li> IT.&lt;br /&gt;:(</li>
            <li> Hate that i ordered it.</li>
            <li> Horrible product.</li>
            <li> Terrible product.</li>
            <li> one of the worst things i ordered on Amazon.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> They&#x27;re great but take some wearing down before they&#x27;re comfortable to use.  Extra firm.</li>
            <li> I love loofah sponges, they are the best thing for dry skin that needs exfoliating.  I soak them first in hot water to make them softer, so they aren&#x27;t too scratchy, and when they soften up they also work for the face.  Better than a sponge for cleaning your parts!  lol</li>
            <li> i really liked these loofahs!  not too stiff, or rough, but still does the trick!  i was a bit bummed at the shipping cost, but still quite happy with the product!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the product.  Just as importantly, I received excellent customer service regarding uniformity of size.  I would definitely purchase from Big Bear Bath again.</li>
            <li> I have been using the natural loofah for about 2 weeks and i am already seeing results. It is definitely one of the best products i have brought from Amazon. I&#x27;m not quite sure why we can&#x27;t find the same quality in stores like walmart and target. However, this is the real deal. I also brought the one for the back with the strap...um...LOVE IT! this is definitely worth buying!</li>
            <li> Bath sponges are quite harsh on the skin, face pad is excellent</li>
            <li> Really gets dead skin and dirt off skin, but be careful not to hurt your skin and scrub too much and too hard.</li>
            <li> The loofas are a great value and the perfect size. I was impressed with how soft and fluffy they are. I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> People saying these are hard maybe aren&#x27;t as familiar with natural loofah. These are just right! I use them to pour handmade soap into to create a loofah/soap scrubbie. They are a great product!</li>
            <li> Not for someone sensitive they are very rough eventually they will become soft, but if you wish to exfoliate your skin the right way this is it.</li>
            <li> Horrible product. Very cheap loofah. Nothing natural about it</li>
            <li> I used these to make loofah/soap scrubbies for Christmas presents.  Everyone loved them.  It was a great value and I was very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Terrible product. Even after soaking for 2 weeks it stayed as hard as a brick.</li>
            <li> These are some really neat little Loofah sponges, I usually purchase one on a stick for a back brush, but have never used these little ones, didn&#x27;t know they were around, go figure! Works really well on all those spots that you just don&#x27;t want to put that luggy back brush.</li>
            <li> One of these sponges I got was HUGE, a good 7-8\\&quot; around. The other 2 were the right size though. Maybe I can use the oversized one as a scrubbing mop or something.</li>
            <li> I ordered and received products from two different suppliers on accident.  The Latin Products Loofah is more rigid, harder (I&#x27;m assuming this would be Chinese Loofah) and the Big Bear Bath Products Loofah was fluffier (I guess that is what you would call it) and of a different texture than what I was used to.  (They are calling it Mayan Loofah)  Anyway, I really ended up liking Big Bear Bath Products Loofah better and have since switched.  It seems like they actually process their loofah rather than just ordering it from China, marking it up and re-shipping it.  They also carry both types of loofah and note which you are buying per listing.  Bottom line... pay attention to what you are buying and from whom, all loofah is not the same.</li>
            <li> I use a loofah every day and this isn&#x27;t what I expected or wanted but will give them a try. In the past when they are this hard they never soften up as much as I would like.</li>
            <li> A natural loofah sponge comes from the Ocean or a farm, not from a factory in china, so not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> The Loofah´s are smaller than what I am accustomed to, but maybe you don´t really need a big hunk. I still have not  tried them, hence I withhold the 5th star.</li>
            <li> love these.  look good and work great.  They plump up after they get wet the first time.  make my bath feel like a spa</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with these. Some Loofahs are so soft and mushy after getting wet. These are great size, don&#x27;t lose their shape and efficientcy over time, or with water.</li>
            <li> IT IS MUCH TOO HARD AND DOESN&#x27;T SOFTEN EVEN AFTER LEAVING IT IN WARM WATER FOR A WHILE.  THAT MAKES IT QUITE UNYIELDY AND HARD TO MANIPULATE. I HAVE USED LOOFAHS IN THE PAST AND NEVER HAD THAT KIND OF EXPERIENCE.&lt;br /&gt;I WOULDN&#x27;T RECOMMEND IT.&lt;br /&gt;:(</li>
            <li> Years ago I bought a relatively expensive back scrubbing Loofah with a nice long handle. Over time the natural loofah degrades and has to be replaced. I use these to replace the loofah on the stick and pad of the Loofah back scrubber so many years ago. A couple of weeks ago I cut off the old Loofah and sanded down and applied polyurethane to the handle and wooden pad the loofah is glued to. It looks like new. Also, Gorilla glue works wonderfully to attach a new loofah to the old wooden handle. What can I say. I like to conserve and save money.</li>
            <li> This thing is HARSH! I was looking for an alternative to my loofah. A little change in pace...however...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If a bath sponge and steel wool had a baby...this might be the product. These things are more suitable for scrubbing that stubborn dried up oatmeal out of your favorite cereal bowl. They might be great if you happen to be a rhinoceros, an alligator or a tyrannosaurus rex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s possible that you don&#x27;t mind sanding the first four layers of your skin off while bathing and that&#x27;s your own business. If that is the case then these babies are for you.</li>
            <li> I use this instead of a wash cloth, it leaves my skin so soft and refresh everyone should have one</li>
            <li> I have used these sponges in times past, and am always glad I did. Good job. I will no doubt return and renew my supplies soon . Thanks</li>
            <li> Good product. received quickly and was a good value.</li>
            <li> These work just as good as loofahs and they are all natural.  They are just about the right size.  They have a good texture to them which allows good old skin removal when showering.  They don&#x27;t hold water that well as regular sponges and loofahs do though.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> these are excellent .i like the fact thy come as a 3 pack,these are strong and last for awhile.Greattt deal.</li>
            <li> we like loofa&#x27;s, and these are a little smaller than the ones we&#x27;ve seen before.  They came in a  3 pack, so we have a new one for each bathroom.</li>
            <li> this is a great product, its worth it, I would recommend to anyone that is interested and wondering they should purchase</li>
            <li> this is my first experience with these natural loofahs, and their alright.&lt;br /&gt;i always used those round cheap ones and they were good too.&lt;br /&gt;all in all, i would probably buy again.</li>
            <li> Convenient size.&lt;br /&gt;Gets rid of dry or dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it and by the time I thought of it again, it was on my doorstep.</li>
            <li> Great! Does what it is supposed to do and is of top quality. Should last a long time. Also, great price and quick shipment.</li>
            <li> They are extremely good quality loofahs of 5\\&quot; each so I am very happy with it. I will definitely place an order again</li>
            <li> These loofahs are not what I expected. They&#x27;re very hard, and hurt your skin. Its almost like scrubbing your skin with a brillo pad. They aren&#x27;t very spongy at all its just overall pretty unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Great if hand held. Not so great attached to a stick.</li>
            <li> Not what I was hoping for.  Loofahs are firm and should last a long time.  I was looking for a somewhat softer loofah.  I&#x27;m certain that these will do very well for me for a ver long time.</li>
            <li> Not happy when I get a crappy product from Amazon. These are replacement pads for those popular loofah brushes that slip off the handle (ad should express that). They are not loofahs that you can hold in your hand. I had to cut mine open just to try to have some type of grip to use it. Water does not seem to penetrate it either to make it softer. The Fibers are flat and compressed so much that the loofah just slides over skin. It does not exfoliate.So I will donate the others to charity and never buy from this company again.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s to review, it&#x27;s just ripe loofah/gourd.  I&#x27;ve started using two and there&#x27;s some variation in abrasiveness, it&#x27;s expected from a natural product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking away one star because the packaging didn&#x27;t have the Touch Me brand name. I don&#x27;t care for the name, but I do for accurate advertisement. : )</li>
            <li> Bought as gift. Still wrapped awaiting St Nick&#x27;s arrival. I have 11 words to write--now five; hoe exciting, my friends.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a natural loofah fiber bath sponge for over a year. I decided to check amazon and found it. We love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We like it better than the nylon. We do not feel nylon mesh gets the job done that we expect. I have also used the other fiber sponges from the store, but they have dye on them and don&#x27;t want to use dye on my face and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought three loofah&#x27;s. They will last quite a while, but I hope that you will keep them on hand for my next purchase.</li>
            <li> What can you say about Loofah Sponges?  They are what they are, when you, or someone you know needs gentle exfoliation, it&#x27;s the only decent way to go.  Ask your pharmacist as to which exfoliating cleanser would be best for you and DON&#x27;T perform this if you have a sunburn or open cuts.  The key word is &amp;#34;gentle.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> These loofahs are just what I was looking for.  Moreover, the price is right and they arrived quickly.  Each loofah is individually wrapped, so that spares can be safely stored until a replacement is needed.  Yes, the loofah is stiff and scratchy when dry, but it hydrates quickly and stays a little rough when wet, without being abrasive even for sensitive areas.  One reviewer said that the loofahs were shorter than advertised. However, the ones I received were indeed 5&amp;#34; long (2.5-3&amp;#34; wide), so perhaps that review was for another product.  Overall, these were exactly what I expected from the listing!</li>
            <li> items were exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li> There is a gross weird chemical smell all over these, I&#x27;m not impressed with that because I want to smell like my own body wash, not some gross chemicals.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for exfoliating the body, but when it comes to absorbing soap and creating a suds-y lather it fails. It&#x27;s VERY hard and softens up only a little bit after daily. Also, for men using this product, your little body hairs get caught in all of the pores of the sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the three, one was very soft, created the perfect lather and was perfect for washing. If they all were like that it&#x27;d be a great product.</li>
            <li> I use these to exfoliate in the shower after i Epilate. These work awesome they are a nice handful size so you can really grab them and scrub away, After using these for about 4 days i have noticed that ingrown hairs are surfacing and i am to use my Epilator on them. So overall this is a very nice scrubber for exfoliation and surfacing ingrown hairs. I would recommend this Loofah.</li>
            <li> a great deal for 3 loofah. Pieces were large, evenly shaped and texture is firm but with a fine mesh quality, not as coarse as some I&#x27;ve had before. Takes a while to soften in the shower, but it is fine for me. Not a lot of seeds left inside. For some people looking for ones with a rope: it is easy to add your own, just punch a hole through the side about an inch down with a knife or screwdriver, then add rope.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for loofahs for a while in local shops, but found nothing. These are excellent quality and a perfect size. Not a single complaint!</li>
            <li> not flexible like I expected. stiff and hard,  good for a back scrub if you put it on a stick.  too hard for my face and too small and inflexible for showering.  real good for scrubbing hands and fingernails</li>
            <li> All natural. I liked it.</li>
            <li> these have been used daily in my shower and cleaned frequently and haven&#x27;t had one mold yet (so the other two are still in the packaging).  Great deal and great product.  They stand up to teenage use.  To reach the back we bought a wooden loofah stick thing (here on Amazon of course) and this slides right onto it... great deal!</li>
            <li> bought this sometime ago..  they work great as a sponge.. still have 2 left to use. . great product for a low price</li>
            <li> THEY SEEM  VERY STIFF AND SCRATCHY</li>
            <li> These are way too coarse.  My wife uses them for her feet, but they are aren&#x27;t very good for the rest of your body and they are too hard so suds up with soap.</li>
            <li> A little rough, but good for exfoliating.</li>
            <li> Love! Love! Love!!! These are sooooo good!! I will reorder!</li>
            <li> My mum suggested me to buy it. I believe it is pretty useful to soft my skin in winter. After shower, i feel cleaner and more comfortable.</li>
            <li> My husband likes these types of things.... and he really likes these. They are not too hard and scratchy so that is nice. I put them in the washer too.</li>
            <li> Was not impressed.  These never softened enough to feel comfortable on my skin.  I have used other oofahs  that exfoliated but did not flay my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect item for the needed application. I couldn&#x27;t find it any place. It is well worth the price, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice sturdy loofah made from a quality sponge and it&#x27;s a nice large size. The one drawback is it doesn&#x27;t come with a rope string to hang it.</li>
            <li> I found them to be very hard and very stiff.  I wanted to use them for a soaf craft project, but I will have to remove the middle.</li>
            <li> Good sponge.  MIght be too large for some people as I have used smaller loofah sponges before.  Does a great sponge of massaging the skin.</li>
            <li> I got all 3 sponges for so cheap, and they were the real deal.. I am glad to have found an inexpensive online alternative to what 1 would have cost me at a local store!</li>
            <li> My wife didn&#x27;t like these at all, as they are stiff and hard to the touch, not fun to shower with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They seem to be excellent for cleaning Teflon-covered pans, gets them clean without removing the coating.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really need it as much, only from time to time, but for the price, why not buy it. have not yet had a chance to use it</li>
            <li> I bought these for a friend&#x27;s wedding shower and she loved them, kept one for myself and bought more!</li>
            <li> Too strong! too big, hard to grib. If it wasn&#x27;t so cheap i would be pissed! one of the worst things i ordered on Amazon. I wish i could return. does not Absorb soap well. its too hard on skin..Hate that i ordered it. Go to tkoskin.com to order her loofah. hers is wayy better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. Loofah is loofah.</li>
            <li> This a very natural scrubber, no so rough but strong enough to feel a really clean skin and the prices is very reasonable</li>
            <li> I bought these, hoping that they would soften just a bit...but even after soaking for almost 2 weeks straight,these loofah sponges are still too bristly and rough. It feels good if I&#x27;ve been out working and have a lot of sweat and grime, but I swear that even after that I feel like I&#x27;ve lost a few layers of skin. It also does not retain soap very well, or suds up.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing like a loofah sponge to make your skin feel clean and alive when you shower. The natural fibers in these sponges feels hard when dry, but they soften up some in the shower or tub after they&#x27;ve been wet for a while.  But what I like about them is that they&#x27;re naturally kind of scratchy and do a great job of exfoliating dry and flaky skin and leaving the soft new skin cells which naturally look brighter and feel really smooth.  I can always tell when I need to do a loofah scrub because my skin feels kind of dry and has a certain fine roughness to it. My skin isn&#x27;t too sensitive so I can do a pretty good job of scrubbing over the same areas several times.  I use a little bit of liquid or bar soap that helps to soften the loofah sponge.  A couple of my favorites are [[ASIN:B0072EXF8G Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s Clean Day Liquid Hand Soap, Rhubarb, 12.5 Fluid Ounce (Pack of 2)]] or [[ASIN:B001ET77YI Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps Pure-Castile Soap, 18-in-1 Hemp Peppermint, 32-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]] or [[ASIN:B001ET77P2 Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps Pure-Castile Soap, All-One Hemp Tea Tree, 5-Ounce Bars (Pack of 6)]].  The peppermint is particularly nice and invigorating in the morning shower and it&#x27;s soothing on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the loofah sponge every third or forth day.  Using them every day would probably be kind of irritating on my skin and there isn&#x27;t really a need to use it that often. These natural fiber sponges are the perfect size because they fit well in my hand.  They last for several months.  I soak them in a little [[ASIN:B001LRC4XC Oxy-Boost Oxygen Bleach 2.5 lb]] for half an hour or so every so often.  Since they are a natural product and I leave them in the shower where the air is moist, they can develop mold. I make sure I rinse them well after soaking and that seems to work very well for keeping them clean.  They eventually loose their \\&quot;scratch\\&quot;.  The fibers wear down and they feel more smooth than scratchy.  That&#x27;s when I need to replace them.  But at this price they are a very good deal (Less than $6 for three.) It&#x27;s a simple product, but I&#x27;m completely happy with it.ut at this price they are a very good deal (Less than $6 for three.) It&#x27;s a simple product, but I&#x27;m completely happy with it.</li>
            <li> These loofahs are very hard. I finally tried cutting them in half and that seems better, but I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Much finer-grained than the last loofahs I got under this item page, and I think I prefer the coarser kind.</li>
            <li> I actually got these loofahs as chew toys for my gerbils. They loved them! I&#x27;m not sure if they make good bath sponges because they are fairly hard, but my gerbils seemed to like them.</li>
            <li> I love Loofah sponges but this order was a major disappointment.  I thought I was getting 5\\&quot; length sponges but much to my surprise what I got was 3 pieces of l.7\\&quot; long each.  Never would have purchased this item had I known.  Shame.</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m cutting my skin, that&#x27;s how harsh these loofah sponges are. Not good quality either as they break apart into tiny specs while in use. I would not recommend this particular loofah to anyone.</li>
            <li> I was excited about the natural fiber and exfoliating properties of the loofah; however, I have been frustrated with how much liquid soap is needed to actually get a good lather in the shower. It seems like a waste of soap given how much one needs to use to get any suds.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t soften up much at all in the water. Very rough on the skin. Probably only good for callus removal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s average loofa sponges, nothing special. I give it 2 stars because there were some debris inside, but it was easily removed.</li>
            <li> I recommend this, clean you dead skin and remember this is not very soft... I use this with a bar soap exfoliator.</li>
            <li> It really worth to buy, and the actual thing is much bigger than I thought. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Natural Loofahs are far superior to the plastic mesh found in the stores. I believe they last longer and can be dumped in the compose bin when the scrub is gone.</li>
            <li> This item is not natural as stated in the listed but is manufactured. And the item you receive looks nothing like the picture posted in the listing. I had to open an AtoZ Claim with Amazon.</li>
            <li> These are great and I can never seem to find them at my local store. Can&#x27;t beat this price. These natural sponges work great and last a long time.</li>
            <li> This product works great to scrub off all the dead skin when your feet knees and elbows. If you have sensitive skin not sure if  is the product for you. They feel really hard before you get them wet but as soon as they get wet they soften up and are pretty good scrubbing tool.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s pediatrician recommended a loofah for my daughter&#x27;s skin and so I bought these, when I first got them I was surprised at how small they were but with a little water the perked right up and fit right in your palm, perfect size and texture.</li>
            <li> I got to have my loofah in the shower, it&#x27;s so gentle on your skin but yet it does the job.  Great way to exfoliate too.</li>
            <li> These are acceptable. They were very very firm and actually shaved down or sanded or something. They were incredibly smooth and conical and not what I expect from a loofah. When I buy a natural loofah I do expect more texture and give such that they actually absorb moisture and have more texture to exfoliate. They work well enough, but I probably won&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
