            <li>I experienced some momentary burning when I first applied the product, but it quickly abated.</li>
            <li>This product is great because it makes your natural nail strong and helps your nails to grow.</li>
            <li>So I wouldn&#x27;t be with out it, my nails are so strong .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for over a year, keeping a fresh coat on my nails every 3-4 days, mostly alone</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>After the first 2 weeks of usage, I did not experience any more discomfort.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how or why my cuticles are better because the product isn&#x27;t applied to them, but they are very improved.  </li>
            <li>Quick results and manicure lasted 2 weeks</li>
            <li>Came super quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wise to go ahead and purchase a few at a time for yourself , or share to someone you love.</li>
            <li>So strong that the bottle went straight in the trash.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s really all I can say!!</li>
            <li>Later, I bought my own bottles through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I thought it would be worth a try because I have a high tolerance for pain, but ouch ouch ouch!!</li>
            <li>They were braking very fast.</li>
            <li>Since then my nails have grown very strong and long.</li>
            <li>I hot three bottles and shared them.</li>
            <li>but this product works so well that I&#x27;m willing to overlook it.</li>
            <li>They are growing now and growing very long and strong!</li>
            <li>My nails are weak and tear easily, but after using this product for the past year, they are strong and beautiful.</li>
            <li>For the first time in my 58 years I have long, strong nails.</li>
            <li>This really hardens nail giving it time to grow.</li>
            <li>This works very well.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t believe how much it has hardened my nails.  </li>
            <li>Product came in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li>It truly hardens my nails and they grow extremely fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m over 75 and have been a nail and cuticle biter since I was a child, so they are very damaged.  </li>
            <li>I have never been able to grow my nails with any other product.</li>
            <li>I finally find a thing that makes my nails grow hard and beautiful</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and I have had no negative effects.</li>
            <li>OK, so the first time I tried this stuff, my fingers were on fire, the pain was so intense I was nauseated.  </li>
            <li>This will be a new staple for me.</li>
            <li>She does say, &amp;#34;it burns a little if I use too much, but worth it.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It barely chips.</li>
            <li>First time a tried it, it burned my nails a little</li>
            <li>They grow so fast that I actually have to keep filing them down a bit.</li>

            <li> They grow so fast that I actually have to keep filing them down a bit.</li>
            <li> They actually get so long I have to cut them.</li>
            <li> I have very weak nails that split and peel layers off easily.  </li>
            <li> I never had long nails before.</li>
            <li> I have no idea how long it will take for this feeling to go awa, but I hope it&#x27;s soon!!!</li>
            <li> Be careful.</li>
            <li> My nails were thin, constantly peeling and prone to frequent breakage.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve given bottles to other friends and family members.  </li>
            <li> She has petite Chinese fingers with delicate nails.</li>
            <li> It burns a little when applied, and burn lasts for a couple of days.</li>
            <li> Almost every one of my nails would split as soon as they got a little length</li>
            <li> My sister however was not able to tolerate the nail hardener and had to discontinue using it.</li>
            <li> It seems to have some questionable ingredients such a &amp;#34;the five&amp;#34; that have been taken out of polishes, but I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> Enjoy and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!  </li>
            <li> This polish stays on and keeps the nails hard and keeps them from breaking.</li>
            <li> I gave one bottle to my sister when she complained about split and cracked nails.  </li>
            <li> The smell was unbelievable - not just for minutes but for hours!</li>
            <li> I stopped doing fake nails 3 years ago andI have been using this product for 3 years.  </li>
            <li> Bought this to replace another nail hardener I was using and my nails started growing like crazy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no burning or any bad effects from this product.</li>
            <li> Terrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Be careful. I hot three bottles and shared them. The Polish is good but two out if the three people nails got burned w the Polish. My suggestion is just putting it on your nail tips only and then covering the entire nail with a different Polish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed! I absolutely love it! I saw a co workers nails and she suggested it. I apply it about every three or so days( hence the obsession) but it&#x27;s not necessary. It barely chips. First time a tried it, it burned my nails a little but I stuck through it because I realized my nails were damaged from the gel nail polish. Like putting medication on a cut. Since then my nails have grown very strong and long. So happy. Recommend recommended recommended</li>
            <li> it works well and i share it with my family in bayonne</li>
            <li> This was the nastiest nail product I have ever used!  The smell was unbelievable - not just for minutes but for hours! So strong that the bottle went straight in the trash.  It literally couldn&#x27;t be used in doors and my nails stunk for days. Terrible!</li>
            <li> The  best  nail  hardner ever nails  grew&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace another nail hardener I was using and my nails started growing like crazy. In about two weeks I went from nubs to my nails being over my fingertips. This will be a new staple for me.</li>
            <li> OK, so the first time I tried this stuff, my fingers were on fire, the pain was so intense I was nauseated.  I think this was because I had just had acrylics removed and my nails were too damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this a couple weeks later, it has been great!  My nails haven&#x27;t been breaking (even with the weakness from the acrylics).  Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Best Nail Product EVER! I have been using it for over 4years now. It did miracles for me!</li>
            <li> I love it this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent nail hardener, works great. I would just beware that it does make it easier for nails to chip if hit against something because of their now brittle quality. Otherwise this truly does make my nails grow longer.</li>
            <li> This product is great because it makes your natural nail strong and helps your nails to grow.</li>
            <li> I have fingernails that split vertically. Nail salon will only try gel, wrap, or cut very short. This really hardens nail giving it time to grow. It burns a little when applied, and burn lasts for a couple of days. But it works.</li>
            <li> my nails thanks !!!! its very good, really good !</li>
            <li> This works very well. I finally find a thing that makes my nails grow hard and beautiful</li>
            <li> A friend gave me bottle of this and I can&#x27;t believe how much it has hardened my nails.  So I&#x27;ve given bottles to other friends and family members.  Everyone loves it, even my sister who has always had stubby nails.</li>
            <li> For the first time in my 58 years I have long, strong nails. I had worn acrylic nails for years. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Best nail hardner I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> Great value, my nails need repair-Thanks!</li>
            <li> LOVE!!! If you have never used hardener before, remember to be patient and stick with it, because this stuff is legit. It works wonders. Just look at my picture. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Its the only thing I have found that keeps my nails from splitting. Its great and I have had no negative effects.</li>
            <li> I love the product;however; I received more than I ordered.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, it keeps my polish in place for days and makes my nails nice and strong.</li>
            <li> This product is very good</li>
            <li> Love this nail hardener.</li>
            <li> Amazing! I never had long nails before. They were braking very fast. They are growing now and growing very long and strong! Yes, sometimes it burns (for some reason only one finger nail). But I can tolerate it. In a 30 min burning effect disappearing. I recommended it for 2 of my friends. They are very happy with this product as well!</li>
            <li> I know formaldehyde isn&#x27;t good to use but this product works so well that I&#x27;m willing to overlook it. My nails are beautiful. They grow so fast that I actually have to keep filing them down a bit. I&#x27;ve had no burning or any bad effects from this product.</li>
            <li> I love it work wonder on my nails</li>
            <li> I have never been able to grow my nails with any other product. My nails were thin, constantly peeling and prone to frequent breakage. I experienced some momentary burning when I first applied the product, but it quickly abated. After the first 2 weeks of usage, I did not experience any more discomfort. My nails look great and are very strong. My sister however was not able to tolerate the nail hardener and had to discontinue using it. Therefore, I think it is a great product for some, but not for everyone.</li>

            <li> Great product it really helped my nails when nothing else did.</li>
            <li> Best nail strengthener I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have very weak nails that split and peel layers off easily.  I&#x27;ve used this for over a year, keeping a fresh coat on my nails every 3-4 days, mostly alone but sometimes with polish.  It&#x27;s been a miracle for me.  My nails almost never break now, they look healthy and strong.  Excellent product!!!</li>
            <li> Good, product... It said it would be here 2 days prime but I actually rec&#x27;d it in 3 days...</li>
            <li> Ooouuuchhhhhh!!!!! That&#x27;s really all I can say!! My fingers are on fire!!!! Ouch ouch ouch!!!!! I thought it would be worth a try because I have a high tolerance for pain, but ouch ouch ouch!! I can&#x27;t imagine what is in his that made it hurt all the way from the tips of my fingers to my elbow, but it can&#x27;t be good!! I have no idea how long it will take for this feeling to go awa, but I hope it&#x27;s soon!!! Typing this is torture, but others should know!!</li>
            <li> Good product for chipping and breaking nails.</li>
            <li> This was a reorder for my muse. She loves the stuff. She has petite Chinese fingers with delicate nails. She does say, &amp;#34;it burns a little if I use too much, but worth it.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to everyone. As a licenced  manicurest I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> great product.  I stopped doing fake nails 3 years ago andI have been using this product for 3 years.  It has strengthened my nails.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and efectibilty!!</li>
            <li> This is the best hail hardner ever. I&#x27;ve bought 100&#x27;s over the years and none stay on well. This polish stays on and keeps the nails hard and keeps them from breaking.</li>
            <li> Quick results and manicure lasted 2 weeks</li>
            <li> Came super quickly. I love this stuff! It truly hardens my nails and they grow extremely fast. It seems to have some questionable ingredients such a &amp;#34;the five&amp;#34; that have been taken out of polishes, but I&#x27;m hooked. This is my second order of multiple bottles.</li>
            <li> So fart the only nail hardner that keeps my nails from splitting, chipping and breaking.  Bought it for my Mom and Sister.  The swear by it also.</li>
            <li> was please with my purhase . Now my nails are growing  without breaking or chiping.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST nail Strengther ever,I&#x27;ve been using it close to 5 years . So I wouldn&#x27;t be with out it, my nails are so strong . They actually get so long I have to cut them. It&#x27;s wise to go ahead and purchase a few at a time for yourself , or share to someone you love. Follow the instructions and don&#x27;t put it on your cuticles,that area need to grow. Enjoy and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!  Nancy</li>
            <li> I love this nail hardener and have used it for years.  My nails use to split and crack but once I started using Quimica Alemana Nail Hardener that has never happened again.  My manicurist use to put it on when I had my nails done. Later, I bought my own bottles through Amazon.  I gave one bottle to my sister when she complained about split and cracked nails.  Now I bring it to the nail salon and have them apply it before putting on nail-color polish.</li>
            <li> best nail hardner works great</li>
            <li> I love this product.  My nails are weak and tear easily, but after using this product for the past year, they are strong and beautiful.</li>
            <li> This stuff is phenomonal!  My fingernails grow longer and quicker and look great!  Get lots of compliments on my nails.  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I wish I had taken pictures of my nails (and cuticles) before using Quimica Alemana to show the difference, which amazed me. I&#x27;m over 75 and have been a nail and cuticle biter since I was a child, so they are very damaged.  I don&#x27;t know how or why my cuticles are better because the product isn&#x27;t applied to them, but they are very improved.  Almost every one of my nails would split as soon as they got a little length and they would just peel.  Now they are longer and stronger.  The last time I went for a manicure, she looked at them, and then at me, and said &amp;#34;wow!.&amp;#34;  I bring my bottle to her, but she also has it in the shop and charges extra for it.</li>
            <li> The only way I order this product. Thank you</li>
