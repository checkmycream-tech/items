            <li>I discovered this a year ago at a discount store, I did not expect it to be so good.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a good cuticle remover.</li>
            <li>Good at removing cuticles with the use of a cuticle pusher.</li>

            <li>it will be a nice product i&#x27;m sure!</li>
            <li>Good for quick manicures and very effective.</li>
            <li>Works amazing.  </li>
            <li>this one by Sally Hansen is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>This stuff is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>This cuticle remover is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>so it is nice to have something to fix this since I do my own nails at home now.</li>
            <li>Does the job nicely.</li>
            <li>I decided to do my own manicure and buying this product helps me to take care of my cuticles ones a week, without the hassel of soaking and waiting.  </li>
            <li>Effective, works as described.</li>
            <li>cause your nails will start to deteriorate so once youre done, go wash your nails with soap and warm water.</li>
            <li>This remover doesn’t work well on its own</li>
            <li>I soak my fingers in luke warm water after putting the gel on my cuticles.</li>
            <li>I do my own nails and always keep this on hand.</li>
            <li>When I would use the at home motorized cuticle remover, my cuticles were removed, but it still looked kind of jagged.</li>
            <li>Softens cuticles nicely for a neat manicure</li>
            <li>I was impressed, really does dissolve</li>
            <li>cuticles looked ok, but it kind of just ate my cuticles away and my nails would never grow.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;d be nice if I used cuticle cream at night before I went to bed, but I more often than not don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I have been using the cuticle remover for more than five years, it&#x27;s convinient and effective.</li>
            <li>Love love love this product!</li>
            <li>i totally trust sally hansen products, they are amazing and always work perfectly</li>
            <li>Make sure you wash the cuticle remover off as soon as you are done.</li>
            <li>I have invisible cuticles and in order to wear Jamberry nail wraps, I  need to make sure those are removed before I can apply them, and this does the job.</li>
            <li>I love this cuticle remover.  </li>
            <li>I used to have acryllic on my nails for many years.</li>
            <li>AND ABSOLUTELY LOVE</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>:) i&#x27;m keeping this product.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m pleased with it there.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>More cost-effective, I should say.</li>
            <li>I have tried many over the years.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you follow the directions.</li>
            <li>As it is, I&#x27;m trying to avoid using this cuticle remover, and instead I&#x27;m just pushing my cuticles back as best</li>
            <li>This makes my cuticles disappear and my manicures look even better, and everything just looks smooth and nice.</li>
            <li>It not only removes cuticles, but loosens callused skin and is great to remove machinery oil from hands; I have used the heck out of it!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t more than once a month, either.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try it again and see if I can get a better result.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t smooth or softened!</li>
            <li>It works in 15 seconds, what more could you ask?</li>
            <li>Love love LOVE</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found most cuticle softeners do diddly squat for me.  </li>
            <li>The best I have ever bought on line for my entire nail care</li>
            <li>Just make sure when rinsing off within the time of application you rinse off all of it well, or the cuticles will peel off for days.</li>
            <li>&quot; it works so much better</li>
            <li>This product for me is okay.</li>
            <li>This stuff works FAST,  great on hands and even better on toenails.</li>
            <li>It works ok.</li>
            <li>It works better than the foot file alone.</li>
            <li>Works like magic.  </li>
            <li>Works wonders love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep looking for something better for me.</li>

            <li>This work pretty good  </li>
            <li>This instant cuticle remover from Sally Hansen is amazing!!</li>
            <li>This stuff is great for removing cuticles (-NOT- the Eponychium, which is live skin, that people often try to trim) and removing thickened skin (callouses) on your feet.</li>
            <li>This is quick and effective.</li>
            <li>Even if your nails look fine now, they&#x27;ll look even better after this cuticle remover and your polish will stick longer without the layer of invisible cuticle covering your nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff is very cool.</li>
            <li>good product, fast shipping</li>
            <li>Easy to use and always works</li>

            <li>nothing miraculous but fine.</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been using this product for years before it stopped being available in drugstores.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li>This stuff works almost instantly and does a great job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a bit of added help to keep my feet smooth always.</li>
            <li>and they are smooth.  </li>
            <li>Really good product does the work and makes it easier to remove cuticles nd calluses, also pretty fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Quick and easy way to keep your cuticles under control.</li>
            <li>Be sure to moisturize with a good hand cream after using or you&#x27;ll end up with dry cuticles and hang nails</li>
            <li>Yeah, gross... but effective!</li>
            <li>used to use another Sally Hansen cuticle remover that came in a squeeze tube but decided to try this one this time, and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I love this remover because it takes more time to grow the cuticle and the nail polish last much more</li>
            <li>I was excited to use tihs products after reading the reviews; however, it did not remove my cuticles.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t suffer from peeling nails and you&#x27;re looking for something to soften your cuticles so you can push them back easily, you might be pretty happy with this stuff.</li>
            <li>stuff dissolves the cuticle and leaves the nails looking clean.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t even wash my feet to use this product,and I was stunned how clean it looked after all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff does a great job of removing the loose cuticles sticking up on your fingers.  </li>
            <li>They were right!</li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>Love it and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Works so fast, love it.</li>
            <li>works so great on dry cuticles!!</li>
            <li>works fine, but you have to use it pretty often to keep your nails clean.</li>
            <li>but it’s a great helping hand for other products.</li>
            <li>Even when I work quickly, my nail layers start peeling at the tip of the nail.  </li>
            <li>Works quickly.</li>
            <li>I have problem cuticles - they are quickly overgrown</li>
            <li>As someone who keeps her nails natural &amp; with no polish, once a week I clean up my cuticles and nothing works as fast or as effectively as this.</li>
            <li>my first time ever attempting to remove my cuticles with any product and all i have to say is this shizz works!  </li>
            <li>I think use a spoon cuticle pusher to take care of them entirely and love how easy this makes it.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, took me a few weeks to wrangle the cuticles under control with this stuff.</li>
            <li>Hansen is well known useful products</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work to get rid of cuticles, but worth a try.</li>
            <li>#2, I used a few products that were available that weren&#x27;t nearly as good, so #3</li>
            <li>every store I went to wanted over $10+ for a cuticle remover it wasn&#x27;t worth</li>
            <li>but i thinks its worth it.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t honestly expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>It is quick and very easy to use, soak for a minute, push back with an orange stick</li>
            <li>Not overly impressed have used it several times now and it doesn&#x27;t seem to remove as well as other products, won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li>Got here pretty quick too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s just me, because all the other reviews are good.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my fianceé, and compared to other options, she says it&#x27;s fairly ineffective.  </li>
            <li>it actually &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; them so that it is very easy to remove.  </li>
            <li>Sally Hansen Instant Cuticle Remover is hands down the best cuticle remover I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I use it slightly differently: Squeeze onto cuticles, wait 15 seconds, gently push the surface of the nail bed to edge with a soft rubber cuticle pusher (Jamberry or BMC brands are great), then wash.</li>
            <li>I am not sure how toxic it is, but is works great.</li>
            <li>Really good to take out remaining nail polish in dark colors, before manicure.</li>
            <li>It helps if you soak your cuticles first, I recommend doing it right after you get out of the shower</li>
            <li>This cuticle remover is quick, gentle, dependable, and inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>Unlike anything I&#x27;ve tried it gently removes excess cuticle quickly without any skin irritation.</li>
            <li>I guess a product you can use at home can not be as strong as the professional ones</li>
            <li>I expected more!</li>
            <li>It works and it&#x27;s very fast.  </li>
            <li>Does a good job of breaking up cuticle build-up, and leaving my cuticles a little softer and nicer looking.  </li>
            <li>you have to read the instructions first</li>
            <li>Overall, I love it -</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.</li>
            <li>nails will look even  better if you hydrate them regularly (2 x a day) with cuticle oil, olive oil or cuticle</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this product after seeing many Youtubers recommend it.</li>
            <li>- it might take a while to use up the whole thing!</li>
            <li>At first the consistency of this product made me think it was nothing more than water and goo, but I do actually think it removes cuticles well.</li>
            <li>This product helps me achieve nail salon-like results for a much cheaper price!</li>
            <li>Just be careful to thoroughly wash off this product with warm soapy water.</li>
            <li>My sally hansen indtant cuticle remover Is exactly the way I thought.</li>
            <li>I have been fortunate to have never had out-of-control cuticles and I moisturize frequently,</li>
            <li>Used exactly as directed and still had cuticles on my nails after using the product.</li>
            <li>I leave mine on for more than the 15 seconds that the directions recommend and the dry skin wipes right off.</li>
            <li>I have used other Sally Hansen products and liked them.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>Softens the cuticle so you can easily and neatly push it back.</li>
            <li>Sally Hansen Instant Cuticle Remover dissolves my cuticles quickly and most of the overgrowth I can simply wipe away.  </li>
            <li>I have tried it on dry nails, nails that are still damp, nails that have been soaking in warm water, and nails fresh out of a long, hot shower.  </li>
            <li>but I doubt I will reorder (its nothing a little soap and warm water can&#x27;t handle).</li>
            <li>i was a little worried that i had wasted my money, but it turned out to be a great deal!</li>
            <li>It works really well..</li>
            <li>Works fast</li>
            <li>This product works very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I like so much</li>
            <li>This product works very well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why it hurts so much.  </li>
            <li>and it takes me 20 min to do the whole thing )</li>
            <li>It makes applying nail polish so much easier and cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Really does his job.</li>
            <li>This product works really well.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Really does work in 30 seconds.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does remove your cuticle, but it is also very drying.  </li>
            <li>It really helps with cuticle sticking to the side of the nails.</li>
            <li>Thanks to this</li>
            <li>and that is when this product really cones in handy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes it really easier to remove cuticle, but it doesn&#x27;t remove it at all.</li>
            <li>if the instructions are followed correctly this really does work.</li>
            <li>I would recommend using this with the \\&quot;MASH Premium Stainless Steel Cuticle Pusher Cutter Trimmer\\</li>
            <li>If I apply the gel to each cuticle and gently wipe away the excess immediately after application, then it works for me.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any real results with this.</li>
            <li>Will try a few more times but will most likely not buy again.</li>
            <li>To my surprise it worked very well.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m telling you as much as I would cut myself</li>
            <li>Works way better than any other cuticle remover or softeners out there.</li>
            <li>I just used this on my nails and toes and they look great no more extra cuticles so now I can do my nails tomorrow with out any worry.</li>
            <li>I started using a cuticle clipper to trim them which successfully removed my overgrown cuticles but left me with harsh, ragged edges which would sometimes bleed and then get inflamed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really do think pushing back your cuticles and using an amazingly shiny topcoat is the key to making your mani and pedi looking 100% professional.</li>
            <li>I can after taking a shower (which does a decent job of softening them).  </li>
            <li>It is simple and quick to use.</li>
            <li>but I noticed my skin was very soft!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for problem cuticles.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest seeing if a friend has this before you purchase it, so you can see whether it works for you.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Good at managing in-growns and tough cuticles.</li>
            <li>Kinda scary how great it works</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it when doing my nails.</li>
            <li>Wash your hand immediately with warm water and soap, rinse and dry, and then repeat the process on the other hand.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>If you want, use Simply Peel first to protect your skin before applying the cuticle remover.</li>
            <li>this is pretty standard for a cuticle remover.  </li>
            <li>Works for you downtime between professional manicures to keep cuticles manageable on hands and feet!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I left it on for the time stated and nothing happened.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m giving this to a friend, as it was a waste of money for me and a complete mystery why it works well for so many when it was completely ineffective on me.  </li>
            <li>It was super rough on my nail beds, and my nails would split and crack.</li>
            <li>(in the past, at most, I&#x27;ve just used a towel to gently press them back after washing my hands).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It allows the polish to stay on better and just looks nicer without all that rough, patchy dry skin around the nail.</li>
            <li>I have tried it many times over the past few weeks, and it is no more effective than a hot water soak.  </li>
            <li>I finally got smart and looked here in amazon.</li>
            <li>Let it sit for about a minute and then use an orange stick to push down the cuticle and clean built up skin and debris under the nail type.</li>
            <li>Afterwards, my cuticles were clean but my nails peeled slightly.</li>
            <li>silky soft</li>
            <li>Maybe I got an old bottle.</li>
            <li>No harsh smells.</li>
            <li>and I get frequent hangnails.</li>
            <li>So much easier than traditional cuticle nippers.  </li>
            <li>Your cuticles will be ready to push back or trim within minutes of application, then just wipe the gel off.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t remove the cuticles, but it does make them much easier to push back with an orange stick.  </li>
            <li>You apply it to all of your cuticles, wait about 15-30 seconds, and then gently push them back with a cuticle stick.</li>
            <li>I had my nails done professionally.</li>
            <li>I just apply a generous amount to my nail beds and push back my cuticles and gently scrap away the skin.</li>
            <li>The instant cuticle remover work very well.</li>
            <li>The first few times I left the gel on a little too long (~30 seconds) and was a bit too enthusiastic about removing (er, scraping!)</li>
            <li>Unlike some of the other cuticle removers available you don&#x27;t have to wait to push them back after applying this.</li>
            <li>The bottle&#x27;s still half full, and she bought another brand.</li>
            <li>I have used this gel several times with decent results.</li>
            <li>I highly prefer Sally Hansen nail products as I&#x27;ve tried a variety of others and even using salon brands usually go back with SH.</li>
            <li>I purchased this at a drugstore as it was less expensive, expecting it to be incredible based on the reviews on here.  </li>
            <li>I apply the cuticle softener &amp; push back my cuticles, and two days later they are right back where they were before.  </li>
            <li>I do have to work quickly though in a mad rush so that it&#x27;s not on my nails for more than a minute.  </li>
            <li>I was worried something that removes calluses would be too strong for delicate fingernail cuticle, but not so.</li>
            <li>If you have thick, strong nails, this may not be a problem.</li>
            <li>I squirt some of this on each nail bed and after a couple of minutes, push back my cuticles ( and scrape off old, stubborn GLITTER polish with ease! )</li>
            <li>Maybe this products works better on cuticles not as tough and ragged as mine.  </li>
            <li>I use it on both hands and feet and my cuticles look better than they have in a long time, my cuticles seem less dry, no tears.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use much at a time, so the bottle will last long.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t remove the Eponychium, which is apparently what some people want-</li>
            <li>A quick way to make your cuticles go away, just apply and use a cuticle stick to push the cuticle back after a few seconds.</li>
            <li>The parts that remain which I end up needing to trim off with cuticle clippers are easy to remove and leave soft edges instead of thick and rough like before.  </li>
            <li>I got my Ped Egg out and scrubbed the soft skin and the dry skin was gone in seconds.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s winter in the Northeast, so dry skin is a guarantee, especially for a germaphobe like me who washes her hands frequently).  </li>

            <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> This cuticle remover is amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> so it is nice to have something to fix this since I do my own nails at home now.</li>
            <li> Does the job nicely.</li>
            <li> I decided to do my own manicure and buying this product helps me to take care of my cuticles ones a week, without the hassel of soaking and waiting.  </li>
            <li> Effective, works as described.</li>
            <li> cause your nails will start to deteriorate so once youre done, go wash your nails with soap and warm water.</li>
            <li> This remover doesn’t work well on its own</li>
            <li> I soak my fingers in luke warm water after putting the gel on my cuticles.</li>
            <li> I do my own nails and always keep this on hand.</li>
            <li> When I would use the at home motorized cuticle remover, my cuticles were removed, but it still looked kind of jagged.</li>
            <li> Softens cuticles nicely for a neat manicure</li>
            <li> I was impressed, really does dissolve</li>
            <li> cuticles looked ok, but it kind of just ate my cuticles away and my nails would never grow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;d be nice if I used cuticle cream at night before I went to bed, but I more often than not don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I have been using the cuticle remover for more than five years, it&#x27;s convinient and effective.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product!</li>
            <li> i totally trust sally hansen products, they are amazing and always work perfectly</li>
            <li> Make sure you wash the cuticle remover off as soon as you are done.</li>
            <li> I have invisible cuticles and in order to wear Jamberry nail wraps, I  need to make sure those are removed before I can apply them, and this does the job.</li>
            <li> I love this cuticle remover.  </li>
            <li> I used to have acryllic on my nails for many years.</li>
            <li> AND ABSOLUTELY LOVE</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> :) i&#x27;m keeping this product.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m pleased with it there.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> More cost-effective, I should say.</li>
            <li> I have tried many over the years.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure you follow the directions.</li>
            <li> As it is, I&#x27;m trying to avoid using this cuticle remover, and instead I&#x27;m just pushing my cuticles back as best</li>
            <li> This makes my cuticles disappear and my manicures look even better, and everything just looks smooth and nice.</li>
            <li> It not only removes cuticles, but loosens callused skin and is great to remove machinery oil from hands; I have used the heck out of it!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t more than once a month, either.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try it again and see if I can get a better result.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t smooth or softened!</li>
            <li> It works in 15 seconds, what more could you ask?</li>
            <li> Love love LOVE</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve found most cuticle softeners do diddly squat for me.  </li>
            <li> The best I have ever bought on line for my entire nail care</li>
            <li> Just make sure when rinsing off within the time of application you rinse off all of it well, or the cuticles will peel off for days.</li>
            <li> &quot; it works so much better</li>
            <li> This product for me is okay.</li>
            <li> This stuff works FAST,  great on hands and even better on toenails.</li>
            <li> It works ok.</li>

            <li> Works wonders love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep looking for something better for me.</li>
            <li> is more.  </li>
            <li> I am familiar with the old formula and it worked great!</li>

            <li> This work pretty good  </li>
            <li> This instant cuticle remover from Sally Hansen is amazing!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for removing cuticles (-NOT- the Eponychium, which is live skin, that people often try to trim) and removing thickened skin (callouses) on your feet.</li>
            <li> This is quick and effective.</li>
            <li> Even if your nails look fine now, they&#x27;ll look even better after this cuticle remover and your polish will stick longer without the layer of invisible cuticle covering your nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff is very cool.</li>

            <li> Yeah, gross... but effective!</li>
            <li> used to use another Sally Hansen cuticle remover that came in a squeeze tube but decided to try this one this time, and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love this remover because it takes more time to grow the cuticle and the nail polish last much more</li>
            <li> I was excited to use tihs products after reading the reviews; however, it did not remove my cuticles.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t suffer from peeling nails and you&#x27;re looking for something to soften your cuticles so you can push them back easily, you might be pretty happy with this stuff.</li>
            <li> stuff dissolves the cuticle and leaves the nails looking clean.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t even wash my feet to use this product,and I was stunned how clean it looked after all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff does a great job of removing the loose cuticles sticking up on your fingers.  </li>
            <li> They were right!</li>
            <li> I love it so much</li>
            <li> Love it and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Works so fast, love it.</li>
            <li> works so great on dry cuticles!!</li>
            <li> works fine, but you have to use it pretty often to keep your nails clean.</li>
            <li> but it’s a great helping hand for other products.</li>
            <li> Even when I work quickly, my nail layers start peeling at the tip of the nail.  </li>
            <li> Works quickly.</li>
            <li> I have problem cuticles - they are quickly overgrown</li>
            <li> As someone who keeps her nails natural &amp; with no polish, once a week I clean up my cuticles and nothing works as fast or as effectively as this.</li>
            <li> my first time ever attempting to remove my cuticles with any product and all i have to say is this shizz works!  </li>
            <li> I think use a spoon cuticle pusher to take care of them entirely and love how easy this makes it.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, took me a few weeks to wrangle the cuticles under control with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Hansen is well known useful products</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work to get rid of cuticles, but worth a try.</li>
            <li> #2, I used a few products that were available that weren&#x27;t nearly as good, so #3</li>
            <li> every store I went to wanted over $10+ for a cuticle remover it wasn&#x27;t worth</li>
            <li> but i thinks its worth it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t honestly expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> It is quick and very easy to use, soak for a minute, push back with an orange stick</li>
            <li> Not overly impressed have used it several times now and it doesn&#x27;t seem to remove as well as other products, won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> Got here pretty quick too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s just me, because all the other reviews are good.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my fianceé, and compared to other options, she says it&#x27;s fairly ineffective.  </li>
            <li> it actually &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; them so that it is very easy to remove.  </li>
            <li> Sally Hansen Instant Cuticle Remover is hands down the best cuticle remover I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I use it slightly differently: Squeeze onto cuticles, wait 15 seconds, gently push the surface of the nail bed to edge with a soft rubber cuticle pusher (Jamberry or BMC brands are great), then wash.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how toxic it is, but is works great.</li>
            <li> Really good to take out remaining nail polish in dark colors, before manicure.</li>
            <li> It helps if you soak your cuticles first, I recommend doing it right after you get out of the shower</li>
            <li> This cuticle remover is quick, gentle, dependable, and inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> Unlike anything I&#x27;ve tried it gently removes excess cuticle quickly without any skin irritation.</li>
            <li> I guess a product you can use at home can not be as strong as the professional ones</li>
            <li> I expected more!</li>
            <li> It works and it&#x27;s very fast.  </li>
            <li> Does a good job of breaking up cuticle build-up, and leaving my cuticles a little softer and nicer looking.  </li>
            <li> you have to read the instructions first</li>
            <li> Overall, I love it -</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.</li>
            <li> nails will look even  better if you hydrate them regularly (2 x a day) with cuticle oil, olive oil or cuticle</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product after seeing many Youtubers recommend it.</li>
            <li> - it might take a while to use up the whole thing!</li>
            <li> At first the consistency of this product made me think it was nothing more than water and goo, but I do actually think it removes cuticles well.</li>
            <li> This product helps me achieve nail salon-like results for a much cheaper price!</li>
            <li> Just be careful to thoroughly wash off this product with warm soapy water.</li>
            <li> My sally hansen indtant cuticle remover Is exactly the way I thought.</li>
            <li> I have been fortunate to have never had out-of-control cuticles and I moisturize frequently,</li>
            <li> Used exactly as directed and still had cuticles on my nails after using the product.</li>
            <li> I leave mine on for more than the 15 seconds that the directions recommend and the dry skin wipes right off.</li>
            <li> I have used other Sally Hansen products and liked them.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> Softens the cuticle so you can easily and neatly push it back.</li>
            <li> Sally Hansen Instant Cuticle Remover dissolves my cuticles quickly and most of the overgrowth I can simply wipe away.  </li>
            <li> I have tried it on dry nails, nails that are still damp, nails that have been soaking in warm water, and nails fresh out of a long, hot shower.  </li>
            <li> but I doubt I will reorder (its nothing a little soap and warm water can&#x27;t handle).</li>
            <li> i was a little worried that i had wasted my money, but it turned out to be a great deal!</li>
            <li> It works really well..</li>
            <li> Works fast</li>
            <li> This product works very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I like so much</li>
            <li> This product works very well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it hurts so much.  </li>
            <li> and it takes me 20 min to do the whole thing )</li>
            <li> It makes applying nail polish so much easier and cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Really does his job.</li>
            <li> This product works really well.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Really does work in 30 seconds.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does remove your cuticle, but it is also very drying.  </li>
            <li> It really helps with cuticle sticking to the side of the nails.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this</li>
            <li> and that is when this product really cones in handy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes it really easier to remove cuticle, but it doesn&#x27;t remove it at all.</li>
            <li> if the instructions are followed correctly this really does work.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using this with the \\&quot;MASH Premium Stainless Steel Cuticle Pusher Cutter Trimmer\\</li>
            <li> If I apply the gel to each cuticle and gently wipe away the excess immediately after application, then it works for me.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any real results with this.</li>
            <li> Will try a few more times but will most likely not buy again.</li>
            <li> To my surprise it worked very well.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m telling you as much as I would cut myself</li>
            <li> Works way better than any other cuticle remover or softeners out there.</li>
            <li> I just used this on my nails and toes and they look great no more extra cuticles so now I can do my nails tomorrow with out any worry.</li>
            <li> I started using a cuticle clipper to trim them which successfully removed my overgrown cuticles but left me with harsh, ragged edges which would sometimes bleed and then get inflamed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really do think pushing back your cuticles and using an amazingly shiny topcoat is the key to making your mani and pedi looking 100% professional.</li>
            <li> I can after taking a shower (which does a decent job of softening them).  </li>
            <li> It is simple and quick to use.</li>
            <li> but I noticed my skin was very soft!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for problem cuticles.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest seeing if a friend has this before you purchase it, so you can see whether it works for you.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> Good at managing in-growns and tough cuticles.</li>
            <li> Kinda scary how great it works</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it when doing my nails.</li>
            <li> Wash your hand immediately with warm water and soap, rinse and dry, and then repeat the process on the other hand.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> If you want, use Simply Peel first to protect your skin before applying the cuticle remover.</li>
            <li> this is pretty standard for a cuticle remover.  </li>
            <li> Works for you downtime between professional manicures to keep cuticles manageable on hands and feet!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I left it on for the time stated and nothing happened.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this to a friend, as it was a waste of money for me and a complete mystery why it works well for so many when it was completely ineffective on me.  </li>
            <li> It was super rough on my nail beds, and my nails would split and crack.</li>
            <li> (in the past, at most, I&#x27;ve just used a towel to gently press them back after washing my hands).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It allows the polish to stay on better and just looks nicer without all that rough, patchy dry skin around the nail.</li>
            <li> I have tried it many times over the past few weeks, and it is no more effective than a hot water soak.  </li>
            <li> I finally got smart and looked here in amazon.</li>
            <li> Let it sit for about a minute and then use an orange stick to push down the cuticle and clean built up skin and debris under the nail type.</li>
            <li> Afterwards, my cuticles were clean but my nails peeled slightly.</li>
            <li> silky soft</li>
            <li> Maybe I got an old bottle.</li>
            <li> No harsh smells.</li>
            <li> and I get frequent hangnails.</li>
            <li> So much easier than traditional cuticle nippers.  </li>
            <li> Your cuticles will be ready to push back or trim within minutes of application, then just wipe the gel off.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t remove the cuticles, but it does make them much easier to push back with an orange stick.  </li>
            <li> You apply it to all of your cuticles, wait about 15-30 seconds, and then gently push them back with a cuticle stick.</li>
            <li> I had my nails done professionally.</li>
            <li> I just apply a generous amount to my nail beds and push back my cuticles and gently scrap away the skin.</li>
            <li> The instant cuticle remover work very well.</li>
            <li> The first few times I left the gel on a little too long (~30 seconds) and was a bit too enthusiastic about removing (er, scraping!)</li>
            <li> Unlike some of the other cuticle removers available you don&#x27;t have to wait to push them back after applying this.</li>
            <li> The bottle&#x27;s still half full, and she bought another brand.</li>
            <li> I have used this gel several times with decent results.</li>
            <li> I highly prefer Sally Hansen nail products as I&#x27;ve tried a variety of others and even using salon brands usually go back with SH.</li>
            <li> I purchased this at a drugstore as it was less expensive, expecting it to be incredible based on the reviews on here.  </li>
            <li> I apply the cuticle softener &amp; push back my cuticles, and two days later they are right back where they were before.  </li>
            <li> I do have to work quickly though in a mad rush so that it&#x27;s not on my nails for more than a minute.  </li>
            <li> I was worried something that removes calluses would be too strong for delicate fingernail cuticle, but not so.</li>
            <li> If you have thick, strong nails, this may not be a problem.</li>
            <li> I squirt some of this on each nail bed and after a couple of minutes, push back my cuticles ( and scrape off old, stubborn GLITTER polish with ease! )</li>
            <li> Maybe this products works better on cuticles not as tough and ragged as mine.  </li>
            <li> I use it on both hands and feet and my cuticles look better than they have in a long time, my cuticles seem less dry, no tears.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use much at a time, so the bottle will last long.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t remove the Eponychium, which is apparently what some people want-</li>
            <li> A quick way to make your cuticles go away, just apply and use a cuticle stick to push the cuticle back after a few seconds.</li>
            <li> The parts that remain which I end up needing to trim off with cuticle clippers are easy to remove and leave soft edges instead of thick and rough like before.  </li>
            <li> I got my Ped Egg out and scrubbed the soft skin and the dry skin was gone in seconds.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s winter in the Northeast, so dry skin is a guarantee, especially for a germaphobe like me who washes her hands frequently).  </li>
            <li> it cause the reviews that I was able to get were very poor.</li>
            <li> It works fine, although I find I still have a hard time with some of my cuticles, (I&#x27;ve got two that literally cover half the nail).</li>
            <li> While this approach is more delicate, it does not treat the occasional dry, stiff bit.</li>
            <li> is my second bottle of this (it does last a long time though)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seriously tried a million different methods of using it and no matter what, my cuticles look the exact same.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find that it damages my cuticles (of course don&#x27;t use too much at once and don&#x27;t leave on for an excessive amount of time if you have problem nails).</li>
            <li> and I occasionally combine with a minor cuticle trim on my winter feet .  </li>
            <li> , I see it lasting a long while!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and I hardly have to trim my cuticles at all.</li>
            <li> so the bottle&#x27;s lasted me a long time.</li>
            <li> also, don&#x27;t let the solution sit too long on your nails</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s instant, though it will work well enough almost instantly, but I tend to leave it on a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Works as stated, just don&#x27;t leave it on too long.</li>
            <li> I hav been using it a long time.</li>
            <li> #34;so long, pest&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never go back to the other stuff.</li>
            <li> He swears by it and loves how it takes care his stubborn dry skin.  </li>
            <li> but my cuticles are forever dry</li>
            <li> I work in health care, so dry cuticles are the bane of my existence.  </li>
            <li> Definitely would repurchase this - but a little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not particularly drying but you&#x27;ll need to use some cuticle oil afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have definitely learned less</li>
            <li> no cuticles were removed and my cuticles are very very dry after using this product.</li>
            <li> You only need a very small amount so this bottle should last a long time.</li>
            <li> it just removes the actual dead cuticle and neatens up your nail beds.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s enough to sit on your nails for the few seconds required.</li>
            <li> Take a few mins for the cuticles to get moist enough to scrap away.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my feet to soften skin that becomes thickened and rough when going barefoot &amp; wearing sandals a lot in the summer, or to help speed the process during desquamation.</li>
            <li> But for me, it worked only after I applied it for a min and few</li>
            <li> but I recently noticed a few nails were being crowded by the skin</li>
            <li> I have a lot of cuticle on my nails and this product makes short work of removing all the dead stuff.  </li>
            <li> It does what it says and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> One bottle lasts almost a year as a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> wow keeps my cuticles on my hands and feet from growing back all hard and thick</li>
            <li> IF I USE AND DO OTHER ROUTINE HAND SKIN CARE,</li>
            <li> It says you can only use it for 15 seconds and no more, I use it for longer because it doesn&#x27;t always work.</li>
            <li> I have used orange sticks with and without cotton, metal scrapers, a spoon, and other nails.  </li>
            <li> I do have to leave it on slightly longer than the recommended time, it does the job without leaving any rough skin or residue.</li>
            <li> Read the instructions carefully (the timing to use it is tight).</li>
            <li> Just recently i have become a nail fanatic and i</li>
            <li> I only apply it to a few fingers at a time - and definitely a small strip.  </li>
            <li> My nails tend to run on the thin and soft side, so it may just be me.</li>
            <li> set it on my cuticle area for 30 sec and used wood stick and it all removed dried cuticle so easy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not harsh or irritating.</li>
            <li> Then i use a cuticle pusher to push the cuticles down and the clip them off.</li>
            <li> Works well, but not are well as I thought it would, my cuticles are not &amp;#34;salon perfect&amp;#34; but maybe I haven&#x27;t gotten the technique down yet.</li>
            <li> At first it was not ideal, but after the 2nd time it removed all the ugly dry cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> otherwise you would complain that the product doesnt work and its a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It just feels like my fingers are melting off, and afterwards, they are swollen for a few hours.  </li>
            <li> Anyhow, 15 seconds is all I need, and then I wash the dead skin off with soap and water.  </li>
            <li> I put a thin strip of it around my entire cuticle, let it sit for 1-2 minutes then push it back.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> Apply just a bit, massage it in for a few seconds and scrape off with a cuticle pusher- makes all that dead skin just slough off.</li>
            <li> This product works so well and removes the dead cuticles in seconds.</li>
            <li> Not sure how this works.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn or feel weird when left on for longer than 15 seconds.</li>
            <li> Since I go to the nail salon no more than twice a month and am no manicurist, this is used when I am in maintenance mode.</li>
            <li> The instruction says to soak not more than a min.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied with the product at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to leave it on longer than the instruction&#x27;s maximum, but it barely softens the cuticles on my fingers.</li>
            <li> After putting it on one hand I started to use my cuticle pusher and the cuticle came off without any pain or hard work.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant in trying this product, but I did and I am addicted to it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It really takes off all the hard to remove cuticle from the base and surface of the nail.</li>
            <li> Also, I was afraid when they grew back they would be tougher, but that didn&#x27;t happen.  </li>
            <li> My cuticles are still thick</li>
            <li> I do have thick cuticles.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about other people&#x27;s cuticles, but mine grow like crazy and are thick and hard.</li>
            <li> did soak off process after gelish, and they were looking awful right after that.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because the item was not effective at all!</li>
            <li> this cuticle \\&quot;remover\\&quot; makes it 5x worse, so</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I used it wrong, but my cuticles look worse after I used it.</li>
            <li> and once you have this you can&#x27;t go back to cutting them!!</li>
            <li> m obsessed with taking care of my nails.</li>
            <li> No matter what I have tried, I have found it useless.  </li>
            <li> a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> and I have to resist cutting them.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed, as I usually like Sally Hansen products and, as I said, my cuticles aren&#x27;t that bad</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s horribly painful.  </li>
            <li> What a disappointment!  </li>
            <li> Goodbye ugly cuticles!</li>
            <li> My cuticles were not removed and the gel had an awful smell.</li>
            <li> ; it was horrible!</li>
            <li> I get nasty hangnails all around my cuticles if I make that mistake.</li>
            <li> I once had them removed using a fork-style trimmer with gruesome results.</li>
            <li> I have horrible cuticles and after one use the thickness is gone</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I loved this cuticle remover.  It doesn&#x27;t just make the cuticles softer, it actually &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; them so that it is very easy to remove.  Also, I was afraid when they grew back they would be tougher, but that didn&#x27;t happen.  All in all, I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> always loved this product... silky soft</li>
            <li> Make sure you wash the cuticle remover off as soon as you are done. If you want, use Simply Peel first to protect your skin before applying the cuticle remover. It helps prevent the cuticle remover from touching your skin!!!</li>
            <li> Great price and quality</li>
            <li> Great for calluses and softens cuticles very quickly. Good for quick manicures and very effective. Good at managing in-growns and tough cuticles.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years. It works really well..</li>
            <li> does what it says. good stuff</li>
            <li> This stuff does a great job of removing the loose cuticles sticking up on your fingers.  This has always been a problem for me so it is nice to have something to fix this since I do my own nails at home now.</li>
            <li> سالي هانسن غنية عن التعريف منتجات مفيدة&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sally Hansen is well known useful products</li>
            <li> work as promised , easy to use and smooth on the skin .&lt;br /&gt;No complications .</li>
            <li> Does the job nicely. I have invisible cuticles and in order to wear Jamberry nail wraps, I  need to make sure those are removed before I can apply them, and this does the job. I think use a spoon cuticle pusher to take care of them entirely and love how easy this makes it.</li>
            <li> Works fast and I accidentally leave it like that for some time which should not be done. Caused irritaion but if used properly it is good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seriously tried a million different methods of using it and no matter what, my cuticles look the exact same. What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I like this Sally Hansen product. I don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it so the bottle&#x27;s lasted me a long time. Just a dab on each nail does the trick. I leave mine on for more than the 15 seconds that the directions recommend and the dry skin wipes right off.</li>
            <li> I love this cuticle remover.  I used to have acryllic on my nails for many years. I decided to do my own manicure and buying this product helps me to take care of my cuticles ones a week, without the hassel of soaking and waiting.  The works well and just as advertised.  I am very happy I bought it. Goodbye ugly cuticles!</li>
            <li> ANOTHER ITEM I CAN&#x27;T GET LOCALLY ANYMORE.&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE USED FOR YEARS AND ABSOLUTELY LOVE HOW IT WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;I DON&#x27;T GET HANGNAILS IF I USE AND DO OTHER ROUTINE HAND SKIN CARE, SUCH AS WEAR RUBBER GLOVES AND GARDEN GLOVES AND NIGHTLY USE A HAND CREAM.</li>
            <li> great product, great seller</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and in perfect condition.This product works very well.</li>
            <li> I like this product. I do have to leave it on slightly longer than the recommended time, it does the job without leaving any rough skin or residue. Great product!</li>
            <li> Effective, works as described.</li>
            <li> This product did not work at all.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the product. Thanks.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;remove&amp;#34; my cuticles, but definitely softened them and made it easier to push them back.</li>
            <li> It work very good in your cuticle you don&#x27;t need to use the nipple to cut your cuticle. I like so much</li>
            <li> my first time ever attempting to remove my cuticles with any product and all i have to say is this shizz works!  you have to read the instructions first otherwise you would complain that the product doesnt work and its a waste of money. allow 15 secs to start softening your cuticles, push back the cuticles with a pusher, and whoa-la! also, don&#x27;t let the solution sit too long on your nails cause your nails will start to deteriorate so once youre done, go wash your nails with soap and warm water. :) i&#x27;m keeping this product.</li>
            <li> works so great on dry cuticles!!</li>
            <li> Love this product very easy to use and does a good job on my cuticles!</li>
            <li> This cuticle remover works well, just not on cuticles. I used this on my cuticles and got no results. It says you can also you the remover on calluses so I did. I also got nothing but I noticed my skin was very soft! I got my Ped Egg out and scrubbed the soft skin and the dry skin was gone in seconds. This remover doesn’t work well on its own but it’s a great helping hand for other products.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for removing cuticles (-NOT- the Eponychium, which is live skin, that people often try to trim) and removing thickened skin (callouses) on your feet. Yeah, gross... but effective! The directions say to squeeze onto cuticles, wait 15 seconds, wash with soapy water. I use it slightly differently: Squeeze onto cuticles, wait 15 seconds, gently push the surface of the nail bed to edge with a soft rubber cuticle pusher (Jamberry or BMC brands are great), then wash. Follow up with cuticle oil to prevent tearing and drying. For calluses, the directions say to do the same but for one minute. I rub with a washcloth before washing with soap and water. Repeat if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t remove the Eponychium, which is apparently what some people want- it just removes the actual dead cuticle and neatens up your nail beds. Even if your nails look fine now, they&#x27;ll look even better after this cuticle remover and your polish will stick longer without the layer of invisible cuticle covering your nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d describe the consistency as being between dish soap and hand sanitizer. It&#x27;s enough to sit on your nails for the few seconds required. It&#x27;s not particularly drying but you&#x27;ll need to use some cuticle oil afterwards. Overall, I love it - the bottle is larger than my CND Cuticle Eraser, cheaper, and works just as well.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what its supposed to do !!!</li>
            <li> Ótimo produto! Realmente amolece a cutícula, e tira apenas o excesso do que há. Porém um pouco \\&quot;perigoso\\&quot;, se não bem manuseado, pode deixar sensibilidade na parte aplicada, como se houvesse ralado a região.</li>
            <li> wow keeps my cuticles on my hands and feet from growing back all hard and thick and once you have this you can&#x27;t go back to cutting them!!</li>
            <li> I have been waiting on my order of cuticle remover to arrive.  While I waited, I used this product.  no cuticles were removed and my cuticles are very very dry after using this product.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work to get rid of cuticles, but worth a try. Maybe I got an old bottle. I am familiar with the old formula and it worked great!</li>
            <li> It works fine, although I find I still have a hard time with some of my cuticles, (I&#x27;ve got two that literally cover half the nail). It works fine on my shorter cuticles though so I&#x27;m pleased with it there.</li>
            <li> Really good to take out remaining nail polish in dark colors, before manicure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using this product for years before it stopped being available in drugstores. #1, it&#x27;s so good that I searched every drugstore in the city for it (and couldn&#x27;t find it) #2, I used a few products that were available that weren&#x27;t nearly as good, so #3 I buy this from Amazon now. As someone who keeps her nails natural &amp; with no polish, once a week I clean up my cuticles and nothing works as fast or as effectively as this. I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s instant, though it will work well enough almost instantly, but I tend to leave it on a few minutes.</li>
            <li> This product works very well. I soak my fingers in luke warm water after putting the gel on my cuticles. Then i use a cuticle pusher to push the cuticles down and the clip them off.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product! Works great! No complains at all! Got here pretty quick too. I love it so much</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product!! every store I went to wanted over $10+ for a cuticle remover it wasn&#x27;t worth it cause the reviews that I was able to get were very poor. I just used this on my nails and toes and they look great no more extra cuticles so now I can do my nails tomorrow with out any worry.</li>
            <li> Does a good job of breaking up cuticle build-up, and leaving my cuticles a little softer and nicer looking.  It&#x27;s fast-acting, so there&#x27;s not a lot of wait time for the product to work, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> I Love this cutilce remover! I was a little hesitant in trying this product, but I did and I am addicted to it.&lt;br /&gt;I do my own manicure every weekend and since I started using this, my cuticles look healthier than ever!</li>
            <li> Well, it DOES work.  It works and it&#x27;s very fast.  But it&#x27;s horribly painful.  It feels like fire. I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s just me, because all the other reviews are good.  I don&#x27;t know why it hurts so much.  I don&#x27;t put it on if I have bitten fingers.  I only leave it on 15 seconds. It just feels like my fingers are melting off, and afterwards, they are swollen for a few hours.  Possibly I&#x27;m allergic? Anyhow, 15 seconds is all I need, and then I wash the dead skin off with soap and water.  I just think I&#x27;ll toss this and try another brand.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Can&#x27;t live without it when doing my nails.</li>
            <li> I expected more! But it&#x27;s ok!!!</li>
            <li> This is great for this times I can&#x27;t get a manicure. It helps me keep my nails looking great and healthy. Would not use anything else.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my husband and he uses it on his feet.  He swears by it and loves how it takes care his stubborn dry skin.  So we recommend it.</li>
            <li> It does the job it is supposed to do. No harsh smells. I suggest having a paper towel under your habss/feet while you let the serum do it&#x27;s thing, just so you don&#x27;t get any of it on your things or floor. I plan on buying this again as soon as I run out.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Swift delivery.  No complaints!</li>
            <li> Works amazing.  I am not sure how toxic it is, but is works great. Don&#x27;t eat it.</li>
            <li> I highly prefer Sally Hansen nail products as I&#x27;ve tried a variety of others and even using salon brands usually go back with SH. That said, this is not the best product I&#x27;ve used from them. I get a biweekly manicure but my cuticles are forever dry and I get frequent hangnails. I was hoping this removal gel would help as I&#x27;ve also tried clippers, trimmers, and cream.</li>
            <li> Works way better than any other cuticle remover or softeners out there. More cost-effective, I should say.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to make a difference whether or not I use it.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  If you have problem cuticles that must be removed.  I like to use with the tweezerman cuticle remover.  So much easier than traditional cuticle nippers.  Just DON&#x27;T Leave on for more than 15-20 seconds!  Follow directions!  Otherwise your cuticles will peel all week.</li>
            <li> I am a product junkie and have tried the most expensive cuticle removers/ softeners and let me tell ya, this one by Sally Hansen is AMAZING. I squirt some of this on each nail bed and after a couple of minutes, push back my cuticles ( and scrape off old, stubborn GLITTER polish with ease! ) to reveal a nail bed that looks cleaner. It also helps with the ridges on my nails. I really do think pushing back your cuticles and using an amazingly shiny topcoat is the key to making your mani and pedi looking 100% professional. Each time I do my nails myself ( trust me, I am not that great and it takes me 20 min to do the whole thing ) all of my girlfriends ask me where I got my nails done. I have been using this for years and will never stray ! Works perfect on toe nails, too</li>
            <li> This would have to be the best cuticle remover I have used. I have tried many over the years.  I discovered this a year ago at a discount store, I did not expect it to be so good.  It is quick and very easy to use, soak for a minute, push back with an orange stick and I occasionally combine with a minor cuticle trim on my winter feet .  I use it on both hands and feet and my cuticles look better than they have in a long time, my cuticles seem less dry, no tears. Highly recommended for problem cuticles.</li>
            <li> Really great cuticle remover - I use it once a week with the cuticle pusher from Satin Edge. It cleans up my cuticles perfectly each time. It makes applying nail polish so much easier and cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;I used to use another Sally Hansen cuticle remover that came in a squeeze tube but decided to try this one this time, and I am not disappointed. I don&#x27;t find that it damages my cuticles (of course don&#x27;t use too much at once and don&#x27;t leave on for an excessive amount of time if you have problem nails). I put a thin strip of it around my entire cuticle, let it sit for 1-2 minutes then push it back.&lt;br /&gt;For the size of the bottle and amount used each time, I see it lasting a long while!</li>
            <li> Unlike some of the other cuticle removers available you don&#x27;t have to wait to push them back after applying this. I&#x27;d never go back to the other stuff. This is quick and effective. Used it for around a year now with no complaints.</li>
            <li> I will never use anything else.  Sally Hansen Instant Cuticle Remover is hands down the best cuticle remover I have ever used.  Just make sure you follow the directions.</li>
            <li> Really good product does the work and makes it easier to remove cuticles nd calluses, also pretty fast shipping! Recomend it.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s amazing but it&#x27;s a good cuticle remover.</li>
            <li> Really does his job. Usage is very economic and result is very impressive, price is low...what else I can wish for? Nothing! Just plan my next order</li>
            <li> This product works really well. Your cuticles will be ready to push back or trim within minutes of application, then just wipe the gel off. Simple and efficient. I do my own nails and always keep this on hand.</li>
            <li> Its a great remover, you should buy it if some cuticles dont botter you. Im in a experience fase yet, but i thinks its worth it.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because the item was not effective at all! My cuticles were not removed and the gel had an awful smell. I would not recommend this product for future buyers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this about once a month for the last 6 months.  It doesn&#x27;t remove the cuticles, but it does make them much easier to push back with an orange stick.  Also, it makes the skin around my nail softer, too.  I do have to work quickly though in a mad rush so that it&#x27;s not on my nails for more than a minute.  Even when I work quickly, my nail layers start peeling at the tip of the nail.  Peeling nails is a problem for me but this cuticle \\&quot;remover\\&quot; makes it 5x worse, so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be repurchasing.  As it is, I&#x27;m trying to avoid using this cuticle remover, and instead I&#x27;m just pushing my cuticles back as best I can after taking a shower (which does a decent job of softening them).  If you don&#x27;t suffer from peeling nails and you&#x27;re looking for something to soften your cuticles so you can push them back easily, you might be pretty happy with this stuff.</li>
            <li> This stuff is very cool. Apply just a bit, massage it in for a few seconds and scrape off with a cuticle pusher- makes all that dead skin just slough off.</li>
            <li> Works perfect for my nails. At first it was not ideal, but after the 2nd time it removed all the ugly dry cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your nails will look even  better if you hydrate them regularly (2 x a day) with cuticle oil, olive oil or cuticle cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it for a week and you will be amazed by the results.</li>
            <li> Works as stated, just don&#x27;t leave it on too long.</li>
            <li> This cuticle remover is quick, gentle, dependable, and inexpensive.  Easy to use and always works -- I never use anything else.</li>
            <li> Good at removing cuticles with the use of a cuticle pusher. Works quickly.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING! It is simple and quick to use. It&#x27;s magic!</li>
            <li> Before I tried the Sally Hansen Instant Cuticle Remover, I used an at-home nail salon-like tool to cut/file my cuticles away. My nails/cuticles looked ok, but it kind of just ate my cuticles away and my nails would never grow. It was super rough on my nail beds, and my nails would split and crack. I decided to try a cuticle remover product (this one) instead in hopes that it would be gentler, still remover my cuticles, and perhaps fix my weak/brittle nails. It definitely did all of the above!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is so easy to use. You apply it to all of your cuticles, wait about 15-30 seconds, and then gently push them back with a cuticle stick. Then just wash the product off. I use this about twice a week, and my nails look great! When I would use the at home motorized cuticle remover, my cuticles were removed, but it still looked kind of jagged. This makes my cuticles disappear and my manicures look even better, and everything just looks smooth and nice. My nails even got quite a bit healthier and grow longer too since I am not constantly abusing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second bottle of this (it does last a long time though) and I highly recommend it! This is a beauty must-have for me!</li>
            <li> Works great before applying nail wraps!</li>
            <li> Really does work in 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only product I know that actually works well enough for me not to need to cut the cuticles away</li>
            <li> This stuff actually works! I wasn&#x27;t honestly expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised. It really takes off all the hard to remove cuticle from the base and surface of the nail. It won&#x27;t remove snagged or raggedy cuticle, but it does take off the thickened parts. And no irritation! I was worried something that removes calluses would be too strong for delicate fingernail cuticle, but not so.</li>
            <li> The best. Softens cuticles nicely for a neat manicure</li>
            <li> A quick way to make your cuticles go away, just apply and use a cuticle stick to push the cuticle back after a few seconds. You don&#x27;t have to use much at a time, so the bottle will last long.</li>
            <li> nothing miraculous but fine.</li>
            <li> Does what i need it to do.</li>
            <li> Cuticles did not go away. Maybe it has to be done several times to see an effect?</li>
            <li> This is one of my must have items. I ran out a while back, to my luck I could not find it anywhere and so I bought a $30 cuticle remover from Sally&#x27;s boutique; it was horrible! I finally got smart and looked here in amazon. This instant cuticle remover from Sally Hansen is amazing!! It not only removes cuticles, but loosens callused skin and is great to remove machinery oil from hands; I have used the heck out of it! Love it and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the cuticle remover for years. It&#x27;s great for in between manicures and works very quickly, which is great for a last-minute fix. Caution: do NOT leave on longer than specified, as it will cause your finger nails to peel a bit. If you have thick, strong nails, this may not be a problem. My nails tend to run on the thin and soft side, so it may just be me.</li>
            <li> this is pretty standard for a cuticle remover.  It does remove your cuticle, but it is also very drying.  Be sure to moisturize with a good hand cream after using or you&#x27;ll end up with dry cuticles and hang nails</li>
            <li> Not sure how this works. Only used it once, will try again...</li>
            <li> eliminates the need for a cuticle cutter</li>
            <li> Excelente to remove cuticle.  It woks.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, took me a few weeks to wrangle the cuticles under control with this stuff.</li>
            <li> DOESNT REMOVE, JUST MAKES IT EASIER TO PUSH CUTICLES.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product after seeing many Youtubers recommend it. They were right! It takes 15 seconds to soften cuticles, allowing you to push them back or cut them - or both. It really helps with cuticle sticking to the side of the nails. It doesn&#x27;t burn or feel weird when left on for longer than 15 seconds. You can also use it on calluses. I use this every time I do an at-home manicure and pedicure. It allows the polish to stay on better and just looks nicer without all that rough, patchy dry skin around the nail. Definitely would repurchase this - but a little bit goes a long way - it might take a while to use up the whole thing!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t more than once a month, either.  I get nasty hangnails all around my cuticles if I make that mistake.</li>
            <li> Everyone has recommended this product and I had to try it. I don&#x27;t know if I used it wrong, but my cuticles look worse after I used it. I&#x27;m going to try it again and see if I can get a better result.</li>
            <li> Works for you downtime between professional manicures to keep cuticles manageable on hands and feet! Take a few mins for the cuticles to get moist enough to scrap away.</li>
            <li> Used to get manicures *just* to have my cuticles taken care of.  Thanks to this, I no longer have to get regular manicures.  This stuff is saving me $25 (with tip) every 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t smooth or softened!</li>
            <li> good product, fast shipping</li>
            <li> I work in health care, so dry cuticles are the bane of my existence.  This product fixes the problem while I&#x27;m in the shower. It works in 15 seconds, what more could you ask?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this product for a couple of years now. Since I go to the nail salon no more than twice a month and am no manicurist, this is used when I am in maintenance mode. I don&#x27;t know about other people&#x27;s cuticles, but mine grow like crazy and are thick and hard. It&#x27;d be nice if I used cuticle cream at night before I went to bed, but I more often than not don&#x27;t and that is when this product really cones in handy.&lt;br /&gt;The trick is to apply this to the cuticles and underneath the nail pad. Let it sit for about a minute and then use an orange stick to push down the cuticle and clean built up skin and debris under the nail type. Wash your hand immediately with warm water and soap, rinse and dry, and then repeat the process on the other hand.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff dissolves the cuticle and leaves the nails looking clean. I file my nails when I am through and buff out any ridges and then apply a couple of coats of OPI nail gloss. If you do this once a week, it will maintain your nails between visits to the nail salon.&lt;br /&gt;I use these on my toe nails as well. Works fine. My only advice is to watch the clock and never exceed the recommended time the manufacturer provides.</li>
            <li> Love this product I would definitely recommend works great and does what it&#x27;s supposed to got here on time too</li>
            <li> Bought this for my fianceé, and compared to other options, she says it&#x27;s fairly ineffective.  The bottle&#x27;s still half full, and she bought another brand.</li>
            <li> It makes it really easier to remove cuticle, but it doesn&#x27;t remove it at all. Read the instructions carefully (the timing to use it is tight).</li>
            <li> Not overly impressed have used it several times now and it doesn&#x27;t seem to remove as well as other products, won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> followed directions but it didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing. I will keep buying this every time I run out. Love love LOVE</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. Did my toes with it.  Looks good</li>
            <li> I have problem cuticles - they are quickly overgrown and I&#x27;ve found most cuticle softeners do diddly squat for me.  I apply the cuticle softener &amp; push back my cuticles, and two days later they are right back where they were before.  I started using a cuticle clipper to trim them which successfully removed my overgrown cuticles but left me with harsh, ragged edges which would sometimes bleed and then get inflamed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Sally Hansen Instant Cuticle Remover dissolves my cuticles quickly and most of the overgrowth I can simply wipe away.  The parts that remain which I end up needing to trim off with cuticle clippers are easy to remove and leave soft edges instead of thick and rough like before.  I also use it on my feet to soften skin that becomes thickened and rough when going barefoot &amp; wearing sandals a lot in the summer, or to help speed the process during desquamation.</li>
            <li> The best I have ever bought on line for my entire nail care collection.&lt;br /&gt;I set it on my cuticle area for 30 sec and used wood stick and it all removed dried cuticle so easy.&lt;br /&gt;I was also very impressed with the effect on my toe nails too.&lt;br /&gt;I did soak off process after gelish, and they were looking awful right after that.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t even wash my feet to use this product,and I was stunned how clean it looked after all.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definately come back to buy this over and over.</li>
            <li> At first the consistency of this product made me think it was nothing more than water and goo, but I do actually think it removes cuticles well. One bottle lasts an eternity.</li>
            <li> Works so fast, love it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Makes cuticle care a breeze.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic. I trim my cuticles about once every two weeks now and they look great. This stuff works almost instantly and does a great job.</li>
            <li> I use this product in combination with a metal cuticle pusher. This product helps me achieve nail salon-like results for a much cheaper price! Just be careful to thoroughly wash off this product with warm soapy water.</li>
            <li> if the instructions are followed correctly this really does work. Just make sure when rinsing off within the time of application you rinse off all of it well, or the cuticles will peel off for days.</li>
            <li> It helps if you soak your cuticles first, I recommend doing it right after you get out of the shower so your cuticles are a softer before you start.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sally Hansen for years - it is great!</li>
            <li> Just recently i have become a nail fanatic and im obsessed with taking care of my nails. This product works so well and removes the dead cuticles in seconds. I would recommend using this with the \\&quot;MASH Premium Stainless Steel Cuticle Pusher Cutter Trimmer\\&quot; it works so much better</li>
            <li> This work pretty good  I have only used it once but I like it</li>
            <li> My sally hansen indtant cuticle remover Is exactly the way I thought. I hav been using it a long time.</li>
            <li> This product for me is okay. It says you can only use it for 15 seconds and no more, I use it for longer because it doesn&#x27;t always work.</li>
            <li> i used it the same day that i had recieved it, and i used it on my feet. i was a little worried that i had wasted my money, but it turned out to be a great deal!</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me.  The first time I used it I left it on for the time stated and nothing happened.  The next time I left it on for double the time and still nothing.  I&#x27;m going back to cuticle nippers.</li>
            <li> This works great. I leave it in for 90 seconds. It&#x27;s gentle and I hardly have to trim my cuticles at all. Worth the price. You only need a very small amount so this bottle should last a long time.</li>
            <li> I use this on the bottom of my feet for pedicures. It&#x27;s just a bit of added help to keep my feet smooth always. It works well.</li>
            <li> I was thoroughly impressed by how quickly this product works. After putting it on one hand I started to use my cuticle pusher and the cuticle came off without any pain or hard work. I didn&#x27;t know it would be so easy.</li>
            <li> I have difficulty with my cuticles. I once had them removed using a fork-style trimmer with gruesome results. I have since used Sally Hansen Nails &amp; Cuticles Hand Creme to try to make amends. While this approach is more delicate, it does not treat the occasional dry, stiff bit. Enter Sally Hansen Instant Cuticle Remover. I have used this gel several times with decent results. The first few times I left the gel on a little too long (~30 seconds) and was a bit too enthusiastic about removing (er, scraping!) the excess. Afterwards, my cuticles were clean but my nails peeled slightly. If I apply the gel to each cuticle and gently wipe away the excess immediately after application, then it works for me. The gel is especially good at cleaning under the nails (see pic). Overall, I like this cuticle remover and will continue to use it until I run out but I doubt I will reorder (its nothing a little soap and warm water can&#x27;t handle).</li>
            <li> works perfectly&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I love this remover because it takes more time to grow the cuticle and the nail polish last much more</li>
            <li> Does what it says. The instruction says to soak not more than a min. But for me, it worked only after I applied it for a min and few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;I think the same could be achieved if I soak my fingers in soapy water.</li>
            <li> this stuff is great. made pushing my cuticles back so effortlessly and looking like I had my nails done professionally.</li>
            <li> This cuticle remover is awesome! I just apply a generous amount to my nail beds and push back my cuticles and gently scrap away the skin. Doing this takes the pedicure and manicure a more finished look!</li>
            <li> I have been using the cuticle remover for more than five years, it&#x27;s convinient and effective. But you need to get a good-quality spoon nail cleaner at the same time.</li>
            <li> Kinda scary how great it works lol.</li>
            <li> This stuff works FAST,  great on hands and even better on toenails.</li>
            <li> The instant cuticle remover work very well.I am so happy I purchased it!</li>
            <li> It works ok. I prefer the cuticle removing cream because it&#x27;s easier to use and you don&#x27;t need to rinse it</li>
            <li> Works well, but not are well as I thought it would, my cuticles are not &amp;#34;salon perfect&amp;#34; but maybe I haven&#x27;t gotten the technique down yet. Tried scraping after leaving on for a bit, but still had cuticle edges hanging on for dear life.</li>
            <li> It works better than the foot file alone.</li>
            <li> I purchased this at a drugstore as it was less expensive, expecting it to be incredible based on the reviews on here.  What a disappointment!  I have been fortunate to have never had out-of-control cuticles and I moisturize frequently, but I recently noticed a few nails were being crowded by the skin (it&#x27;s winter in the Northeast, so dry skin is a guarantee, especially for a germaphobe like me who washes her hands frequently).  As this was the best rated of the affordable cuticle removers, I decided to go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a disappointment.  I have tried it many times over the past few weeks, and it is no more effective than a hot water soak.  I have tried it on dry nails, nails that are still damp, nails that have been soaking in warm water, and nails fresh out of a long, hot shower.  I have used orange sticks with and without cotton, metal scrapers, a spoon, and other nails.  I have left it on for 15 seconds, 30 seconds, and a minute or longer.  No matter what I have tried, I have found it useless.  I am very disappointed, as I usually like Sally Hansen products and, as I said, my cuticles aren&#x27;t that bad (in the past, at most, I&#x27;ve just used a towel to gently press them back after washing my hands).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this to a friend, as it was a waste of money for me and a complete mystery why it works well for so many when it was completely ineffective on me.  I highly suggest seeing if a friend has this before you purchase it, so you can see whether it works for you.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of cuticle on my nails and this product makes short work of removing all the dead stuff.  I can apply it with a Q-tip which makes it easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It does what it says and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> esse liquido &amp;eacute; muito bom  para amolecer as cuticulas. passa nas cuticulas e deixa por um tempinho , dai so empurrar as cuticulas</li>
            <li> This works great on cuticles. 15 seconds on and it cleans up your nails. I am very happy with this.</li>
            <li> This cuticle remover is amazing. Unlike anything I&#x27;ve tried it gently removes excess cuticle quickly without any skin irritation. One bottle lasts almost a year as a little goes a long way. And what a great price!</li>
            <li> Great ! Thank you! Very good communication</li>
            <li> PURCHASED AS A GIFT FOR SOMEONE.  THEY LOVED IT!</li>
            <li> I use Sally Hansen Instant Cuticle remover about twice a week.  It &amp;#34;cleans up&amp;#34; my nails.</li>
            <li> Works so well! So happy I bought this!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any real results with this. My cuticles are still thick and I have to resist cutting them. Will try a few more times but will most likely not buy again.</li>
            <li> I will admit I didn&#x27;t think this stuff would work. To my surprise it worked very well.</li>
            <li> Second bottle bought!!!!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  Works like magic.  You need to follow instructions by the book.</li>
            <li> Works wonders love it</li>
            <li> This stuff works great!!!!! I was impressed, really does dissolve</li>
            <li> Disappointing.  I was excited to use tihs products after reading the reviews; however, it did not remove my cuticles.  I used a cuticle stick to push them back along with the Sally Hansen&#x27;s, but to no avail.  I have used other Sally Hansen products and liked them.  I do have thick cuticles.  Maybe this products works better on cuticles not as tough and ragged as mine.  I&#x27;ll keep looking for something better for me.</li>
            <li> Works well. Softens the cuticle so you can easily and neatly push it back. Not harsh or irritating. Use it about once every two weeks.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied with the product at all. Used exactly as directed and still had cuticles on my nails after using the product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a God send.  I have definitely learned less is more.  I only apply it to a few fingers at a time - and definitely a small strip.  It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> There is nothing instant about this cuticle remover.  I&#x27;m afraid to leave it on longer than the instruction&#x27;s maximum, but it barely softens the cuticles on my fingers.</li>
            <li> works fine, but you have to use it pretty often to keep your nails clean. I guess a product you can use at home can not be as strong as the professional ones</li>
            <li> Works well to remove cuticles...</li>
            <li> product is as stated!</li>
            <li> I am one of those people who have had cuticle galore and never knew how to control it.  This product is terrific.  Used as directed it dismisses the cuticle saying &amp;#34;so long, pest&amp;#34;.  I needed the help!  Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  Quick and easy way to keep your cuticles under control.</li>
            <li> Even though I read the reviews I was still amazed at how good this product works.  I have horrible cuticles and after one use the thickness is gone and they are smooth.  It was so easy to do but I did use a soapy fingernail brush to wash it off instead of just washing my hands.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Best Cuticle remover I first seen this product on NailPro. You should also buy the Opi Avoplex Nail and Cuticle Replenishing Oil for the best results. I&#x27;m telling you as much as I would cut myself it is a wonderful thing have these to products.</li>
            <li> i totally trust sally hansen products, they are amazing and always work perfectly fine!&lt;br /&gt;definetly it will be a nice product i&#x27;m sure!</li>
