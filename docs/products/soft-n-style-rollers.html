            <li>Love these rollers!</li>
            <li>Love these!  </li>
            <li>Great easy to use and does the job</li>
            <li>They are huge, but a great value.</li>
            <li>but why do you force everyone to buy so MANY in a package?.</li>
            <li>Totally satisfied.</li>
            <li>Love these rollers.</li>
            <li>I was expecting better results.</li>
            <li>Overall good buy!</li>
            <li>These rollers are easy to use and put a long-lasting bouncy curl to my hair.  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t believe I got 18 rollers for such a great price.</li>
            <li>The curlers work well in relatively smooth hair.  </li>
            <li>So much better for your hair than a hot curling iron.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price and super quick delivery.</li>
            <li>They work great for long hair not short hair.</li>
            <li>and they were exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>very affordable way to buy these curlers</li>
            <li>Arrived fast.</li>
            <li>Hold in my hair (as well as hair extensions) very well.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and product as pictured.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted these to work</li>
            <li>Easy to use and performed as expected.</li>
            <li>Decent product..</li>
            <li>Maybe I am not applying the right product (I have tried about 5 different products each time I&#x27;ve tried to set the rollers), but these just aren&#x27;t working out for me.</li>
            <li>and I have seriously tried about 6 different ways to successfully curl/volumize my hair, and I just can&#x27;t seem to get it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to order another set by a different company and see if maybe the Velcro is a little more soft.</li>
            <li>Little too large for my shoulder length hair, but I can make it work using smaller ones for the bangs.</li>

            <li> I think the main reason is the fact that these rollers are heavy duty Velcro.</li>
            <li> Give me the big loose curl I&#x27;m looking for</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m desperate for an easier, quicker morning routine. :)</li>
            <li> If you loose them in your room , they&#x27;ll stick to EVERYTHING.</li>
            <li> A friend with really frizzy hair tried them and she had a hard time removing them!</li>
            <li> I put them into my mostly dried hair and finish drying on low.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful or hair can get stuck/tangled.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;hair being pulled out&amp;#34; as a couple of other reviewers described.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just haven&#x27;t broken them in enough yet, but when I wrap my hair around them and let them dry/cool off, I have to TUG on them to get them out of my hair, which leaves my hair frizzy and damaged.</li>
            <li> My hair is long, but thin and wavy.</li>
            <li> I do find these rollers are somewhat difficult to remove from dry hair, and leaves the ends a little frizzy, which I tame with a little shine oil.</li>
            <li> WARNING READ ALL THE SMALL PRINT.</li>
            <li> Hard to pull out of hair.</li>
            <li> Body all in my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and these curlers will hold!  </li>
            <li> I have long hair, so when I remove each roller, I hold the base of the hair wrapped around roller as I unroll the roller</li>
            <li> They were so expensive at beauty supply store</li>
            <li> I am a hairdresser and needed these badly.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed in these.</li>

            <li> Great product at a fantastic price! If you want body in your hair, look no further! I put them into my mostly dried hair and finish drying on low. Body all in my thick hair.</li>
            <li> Perfect! They work great for long hair not short hair. You get 18 blue velcro rollers.</li>
            <li> Great price for these velcro rollers.  Easy to use and performed as expected.</li>
            <li> very affordable way to buy these curlers</li>
            <li> Decent product.. If you loose them in your room , they&#x27;ll stick to EVERYTHING. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚</li>
            <li> Great but why do you force everyone to buy so MANY in a package?. WARNING READ ALL THE SMALL PRINT. Picture does not always represent the item correctly. What am I to do with the extrasâ€¦sell them-(right) or just send them to the landfill? Any ideas?</li>
            <li> These rollers are easy to use and put a long-lasting bouncy curl to my hair.  I mix the 2&amp;#34; rollers with 1.5&amp;#34; rollers to get the style I want.  I do find these rollers are somewhat difficult to remove from dry hair, and leaves the ends a little frizzy, which I tame with a little shine oil.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast. They do what you expect. Hold in my hair (as well as hair extensions) very well. Totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love these!  I have thick hair and these curlers will hold!  So much better for your hair than a hot curling iron.</li>
            <li> I am a hairdresser and needed these badly.  They were so expensive at beauty supply store and I can&#x27;t believe I got 18 rollers for such a great price. Received promptly and they were exactly what I was expecting. Can&#x27;t wait to use.</li>
            <li> Love these rollers. Give me the big loose curl I&#x27;m looking for and you can&#x27;t beat the price for 36 rollers!</li>
            <li> These were great!! I don&#x27;t even need clips to hold them in place! They just stay!</li>
            <li> Great product for the money.</li>
            <li> Love these rollers! Wish I had ordered them sooner as they are effortless to use and my hair looks dramatically prettier, fuller, smoother! I have long hair, so when I remove each roller, I hold the base of the hair wrapped around roller as I unroll the roller and I&#x27;ve not had any issues of &amp;#34;hair pulling&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;hair being pulled out&amp;#34; as a couple of other reviewers described.</li>
            <li> No curl at all. Hard to pull out of hair. Disappointed in these. My hair is long, but thin and wavy. I was expecting better results. I left these in for two hours and got nothing!</li>
            <li> Good deal.  Ends get stuck if you don&#x27;t use end papers.</li>
            <li> as described, not a  problem with my hair tangling in it when i remove them...</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and product as pictured.  The curlers work well in relatively smooth hair.  A friend with really frizzy hair tried them and she had a hard time removing them! Overall good buy!</li>
            <li> Good product just like in olden days. Reasonable price and super quick delivery. You have to be careful or hair can get stuck/tangled. I don&#x27;t remember than being a problem when I used them 30 years ago.</li>
            <li> Great easy to use and does the job</li>
            <li> Roller was not as soft as expected.</li>
            <li> They are curlers.  They arrived on time and they work.</li>
            <li> Love these!  They create incredible volume!</li>
            <li> I really wanted these to work and I have seriously tried about 6 different ways to successfully curl/volumize my hair, and I just can&#x27;t seem to get it. I think the main reason is the fact that these rollers are heavy duty Velcro.

            <li> Great rollers.  Add height.</li>
            <li> They are huge, but a great value. Little too large for my shoulder length hair, but I can make it work using smaller ones for the bangs.</li>
            <li> Very nice rollers! Hold my hair well.</li>
