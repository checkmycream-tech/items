            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>I am soooooooooooooo happy.  </li>
            <li>I can not tell you how happy and thankful I am.  </li>
            <li>It washes out great.</li>
            <li>My hair looks great</li>
            <li>and it looks great.</li>
            <li>This hair products is good as it helps a great deal with people who have problems loosing hair.  </li>
            <li>The quality of the fibers is good.</li>
            <li>Good for in-between hair coloring.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t think quality control on FP is all that good).</li>
            <li>One good thing is that it doesn&#x27;t come off on your hands everytime you touch it.  </li>
            <li>After I applied this powder, I ran and showed my parents my &amp;#34;new hair line&amp;#34; and they were super impressed.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t so sure, however, this product is great for me.</li>
            <li>I love this Viviscal!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>nice product works just as advertised</li>
            <li>and I know it&#x27;s effective just not on bald head and be advised not to run your hair or have anyone run their hands on your hair if you have applied this on your own.  </li>
            <li>You just sprinkle them on, very lightly, and then go.</li>
            <li>It probably works better in the crown for someone who is not wearing her hair very smooth.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>but I couldn&#x27;t disagree more.</li>
            <li>Love it , recommended for hair loss.</li>
            <li>but the product color was more reddish.</li>
            <li>This is an interesting product that I can see would be a lifesaver for someone with thinning hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Until something better comes along for thinning hair, she suggests giving it a try.</li>
            <li>but like this much better.  </li>
            <li>I like the shaker top</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even got me fooled that I&#x27;ve grown more hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>These fibers lessen my insecurity about having a bald spot on the top of my head.</li>
            <li>I had layers cut on top, strategically placing strands.</li>
            <li>It gave me confidence that people won&#x27;t stare at the top of my head unless a bug has flown in it.</li>
            <li>I find Miracle Hair to be a better product.  </li>
            <li>I used to love doing my hair now</li>
            <li>I asked my mom to shine a flashlight on my hair to see if anyone would be able to tell that I basically had powder all over my head.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I did.</li>
            <li>It is just okay.</li>
            <li>I think it still looked better on my head than my hairline looked without it</li>
            <li>/&gt;In sum, happy that I tried this, as it will probably become my new choice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but then I tried just taking the container and pressing it lightly on my scalp in the areas needed and it worked much better this way.</li>
            <li>I have two bold areas on the back of my hair that get perfectly covered with Viviscal.</li>
            <li>So quick and easy!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons- shaker doesn&#x27;t distribute fibers easily.</li>
            <li>The fibers are easy to apply --just shake &#x27;n go.</li>
            <li>like you&#x27;re peppering eggs, you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>But, when the item arrives 1/3 full or if seen in stores not fully filled, then the price of $12.00 or more is not one to consider for this item...</li>
            <li>Super!</li>
            <li>After a couple of times figuring out where to put it, how much to apply and how to camouflage it, I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I got a jar of this for free through the Amazon Vine program and thought I&#x27;d check it out.</li>
            <li>Then brush lightly with comb or fingers ...but don&#x27;t rub scalp,&lt;br /&gt;only hair.</li>
            <li>I use a light hairspray after I apply the fibers just to ensure they &amp;#34;stay&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>if not fully filled up to the contained bottle it arrives in as.</li>
            <li>So light, not sticky, stays on until you wash your hair.  </li>
            <li>It takes a bit of doing to get it right, but it works well and for the most part stays put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, if you have too much skin showing on top of your head, I don&#x27;t recommend this product at all.</li>
            <li>stuff is not bad.</li>
            <li>You need to only do one or two light presses as the fibers are real fine.</li>
            <li>you haven&#x27;t used a fiber filler before, it works as described in other reviews: it does not grow hair, but it does a great job of filling in and concealing thinning areas.</li>
            <li>I really liked the spray it was easy and convenient and lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li>, it stayed on for long periods of time and it looked really good.  </li>
            <li>No matter how much hair spray you use, it comes off rather easily.</li>
            <li>It is effective in giving the appearance of more hair, however, it may be a little tricky to apply.</li>
            <li>I find it primarily useful when the gray roots start peeping through.</li>
            <li>I have to point out that I absolutely love that it comes in a clear bottle</li>
            <li>It differs from Fixplant in that the filler is very fine and less clingy, so that you lose more during application to the scalp.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just not the right product for me</li>
            <li>It blends right in.</li>
            <li>and I put it right onto my hair and the scalp</li>
            <li>If you really need something to cover up your thinning hair for special occasions or confidence, I would suggest the spray.</li>
            <li>Not ideal for what I need, but I am sure it would be perfect to fill in thinning hair or a balding spot at the back of the head that men have.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s sloppy, but it&#x27;s really kind of amazing</li>
            <li>One really can&#x27;t tell the difference between the fibers and your hair!</li>
            <li>I would advise practicing first, before going out.</li>
            <li>However if you use it in tandem it actually achieves a better effect than either would alone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad product for under $20, but not at the new price of $30.  </li>
            <li>The fibers also fall off easily, so I don&#x27;t recommend wearing a white top or using white sheets.</li>
            <li>Too much can look obvious and comical.  </li>
            <li>Far far better than this TRASH</li>
            <li>I love this product it really hides open spaces in your hair.</li>
            <li>I found the price to be very affordable-- not much less expensive than the drug store, but with Amazon Prime&#x27;s free two day shipping, the already discounted price and the many uses I&#x27;m getting out of one bottle, I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>My hair color is a very dark brown, almost black, so the color was perfect.  </li>
            <li>I found it slightly more resilient, however, i.e. it seemed to last longer before a new application was needed.</li>
            <li>These really work.  </li>
            <li>Thinning hair can be a real issue for women.</li>
            <li>I really like how this product works.  </li>
            <li>Great to hide thin spots&lt;br</li>
            <li>no thin sections.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the bottle against the scalp area move lightly in a circular motion very briefly..</li>
            <li>Priced reasonable</li>
            <li>My scalp at my part is very visible.  </li>
            <li>Then I tried the fibers and they really helped.</li>
            <li>It has worked very well.</li>
            <li>My hair loss was not as much as the picture on the box ...</li>
            <li>That stuff really works.</li>
            <li>and  cover the scalp  very well  </li>
            <li>The fibers look like the frizzies so for me when I am pulling my hair back and want a smooth finish</li>
            <li>but does the job very well.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>With the other product, I&#x27;m always out when I need it most</li>
            <li>In fact, when I got this I was already using Fixplant, which I&#x27;d found more than adequate if not spectacular.</li>
            <li>how something so simple can create the illusion of a full head of hair.  </li>
            <li>There are times when I&#x27;m looking at my own head of hair, and I&#x27;m not sure which is my hair and which is the product.  </li>
            <li>Must be very careful in applying , apparently, as I&#x27;ve read and been informed that particles will stain what it comes in contact with though effective in doing its job by filling the areas of thinning hair, not bald head.</li>
            <li>One caveat: It tends to create build up after a couple of uses, especially if you use gels, etc., but a quick shampoo clears it up.</li>
            <li>so my main issue was covering the scalp sections showing in my part line.</li>
            <li>I had to take medicine that made my hair fall out when I was younger and most of it has not grown back.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have thinning on the top of my head; even though I have curly hair, you could still see a little scalp.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s texture is a little more grainy, but works just as well.</li>
            <li>powder is actually more like narrow flakes that are charged or &amp;#34;magnitized&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>so I predominantly wear my hair in the cute messy bun style...for about eight months out of the year.</li>
            <li>I would definitely use it again if the price was right.</li>
            <li>More powder comes out in applying this, which worried me at first, but it takes only a few shakes</li>
            <li>That is what I get for trying something new.</li>
            <li>I was turned on to Viviscal after I got a coupon in the Sunday paper for the new women&#x27;s vitamins.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very much like hair in appearance as it is to be one of such.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, but I live in Arizona and it gets up to 1000 degrees here in the summer</li>
            <li>It lasts as long as I don&#x27;t wash my hair; shampoo and water washes it right off.</li>
            <li>Probably because of this it requires more to achieve the same effect, which is why the bottle didn&#x27;t last nearly as long as one of Fixplant.</li>
            <li>it is much less and concentrated in the top back of my head</li>
            <li>the bottle is slighty larger giving you a little more product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 32 and in the last year or two, my hair has started thinning so much; my scalp seemed to be giving me the stink eye every time I looked in the mirror.</li>
            <li>THe first day it did not stay too long, when I checked up on my hair</li>
            <li>Fibers look natural.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>That saved me considerable time.</li>
            <li>If you touch your hair or heaven forbid scratch your head don&#x27;t be surprised to find your fingers covered in this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been so self conscious and depressed over the issue.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a gal in her early 30&#x27;s and have hair-loss/thinning.  </li>
            <li>Lastly, wear a face mask when applying , close your eyes as well, due to not wanting to inhale this fine fiber hair like particles to enter inside your mouth, nose or eyes.</li>
            <li>If you touch your hair, itch your head, or smooth your hair down with this on, a little will get on your hands so be careful when touching your head with this product in.</li>
            <li>This simple bottle has given me so much confidence back, I would highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li>Because, damn it, the hair on the back of my head is thinning and who the hell wants to walk into the grocery store and see a big reflective spot on one&#x27;s dome as he walks beneath the security camera?</li>
            <li>So, it was super obvious a dark reddish brown.</li>
            <li>I do have to go over super bare areas a few times with powder, but this does cover the white/bald spots, I promise.</li>
            <li>I hold my left hand at my forehead so it doesn&#x27;t get on my face and this has worked well for me so far.</li>
            <li>It does the job reasonably well, though I&#x27;ve had to be careful in application to avoid clumps of powder on my scalp.</li>
            <li>I could barely tell after he used it.</li>
            <li>You barely know it&#x27;s there</li>
            <li>This is not a miracle cure, but it is an affordable safe measure that can disguise the thin spots a bit.</li>
            <li>in all I can&#x27;t say I think this product is better that Fixplant, though whether it is worse is a matter of opinion.</li>
            <li>This is a definite repeat buy for me until I grow my natural hair back.</li>
            <li>The first time I used the product I was a little unsure how to apply it.</li>
            <li>Or at least the look of it by covering the scalp enough to make it look full again.  </li>
            <li>Shake too much and you have a giant black spot on your scalp.</li>
            <li>Even a little was too much for me.  </li>

            <li> stuff is not bad.</li>
            <li> You need to only do one or two light presses as the fibers are real fine.</li>
            <li> you haven&#x27;t used a fiber filler before, it works as described in other reviews: it does not grow hair, but it does a great job of filling in and concealing thinning areas.</li>
            <li> I really liked the spray it was easy and convenient and lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li> , it stayed on for long periods of time and it looked really good.  </li>
            <li> No matter how much hair spray you use, it comes off rather easily.</li>
            <li> It is effective in giving the appearance of more hair, however, it may be a little tricky to apply.</li>
            <li> I find it primarily useful when the gray roots start peeping through.</li>
            <li> I have to point out that I absolutely love that it comes in a clear bottle</li>
            <li> It differs from Fixplant in that the filler is very fine and less clingy, so that you lose more during application to the scalp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not the right product for me</li>
            <li> It blends right in.</li>
            <li> and I put it right onto my hair and the scalp</li>
            <li> If you really need something to cover up your thinning hair for special occasions or confidence, I would suggest the spray.</li>
            <li> Not ideal for what I need, but I am sure it would be perfect to fill in thinning hair or a balding spot at the back of the head that men have.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s sloppy, but it&#x27;s really kind of amazing</li>
            <li> One really can&#x27;t tell the difference between the fibers and your hair!</li>
            <li> I would advise practicing first, before going out.</li>
            <li> However if you use it in tandem it actually achieves a better effect than either would alone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad product for under $20, but not at the new price of $30.  </li>
            <li> The fibers also fall off easily, so I don&#x27;t recommend wearing a white top or using white sheets.</li>
            <li> Too much can look obvious and comical.  </li>
            <li> Far far better than this TRASH</li>
            <li> I love this product it really hides open spaces in your hair.</li>
            <li> I found the price to be very affordable-- not much less expensive than the drug store, but with Amazon Prime&#x27;s free two day shipping, the already discounted price and the many uses I&#x27;m getting out of one bottle, I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> My hair color is a very dark brown, almost black, so the color was perfect.  </li>
            <li> I found it slightly more resilient, however, i.e. it seemed to last longer before a new application was needed.</li>
            <li> These really work.  </li>
            <li> Thinning hair can be a real issue for women.</li>
            <li> I really like how this product works.  </li>
            <li> Great to hide thin spots&lt;br</li>
            <li> no thin sections.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the bottle against the scalp area move lightly in a circular motion very briefly..</li>
            <li> Priced reasonable</li>
            <li> My scalp at my part is very visible.  </li>
            <li> Then I tried the fibers and they really helped.</li>
            <li> It has worked very well.</li>
            <li> My hair loss was not as much as the picture on the box ...</li>
            <li> That stuff really works.</li>
            <li> and  cover the scalp  very well  </li>
            <li> The fibers look like the frizzies so for me when I am pulling my hair back and want a smooth finish</li>
            <li> but does the job very well.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> With the other product, I&#x27;m always out when I need it most</li>
            <li> In fact, when I got this I was already using Fixplant, which I&#x27;d found more than adequate if not spectacular.</li>
            <li> how something so simple can create the illusion of a full head of hair.  </li>
            <li> There are times when I&#x27;m looking at my own head of hair, and I&#x27;m not sure which is my hair and which is the product.  </li>
            <li> Must be very careful in applying , apparently, as I&#x27;ve read and been informed that particles will stain what it comes in contact with though effective in doing its job by filling the areas of thinning hair, not bald head.</li>
            <li> One caveat: It tends to create build up after a couple of uses, especially if you use gels, etc., but a quick shampoo clears it up.</li>
            <li> so my main issue was covering the scalp sections showing in my part line.</li>
            <li> I had to take medicine that made my hair fall out when I was younger and most of it has not grown back.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have thinning on the top of my head; even though I have curly hair, you could still see a little scalp.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s texture is a little more grainy, but works just as well.</li>
            <li> powder is actually more like narrow flakes that are charged or &amp;#34;magnitized&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> so I predominantly wear my hair in the cute messy bun style...for about eight months out of the year.</li>
            <li> I would definitely use it again if the price was right.</li>
            <li> More powder comes out in applying this, which worried me at first, but it takes only a few shakes</li>
            <li> That is what I get for trying something new.</li>
            <li> I was turned on to Viviscal after I got a coupon in the Sunday paper for the new women&#x27;s vitamins.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very much like hair in appearance as it is to be one of such.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, but I live in Arizona and it gets up to 1000 degrees here in the summer</li>
            <li> It lasts as long as I don&#x27;t wash my hair; shampoo and water washes it right off.</li>
            <li> Probably because of this it requires more to achieve the same effect, which is why the bottle didn&#x27;t last nearly as long as one of Fixplant.</li>
            <li> it is much less and concentrated in the top back of my head</li>
            <li> the bottle is slighty larger giving you a little more product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 32 and in the last year or two, my hair has started thinning so much; my scalp seemed to be giving me the stink eye every time I looked in the mirror.</li>
            <li> THe first day it did not stay too long, when I checked up on my hair</li>
            <li> Fibers look natural.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> That saved me considerable time.</li>
            <li> If you touch your hair or heaven forbid scratch your head don&#x27;t be surprised to find your fingers covered in this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been so self conscious and depressed over the issue.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a gal in her early 30&#x27;s and have hair-loss/thinning.  </li>
            <li> Lastly, wear a face mask when applying , close your eyes as well, due to not wanting to inhale this fine fiber hair like particles to enter inside your mouth, nose or eyes.</li>
            <li> If you touch your hair, itch your head, or smooth your hair down with this on, a little will get on your hands so be careful when touching your head with this product in.</li>
            <li> This simple bottle has given me so much confidence back, I would highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li> Because, damn it, the hair on the back of my head is thinning and who the hell wants to walk into the grocery store and see a big reflective spot on one&#x27;s dome as he walks beneath the security camera?</li>
            <li> So, it was super obvious a dark reddish brown.</li>
            <li> I do have to go over super bare areas a few times with powder, but this does cover the white/bald spots, I promise.</li>
            <li> I hold my left hand at my forehead so it doesn&#x27;t get on my face and this has worked well for me so far.</li>
            <li> It does the job reasonably well, though I&#x27;ve had to be careful in application to avoid clumps of powder on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I could barely tell after he used it.</li>
            <li> You barely know it&#x27;s there</li>
            <li> This is not a miracle cure, but it is an affordable safe measure that can disguise the thin spots a bit.</li>
            <li> in all I can&#x27;t say I think this product is better that Fixplant, though whether it is worse is a matter of opinion.</li>
            <li> This is a definite repeat buy for me until I grow my natural hair back.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the product I was a little unsure how to apply it.</li>
            <li> Or at least the look of it by covering the scalp enough to make it look full again.  </li>
            <li> Shake too much and you have a giant black spot on your scalp.</li>
            <li> Even a little was too much for me.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, adding a subtle illusion of more hair to your look.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure I really needed to do that then.</li>
            <li> but this stuff doesn&#x27;t last as long.  </li>
            <li> I normally order another a different brand and their dark brown is dark brown with no red undertone.  </li>
            <li> The filler really did stick but was hard to move or remove to get it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the right color but after you shake it onto your scalp, it&#x27;s very hard to move around and blend into the hair around it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also better-priced (at least on Amazon) and I appreciate the transparent jar that allows you to see how much you have left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve long used Toppik to conceal my thinning hair.</li>
            <li> The viviscal wears off during a long day making my part look like I had leopard spots tattooed on my head.  </li>
            <li> I have switched to those hair color sticks that cover grey when you are in between colors</li>
            <li> I have china white skin and pitch black hair...think Snow White.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now going to try their other products to see if there might be hope for growing my hair back.</li>
            <li> I just sprinkle it on the part, gently tap it down, use a little hair spray and voila!....</li>
            <li> Arrived early in an open sealed, half empty and messy all over as it reveals how sticky it remains.  </li>
            <li> I picked this up for a relative who has slightly thinning hair.</li>
            <li> When I style my hair as usual and I look in the mirror, there&#x27;s not a blank spot glaring back at me.</li>
            <li> As a woman, my hair was my crown of glory, over the past several years it has gotten thinner and thinner especially around the crown.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, when you have a ceiling fan and a floor fan going when you apply this when it&#x27;s hot as b@ll$ outside, it will go everywhere.</li>
            <li> So the second use, i put a little hair spray after.</li>
            <li> The directions say to spray a little hair spray for added protection, but I only did it for rainy days</li>
            <li> Just add in increments and lightly fluff hair.</li>
            <li> Similar to other hair fillers, works well to cover up the thinness and grey when used in small doses.  </li>
            <li> She followed the instruction, used very little, and kept it away from her hairline near her forehead (the place where you don&#x27;t want little frizzy hairs popping up.)</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about using a dark brown/black color in Viviscal, but I actually prefer it.</li>
            <li> First it doesn&#x27;t come in black only and filling in black hair with dark brown fibers is not a perfect match.</li>
            <li> I have tried other hair fiber products.  </li>
            <li> I think it was due to a stressful life event but unsure - it may be hereditary.</li>
            <li> These fibers can actually help hide the thin spots and thicken the hair enough so that the scalp isn&#x27;t as noticeable.</li>
            <li> More of my scalp is visible now making me miserable and self conscious.</li>
            <li> It is messy and it&#x27;s difficult to apply it in the right place.  </li>
            <li> have naturally black hair that is currently dyed &amp;#34;Natural Black.&amp;#34; I used the black Toppik, which almost has a green tint to it in heavy concentration (heavier than I&#x27;d apply, but as it collects when wiping the counter, etc.).</li>
            <li> There dark brown seems to be a bit lighter than what I&#x27;m used to.  </li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and purchased the dark brown fiber color</li>
            <li> I ordered the dark brown/black.  </li>
            <li> but this brand has a reddish tone in the dark brown.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Depending on how dark your skin is, you might have to apply a lot like I do.</li>
            <li> but it is not worth the price.</li>
            <li> This stuff hides the thin spots and looks completely natural.  </li>
            <li> I was feeling so down about my hair thinning.</li>
            <li> It said brown/black my hair is black and that is the one yhey send tried it once it looks brown.</li>
            <li> I have black and brown and just ordered gray for my mom.</li>
            <li> My uncle has slight baldness and wore hats all the time because of it..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I have oily hair or not, but it just got all over my clothes and made a mess.  </li>
            <li> I found it hard to work with when you want to touch up, or cover a small, specific area.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She washes her hair every other day, and Viviscal stayed on her hair (very little evidence of it on her</li>
            <li> It does fill in if you are thinning a little.</li>
            <li> Sprinkle a little of this and the gray becomes unnoticeable.</li>
            <li> fibers on my head which helped a little</li>
            <li> It is a little messy to shake on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read comments saying the product is messy</li>
            <li> Pls DONOT waste your money.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my hair thinned dramatically after some medication I have been on for a few years.  </li>
            <li> I was going to try it out a few times and then use it for my wedding in hopes that my scalp would not be so viable in photos.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a teeny bit messy if you apply it the way the directions say to apply it.</li>
            <li> After shampooing, I dry my hair and style it; then I shake some Viviscal fibers on the thin spots and finish with a little hairspray.  </li>
            <li> This product allows me another week or two between coloring and it takes very little product to do the job.</li>
            <li> I started looking for another product that was a little less expensive and found this one for a few dollars less and</li>
            <li> I read in one of the reviews that it also works on covering small areas of gray.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable you cannot tell and it covers the thining hair</li>
            <li> I have dark hair and hate my white scalp showing through.  </li>
            <li> I have thin hair on my temples and a little sprinkle of this (I run my fingers through it to distribute and soften) and voila!</li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t go crazy, shaking it all over your head</li>
            <li> but its been getting a little expensive.</li>
            <li> They can be irritating .</li>
            <li> My front hairline has gotten dreadfully thin from misuse of those snap combs</li>
            <li> I used this to fill in the spots so it didn&#x27;t look as thin.  </li>
            <li> NO MORE!!!</li>
            <li> Maybe I did it wrong?  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re nervous or skeptical, just give it a try.</li>
            <li> my hair gel failed.  </li>
            <li> Not a fan. :-(</li>
            <li> She just sprayed at the base of my hair and it covered the thinning hair</li>
            <li> I just hate it.</li>
            <li> I hated it.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed if you purchase this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably my worst critic and it doesn&#x27;t look streaked or blotchy on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Worst ever product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s devastating for me.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My issue is not with the actual fibers, but with the color.  I have tried other hair fiber products.  There dark brown seems to be a bit lighter than what I&#x27;m used to.  The quality of the fibers is good.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product.  It is messy and it&#x27;s difficult to apply it in the right place.  Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the right color but after you shake it onto your scalp, it&#x27;s very hard to move around and blend into the hair around it.</li>
            <li> These really work.  I was impressed!  So quick and easy!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product. I&#x27;m 32 and in the last year or two, my hair has started thinning so much; my scalp seemed to be giving me the stink eye every time I looked in the mirror. I got this product on a whim and I&#x27;m so glad I did. I&#x27;ve read comments saying the product is messy but I couldn&#x27;t disagree more. As long as you don&#x27;t go crazy, shaking it all over your head like you&#x27;re peppering eggs, you&#x27;ll be fine. I hold my left hand at my forehead so it doesn&#x27;t get on my face and this has worked well for me so far. It lasts as long as I don&#x27;t wash my hair; shampoo and water washes it right off. I&#x27;m probably my worst critic and it doesn&#x27;t look streaked or blotchy on my scalp. I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to hide their scalp showing through their thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I have been self-conscious for years about my thinning hair, especially around my part and crown.  I have dark hair and hate my white scalp showing through.  This stuff hides the thin spots and looks completely natural.  It does not come off on my pillowcase.  After shampooing, I dry my hair and style it; then I shake some Viviscal fibers on the thin spots and finish with a little hairspray.  Voila!  I&#x27;m very happy!</li>
            <li> I love this Viviscal! It does fill in if you are thinning a little. I find it primarily useful when the gray roots start peeping through. Sprinkle a little of this and the gray becomes unnoticeable. This product allows me another week or two between coloring and it takes very little product to do the job. You won&#x27;t be disappointed if you purchase this! One really can&#x27;t tell the difference between the fibers and your hair!</li>
            <li> nice product works just as advertised</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not the right product for me</li>
            <li> Nice quality item!!! Great price!!! It perfectly blends with my hair color! It makes my hair look thicker and covers my scalp.  I would definitely recommend this to my friends!!!</li>
            <li> Love it , recommended for hair loss.</li>
            <li> Thinning hair can be a real issue for women. These fibers can actually help hide the thin spots and thicken the hair enough so that the scalp isn&#x27;t as noticeable. You just sprinkle them on, very lightly, and then go. This is not a miracle cure, but it is an affordable safe measure that can disguise the thin spots a bit.</li>
            <li> I really like how this product works.  It does a excellent job although the color is not as matching.  I have dark brown hair and purchased the dark brown fiber color but the product color was more reddish. This is why I gave the product 3 stars and not 5.</li>
            <li> This is an interesting product that I can see would be a lifesaver for someone with thinning hair. I read in one of the reviews that it also works on covering small areas of gray. I wanted to fill in my hairline so my hair looks thicker and to cover the temples. I found it hard to work with when you want to touch up, or cover a small, specific area. The filler really did stick but was hard to move or remove to get it right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The powder is actually more like narrow flakes that are charged or &amp;#34;magnitized&amp;#34; -- static-ey. It reminds me of the child&#x27;s toy where you use a magnet to place &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; on a bald characters face or head. Not ideal for what I need, but I am sure it would be perfect to fill in thinning hair or a balding spot at the back of the head that men have.</li>
            <li> It said brown/black my hair is black and that is the one yhey send tried it once it looks brown.</li>
            <li> My aunt is going through menopause, and one of the issues she&#x27;s faced is hair loss. While looking for various solutions (vitamins, hair thickening grooming products), the idea of a hair &#x27;filler&#x27; came up. She gave Viviscal a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly, it worked! She followed the instruction, used very little, and kept it away from her hairline near her forehead (the place where you don&#x27;t want little frizzy hairs popping up.) She used hairspray to keep it in place.&lt;br /&gt;She washes her hair every other day, and Viviscal stayed on her hair (very little evidence of it on her pillowcase.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s recommending it to her friends. She said that there is a learning curve to this, so it&#x27;s not something you want to use the day you&#x27;ve got a big interview. It takes a bit of doing to get it right, but it works well and for the most part stays put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until something better comes along for thinning hair, she suggests giving it a try.</li>
            <li> This hair products is good as it helps a great deal with people who have problems loosing hair.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I ordered the dark brown/black.  I did get that but this brand has a reddish tone in the dark brown. I have no red in my hair. So, it was super obvious a dark reddish brown. I hated it. I normally order another a different brand and their dark brown is dark brown with no red undertone.  That is what I get for trying something new.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Don&#x27;t know how I got along all these years without it!!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! It blends right in. THe first day it did not stay too long, when I checked up on my hair it seemed like it had fallen. So the second use, i put a little hair spray after. Worked like a miracle.</li>
            <li> Pros- Makes hair look fuller. Fibers look natural. Great to hide thin spots&lt;br /&gt;Cons- shaker doesn&#x27;t distribute fibers easily. Shake too much and you have a giant black spot on your scalp. The fibers also fall off easily, so I don&#x27;t recommend wearing a white top or using white sheets. Not enough color selection either. Had to dye my hair to match</li>
            <li> This stuff got everywhere!  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I have oily hair or not, but it just got all over my clothes and made a mess.  Maybe I did it wrong?  Not a fan. :-(</li>
            <li> I picked this up for a relative who has slightly thinning hair. Similar to other hair fillers, works well to cover up the thinness and grey when used in small doses.  Just add in increments and lightly fluff hair. I would advise practicing first, before going out. Too much can look obvious and comical.  Good for in-between hair coloring.</li>
            <li> I have thinning on the top of my head; even though I have curly hair, you could still see a little scalp.  Even a little was too much for me.  I have used Topik but like this much better.  I like the shaker top - the fibers go where you want them to go.  And it does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> I have two bold areas on the back of my hair that get perfectly covered with Viviscal.</li>
            <li> Worst ever product. Fibers stick to everything that it comes in contact. When I woke up in the morning there are fibers all over my bed. Pls DONOT waste your money. Used Toppik and worked well for me. Far far better than this TRASH</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s sloppy, but it&#x27;s really kind of amazing how something so simple can create the illusion of a full head of hair.  I was pleasantly surprised.  And it&#x27;s also relatively inexpensive.  There are times when I&#x27;m looking at my own head of hair, and I&#x27;m not sure which is my hair and which is the product.  It&#x27;s even got me fooled that I&#x27;ve grown more hair.</li>
            <li> I was turned on to Viviscal after I got a coupon in the Sunday paper for the new women&#x27;s vitamins. I went to the drug store to get the vitamins when I noticed the hair flakes. Preferring Amazon&#x27;s return policy over my drug store&#x27;s I ordered this. I&#x27;m glad I did. The fibers are easy to apply --just shake &#x27;n go. They even stay in place for days (assuming you don&#x27;t wash them out). The directions say to spray a little hair spray for added protection, but I only did it for rainy days and I&#x27;m not sure I really needed to do that then. I&#x27;m trying to get my hair that I somehow lost in droves to come back and I worried about the flakes clogging my roots. I don&#x27;t have the impression at all that the fibers are doing that. I found the price to be very affordable-- not much less expensive than the drug store, but with Amazon Prime&#x27;s free two day shipping, the already discounted price and the many uses I&#x27;m getting out of one bottle, I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase. These fibers lessen my insecurity about having a bald spot on the top of my head. When I style my hair as usual and I look in the mirror, there&#x27;s not a blank spot glaring back at me. This is a definite repeat buy for me until I grow my natural hair back.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it. I was feeling so down about my hair thinning. I had layers cut on top, strategically placing strands. NO MORE!!! not with Viviscal Hair Fibers. I just sprinkle it on the part, gently tap it down, use a little hair spray and voila!....no thin sections.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t live without it. It gave me confidence that people won&#x27;t stare at the top of my head unless a bug has flown in it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! I have thin hair on my temples and a little sprinkle of this (I run my fingers through it to distribute and soften) and voila! I&#x27;ve asked my family to &#x27;inspect&#x27; my hair when it&#x27;s on and it&#x27;s undetectable. I have black and brown and just ordered gray for my mom. They&#x27;re all great. One caveat: It tends to create build up after a couple of uses, especially if you use gels, etc., but a quick shampoo clears it up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad product for under $20, but not at the new price of $30.  You can buy cocoa powder and get the same results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve long used Toppik to conceal my thinning hair. It does the job reasonably well, though I&#x27;ve had to be careful in application to avoid clumps of powder on my scalp. I just started using this (received a sample) and I plan to make the switch. More powder comes out in applying this, which worried me at first, but it takes only a few shakes and it just did not clump on my scalp like Toppik does. That saved me considerable time. It&#x27;s also better-priced (at least on Amazon) and I appreciate the transparent jar that allows you to see how much you have left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally black hair that is currently dyed &amp;#34;Natural Black.&amp;#34; I used the black Toppik, which almost has a green tint to it in heavy concentration (heavier than I&#x27;d apply, but as it collects when wiping the counter, etc.). I was a little nervous about using a dark brown/black color in Viviscal, but I actually prefer it. Both products are going to leave a matte finish, but this seemed to blend better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Toppik seemed to make my scalp itch and exacerbate my dandruff. I can&#x27;t think of any legitimate reason why that would be the case, but it did. Since using Viviscal, I haven&#x27;t had either problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum, happy that I tried this, as it will probably become my new choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t used a fiber filler before, it works as described in other reviews: it does not grow hair, but it does a great job of filling in and concealing thinning areas. If you&#x27;re nervous or skeptical, just give it a try.</li>
            <li> I got a jar of this for free through the Amazon Vine program and thought I&#x27;d check it out. Why? Because, damn it, the hair on the back of my head is thinning and who the hell wants to walk into the grocery store and see a big reflective spot on one&#x27;s dome as he walks beneath the security camera? No this decaying middle-aged specimen. In fact, when I got this I was already using Fixplant, which I&#x27;d found more than adequate if not spectacular. So, here is my verdict on the experience I had with this product, which I think may be semi-valuable as I have something to compare it to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is not bad. It does the job in question, which is to thicken the hair you have. It differs from Fixplant in that the filler is very fine and less clingy, so that you lose more during application to the scalp. Probably because of this it requires more to achieve the same effect, which is why the bottle didn&#x27;t last nearly as long as one of Fixplant. I found it slightly more resilient, however, i.e. it seemed to last longer before a new application was needed. And lIke Fixplant it washes out immediately when you shower. I had some issue with the coloring not matching the description -- &amp;#34;dark brown/black&amp;#34; actually looked a lot like medium brown to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I can&#x27;t say I think this product is better that Fixplant, though whether it is worse is a matter of opinion. (I don&#x27;t think quality control on FP is all that good). However if you use it in tandem it actually achieves a better effect than either would alone. I would definitely use it again if the price was right.</li>
            <li> Super! Perfect.&lt;br /&gt; Only issue was getting it all over the place, sink floor etc. Here&#x27;s a tip to make it last longer and not make a mess.&lt;br /&gt;Hold the bottle against the scalp area move lightly in a circular motion very briefly.. Then brush lightly with comb or fingers ...but don&#x27;t rub scalp,&lt;br /&gt;only hair. It falls into place. I&#x27;d rinse out before bed so particles are not on your pillow. They can be irritating .</li>
            <li> I love this product it really hides open spaces in your hair. It stays on until you wash it off.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. Had to try it. Works great. Unbelievable. You must try it. You have to try it. Priced reasonable</li>
            <li> I find Miracle Hair to be a better product.  It&#x27;s been only a week and I am already halfway through the jar.  If you touch your hair or heaven forbid scratch your head don&#x27;t be surprised to find your fingers covered in this stuff.  It&#x27;s the same with Miracle Hair but this stuff doesn&#x27;t last as long.  No matter how much hair spray you use, it comes off rather easily.</li>
            <li> I am soooooooooooooo happy.  As a woman, my hair was my crown of glory, over the past several years it has gotten thinner and thinner especially around the crown.  I&#x27;ve been so self conscious and depressed over the issue.  This product gave me my hair back!!! Or at least the look of it by covering the scalp enough to make it look full again.  I can not tell you how happy and thankful I am.  woooooooohooooooooooo!!!!</li>
            <li> I like to think of this stuff as makeup for my hair. It is effective in giving the appearance of more hair, however, it may be a little tricky to apply. A little goes a long way, adding a subtle illusion of more hair to your look. Use sparingly on thinning regions (not advised for bald spots) and try to blend if possible. I apply a tad after styling and finish with a touch of hairspray.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my hair thinned dramatically after some medication I have been on for a few years.  My scalp at my part is very visible.  I was going to try it out a few times and then use it for my wedding in hopes that my scalp would not be so viable in photos.  Now after you style your hair you shake this on, a bit like a spice shaker onto your part until the scalp is no longer visible.  My hair color is a very dark brown, almost black, so the color was perfect.  It is a little messy to shake on.  It does work, it does cover, however, for my wedding I went to a stylist who saw the thing areas and said I have just the thing.  She used bumble and bumble to cover my thing hair.  I would liken that to costume hair color spray.  She just sprayed at the base of my hair and it covered the thinning hair, it stayed on for long periods of time and it looked really good.  The viviscal wears off during a long day making my part look like I had leopard spots tattooed on my head.  I really liked the spray it was easy and convenient and lasted a long time.  If you really need something to cover up your thinning hair for special occasions or confidence, I would suggest the spray.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Toppik but its been getting a little expensive. I started looking for another product that was a little less expensive and found this one for a few dollars less and the bottle is slighty larger giving you a little more product. It&#x27;s texture is a little more grainy, but works just as well. I have to point out that I absolutely love that it comes in a clear bottle so I can see when I&#x27;m running low. With the other product, I&#x27;m always out when I need it most and I can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
            <li> I started losing my hair about 5 months ago. I think it was due to a stressful life event but unsure - it may be hereditary. More of my scalp is visible now making me miserable and self conscious. I used to love doing my hair now I just hate it. Then I tried the fibers and they really helped. I went months just using a makeup brush and &amp;#34;dabbing&amp;#34; fibers on my head which helped a little but then I tried just taking the container and pressing it lightly on my scalp in the areas needed and it worked much better this way. You need to only do one or two light presses as the fibers are real fine. It matched my hair color and cannot even see any scalp and hair looks fuller in that spot. I was very happy as these fibers give me some temporary cosmetic relief as I try to figure out what to do about this hair loss (I am also taking Viviscail pills and biotin and using bosley shampoo). I use a light hairspray after I apply the fibers just to ensure they &amp;#34;stay&amp;#34;. It has worked very well. My hair loss was not as much as the picture on the box ... it is much less and concentrated in the top back of my head so my main issue was covering the scalp sections showing in my part line. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> this product really works--covers up where it should---but it is somewhat messy otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> My uncle has slight baldness and wore hats all the time because of it..That stuff really works. I could barely tell after he used it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t rub off on hats or clothing  and  cover the scalp  very well  I  would recommend  this to anyone who has a problem w/thinning hair</li>
            <li> Unbelievable you cannot tell and it covers the thining hair</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t so sure, however, this product is great for me. I have naturally curly hair, but I live in Arizona and it gets up to 1000 degrees here in the summer so I predominantly wear my hair in the cute messy bun style...for about eight months out of the year. I had to take medicine that made my hair fall out when I was younger and most of it has not grown back. I have tried vitamins, shampoos, etc. to no avail. I read about this product in a magazine and I remembered I had seen Joan Rivers talk about a product similar to this in an interview I caught one time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a teeny bit messy if you apply it the way the directions say to apply it. I use a big blush brush and pour the powder into the lid and apply it that way. The directions say to shake it above the area you want to cover. Needless to say, when you have a ceiling fan and a floor fan going when you apply this when it&#x27;s hot as b@ll$ outside, it will go everywhere. It was in the cracks of my ears, on my neck, and on my forehead for heaven’s sake! If you touch your hair, itch your head, or smooth your hair down with this on, a little will get on your hands so be careful when touching your head with this product in. It washes out great. No residue or remnants anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending on how dark your skin is, you might have to apply a lot like I do. I have china white skin and pitch black hair...think Snow White. You can imagine how white my scalp is. I do have to go over super bare areas a few times with powder, but this does cover the white/bald spots, I promise. It even covers some of my baby glitter strands (gray hair), which is an added bonus in my opinion. After I applied this powder, I ran and showed my parents my &amp;#34;new hair line&amp;#34; and they were super impressed. I asked my mom to shine a flashlight on my hair to see if anyone would be able to tell that I basically had powder all over my head. She even got out the magnifying glass and said she couldn&#x27;t tell that it wasn&#x27;t natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have reservations about how this will work, just buy it. I am so glad that I did. My hair looks great and I don&#x27;t feel so self-conscious anymore. I&#x27;m now going to try their other products to see if there might be hope for growing my hair back.</li>
            <li> My front hairline has gotten dreadfully thin from misuse of those snap combs but I still like to wear a ponytail.  I used this to fill in the spots so it didn&#x27;t look as thin.  First it doesn&#x27;t come in black only and filling in black hair with dark brown fibers is not a perfect match. You can tell.  It is just okay. The fibers look like the frizzies so for me when I am pulling my hair back and want a smooth finish, this looks like I added some kinks to the hair or something or my hair gel failed.  I may not be using it for its intended purpose.  I think it still looked better on my head than my hairline looked without it but it is not worth the price. One good thing is that it doesn&#x27;t come off on your hands everytime you touch it.  It probably works better in the crown for someone who is not wearing her hair very smooth.  I have switched to those hair color sticks that cover grey when you are in between colors and I put it right onto my hair and the scalp and it looks great. Those do come off to the touch though.</li>
            <li> Arrived early in an open sealed, half empty and messy all over as it reveals how sticky it remains.  Must be very careful in applying , apparently, as I&#x27;ve read and been informed that particles will stain what it comes in contact with though effective in doing its job by filling the areas of thinning hair, not bald head. So, if you have too much skin showing on top of your head, I don&#x27;t recommend this product at all. I &#x27;ve purchased this item before from another store and I know it&#x27;s effective just not on bald head and be advised not to run your hair or have anyone run their hands on your hair if you have applied this on your own.  Lastly, wear a face mask when applying , close your eyes as well, due to not wanting to inhale this fine fiber hair like particles to enter inside your mouth, nose or eyes. It&#x27;s very much like hair in appearance as it is to be one of such. But, when the item arrives 1/3 full or if seen in stores not fully filled, then the price of $12.00 or more is not one to consider for this item...if not fully filled up to the contained bottle it arrives in as.</li>
            <li> Finally, a hair fiber product in as see-through container!  And it also coverx well and evenly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a gal in her early 30&#x27;s and have hair-loss/thinning.  It&#x27;s devastating for me. The first time I used the product I was a little unsure how to apply it. After a couple of times figuring out where to put it, how much to apply and how to camouflage it, I LOVE IT! I don&#x27;t go a day and not use it anymore.  This simple bottle has given me so much confidence back, I would highly recommend this.  It&#x27;s about a 30 day supply if you use it everyday and that also depends on how much you&#x27;re using.</li>
            <li> So light, not sticky, stays on until you wash your hair.  You barely know it&#x27;s there but does the job very well.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
