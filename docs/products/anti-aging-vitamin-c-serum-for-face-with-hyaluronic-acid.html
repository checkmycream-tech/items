            <li>It has a nice acent and after applying it absorbed well into my skin.</li>
            <li>Superior ingredients and a gentle serum.</li>
            <li>Bur, really, this stuff is really good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very mild</li>
            <li>Product absorbs very quickly into skin...  </li>
            <li>however its easy to absorb and not greasy</li>
            <li>Start trying this, so far so good, the feeling is ok for me.</li>
            <li>Luckily my moisturizer smells really good and masks the smell pretty well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very light , non greasy serum that dries quickly.</li>
            <li>but makes my face feel soft and looks nice!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different kinds of Vitamin C serums and have had mixed reviews, some were great and others were not so great.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the consistency of it and the dropper makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li>I noticed my fine lines and wrinkles disappearing.  </li>
            <li>My skin is tighter with improved elasticity and fewer fine lines.</li>
            <li>MY FINE LINES AND WRINKLES ARE FADING.  </li>
            <li>I think it helps with fine lines around your eyes.</li>
            <li>I see a difference in the fine lines and have watched them disappear.</li>
            <li>I have the dreaded crow&#x27;s feet along my eyes along with fine lines on my forehead and between my eyes.</li>
            <li>I use it nightly and it is light, easy to apply and has been visibly improving my skin.  </li>
            <li>About two weeks after I started the process there was a visible difference in the fine lines underneath and around my eyes.</li>
            <li>and I do see a difference in the fine lines on my forehead.  </li>
            <li>The serum relieves your skin of dullness and reduces fine lines.</li>
            <li>and makes my skin feel super hydrated and smooth after applying!</li>
            <li>I goes on smooth and absorbs quickly!</li>
            <li>That is HUGE for me.</li>
            <li>makes my face feels sooooo smooth.</li>
            <li>If I hadn&#x27;t gotten such a great price I would probably consider returning it.</li>
            <li>It works and really smoothly.</li>
            <li>I apply just a couple of drops, lightly smooth it around, and my skin seems to be brighter and perkier.</li>
            <li>I received a free bottle of Vitamin C serum to try.</li>
            <li>Great product  Would definitely recommend for anyone</li>
            <li>It is light and not greasy.</li>
            <li>, I had not used this before and really enjoy the feel it gives to my skin.</li>
            <li>As I know that Vitamin C is an essential component in production of collagen; which is great...</li>
            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t want great form, firmness, and strength to their skin, at the same time giving your skin its flexibility.</li>
            <li>so cheap it was nearly free and wanted to use the product</li>
            <li>Make my skin feel smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>it does exactly what they say it would do!!</li>
            <li>My face felt smooth and clean all day.</li>
            <li>Drys quickly and the odor of the serum is not too strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;is quick and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>and it was easy to apply and absorb quickly</li>
            <li>So when I was offered this Professional Clinical Strength Vitamin C Serum from Health Plus Prime for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely wanted to try it.</li>
            <li>I have no clue why it&#x27;s taken so long for great products like this to surface.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this</li>
            <li>Totally worth it!</li>
            <li>First of all, I really love the smell of this bottle of vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>Bought for a coworker and she was so excited to use it.</li>
            <li>When my vitamin C serum came in the mail I was so excited to try it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this for a couple of days, but so far it is going great!  </li>
            <li>The serum is feels light and silky, not at all oily, and absorbs quickly so I can moisturize.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>However this product is by far the best it has minimized my acne scars, kept my acne under control and my skin looks younger.</li>
            <li>Also does not sit on the surface of my skin like a mask, but soaks in and feels smooth quickly.  </li>
            <li>I am pretty sure that everyone knows that vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant in preventing free radical damage.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to use just the right amount.</li>
            <li>This would be great to pair with a daily beauty regime as a natural option that will improve the way your skin looks! :)</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied and would highly recommend this product to anyone that was looking for an inexpensive serum that really works!</li>
            <li>Product arrived quicker than expected and is great.</li>
            <li>It leaves a light, fresh feeling without any greasiness.</li>

            <li>Will order more when this runs out&lt;br /&gt;Shipped very timely</li>
            <li>I actually took this product to my doctor and asked whether it was good for me</li>
            <li>Guess I need to contact the company to see if this is a true product.  </li>
            <li>I in all honesty would have returned it had I paid full price.  </li>
            <li>It really helps my skin look and feel more supple.</li>
            <li>So far I have really liked this serum compared to others that I have tried.</li>
            <li>I would like to think that I am saving money by purchasing this product, but if I don&#x27;t receive a full bottle it makes me wonder.</li>
            <li>But I was really hoping it smelled more like oranges and not this foul type of odor it does have.</li>
            <li>I recently found it and started to use it, the results are incredible, there is a new glow</li>
            <li>From the very first application I was able to see results, mainly on my chest and forehead!</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly with a fresh scent and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>The vitamin c has a strong odor when you first put it on</li>
            <li>Wants more! haha</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and well packaged</li>
            <li>But the scent quickly fades so</li>
            <li>but it fades quickly.</li>
            <li>quick shipping.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and is not greasy</li>
            <li>but luckily it&#x27;s put on at night before bed and</li>
            <li>I decided to try it out because the company claims the smell would leave quickly.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Love this product make my face smooth and moisturized, it works for me clearly.</li>
            <li>Super product.  </li>
            <li>I received my free bottle very fast.  </li>
            <li>I think it has a bit of a scent, but it&#x27;s not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>It spreads on quick and is absorbed even quicker.</li>
            <li>I will be sure to order more before running out as this is a product I can see my self using long term.</li>

            <li>My husband has commented on several occasions, in the morning when I&#x27;m bare faced and sipping my morning coffee, that my face looks good!</li>
            <li>:) goes on nice, non greasy feeling and dries fast and as soon as u let dry</li>
            <li>I believe it&#x27;s strong, so if one has delicate skin, perhaps once a day, in the morning is best, as it could be a bit harsh, but my skin is used to powerful products, so for me twice a day is fine and love having it on overnight...  </li>
            <li>Serum goes on light, dries fast, and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li>I was given a deep discount on this product in return or my honest feedback.</li>

            <li>Thanks Health Plus Prime!</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and the first thing I noticed was that it wasn&#x27;t greasy like some have been.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this Vitamin C Serum from Health Plus Prime for anyone who wants a great facial product.</li>
            <li>I love this product and will purchase it again in the future.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it I almost gagged.  </li>
            <li>I noticed results after the first use.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to using it because it has oranges on the bottle!</li>
            <li>This serum leaves my skin soft and smooth - not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>It contains vitamin C and aloe, my skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Would love to give a second bottle a try!!</li>
            <li>Glad to have found such a serum that works for me and my lifestyle.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft and smooth</li>
            <li>but when it dries my skin looks much smoother and it defiantly softens the wrinkles!</li>
            <li>This Vitamin C Serum leaves my skin smooth and soft than before.</li>
            <li>Not a big fan of the smell, but the product seems to give my skin a healthy appearance.</li>
            <li>I really like this serum!</li>
            <li>I saw results with the first application.</li>
            <li>Will definitely always be a part of my beauty routine :)</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product!</li>
            <li>My skin is truly glowing, I believe from the regular use of the potent Vitamin C product...  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much for this Vit C product!</li>
            <li>Thanks for offering a deal for me to try!</li>
            <li>I love this product and will continue to use it in the future!</li>
            <li>Made my skin soft, smooth and helped to tighten my skin.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s exactly what this stuff smells like.</li>
            <li>Love this product and will definite recommend to my friends!</li>
            <li>My first bottle arrived and I felt the effects after the first day.</li>
            <li>Plus the supplier is interested in opinion..</li>
            <li>When the Health Plus Vitamin C arrived, the serum only reached to the top of the paper label.</li>
            <li>and I could rate it higher.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quiet happy with the lovely results I&#x27;ve seen so far, and I look forward to using this product as part of my everyday skin care routine from now on.</li>
            <li>Plus the hylauronic acid is a huge plus for ant aging!!I find the smell of this product a little too overwhelming to continue use.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that my skin didn&#x27;t break out like it has with different products and that is really the winning factor for me.</li>
            <li>Another positive thing about it</li>
            <li>I have been using the serum for about a week and have already noticed a positive difference.</li>
            <li>Too soon for me to tell if it is making any long term differences, but I feel better about taking care of my skin.</li>
            <li>It really gives your face a pretty glow too.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s doing good things for my skin, but I just can&#x27;t get past the smell.</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin, you might need to add a moisturizer on top.</li>
            <li>The consistency is just enough and make it easy to spread the serum.</li>
            <li>This serum&lt;br /&gt;has improved the smoothness, and dry spots as well as giving my skin a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>My face still felt dry, but I apply my moisture and after that my face felt ok.</li>
            <li>My skin is flake-free, and super soft.  </li>
            <li>~ I have to use a face cream to cover the strong scent left.  </li>
            <li>Vitamin c should at least smell pleasant.  </li>
            <li>I see fine lines disappearing on my face, especially around my eyes.</li>
            <li>It has diminished the fine lines I have around my eyes &amp; my skin looks so much younger.</li>
            <li>like this particular brand because it&lt;br /&gt;contains 20%Vitamin C and Organic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Also, this Vitamin C serum is non allergic!</li>
            <li>I have only been using it a couple of days, so this might not be so accurate.</li>
            <li>There is much research showing the benefits.</li>
            <li>My face feels extra smooth</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to exfoliate it as much.</li>
            <li>and I like how fast this absorbs on the skin, and my skin does feel softer and smoother.</li>
            <li>i really like this vitamin c serum...</li>
            <li>I really have to give this Vitiam C a chance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easily absorbed into my skin, leaves no residue, &amp; not heavy.  </li>
            <li>thanks Amazon and health plus prime.</li>
            <li>I can see how this could be very beneficial.</li>
            <li>until the smell goes away Im in a constant sneezing fit.</li>
            <li>I really like this vitamin c serum.</li>
            <li>it works very well</li>
            <li>I really like this serum,</li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>and I have noticed a difference in how smooth my skin is starting to look.  </li>
            <li>it absorbs fast and doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily.</li>
            <li>Thanks~</li>
            <li>From the bottle, it doesn&#x27;t smell much.</li>
            <li>But this really worked.</li>
            <li>However I can&#x27;t stand the smell much so here</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t give much feedback because I couldn&#x27;t handle the smell</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really have any wrinkles</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I really like the Vitamin C product</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really think it&#x27;s for me.</li>
            <li>Thanks Health Plus Prime...</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I also have just received this product for a very discounted price like some others here.  </li>
            <li>I have really noticed my acne scars have improved.</li>
            <li>This is an overall fabulous must have product for/to me.</li>
            <li>Not working as fast as I thought</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to exfoliate it as much.</li>
            <li>I have been using and feel like it is really helping already.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast and with no incident.</li>
            <li>Fast Service</li>
            <li>and I really like it</li>
            <li>I really like this serum.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t care much for the smell, but it wasn&#x27;t so overpowering that I wouldn&#x27;t continue to use it.  </li>
            <li>my skin looks smooth and younger.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This serum is really nice, it&#x27;s not too heavy as some serums can be.</li>
            <li>I tried it on the back of my hand, and it actually feels nice.</li>
            <li>I wanted to wait a few weeks to really see the results for this product and honestly did not use it faithfully.</li>
            <li>and I can swear I see a difference in my face.....to be honest not sure exactly what the difference is ....</li>
            <li>Does have a bit of an odor when you first apply it but that fades quickly and it absorbs almost instantly.</li>
            <li>Compared to other vitamin c serums I compared the ingredients and was pretty surprised that vitamin c was the second ingredient, so that was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>I noticed after the first week that my skin is brighter, and has started to clear up (I had break outs in certain areas).  </li>
            <li>I use a LOT of facial products and this one really is worth it!</li>
            <li>So excited to see this as a topical solution.</li>
            <li>It is thicker and more cloudy than the other serum.</li>
            <li>I have not been using it long enough to report whether or not it&#x27;s actually doing anything, but so far so good!</li>
            <li>my first few weeks of using the product i notice that some of my freckles was lightened and i will continue using this :)</li>
            <li>It does have a slightly sour odor when I first apply, but fades very quickly.</li>
            <li>I just hope that the next bottle is full.</li>
            <li>I tried it mainly for dark spots on my face and my face has never looked better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read many of the reviews commenting on the smell of this product, both good and bad.</li>
            <li>My skin tone is more even with less appearance of line depressions in my skin.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t experienced any negative issues, such as  peeling, burning or break outs.</li>
            <li>my skin, because I&#x27;ve only used this for a few days, I still don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s good to erase my spots...</li>
            <li>I seriously never knew I needed this, but now I cant imagine doing with out it.</li>
            <li>Will most likely not order this product in the future.</li>
            <li>Will be back for more as soon as i get low.</li>
            <li>My Obagi bottles which are exactly the same size and also hold 1 fluid ounce are always filled to the brim.</li>
            <li>My skin feels more firm/more tight and does not feel so saggy.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Definitely I highly recommend this product to a friend and family.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and will always use it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to try this product.</li>
            <li>and she highly recommended it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I got it by having a high discount code.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend to others.</li>
            <li>And no heavy odor, either!!</li>
            <li>While I do agree with other reviews that this product may &amp;#34;smell a bit funny&amp;#34;, it is a very earthy/citrus smell and fades quickly after absorbing into your skin.</li>
            <li>it goes on silky smooth and sinks into the skin leaving it</li>
            <li>brighter, my skin looked radiant and it was more firm.</li>
            <li>I feel like I need to give this a few more weeks and see what happens.</li>
            <li>If you have dead skin laying on your face, the products just lay on top of that.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product because another brand that uses was very bad, my clients at the spa are very happy and will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>I will write further details after I have used it a few more weeks!</li>
            <li>My skin is super super soft now and the few lines I wanted gone have faded to were they are almost not visible.</li>
            <li>After trying this new product on my face I can feel a difference on my skin.</li>
            <li>My new regimen includes this and wouldn&#x27;t go with out it.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy and I can tell a huge difference in the brightness of my skin after only ten days.</li>
            <li>for those w sensitive skin I would suggest starting with one application a day and working up to more so to not over dry or irritate your skin.</li>
            <li>Well, it has been a few more weeks, and my skin does seem softer ,and when used with a natural moisturizer, my skin has a rejuvenated look and feel.</li>
            <li>My skin is very soft and lines not so noticeable .</li>
            <li>This product came sealed and in an opaque dark container which is important</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I admit, I was skeptical at first, but I absolutely love this!  </li>
            <li>smell is pleasant, not overbearing or fake.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using about three weeks and am seeing positive results.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had the product long enough to see if it helps wrinkles, but it is light and moisturizing and soothing to my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>So far I would recommend this to any woman young and old. !</li>
            <li>So far I would recommend this to any woman young and old. !</li>
            <li>This product I have been using for a few acne scars on face, some fine wrinkles on my neck and some old scarring pigmentation problems from my baby cat scratching me.  </li>
            <li>Well so far I&#x27;ve used it for a week</li>
            <li>So far this seems to be working</li>
            <li>No issues with sensitive skin however the smell is a bit off putting.  </li>
            <li>Like it so far.</li>
            <li>Seems to tighten my old skin well.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am not a picky person nor am I sensitive to smells</li>
            <li>have had this product for a week now and am liking it so far</li>
            <li>And so far, I like how it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>I might get pimples and I have a sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>But so far, it&#x27;s maintaining my skin.  </li>
            <li>Since I am a sailor, My 65 year old skin has been in the sun a lot.  </li>
            <li>(I will NOT declare it to be an old age spot, ever –</li>
            <li>It smells like a mixture of old composting fruit and sweaty areas in your nether regions.</li>
            <li>If not I will pass it on to someone whose skin is not as sensitive as mine.</li>
            <li>So far it hasn&#x27;t faded as I hoped.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>I am now 60 years old</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s working, make my skin looks soft</li>
            <li>This product leaves the skin soft.</li>
            <li>My some part of my face is sensitive.</li>
            <li>So even if you have sensitive skin prone to breaking out from lotions and serums, try this.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, I&#x27;m only 26</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels soft.</li>
            <li>but on the plus side I can say it does leave my skin soft</li>
            <li>I like the firming action it produces on my skin.</li>
            <li>Another plus is that it is natural</li>
            <li>:B00R848RZQ Professional Clinical Strength Vitamin C Serum</li>
            <li>All Natural And Organic 1oz Bottle</li>
            <li>I saw a marked improvement.&lt;br</li>
            <li>IT makes m skin feel really soft</li>
            <li>THIS PROFESSIONAL CLINICAL STRENGTH VITAMIN C SERUM</li>
            <li>AND MY SKIN FEEL SOFT AND MOISTURE</li>
            <li>have had this product for a week now and am liking it so far</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling soft...</li>
            <li>I have only been using this product for about a week now,  My skin looks brighter and is much smoother.  </li>
            <li>u feel how soft it  makes u feel</li>
            <li>I am sensitive skin type.</li>
            <li>this stuff leaves my skin so soft</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I got soft skin</li>
            <li>Also acne dark spot fade away really quick after applied this over night.</li>
            <li>I am definitely a fan of serums I feel they have done so much more for my skin than ordinary moisturizers alone.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and seems to just wake my skin up with a slight glow</li>
            <li>First of all, the smell is not pleasing at all; second, it&#x27;s too watery,  third</li>
            <li>so I did give them three stars, but I would tell anyone interested to be wary of the product since I could not stand the smell they may be able to tolerate it</li>
            <li>uper super soft now and the few lines I le.</li>
            <li>The smell is a little bothersome but goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit different &amp; not what I expected, I was thinking it would smell more like citrus, but I can deal with it since it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is slightly herbal rather than &amp;#34;citrus&amp;#34;, as are many other Vitamin C products.</li>
            <li>I like this serum very much and use it every other day....</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using the product long enough to notice any real results, but I like it so far.</li>
            <li>worked in the past in mental healthy and had to go to clients homes.</li>
            <li>As far as my personal experience with this product ...</li>
            <li>IT SINKS IN FAST</li>
            <li>, I let it dry and then go about my normal rountine of apply my face lotion</li>
            <li>I have sensitive dry skin and use only natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have had no dry skin from it at all.</li>
            <li>The Vitamin C content is super concentrated and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive  and dry skin.</li>
            <li>I honestly went to use a few times but I cannot get past the smell!</li>
            <li>I have dark pigments and I haven&#x27;t really noticed any changes in it</li>
            <li>This is my first time using this product and a few things get to me.</li>
            <li>Product has a light texture, with a slight, slight scent that goes away immediately...  </li>
            <li>I am not sure I can continue to use the product, possibly some more research could convince me the odor, slight burning &amp; redness will subside.</li>
            <li>After using this much touted product religiously for a month, neither my wife nor I have seen any differences in the quality and tone of our skins, each quite different from the other&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I got past the smell right away.  </li>
            <li>It is a high quality product at a lower cost than other  brands</li>
            <li>This serum really is plumping my skin and making them much less visible.</li>
            <li>At first I was surprised it was thick and had color to it</li>
            <li>My face feels really hydrated and plump, the lines are less visible, pore is smaller</li>
            <li>I like the way it feels but good lord why does it smell so bad.</li>

            <li> Luckily my moisturizer smells really good and masks the smell pretty well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very light , non greasy serum that dries quickly.</li>
            <li> but makes my face feel soft and looks nice!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different kinds of Vitamin C serums and have had mixed reviews, some were great and others were not so great.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the consistency of it and the dropper makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li> I noticed my fine lines and wrinkles disappearing.  </li>
            <li> My skin is tighter with improved elasticity and fewer fine lines.</li>
            <li> MY FINE LINES AND WRINKLES ARE FADING.  </li>
            <li> I think it helps with fine lines around your eyes.</li>
            <li> I see a difference in the fine lines and have watched them disappear.</li>
            <li> I have the dreaded crow&#x27;s feet along my eyes along with fine lines on my forehead and between my eyes.</li>
            <li> I use it nightly and it is light, easy to apply and has been visibly improving my skin.  </li>
            <li> About two weeks after I started the process there was a visible difference in the fine lines underneath and around my eyes.</li>
            <li> and I do see a difference in the fine lines on my forehead.  </li>
            <li> The serum relieves your skin of dullness and reduces fine lines.</li>
            <li> and makes my skin feel super hydrated and smooth after applying!</li>
            <li> I goes on smooth and absorbs quickly!</li>
            <li> That is HUGE for me.</li>
            <li> makes my face feels sooooo smooth.</li>
            <li> If I hadn&#x27;t gotten such a great price I would probably consider returning it.</li>
            <li> It works and really smoothly.</li>
            <li> I apply just a couple of drops, lightly smooth it around, and my skin seems to be brighter and perkier.</li>
            <li> I received a free bottle of Vitamin C serum to try.</li>
            <li> Great product  Would definitely recommend for anyone</li>
            <li> It is light and not greasy.</li>
            <li> , I had not used this before and really enjoy the feel it gives to my skin.</li>
            <li> As I know that Vitamin C is an essential component in production of collagen; which is great...</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t want great form, firmness, and strength to their skin, at the same time giving your skin its flexibility.</li>
            <li> so cheap it was nearly free and wanted to use the product</li>
            <li> Make my skin feel smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> it does exactly what they say it would do!!</li>
            <li> My face felt smooth and clean all day.</li>
            <li> Drys quickly and the odor of the serum is not too strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;is quick and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> and it was easy to apply and absorb quickly</li>
            <li> So when I was offered this Professional Clinical Strength Vitamin C Serum from Health Plus Prime for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely wanted to try it.</li>
            <li> I have no clue why it&#x27;s taken so long for great products like this to surface.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this</li>
            <li> Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> First of all, I really love the smell of this bottle of vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> Bought for a coworker and she was so excited to use it.</li>
            <li> When my vitamin C serum came in the mail I was so excited to try it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for a couple of days, but so far it is going great!  </li>
            <li> The serum is feels light and silky, not at all oily, and absorbs quickly so I can moisturize.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> However this product is by far the best it has minimized my acne scars, kept my acne under control and my skin looks younger.</li>
            <li> Also does not sit on the surface of my skin like a mask, but soaks in and feels smooth quickly.  </li>
            <li> I am pretty sure that everyone knows that vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant in preventing free radical damage.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to use just the right amount.</li>
            <li> This would be great to pair with a daily beauty regime as a natural option that will improve the way your skin looks! :)</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied and would highly recommend this product to anyone that was looking for an inexpensive serum that really works!</li>
            <li> Product arrived quicker than expected and is great.</li>
            <li> It leaves a light, fresh feeling without any greasiness.</li>
            <li> Loving it so far I was out of town when it arrived so</li>
            <li> and so far I am loving it</li>
            <li> My skin feels so much softer and definately more radient.  </li>
            <li> Will order more when this runs out&lt;br /&gt;Shipped very timely</li>
            <li> I actually took this product to my doctor and asked whether it was good for me</li>
            <li> Guess I need to contact the company to see if this is a true product.  </li>
            <li> I in all honesty would have returned it had I paid full price.  </li>
            <li> It really helps my skin look and feel more supple.</li>
            <li> So far I have really liked this serum compared to others that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I would like to think that I am saving money by purchasing this product, but if I don&#x27;t receive a full bottle it makes me wonder.</li>
            <li> But I was really hoping it smelled more like oranges and not this foul type of odor it does have.</li>
            <li> I recently found it and started to use it, the results are incredible, there is a new glow</li>
            <li> From the very first application I was able to see results, mainly on my chest and forehead!</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly with a fresh scent and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> The vitamin c has a strong odor when you first put it on</li>
            <li> Wants more! haha</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and well packaged</li>
            <li> But the scent quickly fades so</li>
            <li> but it fades quickly.</li>
            <li> quick shipping.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and is not greasy</li>
            <li> but luckily it&#x27;s put on at night before bed and</li>
            <li> I decided to try it out because the company claims the smell would leave quickly.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Love this product make my face smooth and moisturized, it works for me clearly.</li>
            <li> Super product.  </li>
            <li> I received my free bottle very fast.  </li>
            <li> I think it has a bit of a scent, but it&#x27;s not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> It spreads on quick and is absorbed even quicker.</li>
            <li> I will be sure to order more before running out as this is a product I can see my self using long term.</li>
            <li> Then my face broke out for the first time in 40 years!</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this product thus far!</li>
            <li> Helps fade sun spots on my face which is exactly what I was hoping for~!</li>
            <li> Definitely makes my face glow and feel so much better!</li>
            <li> Within a week, my skin obviously get a lot better!</li>
            <li> and it definitely makes my skin look and feel better!</li>
            <li> I really like this product!!</li>
            <li> It really does seem to make my face appear smoother and the fine lines are minimized</li>
            <li> helps fine lines on face I have been using this for about 3 weeks now and really like it</li>
            <li> My husband has commented on several occasions, in the morning when I&#x27;m bare faced and sipping my morning coffee, that my face looks good!</li>
            <li> :) goes on nice, non greasy feeling and dries fast and as soon as u let dry</li>
            <li> I believe it&#x27;s strong, so if one has delicate skin, perhaps once a day, in the morning is best, as it could be a bit harsh, but my skin is used to powerful products, so for me twice a day is fine and love having it on overnight...  </li>
            <li> Serum goes on light, dries fast, and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li> I was given a deep discount on this product in return or my honest feedback.</li>
            <li> product is worth</li>
            <li> So far i love this Vitamin C Serum</li>
            <li> But so far i love this product.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft, bright and clear.</li>
            <li> I love the Professional Clinical Vitamin C Serum.  </li>
            <li> I rarely leave reviews</li>
            <li> Health Plus Prime Clinical Strength Vitamin C Serum is just that a natural approach to better skin but with the power of a clinical strength formula.  </li>
            <li> so it was worth trying.</li>
            <li> I love my Health Plus Prime Professional Clinical Strength Vitamin C Serum.  </li>
            <li> One of my laugh line wrinkle disappeared and couple on my forehead.</li>

            <li> okay have had this for a few weeks now and am really loving it.</li>
            <li> I love how this leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> but I like the fresh smell.  </li>
            <li> and I want to keep my skin looking and feeling young :)  </li>
            <li> Give it a shot, it&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Plus you do look fresh right after applying this on your face.</li>
            <li> I received this vitamin c serum and was excited totry it since i have been hearing so much about vit c serums.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my skin right away.  </li>
            <li> did not get to use right away but been using about a week</li>
            <li> The dropper applicator bottle helps me get just the right amount</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, however this product has not caused any issues and has had a positive impact (better looking skin, no breakouts, etc.)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if this has made my skin better but definitely not making it worse either. :D  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so soft and look more vibrant!</li>
            <li> It is not sticky, feelin fresh and what is good is that u can feel the result after few days of using it.</li>
            <li> So far very well pleased with the results. .</li>
            <li> Works well smells great and definitely be using this regularly from now on!  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I could &amp;#34;see&amp;#34; much of a difference but my 17 year old grandson saw a picture of himself and me from 15 years ago.  </li>
            <li> So far so good its working good mainly but to help reduce dark spots slight change but still waiting to see more results</li>
            <li> Leaves my face smooth and soft , I put some at night and when I wakes up you can feel the effects of it overnight!</li>
            <li> Nice serum, sinks right into your skin.</li>
            <li> I loved the tight feeling on my face after I apply this serum.</li>
            <li> and im starting to see some fine lines go away!</li>
            <li> and I have no acne and fine lines near eyes are reducing.  </li>
            <li> I am 51 years old and I purchased the product to address the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I tried a lot of Viti c serum , this is pretty good in keeping your skin tight</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks and really notice a difference in my skin!</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase some more.</li>
            <li> And overall my skin looks and feels better.</li>
            <li> This is the first time i use vitamin C for my skin.</li>
            <li> Thanks Health Plus Prime!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and the first thing I noticed was that it wasn&#x27;t greasy like some have been.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this Vitamin C Serum from Health Plus Prime for anyone who wants a great facial product.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will purchase it again in the future.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it I almost gagged.  </li>
            <li> I noticed results after the first use.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to using it because it has oranges on the bottle!</li>
            <li> This serum leaves my skin soft and smooth - not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> It contains vitamin C and aloe, my skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Would love to give a second bottle a try!!</li>
            <li> Glad to have found such a serum that works for me and my lifestyle.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft and smooth</li>
            <li> but when it dries my skin looks much smoother and it defiantly softens the wrinkles!</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C Serum leaves my skin smooth and soft than before.</li>
            <li> Not a big fan of the smell, but the product seems to give my skin a healthy appearance.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum!</li>
            <li> I saw results with the first application.</li>
            <li> Will definitely always be a part of my beauty routine :)</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product!</li>
            <li> My skin is truly glowing, I believe from the regular use of the potent Vitamin C product...  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much for this Vit C product!</li>
            <li> Thanks for offering a deal for me to try!</li>
            <li> I love this product and will continue to use it in the future!</li>
            <li> Made my skin soft, smooth and helped to tighten my skin.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s exactly what this stuff smells like.</li>
            <li> Love this product and will definite recommend to my friends!</li>
            <li> My first bottle arrived and I felt the effects after the first day.</li>
            <li> Plus the supplier is interested in opinion..</li>
            <li> When the Health Plus Vitamin C arrived, the serum only reached to the top of the paper label.</li>
            <li> and I could rate it higher.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quiet happy with the lovely results I&#x27;ve seen so far, and I look forward to using this product as part of my everyday skin care routine from now on.</li>
            <li> Plus the hylauronic acid is a huge plus for ant aging!!I find the smell of this product a little too overwhelming to continue use.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that my skin didn&#x27;t break out like it has with different products and that is really the winning factor for me.</li>
            <li> Another positive thing about it</li>
            <li> I have been using the serum for about a week and have already noticed a positive difference.</li>
            <li> Too soon for me to tell if it is making any long term differences, but I feel better about taking care of my skin.</li>
            <li> It really gives your face a pretty glow too.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s doing good things for my skin, but I just can&#x27;t get past the smell.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, you might need to add a moisturizer on top.</li>
            <li> The consistency is just enough and make it easy to spread the serum.</li>
            <li> This serum&lt;br /&gt;has improved the smoothness, and dry spots as well as giving my skin a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> My face still felt dry, but I apply my moisture and after that my face felt ok.</li>
            <li> My skin is flake-free, and super soft.  </li>
            <li> ~ I have to use a face cream to cover the strong scent left.  </li>
            <li> Vitamin c should at least smell pleasant.  </li>
            <li> I see fine lines disappearing on my face, especially around my eyes.</li>
            <li> It has diminished the fine lines I have around my eyes &amp; my skin looks so much younger.</li>
            <li> like this particular brand because it&lt;br /&gt;contains 20%Vitamin C and Organic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Also, this Vitamin C serum is non allergic!</li>
            <li> I have only been using it a couple of days, so this might not be so accurate.</li>
            <li> There is much research showing the benefits.</li>
            <li> My face feels extra smooth</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to exfoliate it as much.</li>
            <li> and I like how fast this absorbs on the skin, and my skin does feel softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> i really like this vitamin c serum...</li>
            <li> I really have to give this Vitiam C a chance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easily absorbed into my skin, leaves no residue, &amp; not heavy.  </li>
            <li> thanks Amazon and health plus prime.</li>
            <li> I can see how this could be very beneficial.</li>
            <li> until the smell goes away Im in a constant sneezing fit.</li>
            <li> I really like this vitamin c serum.</li>
            <li> it works very well</li>
            <li> I really like this serum,</li>
            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed a difference in how smooth my skin is starting to look.  </li>
            <li> it absorbs fast and doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily.</li>
            <li> Thanks~</li>
            <li> From the bottle, it doesn&#x27;t smell much.</li>
            <li> But this really worked.</li>
            <li> However I can&#x27;t stand the smell much so here</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give much feedback because I couldn&#x27;t handle the smell</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really have any wrinkles</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really like the Vitamin C product</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really think it&#x27;s for me.</li>
            <li> Thanks Health Plus Prime...</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I also have just received this product for a very discounted price like some others here.  </li>
            <li> I have really noticed my acne scars have improved.</li>
            <li> This is an overall fabulous must have product for/to me.</li>
            <li> Not working as fast as I thought</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to exfoliate it as much.</li>
            <li> I have been using and feel like it is really helping already.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and with no incident.</li>
            <li> Fast Service</li>
            <li> and I really like it</li>
            <li> I really like this serum.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care much for the smell, but it wasn&#x27;t so overpowering that I wouldn&#x27;t continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> my skin looks smooth and younger.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This serum is really nice, it&#x27;s not too heavy as some serums can be.</li>
            <li> I tried it on the back of my hand, and it actually feels nice.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait a few weeks to really see the results for this product and honestly did not use it faithfully.</li>
            <li> and I can swear I see a difference in my face.....to be honest not sure exactly what the difference is ....</li>
            <li> Does have a bit of an odor when you first apply it but that fades quickly and it absorbs almost instantly.</li>
            <li> Compared to other vitamin c serums I compared the ingredients and was pretty surprised that vitamin c was the second ingredient, so that was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> I noticed after the first week that my skin is brighter, and has started to clear up (I had break outs in certain areas).  </li>
            <li> I use a LOT of facial products and this one really is worth it!</li>
            <li> So excited to see this as a topical solution.</li>
            <li> It is thicker and more cloudy than the other serum.</li>
            <li> I have not been using it long enough to report whether or not it&#x27;s actually doing anything, but so far so good!</li>
            <li> my first few weeks of using the product i notice that some of my freckles was lightened and i will continue using this :)</li>
            <li> It does have a slightly sour odor when I first apply, but fades very quickly.</li>
            <li> I just hope that the next bottle is full.</li>
            <li> I tried it mainly for dark spots on my face and my face has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read many of the reviews commenting on the smell of this product, both good and bad.</li>
            <li> My skin tone is more even with less appearance of line depressions in my skin.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t experienced any negative issues, such as  peeling, burning or break outs.</li>
            <li> my skin, because I&#x27;ve only used this for a few days, I still don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s good to erase my spots...</li>
            <li> I seriously never knew I needed this, but now I cant imagine doing with out it.</li>
            <li> Will most likely not order this product in the future.</li>
            <li> Will be back for more as soon as i get low.</li>
            <li> My Obagi bottles which are exactly the same size and also hold 1 fluid ounce are always filled to the brim.</li>
            <li> My skin feels more firm/more tight and does not feel so saggy.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Definitely I highly recommend this product to a friend and family.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it and will always use it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to try this product.</li>
            <li> and she highly recommended it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I got it by having a high discount code.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend to others.</li>
            <li> And no heavy odor, either!!</li>
            <li> While I do agree with other reviews that this product may &amp;#34;smell a bit funny&amp;#34;, it is a very earthy/citrus smell and fades quickly after absorbing into your skin.</li>
            <li> it goes on silky smooth and sinks into the skin leaving it</li>
            <li> brighter, my skin looked radiant and it was more firm.</li>
            <li> I feel like I need to give this a few more weeks and see what happens.</li>
            <li> If you have dead skin laying on your face, the products just lay on top of that.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product because another brand that uses was very bad, my clients at the spa are very happy and will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> I will write further details after I have used it a few more weeks!</li>
            <li> My skin is super super soft now and the few lines I wanted gone have faded to were they are almost not visible.</li>
            <li> After trying this new product on my face I can feel a difference on my skin.</li>
            <li> My new regimen includes this and wouldn&#x27;t go with out it.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy and I can tell a huge difference in the brightness of my skin after only ten days.</li>
            <li> for those w sensitive skin I would suggest starting with one application a day and working up to more so to not over dry or irritate your skin.</li>
            <li> Well, it has been a few more weeks, and my skin does seem softer ,and when used with a natural moisturizer, my skin has a rejuvenated look and feel.</li>
            <li> My skin is very soft and lines not so noticeable .</li>
            <li> This product came sealed and in an opaque dark container which is important</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I admit, I was skeptical at first, but I absolutely love this!  </li>
            <li> smell is pleasant, not overbearing or fake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using about three weeks and am seeing positive results.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the product long enough to see if it helps wrinkles, but it is light and moisturizing and soothing to my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> So far I would recommend this to any woman young and old. !</li>
            <li> So far I would recommend this to any woman young and old. !</li>
            <li> This product I have been using for a few acne scars on face, some fine wrinkles on my neck and some old scarring pigmentation problems from my baby cat scratching me.  </li>
            <li> Well so far I&#x27;ve used it for a week</li>
            <li> So far this seems to be working</li>
            <li> No issues with sensitive skin however the smell is a bit off putting.  </li>
            <li> Like it so far.</li>
            <li> Seems to tighten my old skin well.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I am not a picky person nor am I sensitive to smells</li>
            <li> have had this product for a week now and am liking it so far</li>
            <li> And so far, I like how it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> I might get pimples and I have a sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> But so far, it&#x27;s maintaining my skin.  </li>
            <li> Since I am a sailor, My 65 year old skin has been in the sun a lot.  </li>
            <li> (I will NOT declare it to be an old age spot, ever –</li>
            <li> It smells like a mixture of old composting fruit and sweaty areas in your nether regions.</li>
            <li> If not I will pass it on to someone whose skin is not as sensitive as mine.</li>
            <li> So far it hasn&#x27;t faded as I hoped.  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I am now 60 years old</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working, make my skin looks soft</li>
            <li> This product leaves the skin soft.</li>
            <li> My some part of my face is sensitive.</li>
            <li> So even if you have sensitive skin prone to breaking out from lotions and serums, try this.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, I&#x27;m only 26</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels soft.</li>
            <li> but on the plus side I can say it does leave my skin soft</li>
            <li> I like the firming action it produces on my skin.</li>
            <li> Another plus is that it is natural</li>
            <li> :B00R848RZQ Professional Clinical Strength Vitamin C Serum</li>
            <li> All Natural And Organic 1oz Bottle</li>
            <li> I saw a marked improvement.&lt;br</li>
            <li> IT makes m skin feel really soft</li>
            <li> THIS PROFESSIONAL CLINICAL STRENGTH VITAMIN C SERUM</li>
            <li> AND MY SKIN FEEL SOFT AND MOISTURE</li>
            <li> have had this product for a week now and am liking it so far</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling soft...</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for about a week now,  My skin looks brighter and is much smoother.  </li>
            <li> u feel how soft it  makes u feel</li>
            <li> I am sensitive skin type.</li>
            <li> this stuff leaves my skin so soft</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I got soft skin</li>
            <li> Also acne dark spot fade away really quick after applied this over night.</li>
            <li> I am definitely a fan of serums I feel they have done so much more for my skin than ordinary moisturizers alone.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and seems to just wake my skin up with a slight glow</li>
            <li> First of all, the smell is not pleasing at all; second, it&#x27;s too watery,  third</li>
            <li> so I did give them three stars, but I would tell anyone interested to be wary of the product since I could not stand the smell they may be able to tolerate it</li>
            <li> uper super soft now and the few lines I le.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little bothersome but goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit different &amp; not what I expected, I was thinking it would smell more like citrus, but I can deal with it since it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is slightly herbal rather than &amp;#34;citrus&amp;#34;, as are many other Vitamin C products.</li>
            <li> I like this serum very much and use it every other day....</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using the product long enough to notice any real results, but I like it so far.</li>
            <li> worked in the past in mental healthy and had to go to clients homes.</li>
            <li> As far as my personal experience with this product ...</li>
            <li> IT SINKS IN FAST</li>
            <li> , I let it dry and then go about my normal rountine of apply my face lotion</li>
            <li> I have sensitive dry skin and use only natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have had no dry skin from it at all.</li>
            <li> The Vitamin C content is super concentrated and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive  and dry skin.</li>
            <li> I honestly went to use a few times but I cannot get past the smell!</li>
            <li> I have dark pigments and I haven&#x27;t really noticed any changes in it</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this product and a few things get to me.</li>
            <li> Product has a light texture, with a slight, slight scent that goes away immediately...  </li>
            <li> I am not sure I can continue to use the product, possibly some more research could convince me the odor, slight burning &amp; redness will subside.</li>
            <li> After using this much touted product religiously for a month, neither my wife nor I have seen any differences in the quality and tone of our skins, each quite different from the other&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I got past the smell right away.  </li>
            <li> It is a high quality product at a lower cost than other  brands</li>
            <li> This serum really is plumping my skin and making them much less visible.</li>
            <li> At first I was surprised it was thick and had color to it</li>
            <li> My face feels really hydrated and plump, the lines are less visible, pore is smaller</li>
            <li> I like the way it feels but good lord why does it smell so bad.</li>
            <li> I am excited to see the results in a few months!!Loving it!!!</li>
            <li> The sealing wrap is great, not like the one from other product with a bad wrap that cannot hold the cap/pipet.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin, prone to blemishes, dark spots and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> After I clean my face, I use a few drops (and a few is all you need) on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This serum is about 20% vitamin C , with other naturally derived ingredients, including aloe vera, jojoba oil &amp; gotu cola extract.</li>
            <li> But I believe with products like this you can slow down the aging process and gradually reduce the appearance of fine lines, and age spots, etc.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how other people can say it has a refreshing smell because it smells more like chemicals and bad garbage.  </li>
            <li> I am 52 years old and was starting to see the wrinkle and dark</li>
            <li> My skin feels very soft and wrinkles less visible.</li>
            <li> the odor is hard to live with, smells of old oranges.</li>
            <li> I use it at night and have really noticed a difference in the small wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> My complexion has really improved after a few uses!</li>
            <li> BUT what it has done for my dark marks and skin tone outweighs the scent by far.</li>
            <li> It is helping the dark spot on my face completely dissappear.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product but don&#x27;t expect to work miracles it is definitely for minor imperfections and upkeep.</li>
            <li> I havent had it long enough to see a difference yet</li>
            <li> But the only thing is you almost have to use a moisturizer after since it does make the area of skin feel dry after it drys.</li>
            <li> I am going to try using it less frequently and see if that helps.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see the long term effects.  </li>
            <li> I plan to keep using the product and wait for long term results.</li>
            <li> I also did smell it for a long time after applying it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s long term results.</li>
            <li> I only use it every other day as I am also using a prescription Retin A Micro</li>
            <li> I notice with other serums that the next morning my face will feel a bit greasy -</li>
            <li> I have used this for only a few days and so far it seems working quite well on my lip wrinkle and some dark spot on my cheek.</li>
            <li> but that goes away once it is dry.</li>
            <li> If your skin tends to get dry, just add your night/day moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Then I let my face air dry, then apply the product.</li>
            <li> have really dry patches and it makes my makeup look blotchy in those spots.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This the only product I have added in the last few weeks</li>
            <li> Got past that and noticed I developed rash on face.  </li>
            <li> and I can see the big difference my dark spots lighten up.</li>
            <li> The product may work as I have tested it the dark age spots on the back of my hands however the smell is horrendous.  </li>
            <li> I had been looking for something to try on my face to help with some spots that were starting to get dark.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m already notices dark spots on side of my face are already starting to fade</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for potential benefits in anti aging and dark spots.</li>
            <li> I do not particularly like the smell, but it does leave skin looking refreshed.</li>
            <li> I simply wash my face, apply a little of the serum to my face and neck, let it dry and then apply a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry</li>
            <li> have seen a big difference in little under a week using this product</li>
            <li> I have finally found something that works on the dark spots!</li>
            <li> I can see my crows feet getting a little smaller.</li>
            <li> I let it dry before applying my other serums and any additional creams or oils...  </li>
            <li> I am not quite sure if this is an indicator that this bottle is gone bad or</li>
            <li> like we all know vitamin C help reduce our dark spot and prevent future dark spot from forming.</li>
            <li> I apply to my entire face and neck - a small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My sensitive skin has not reacted in any negative way.</li>
            <li> My Skin feels Nourished Even in our current Harsh Winter Weather.</li>
            <li> It has not only soothed the cracked skin, but it has helped within a day each time my skin started getting so dried out and cracking.</li>
            <li> so I have to be careful of when I use it.</li>
            <li> so I am curious to see if it will help diminish that line.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it a few days</li>
            <li> I do feel my skin tighten as soon as I put it on, but I&#x27;ve only used it a few days, so I can&#x27;t tell the difference just yet.</li>
            <li> I used this on some zits and facial rough spots and it worked wonders for clearing my skin and removing dead cells.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I do have one major complaint.  </li>
            <li> I have used other hyaluronic acid serums with no noticeable results.  </li>
            <li> I have read through the other reviews</li>
            <li> There are a lot of other ones on the market Sao if you have a nose</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used other serums like this, so I have nothing to compare it to.  </li>
            <li> I have used other products but my skin is softer and I can see the blemishes going away..</li>
            <li> Except I do not like it&#x27;s smell, other than that..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t  wake up with a red face no more.</li>
            <li> However, I used it again the other day</li>
            <li> Has terrific ingredients, my only complaint is the very odd scent.</li>
            <li> When it dried my face actually felt a little tighter.</li>
            <li> A few drops go a long way!</li>
            <li> I have a small dark spot on my face and its only been 2 weeks</li>
            <li> and it seems to have helped with lightening dark spots due to acne scars.</li>
            <li> My skin is normally a dry scaly mess by this time every winter.. but not this year!  </li>
            <li> I have also noticed that the dark circles that I sometimes get under my eyes, have gone away.....</li>
            <li> This is an anti-aging serum to reduce wrinkles and fade dark spots.</li>
            <li> The smell when applying was not great but doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> Helped dark tone of skin over night~used and massages</li>
            <li> It was dark brown and smelled rotten .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it lately because I have occasional breakouts around my eyes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it for my dark and damage skin because of the sun.</li>
            <li> I use this at least once a day, mixed with either emu oil or coconut oil.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have dark blemish on my chin and neck and I use this product three times a day</li>
            <li> Dark spot diminished in a week..</li>
            <li> I have dark acne scars that started fading</li>
            <li> I received an email from company saying they would give me another bottle if I reviewed the product for them, but I am turning them down.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the bottle was not entirely full, but the seal was in place.</li>
            <li> Within less than 4 weeks since I started using Health Plus Prime Vitamin C Serum, I have already noticed wrinkles around and under my eyes beginning to soften.  </li>
            <li> Contacted the company and they assured me that it may have an odd smell</li>
            <li> Her age spots are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I FEEL MY WRINKLE LESS</li>
            <li> but I have noticed it to be slightly lighter.</li>
            <li> she said she can feel her skin smoother and her wrinkles less visible.</li>
            <li> I my dark spots look a little lighter after using this.</li>
            <li> Because of the dropper and the nature of how long it takes, it&#x27;s sort of hard to give it five stars.</li>
            <li> For one: This has no good odor, second: it&#x27;s runny.</li>
            <li> only the smell is not good.</li>
            <li> Instead of putting it on my face, I used this on a few of the dark purple stretch marks that I have.  </li>
            <li> Also my face is clearing from dark spots (I have used a lot of pricey products that irritated and dried my skin).</li>
            <li> I have used other C serums in the past and never came across this.</li>
            <li> even when I have had little sleep.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> so I will update it once I have used it a little longer.  </li>
            <li> , it seems to make my skin a little brighter and softer.</li>
            <li> I wanted to do something about a pesky little spot on my cheek</li>
            <li> Not sure if that caused it or other reason.</li>
            <li> When I put the product on my face is does make my skin feel tighter but the smell is something that will take a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> My skin seems brighter and my wrinkles seem to be lessening a little every day.</li>
            <li> The product is a little bottle and the ingredients are in liquid form.</li>
            <li> , it seems to make my skin a little brighter and softer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 10 days now and have noticed a little bit of a difference in my spots.</li>
            <li> Whether it&#x27;s old age sun burned skin or cold dry winter skin</li>
            <li> Just a few drops along with my hydroxy acid serum and it works wonder at evening out the discoloration and uneven pigmentation of my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it nightly , applying  a few drops to my neck and face.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in a few lines I have</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have sensitive skin and it caused some discomfort.</li>
            <li> feeling hydrated but not greasy like heavy moisturizers often do.  </li>
            <li> I just use a few drops a day before putting on my sunscreen.</li>
            <li> , I noticed that after few days my skin felt smoother,&lt;br /&gt;also</li>
            <li> Sounds harsh or sticky?</li>
            <li> I bought this Item a few weeks ago though a GRUPON.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few days and it seems to be working.</li>
            <li> It will become my everyday go to...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in a few lines I have</li>
            <li> My husband had a spot on his hand and we applied this everyday  for a week and now that spot is gone.</li>
            <li> I have been using it day and night for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product now everyday for almost a month</li>
            <li> just started using a few days ago.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the serum for about 3 weeks now and in those 3 weeks I&#x27;ve broken out and my skin looks uneven</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of the smell</li>
            <li> Not a strong one</li>
            <li> This thing has a very strong nasty scent.</li>
            <li> I have been using Vitamin C on my face for the past few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have been using Vitamin C on my face for the past few months.</li>
            <li> but it has slowly been going down since I&#x27;ve been using the Vitamin C.  </li>
            <li> After 2 weeks my skin seemed to look less dull.</li>
            <li> I have to put moisturizer quite often since I live in cold place.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was hard to put on my face everyday because of the smell.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I can get past the smell of it.  </li>
            <li> but I am not sure I can get past the smell.  </li>
            <li> but since I just started to use it, I am not sure if it will help the lines or not.</li>
            <li> I had quite a few acne spots on my face and this serum has reduced the appearance of them already!</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t get past the smell.  </li>
            <li> im not sure I can continue.</li>
            <li> I just dont think I can look past or &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; past that.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get past that point to use it on face.</li>
            <li> I usually apply this to my face at night after cleansing.</li>
            <li> But I will never know because I could not get past the smell to use it on my face.  </li>
            <li> The first thing you noticed when you open the bottle is the horrible smell.</li>
            <li> as I&#x27;ve used it with my usual skin care regime.  </li>
            <li> Not sure as yet .</li>
            <li> I give it a four star because I&#x27;m not sure where my rash come from.</li>
            <li> but I spent money on this that I now can&#x27;t get back and am wondering if I even got a product that had gone bad or something.  </li>
            <li> , I really would hate to waste the product by not using all of it.</li>
            <li> The oranges on the front of the bottle made me think that it would smell like oranges, or at least some variety of citrus.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not trying to be mean.</li>
            <li> but I am having a very hard time getting past the smell.  </li>
            <li> but this seriously smells rotten.  </li>
            <li> having that smell on my face is seriously vomit inducing.  </li>
            <li> I never smelled a facial care product that smelled so badly.</li>
            <li> Tightened my facial skin and smelt bad.</li>
            <li> It is not pleasant at all.</li>
            <li> The company acknowledge the smell is not pleasant, but they say it goes away</li>
            <li> In my opinion it has a faint citrus like scent that kinda reminds me of those Vitamin C tablets my mom use to force feed me extra of when I had a cold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to leave a negative review</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t stop picking my face and making it worse.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found some serums to be too irritating.</li>
            <li> It goes on in a thin coat</li>
            <li> smell is a little &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; but not too bad.</li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;s a bit harsh, but the bottom line is, this stuff smells bad.</li>
            <li> so not sure if batch is bad.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it smells like feet.  </li>
            <li> My skin was going through a weird stage.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the terrible smell.</li>
            <li> I thought something was wrong.</li>
            <li> I do notice it has a faint smell of oranges which I like</li>
            <li> but I am having a very difficult time getting past the ATROCIOUS smell.  </li>
            <li> Worst money spent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other hyaluronic/vit. c products, but this is terrible.  </li>
            <li> This product is a must have and less painful that needles, all the beauty without the pain, swelling or redness!!</li>
            <li> Got a cold?</li>
            <li> Made my skin break out like crazy.</li>
            <li> It stinks</li>
            <li> Im sorry!</li>
            <li> It stinks so bad.  </li>
            <li> It if did not smell so bad I would use it like crazy.</li>
            <li> .it has an oder that is unpleasant.</li>
            <li> and maybe I just got a bad batch</li>
            <li> It smells too bad....</li>
            <li> it smells bad but does its job</li>
            <li> It just smells way too bad.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I thought this would make my face greasy..I love the way this product makes my skin look and feel</li>
            <li> I could not get used to the feel of the Aloe.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it smells like feet.  Got past that and noticed I developed rash on face.  Have used Sculpt vitamin c and never had problem so not sure if batch is bad.</li>
            <li> I was able to use this for a month before leaving a review an di will say LADIES this is what you need for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have seen a big difference in little under a week using this product</li>
            <li> I was given a deep discount on this product in return or my honest feedback. I have been using this serum ever since I received it. Just a few drops along with my hydroxy acid serum and it works wonder at evening out the discoloration and uneven pigmentation of my face. I have melasma and this is a wonder serum for me! I have finally found something that works on the dark spots! A little goes a long way. I will continue to use this daily. It has changed my skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> Nice serum, sinks right into your skin. If you have dry skin, you might need to add a moisturizer on top. Has terrific ingredients, my only complaint is the very odd scent. I have used other C serums in the past and never came across this.But for the money you can&#x27;t beat it. I will continue to use it. put it on my hands also, hoping it will fade some sunspots!</li>
            <li> While I do agree with other reviews that this product may &amp;#34;smell a bit funny&amp;#34;, it is a very earthy/citrus smell and fades quickly after absorbing into your skin. I have used this product for 4 weeks now, once a day before bed time. It leaves a light, fresh feeling without any greasiness. N the short time I have used this, I have seen an increase in the &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; of my skin and it seems to have helped with lightening dark spots due to acne scars.</li>
            <li> This smells real bad will never try again</li>
            <li> Works great.  Drys quickly and the odor of the serum is not too strong.</li>
            <li> This is amazing I just started using this and within a couple days I can tell a difference</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed this Serum . I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Great product, feels nice on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for a couple of days, but so far it is going great!  I really enjoy the consistency of it and the dropper makes it easy to use. My skin does have a nice glow to it. I use a LOT of facial products and this one really is worth it!</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure that everyone knows that vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant in preventing free radical damage. Also that Orange Juice is soooo good. So I saw this product and thought why not try it? I am so glad that I did. I use this twice a day, morning and night. I simply wash my face, apply a little of the serum to my face and neck, let it dry and then apply a moisturizer. This serum feels like it stimulates my skin and leaves it with a satin like feel. My skin feels more firm/more tight and does not feel so saggy. The bigger difference is that my friends noticed! After three days of use! And that says a lot! I am not a person who wears makeup so my skin is always showing! My friends asked me if I had started to wear makeup! I have also noticed that the dark circles that I sometimes get under my eyes, have gone away.....even when I have had little sleep.&lt;br /&gt;This product is worth it&#x27;s weight in gold oranges!</li>
            <li> My Skin feels Nourished Even in our current Harsh Winter Weather. Also has a lovely scent so you don&#x27;t mind using this product. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Got this for my mom and she said it make her face feel so much younger. Said it&#x27;s the best vitamin c serum she has used! Wants more! haha</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks and really notice a difference in my skin! This is an anti-aging serum to reduce wrinkles and fade dark spots. I&#x27;ve been using it nightly , applying  a few drops to my neck and face. The bottle has a dropper top so it&#x27;s easy to use just the right amount. The serum is feels light and silky, not at all oily, and absorbs quickly so I can moisturize. It&#x27;s very mild and I haven&#x27;t experienced any negative issues, such as  peeling, burning or break outs. The fragrance is slightly herbal rather than &amp;#34;citrus&amp;#34;, as are many other Vitamin C products. This serum is about 20% vitamin C , with other naturally derived ingredients, including aloe vera, jojoba oil &amp; gotu cola extract. This will be a permanent part of my skin care regiment!</li>
            <li> As soon as I got this product I decided to give it to my mother in law since shes vain like me. And I was happy that she did liked it she gave me good positive reviews about it. It did gave a nice effect on her face reducing some fine lines and wrinkles. I will definitely purchase some more.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. My daughter wanted to try for youthful looking skin, she doesn&#x27;t realize she already has it. There is much research showing the benefits. Arrived quickly and well packaged</li>
            <li> I use it every day with my makeup routine.  After I clean my face, I use a few drops (and a few is all you need) on my face.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not oily or greasy and blends into my skin very nicely.</li>
            <li> Im happy with the serum. My skin looks great!!!</li>
            <li> This serum is really nice, it&#x27;s not too heavy as some serums can be. I use it at night and have really noticed a difference in the small wrinkles around my eyes. And overall my skin looks and feels better.</li>
            <li> I been use the Health Plus Prime brand vitamin C serum , it work for me the skin become more smooth and  whiting.</li>
            <li> So far i love this Vitamin C Serum..i have been using it morning and night. I have had no dry skin from it at all. My face feels extra smooth and i notice it being brighter and tighter. Very nice product.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face smooth and soft , I put some at night and when I wakes up you can feel the effects of it overnight! Love this,</li>
            <li> I loved the tight feeling on my face after I apply this serum. makes my face feels sooooo smooth. I do apply moisturizer after, as that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been told to do. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> My skin looks brighter, feels better and I don&#x27;t have to exfoliate it as much. Love this stuff .My skin feels tighter, firmer as it dries. It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.The smell when applying was not great but doesn&#x27;t last long This is my personal experience with the product and is not influenced by receiving it for discounted price.</li>
            <li> Came in a timely manner.  It may have healing properties but I just cannot get over the smell of the product.  I just makes my stomach turn.  I tried a couple of times, I cannot continue to put it on my face, it almost smells spoiled.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my skin right away.  I noticed my fine lines and wrinkles disappearing.  I do have one major complaint.  The smell is awful. It stinks so bad.  I am not sure if I can get past the smell of it.  It if did not smell so bad I would use it like crazy.</li>
            <li> the odor is hard to live with, smells of old oranges. I am not sure I can continue to use the product, possibly some more research could convince me the odor, slight burning &amp; redness will subside. I will look into it further.</li>
            <li> This is the first time i use vitamin C for my skin. I can feel my skin smoother after 1 week use. I haven&#x27;t seen my skin brighter yet, maybe it needs time. But so far i love this product. I give 4 star because, it didn&#x27;t came with box.</li>
            <li> start using it, waiting to see results but in the moment I fell my skin great.</li>
            <li> Well so far I&#x27;ve used it for a week and it seems to help. I&#x27;ll keep on using it and keep you posted. ( it does smell good though )</li>
            <li> I love this serum. It has brightened my skin and it feels and looks smoother. No breakouts from this products.</li>
            <li> Thought I was going to like it. Then my face broke out for the first time in 40 years!</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this product thus far! My skin is tighter with improved elasticity and fewer fine lines. The smell is not my fave, but I can deal. :)</li>
            <li> Love this serum.  I&#x27;ve only been using about three weeks and am seeing positive results.  I have used other hyaluronic acid serums with no noticeable results.  I am very happy with this product and would recommend to others.  Thanks Health Plus Prime!</li>
            <li> I can tell a definitive improvement in my skin since I&#x27;ve been using this product. It&#x27;is quick and easy to apply. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give five stars is because of the scent. It is not pleasant at all. If it had a better or even more neutral scent it would be fabulous!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different kinds of Vitamin C serums and have had mixed reviews, some were great and others were not so great. So when I was offered this Professional Clinical Strength Vitamin C Serum from Health Plus Prime for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely wanted to try it. So I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and the first thing I noticed was that it wasn&#x27;t greasy like some have been. I also noticed that my skin didn&#x27;t break out like it has with different products and that is really the winning factor for me. I definitely recommend this Vitamin C Serum from Health Plus Prime for anyone who wants a great facial product.</li>
            <li> So far this seems to be working My face has a great Shine . I got a discount</li>
            <li> Absorb quickly and effective on whitening, good.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will purchase it again in the future.  My skin is soft, bright and clear.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this vitamin c serum!  i started using it on my stretch marks that I have. I have seen a hug improvement on my stomach and legs.&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on my face, my skin feels tighter, firmer as it dries.But the only thing is you almost have to use a moisturizer after since it does make the area of skin feel dry after it drys.I did receive this product  foe a deep discount to leave my option about it. This is my option in my own words</li>
            <li> Not in love with the smell, but love Vitamin C.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum and I did not cause  any skin irritations at all, great product the best part is organic.My skin look an feels better.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product twice now so I will update it once I have used it a little longer.  It does feel pretty good going on and my face feels tighter but I am having a very hard time getting past the smell.  It STINKS!  The first time I used it I almost gagged.  I have read through the other reviews and I haven&#x27;t seen this mentioned so I am beginning to wonder if its just my bottle.  I asked my hubby and my kids to see if it was just me but everyone says it stinks!!!  I am going to try and use it for a week to see what I think but I am not sure I can get past the smell.  If I hadn&#x27;t gotten such a great price I would probably consider returning it.</li>
            <li> I noticed results after the first use. I wake up to brighter, clearer skin. I use this alone with Retin-A cream.  My skin is noticeably brighter after using the serum.  I would recommend this serum.</li>
            <li> I honestly went to use a few times but I cannot get past the smell! I was really looking forward to using it because it has oranges on the bottle! Im sorry!</li>
            <li> I use it everyday. It is pergect item for me.</li>
            <li> very good product for a very good price</li>
            <li> Very nice on the skin i like it. My skin has tightened up and looks very good since i&#x27;ve been using it would love to have more.This is the best ive ued yet</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 3 weeks and I like how fast this absorbs on the skin, and my skin does feel softer and smoother. I have dark pigments and I haven&#x27;t really noticed any changes in it so I&#x27;ll continue to use and see if it will help.</li>
            <li> Using the product for about a week. I will write further details after I have used it a few more weeks!</li>
            <li> Very good product will buy again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.  Makes my face feel rejuvenated!  Noticed change within days!  Definitely recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> I can see my crows feet getting a little smaller.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple of day and I think it&#x27;s great.  No issues with sensitive skin however the smell is a bit off putting.  I thought it would smell more like Oranges but it does not.  However, anything that will help in looking younger.</li>
            <li> This works absolutely amazing i can see the results after using for 3 days</li>
            <li> Love this! Helps fade sun spots on my face which is exactly what I was hoping for~!</li>
            <li> Saw a difference in my skin tone after only 10 days of using this. My skin is very soft and lines not so noticeable .</li>
            <li> Helped dark tone of skin over night~used and massages</li>
            <li> Like it so far. Seems to tighten my old skin well. It is drying so moisturizer is needed.</li>
            <li> It works and really smoothly.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and this did not bother it at all! Kept my skin moisturized without being greasy. Loved it!</li>
            <li> I like the texture of this serum, and it&#x27;s not irritationg my skin, because I&#x27;ve only used this for a few days, I still don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s good to erase my spots...</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff...</li>
            <li> I used this product for 2 weeks now. I could say that this product amazingly surprize me of the result in my skin. I used it on my face. It is not sticky, feelin fresh and what is good is that u can feel the result after few days of using it. Definitely I highly recommend this product to a friend and family.</li>
            <li> Has a bad smell! but makes my face feel soft and looks nice!</li>
            <li> Loving it so far I was out of town when it arrived so did not get to use right away but been using about a week and so far I am loving it</li>
            <li> I love the Professional Clinical Vitamin C Serum.  It has soften my skin and and is so great!  I highly recommend it and will always use it.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s light，won&#x27;t clog the pores! Been used for a week, skin is tighter and brighter!</li>
            <li> This product was shipped very fast - excellent service. Serum felt great on my face as it just glided on effortlessly. Will definitely purchase this Vitamin C serum again.</li>
            <li> My skin was going through a weird stage. I had never had any acne or acne scar issues before so I freaked and ordered everything under the sun! However this product is by far the best it has minimized my acne scars, kept my acne under control and my skin looks younger. I would recommend this product but don&#x27;t expect to work miracles it is definitely for minor imperfections and upkeep. It smells like saliva hen you put it on but that goes away once it is dry.</li>
            <li> I received this vitamin c serum and was excited totry it since i have been hearing so much about vit c serums. It has a nice acent and after applying it absorbed well into my skin. After using a week my skin seemed a bit smoother.  After 2 weeks my skin seemed to look less dull. I find it works beat after exfoliating.  I apply at night after exfoliating.  I have read a lot about how it helps with elasticity and aging. I will continue to use as beat results are seen after 6 months. This product came sealed and in an opaque dark container which is important so the vitamin isnt compromised.</li>
            <li> I am not quite sure how well this product works as I have just started using it but I am having a very difficult time getting past the ATROCIOUS smell.  I can&#x27;t believe no one has commented on this matter yet.  I am not a picky person nor am I sensitive to smells but this seriously smells rotten.  The expiration on mine is 1/2016 and maybe it&#x27;s a great product but having that smell on my face is seriously vomit inducing.  I&#x27;m sorry to leave a negative review and maybe I just got a bad batch but I spent money on this that I now can&#x27;t get back and am wondering if I even got a product that had gone bad or something.  It&#x27;s like nothing I&#x27;ve ever smelled before.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two weeks now, and I definately see a difference.  My skin feels so much softer and definately more radient.  uper super soft now and the few lines I le. Several of mt friends noticed the difference in my face and I definately told them about this amazing Vitamin C serum. Will definately be ordering more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had this product for a week now and am liking it so far, it seems to make my skin a little brighter and softer. I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in a few lines I have but it&#x27;s only been a week</li>
            <li> This serum leaves my skin soft and smooth - not greasy at all.  Can&#x27;t wait to see the long term effects.  So far very well pleased with the results. .</li>
            <li> This product was wonderful, in fact I have recommended it my family and one of my sister had me purchase some for her.  Your face is so smooth and looks amazing after using it  Great Product</li>
            <li> Is too soon to see any results but I like the fact that does not make my face greasy.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the terrible smell.</li>
            <li> i really like this vitamin c serum... It really does seem to make my face appear smoother and the fine lines are minimized</li>
            <li> I have been using Vitamin C on my face for the past few weeks. I can see the difference already.  I am excited to see the results in a few months!!Loving it!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now a week since I started using this. I can&#x27;t tell if this has made my skin better but definitely not making it worse either. :D  And so far, I like how it feels on my skin. The consistency is just enough and make it easy to spread the serum. If your skin tends to get dry, just add your night/day moisturizer. Plus, this product is not making my skin breakout.  I got scared to try this cause I might get pimples and I have a sensitive skin. But so far, it&#x27;s maintaining my skin.  Plus you do look fresh right after applying this on your face. I also used it on my neck.  Another positive thing about it, it was delivered timely and packaged nicely. Nice for a gift if you&#x27;re giving it to someone.</li>
            <li> Did not like it It was dark brown and smelled rotten . .Thank you. Maybe just this bottle.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C serum is wonderful.  Since I am a sailor, My 65 year old skin has been in the sun a lot.  This serum&lt;br /&gt;has improved the smoothness, and dry spots as well as giving my skin a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> Medium weight serum. Not stickey, not gloppy. Smells great. Moisturizes and awakens the eyes. I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this product and a few things get to me. For one: This has no good odor, second: it&#x27;s runny. When I used the product , I wash and exfoliated my face pretty good. Then I let my face air dry, then apply the product. I didn&#x27;t like the feel of it on my skin. My face still felt dry, but I apply my moisture and after that my face felt ok. I really have to give this Vitiam C a chance. I will return with an update.</li>
            <li> I use this Vit C serum at night befor going to sleep, An it works great</li>
            <li> Great product, I use it on my face and neck, it feels light and not sticky. It contains vitamin C and aloe, my skin feels soft and smooth. I would highly recommend to try this product. Thank you for a great deal! I love it!</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and feels very nice!</li>
            <li> Within less than 4 weeks since I started using Health Plus Prime Vitamin C Serum, I have already noticed wrinkles around and under my eyes beginning to soften.  My skin is softer and plumper which I attribute to this serum along with drinking more water.  Can&#x27;t wait to see if I experience further results with use after 8 weeks.  Got rid of all the skin cosmetics I&#x27;ve purchased that cost a lot of money; this basic and simple serum has replaced them all.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> My wife received this and was very happy with it. The sealing wrap is great, not like the one from other product with a bad wrap that cannot hold the cap/pipet. Will keep updating the results.</li>
            <li> I love this! It smells good, but more importantly, it makes my face feel good! I&#x27;ve been using it lately because I have occasional breakouts around my eyes (I have a food sensitivity to wheat, and ate some - the breakouts around my eyes is the result). It has not only soothed the cracked skin, but it has helped within a day each time my skin started getting so dried out and cracking. All in all, great product and I do recommend it!</li>
            <li> I wanted to do something about a pesky little spot on my cheek (I will NOT declare it to be an old age spot, ever – no matter what my doctor says :) ) and I read that vitamin C along with hyaluronic acid could help reduce its’ appearance.  Another benefit from this combination of ingredients is the skin feeling refreshed. Well, I’m all for that added benefit, so I decided to give this serum a try. I love it! I apply just a couple of drops, lightly smooth it around, and my skin seems to be brighter and perkier. Wow! And the best part: the little annoyance on my cheek is fading quite nicely!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s doing good things for my skin, but I just can&#x27;t get past the smell. It smells like a mixture of old composting fruit and sweaty areas in your nether regions. Maybe that&#x27;s a bit harsh, but the bottom line is, this stuff smells bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that many of us were raised being taught that Vitamin C is good for us and helps keep us healthy. Got a cold? Take some extra Vitamin C. So why wouldn&#x27;t it be good for our skin? I have no clue why it&#x27;s taken so long for great products like this to surface. I&#x27;ve read many of the reviews commenting on the smell of this product, both good and bad. In my opinion it has a faint citrus like scent that kinda reminds me of those Vitamin C tablets my mom use to force feed me extra of when I had a cold. But the scent quickly fades so I think that shouldn&#x27;t be an issue in the performance &amp;#34;review&amp;#34; . As far as my personal experience with this product ... It&#x27;s a very light , non greasy serum that dries quickly. My skin feels tighter, firmer as it dries. It has hydraulic acid in it so following with a moisturizer is a must..for those w sensitive skin I would suggest starting with one application a day and working up to more so to not over dry or irritate your skin. As with all products, there is no overnight cure to erase years of abuse we&#x27;ve put our skin through over the years. But I believe with products like this you can slow down the aging process and gradually reduce the appearance of fine lines, and age spots, etc. I plan on continuing to use this product.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this product!!  Excellent addition to my skin care regimen. It&#x27;s easily absorbed into my skin, leaves no residue, &amp; not heavy.  My skins feels &amp; looks wonderful.</li>
            <li> I rarely leave reviews but I did for this because I love it! I tried it mainly for dark spots on my face and my face has never looked better. The vitamin c has a strong odor when you first put it on but it fades quickly. I will continue using this product as a part of my daily regimen. thanks Amazon and health plus prime.If it wasn&#x27;t for your dollar deals I never would have found this wonderful product! :)</li>
            <li> I can see how this could be very beneficial. The first two days I used it, my skin looked and felt great. Unfortunately, I have sensitive skin and it caused some discomfort. I am going to try using it less frequently and see if that helps.  If not I will pass it on to someone whose skin is not as sensitive as mine.</li>
            <li> Loves the way my face looks and feels when I put it on. I&#x27;m using it for my dark and damage skin because of the sun. So far so good! I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I use this at least once a day, mixed with either emu oil or coconut oil. My ONLY issue with this is that it makes me sneeze! until the smell goes away Im in a constant sneezing fit. My skin feels great. I havent had it long enough to see a difference yet</li>
            <li> I like this serum very much and use it every other day....&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell ~ I have to use a face cream to cover the strong scent left.  I also am hoping to fade on spot on my cheel.  So far it hasn&#x27;t faded as I hoped.  Would love to give a second bottle a try!!</li>
            <li> nice serum only the smell is not good.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the product long enough to see if it helps wrinkles, but it is light and moisturizing and soothing to my sensitive skin and I wake up looking brighter.My only complaint is the fragrance. It doesn&#x27;t smell great to me but its tolerable.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin very soft and it feels very good.  Very easy to do with the container it is in.  Love it.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> Superior ingredients and a gentle serum. I have sensitive dry skin and use only natural ingredients. Glad to have found such a serum that works for me and my lifestyle.</li>
            <li> My face is a lot smoother and feels better.</li>
            <li> Health Plus Prime Clinical Strength Vitamin C Serum is just that a natural approach to better skin but with the power of a clinical strength formula.  it goes on silky smooth and sinks into the skin leaving it feeling hydrated but not greasy like heavy moisturizers often do.  I am definitely a fan of serums I feel they have done so much more for my skin than ordinary moisturizers alone.  My skin texture is smoother and my pores have refined since using vitamin C serum.  While I did Recieve this on a review promotion I will definately continue to purchase this formula.  I would recommend this clinical strength vitamin C formula by Health Plus Prime.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel so hydrated!&lt;br /&gt;I have really dry patches and it makes my makeup look blotchy in those spots.&lt;br /&gt;when I apply this before my foundation it looks so smooth!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel better and it seems to smooth out wrinkles as well! Will order more when this runs out&lt;br /&gt;Shipped very timely</li>
            <li> I really like this vitamin c serum. I started using vitamin c serum after watching a Dr Oz show. This serum has all the ingredients in it that was recommended on the show from two dermatologist. I like it s lot&lt;br /&gt;Mrb</li>
            <li> Because of the dropper and the nature of how long it takes, it&#x27;s sort of hard to give it five stars. I can mix it with a carrier to have it spread better but I haven&#x27;t noticed any results yet. Additionally, I know that sometimes citrus can conflict with the sun so I have to be careful of when I use it.</li>
            <li> it works very well but i cant stand the smell. :(</li>
            <li> OMG my skin is glowing. I actually took this product to my doctor and asked whether it was good for me and she highly recommended it. The Vitamin C content is super concentrated and a little goes a long way. I just use a few drops a day before putting on my sunscreen. Sometimes I even use it at night to get an extra dose. I noticed that my pores even look smaller! I highly recommend it. I plan to get a second bottle to gift to my mom.</li>
            <li> I USE IT DAILY AND I LOVE IT.  It has improved my complexion tremendously in a short period of time.  my skin looks smooth and healthy.  it does exactly what they say it would do!!</li>
            <li> I used this product, I think it is good for my skin. I like it.</li>
            <li> I have only used this for one night, since I just got home &amp; opened the box yesterday. The smell is a bit different &amp; not what I expected, I was thinking it would smell more like citrus, but I can deal with it since it doesn&#x27;t last long. I like how it made my skin feel tighter but since I just started to use it, I am not sure if it will help the lines or not. I don&#x27;t have many but I do have one between my eyebrows so I am curious to see if it will help diminish that line. I will update after I have used the product for a while longer.</li>
            <li> It did nothing for my skin...a lot of hype, but I just didn&#x27;t see the results advertised. I am giving it a 2 instead of a 1 because I got it for about $2 so it was worth trying. Be warned, it stinks really bad!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t cause any breakouts, Does not have a pleasant smell at all but goes on easily without feeling greasy.  Leaves skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell and feel. My complexion has really improved after a few uses!</li>
            <li> The packaging was perfect and bottle was well protected. Pleasant, very light scent and spreads very easily which is a BIG plus in my book. Love the % in this and the added bonus of vitamin E and hyaluronic acid just makes this serum even better!!  I&#x27;ve also noticed in just a short period that my skin is brighter which is what I love most about vitamin c.</li>
            <li> It smells too bad....this is the biggest reason i don&#x27;t want to continue to use this product!</li>
            <li> I really like this serum, the combo of C, E and Hyaluronic Acid is great to not have to apply them separately. It goes on nicely &amp; makes my face feel smooth &amp; refreshed</li>
            <li> Good product and will buy it again!!!</li>
            <li> My face glows, and is more plump,more moisturized. I&#x27;m quiet happy with the lovely results I&#x27;ve seen so far, and I look forward to using this product as part of my everyday skin care routine from now on. I had some acne appear, in a rather embarrassing, and visible place under my bottom lip. I used this serum twice daily on the two acne spots,</li>
            <li> I tried a lot of Viti c serum , this is pretty good in keeping your skin tight</li>
            <li> I love the Vitamin C Serum.  I am now 60 years old and I&#x27;m trying to alleviate the wrinkles that are appearing.  This Vitamin C Serum seems to be helping.</li>
            <li> This product works wonders!! I have been using it for about a month and absolutely love the results! I have already recommended it to others and plan on using this for life! &#x3D;] I had quite a few acne spots on my face and this serum has reduced the appearance of them already!</li>
            <li> I seriously never knew I needed this, but now I cant imagine doing with out it. I immediately noticed a difference in how my skin felt, smoother, plumper, more even if that makes sense. After a couple of weeks my skin look brighter and more healthy, the circles under my eyes more diminished. I am sold, I love the product! You only use 3 drops at a time on your face so the bottle has lasted me over a month!</li>
            <li> I CAN ALREADY SEE A DIFFERENCE IN MY SKIN.  MY FINE LINES AND WRINKLES ARE FADING.  I USE THIS MORNING AND NIGHT.  IT SINKS IN FAST, SO I CAN WEAR IT UNDER MY MAKEUP.</li>
            <li> .it has an oder that is unpleasant.</li>
            <li> This serum was brown and gritty. I hope it was spoiled and not how the product is presented. I&#x27;ve never used a serum with this consistency. It&#x27;s going back.</li>
            <li> I really liked the vitamin c serum. My daughter also tried it and she liked it to. She puts it on before going to work because she woks with a lot of oil and the vitamin c serum helped with break out on her face. I think it helps with fine lines around your eyes.</li>
            <li> I loved it, so glad I tried it</li>
            <li> Everyone in the family uses Vitamin C Serum.&lt;br /&gt;We purchased this Health Plus Prime serum&lt;br /&gt;in a promotion for testing and review.&lt;br /&gt;We like this particular brand because it&lt;br /&gt;contains 20%Vitamin C and Organic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Also, this Vitamin C serum is non allergic!</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t get past the smell.  I am not sure how other people can say it has a refreshing smell because it smells more like chemicals and bad garbage.  Contacted the company and they assured me that it may have an odd smell but it goes away when applied.  I just can&#x27;t even get to the applied part.  Vitamin c should at least smell pleasant.  There are a lot of other ones on the market Sao if you have a nose, I wouldn&#x27;t buy this one.</li>
            <li> Really like this product. It is a high quality product at a lower cost than other  brands I ha e tried. Wod definitely recommend buying it.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft and smooth</li>
            <li> This serum is amazing.  Made my skin feel refreshed and I have noticed a difference in how smooth my skin is starting to look.  Awsome Vitamin C serum. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> A+ Seller. Product arrived quicker than expected and is great. I have only been using it a few days but I already feel a difference</li>
            <li> helps fine lines on face I have been using this for about 3 weeks now and really like it it absorbs fast and doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this but when I opened it I all most didn&#x27;t want to put it on.  It doesn&#x27;t have the best smell at all; however, I know that vitamin C is good for you face, so I tried it.  Instead of putting it on my face, I used this on a few of the dark purple stretch marks that I have.  I have seen a hug improvement on my belly and inner thighs.  Just me I got past the smell right away.  I just let the serum soak into my skin and then put a lotion over it when it dries.</li>
            <li> Does have a bit of an odor when you first apply it but that fades quickly and it absorbs almost instantly.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I goes on smooth and absorbs quickly! So glad I found you guys! Serum goes on light, dries fast, and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. Too soon for me to tell if it is making any long term differences, but I feel better about taking care of my skin.</li>
            <li> Works well great chance to try leaves skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Love this Vitamin C Serum I only use it every other day as I am also using a prescription Retin A Micro so this works well for me if I use it on the days I do not apply the Retin A. My skin is clearing up nicely from all the sun damage  :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working, make my skin looks soft</li>
            <li> I am in awe!  Never suffered from acne until my 30&#x27;s and I couldn&#x27;t stop picking my face and making it worse.  Not even 24 hours passed and I noticed an enormous difference!  Day 7 I use religiously after face wash and I have no acne and fine lines near eyes are reducing.  Five years off my face for a purchase on Amazon?  Yes please!</li>
            <li> So excited to see this as a topical solution. Great for my face :)</li>
            <li> I received a free bottle of Vitamin C serum to try. I do not particularly like the smell, but it does leave skin looking refreshed.</li>
            <li> I bought this some time ago and forgot about it. I recently found it and started to use it, the results are incredible, there is a new glow I though it was gone. The sun spots are getting lighter too, this is an added bonus. I&#x27;m extremely happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Great product  Would definitely recommend for anyone</li>
            <li> I love this product! I am 52 years old and was starting to see the wrinkle and dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;What a difference in the two weeks i been using the vitamin c serum. My skin feels very soft and wrinkles less visible.</li>
            <li> My order arrived on time;  I like using this product on my face before I put on a moisturizer.  It seems to keeping my face fresher it is not drying out in the middle of the day I have been using this for a couple of weeks hopefully it will only keep improving my skin. So far very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Works well smells great and definitely be using this regularly from now on!  Very happy with this product</li>
            <li> It is clearing up my acne which is great&lt;br /&gt;My acne has become embarrassing&lt;br /&gt;Now I am getting great results</li>
            <li> Feels good on my face. Doesnt break me out.</li>
            <li> I think I just need to use it one more time to see the change</li>
            <li> After using this much touted product religiously for a month, neither my wife nor I have seen any differences in the quality and tone of our skins, each quite different from the other&#x27;s.  Will most likely not order this product in the future.</li>
            <li> it smells bad but does its job</li>
            <li> Great product fast shipping</li>
            <li> This does not smell the best when it is,applied but when it dries my skin looks much smoother and it defiantly softens the wrinkles!</li>
            <li> quick shipping.  Will use oil as recommended</li>
            <li> Love it use it around my eyes makes a difference</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel lovely.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C Serum leaves my skin smooth and soft than before. Its smell does not bother me. Will recommend to friend.</li>
            <li> This product leaves the skin soft. is not greasy, good texture.</li>
            <li> I have been using this in conjunction with Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if I could &amp;#34;see&amp;#34; much of a difference but my 17 year old grandson saw a picture of himself and me from 15 years ago.  He asked, &amp;#34;Who is that?&amp;#34;  I told him it was him and me.  He said, &amp;#34;Why are you aging backwards!?!&amp;#34;  I&#x27;m sold, LOL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is noticeably softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> I have used 3 different brands of Vitamin C Serum and I didn&#x27;t want to love this one, but I do! I think it has a bit of a scent, but it&#x27;s not unpleasant. It spreads on quick and is absorbed even quicker. My face felt smooth and clean all day. I know how healthy Vitamin C is for my face and have been using it for about 6 months. I see a difference in the fine lines and have watched them disappear. This brand is now going to be my favorite. I loved it the first time I applied it to my face.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this serum, I used it night and it was easy to apply and absorb quickly, I noticed that after few days my skin felt smoother,&lt;br /&gt;also brighter, my skin looked radiant and it was more firm. I don&#x27;t have any issue with the smell of the product, I am very content, seems like I found a great serum.</li>
            <li> A nice serum, good consistency- doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or sticky.  Also does not sit on the surface of my skin like a mask, but soaks in and feels smooth quickly.  smell is pleasant, not overbearing or fake.</li>
            <li> So far so good. At first I was surprised it was thick and had color to it......made me feel like I was leaving junk on my face.........but the scent was pleasant and goes on smoothly so it was ok.</li>
            <li> I add this to my body lotion and can already see a difference in my skin.  I will continue to buy and use.  It is a great product.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel better and it seems to smooth out wrinkles as well! Will order more when this runs out! Great product!</li>
            <li> This is a great product... like we all know vitamin C help reduce our dark spot and prevent future dark spot from forming. I have very sensitive  and dry skin. I&#x27;ve found some serums to be too irritating. This one does not irritate at all. On the contrary, it is quite soothing. It goes on in a thin coat and I feel the skin tightening. I apply to my entire face and neck - a small amount goes a long way. It creates the perfect combination for my dry skin. Also acne dark spot fade away really quick after applied this over night. I just loved it!</li>
            <li> I admit, I was skeptical at first, but I absolutely love this!  My skin is normally a dry scaly mess by this time every winter.. but not this year!  My skin is flake-free, and super soft.  Thank you!  I will definitely buy this again!!</li>
            <li> Really nice Vitamin C serum. It is light and not greasy. I love using serums at night. This has great ingredients.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because another brand that uses was very bad, my clients at the spa are very happy and will definitely buy more. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this serum!!! Works well with my volume filler cream!!</li>
            <li> Start trying this, so far so good, the feeling is ok for me. Thanks~</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it once daily over my face for about a week.  I don&#x27;t have any irratation and it does help ease my acne problem.</li>
            <li> My some part of my face is sensitive. When I use this, it irritate my face. But I still can apply this in my neck.</li>
            <li> I do like it. Not a big fan of the smell, but the product seems to give my skin a healthy appearance. I feel like I need to give this a few more weeks and see what happens.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it a couple of days, so this might not be so accurate. I&#x27;ve never used other serums like this, so I have nothing to compare it to.  I do feel my skin tighten as soon as I put it on, but I&#x27;ve only used it a few days, so I can&#x27;t tell the difference just yet. I just wanted to point one very specific thing out- the smell. From the bottle, it doesn&#x27;t smell much. When you put it on, oh my. It smells like someone licked your face all over. Luckily my moisturizer smells really good and masks the smell pretty well. That&#x27;s the only reason I gave it 3 stars. Find a nice smelling moisturizer and you should be good to go.</li>
            <li> I could smell this all day ! It smells great! and makes my skin feel super hydrated and smooth after applying! It absorbs quickly and seems to just wake my skin up with a slight glow, I apply this every morning and before bed. It works well under your makeup as well doesnt turn greasy or anything.&lt;br /&gt;Ive started my anti-aging preventative care routine recently and this is a more than welcome addition to my supply :)</li>
            <li> I love this serum!! A lot of serums break my face out, so I was unsure when I tried this. But this really worked. I have used it for about a week, and I swear, I see fine lines disappearing on my face, especially around my eyes. Plus, no breakouts. I assume it&#x27;s the Vitamin C that makes the skin look so good. Bur, really, this stuff is really good. No breakouts. That is HUGE for me. So even if you have sensitive skin prone to breaking out from lotions and serums, try this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this Serum.  I look healthier and my face seems to be smoother.  There is no smell to this product, which I like becasue I&#x27;ve used products on my face and for hours I can smell the product and I end up washing it off.  I dab some on a cotton ball and apply it to my face, I let it dry and then go about my normal rountine of apply my face lotion and then my make-up. Definitley a product I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Vitamin C Serum for about two weeks now and it delivers on what it says it will do. I have the dreaded crow&#x27;s feet along my eyes along with fine lines on my forehead and between my eyes. This serum really is plumping my skin and making them much less visible. I also have sun damage along my cheeks and forehead from years of laying in a tanning bed and this serum is actually fading them out along and along. I would suggest that you exfoliate once a week, so that your skin care products can penetrate deeper into your skin. If you have dead skin laying on your face, the products just lay on top of that.  Really glad I found this.</li>
            <li> From the very first application I was able to see results, mainly on my chest and forehead! Great product!! This product is a must have and less painful that needles, all the beauty without the pain, swelling or redness!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product and it helps your skin. However I can&#x27;t stand the smell much so here is 4 stars for the product</li>
            <li> This product is very good. I have dark blemish on my chin and neck and I use this product three times a day it works wonders. I have used other products but my skin is softer and I can see the blemishes going away.. I recommend this product</li>
            <li> used it twice, it seemed to be okay.. for me there&#x27;s just this smell but I think its only for me since I have sinusitis.</li>
            <li> Very good serum for my face</li>
            <li> This thing has a very strong nasty scent. It made me sick to my stomach. I can&#x27;t give much feedback because I couldn&#x27;t handle the smell</li>
            <li> Just stared using this im not sure I can continue. I can&#x27;t take the smell it honestly smells like I&#x27;m smearing poop on my face. I just dont think I can look past or &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; past that. It smells terrible</li>
            <li> I really like this serum! You can almost feel it tightening your skin but it is not greasy at all! It really gives your face a pretty glow too.</li>
            <li> it smells fishy but is a great moisturizer before lotion applied.</li>
            <li> Totally agree with the name of the product. It is the best. I saw results with the first application. Great great great great product.</li>
            <li> I have been using the serum for about a week and have already noticed a positive difference. Definitely makes my face glow and feel so much better! Love it!</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT! After trying this new product on my face I can feel a difference on my skin. Much more balanced.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, I&#x27;m only 26 and I don&#x27;t really have any wrinkles but it gives my face moisture and softness, very smooth.</li>
            <li> I love my Health Plus Prime Professional Clinical Strength Vitamin C Serum.  My skin is health and more youthful since I have begun using this amazing serum!  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> one of the best ones yet</li>
            <li> Within a week, my skin obviously get a lot better! Spots fades, my skin becomes bright! Except I do not like it&#x27;s smell, other than that.. I have nothing to complain!</li>
            <li> Have been using the oil now for a couple of weeks and am loving it!  Put it on after cleansing face then follow with moisturizer.  Will definitely always be a part of my beauty routine :)</li>
            <li> I really like the Vitamin C product, I had not used this before and really enjoy the feel it gives to my skin. I think it has made my skin brighter than before, I use it at night after cleansing and before applying moisturizer , and then in the morning after my shower.</li>
            <li> Awesom product.  I have been  applying  it to my face. I have notice  a difference  in skin. My skin looks and feels soft. I don&#x27;t  wake up with a red face no more. I am sharing  this with my mom. I see a big difference  in her skin. Her age spots are less noticeable. She loves it.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this product. In addition to Vitamin C, it also contains Vitamin E and Hyaluronic Acid. Sounds harsh or sticky? It isn&#x27;t! I am 64 and have used countless products, many quite expensive. However, this serum tops the charts for me in effectiveness. My skin is definitely brighter, smoother, moister &amp; softer. My husband has commented on several occasions, in the morning when I&#x27;m bare faced and sipping my morning coffee, that my face looks good! My face feels good! I would definitely recommend this product to family and friends. You can&#x27;t beat saving money and yet looking better than ever!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product! The reviews were great and the serum is affordable but I don&#x27;t really think it&#x27;s for me. I&#x27;ve only been using the serum for about 3 weeks now and in those 3 weeks I&#x27;ve broken out and my skin looks uneven but on the plus side I can say it does leave my skin soft so maybe I can use it on my body, I really would hate to waste the product by not using all of it.</li>
            <li> My skin feels and looks more youthful, radiant and refreshed. My skin tone is more even with less appearance of line depressions in my skin. I have great skin but let&#x27;s face it... If I can minimize anti-aging and anti-wrinkling to keep what I got... It&#x27;s a no brainer! As I know that Vitamin C is an essential component in production of collagen; which is great... I like the firming action it produces on my skin. I also like the fact that Vitamin C will remain in the skin for up to three days. And that&#x27;s what I want to maintain healthy, younger-looking skin. Great genes play a part; however it&#x27;s the maintenance and preventive care that promotes extension of healthy, great, youthful looking skin. Who doesn&#x27;t want great form, firmness, and strength to their skin, at the same time giving your skin its flexibility. Hey we all know collagen in the skin tends to decline with age... so now we have help! Thanks Health Plus Prime... Your Vitamin C Serum came to the RESCUE! Good Stuff!!!</li>
            <li> Great product to have.</li>
            <li> I received a great deal on this product and it was shipped quickly. I haven&#x27;t been using the product long enough to notice any real results, but I like it so far. I don&#x27;t care for the smell, but that isn&#x27;t a deal breaker on if I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this product...  I have been using it twice daily, after cleansing, and applying on damp skin...  I let it dry before applying my other serums and any additional creams or oils...  My skin is truly glowing, I believe from the regular use of the potent Vitamin C product...  Every time a friend or family member see me they tell me my skin looks &amp;#34;radiant&amp;#34;...  This the only product I have added in the last few weeks, so I attribute this to adding this product to my routine, morning and night...  I believe it&#x27;s strong, so if one has delicate skin, perhaps once a day, in the morning is best, as it could be a bit harsh, but my skin is used to powerful products, so for me twice a day is fine and love having it on overnight...  Product has a light texture, with a slight, slight scent that goes away immediately...  Product absorbs very quickly into skin...  Feel like using it, I can see tighter pores and softening of the fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes, an area that I like to take really good care of!  Would order again!  Thank you so much for this Vit C product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a week.  So far so good.</li>
            <li> Dark spot diminished in a week.. I&#x27;ve only using this product for a week and I can see the big difference my dark spots lighten up. I can also feel my skin is tighten tho I have to put moisturizer quite often since I live in cold place.</li>
            <li> The product has a not so pleasant smell!&lt;br /&gt;This smell keeps me from putting the serum onto my face. I tried it on the back of my hand, and it actually feels nice. It is not sticky or has any residual feel. However, I just can not pass the smell. I am not quite sure if this is an indicator that this bottle is gone bad or it just the way it should be.</li>
            <li> great product! I have noticed a difference in my skin after using this. The smell is a little bothersome but goes away quickly. Overall I will buy again when this bottle runs out. Thanks for offering a deal for me to try!</li>
            <li> I bought this Item a few weeks ago though a GRUPON. I figured I would give it a try. GLAD I did, it works great for hydration and im starting to see some fine lines go away! Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> It smells horrible!!! Worst money spent.</li>
            <li> This has been a wonderful addition to my skin care routine. It makes my skin feel so soft and look more vibrant! I my dark spots look a little lighter after using this. I will definitely be buying this again after I have used all of it up. I am so happy I have found this!!!!</li>
            <li> I received my Vitamin C Serum, and have started using it and I am impressed how it makes my face feel. It absorbs quickly and is not greasy I apply it at nighttime and I apply it after showering. I thought Vitamin C was only to be taken as a vitamin taken by mouth, I think it is great they have a serum for skin..</li>
            <li> like product, best so far.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin, prone to blemishes, dark spots and wrinkles. I&#x27;ve used 1/3 of the product and already noticed changes. One of my laugh line wrinkle disappeared and couple on my forehead. Also my face is clearing from dark spots (I have used a lot of pricey products that irritated and dried my skin). Another plus is that it is natural and I received an email with the instructions how to use it. I&#x27;ll definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> My face got pimples after use it. Not sure if that caused it or other reason. however its easy to absorb and not greasy</li>
            <li> My face felt firmer and pores were minimized after using this product.... I wanted to wait a few weeks to really see the results for this product and honestly did not use it faithfully. However, I used it again the other day and my face broke out in red raised blotches????? I haven&#x27;t changed my daily products ???? I am going to give it another try&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00R848RZQ Professional Clinical Strength Vitamin C Serum With Vitamin E And Hyaluronic Acid That Fights Aging And Eliminates Wrinkles 100% All Natural And Organic 1oz Bottle To Give Youthful Looking Skin]]</li>
            <li> First of all, the smell is not pleasing at all; second, it&#x27;s too watery,  third, it had a gritty feel to it and lastly, it has a brown color.  Don&#x27;t know if anyone else experienced this or not.  I&#x27;ve used other hyaluronic/vit. c products, but this is terrible.  What is with the &#x27;brown&#x27; color?  Guess I need to contact the company to see if this is a true product.  Won&#x27;t use anymore(only once tried it).  Did not like at all.</li>
            <li> I use this product every night - I use a vitamin C face scrub, a vitamin C toner, and then this serum.  This serum is amazing.  I noticed after the first week that my skin is brighter, and has started to clear up (I had break outs in certain areas).  I notice with other serums that the next morning my face will feel a bit greasy - I don&#x27;t notice that with this serum.  I also don&#x27;t find the need to use a moisturizer after using the serum.  I love this product and will continue to use it in the future!</li>
            <li> I was given a discount to try and write this account. I in all honesty would have returned it had I paid full price.  The product may work as I have tested it the dark age spots on the back of my hands however the smell is horrendous.  Can&#x27;t get past that point to use it on face.</li>
            <li> When I put the product on my face is does make my skin feel tighter but the smell is something that will take a little getting used to. Compared to other vitamin c serums I compared the ingredients and was pretty surprised that vitamin c was the second ingredient, so that was a pleasant surprise. I plan to keep using the product and wait for long term results.</li>
            <li> I do not like the way this smells, I will probably not buy it again</li>
            <li> Loved this product! Made my skin soft, smooth and helped to tighten my skin. I usually apply this to my face at night after cleansing. Will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to try this product. I have only been using it a couple of weeks and have noticed a difference in my skin. My skin seems brighter and my wrinkles seem to be lessening a little every day. I would recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> Been using for a couple weeks now. Makes my skin feel more even and very smooth. Not a huge fan of the smell but luckily it&#x27;s put on at night before bed and the smell disappears when it absorbs.</li>
            <li> This could be the best stuff ever.  It could possibly make me look like a teenager again.  But I will never know because I could not get past the smell to use it on my face.  I used it once, and it was all I could take.  The oranges on the front of the bottle made me think that it would smell like oranges, or at least some variety of citrus.  I was mistaken.  I don&#x27;t know what that smell is, but I couldn&#x27;t stand smelling it for the 15 minutes that I was supposed to leave it on my face before applying my moisturizer.  So even if this stuff is liquid gold, I guess I&#x27;ll just never find out.</li>
            <li> I was offered this product for a steep discount so I bought it. I&#x27;m into all types of products that are used for facial care. The product is a little bottle and the ingredients are in liquid form. The first thing you noticed when you open the bottle is the horrible smell. I never smelled a facial care product that smelled so badly. I thought something was wrong. So I looked at the reviews and saw some mentioned the horrible smell while others say it smelled of citrus. My bottle does not smell of citrus. The company acknowledge the smell is not pleasant, but they say it goes away quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I worked in the past in mental healthy and had to go to clients homes. I remember one where they had many cats and the house reeked of cat urine. That&#x27;s exactly what this stuff smells like. I&#x27;m not trying to be mean. I would love to give a better review if I could, but that is the what it smells of. So I wasn&#x27;t sure what to do because I got the product so cheap it was nearly free and wanted to use the product so I could write a review. I decided to try it out because the company claims the smell would leave quickly. Well I did use it every day. I used it on my forehead and back of my hands. I noticed some of the brown spots did get lighter. I saw a marked improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was hard to put on my face everyday because of the smell. I also did smell it for a long time after applying it. I received an email from company saying they would give me another bottle if I reviewed the product for them, but I am turning them down. I cannot keep putting the product on my face. It just smells way too bad. The product was effect so I did give them three stars, but I would tell anyone interested to be wary of the product since I could not stand the smell they may be able to tolerate it or maybe they will find it to be intolerable as well.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel better and it seems to smooth out wrinkles as well! Will order more when this runs out! Great product!</li>
            <li> perfect! you will be amazed at the results</li>
            <li> Great for oily skin, doesn&#x27;t cause any oil build up and moisturizing</li>
            <li> This serum helps the scars to be not as visible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few days and it seems to be working. Thank you so much for the great product.</li>
            <li> As a licensed cosmetologist I am always looking for the next best thing in skin care to keep my skin looking and feeling its best. This product in combination with my moisturizer has helped my skin to stay more hydrated through out the day. This is  something I have always struggled with.I have also noticed a improvement in the fine/smile lines around my eyes. I love the packaging size as it passes through TSA with no problems while traveling! The dropper applicator bottle helps me get just the right amount so I don&#x27;t waste the product as it doesn&#x27;t take much. I will be sure to order more before running out as this is a product I can see my self using long term. Now to find a moisturizer that I like just as well as the serum!</li>
            <li> So far so good its working good mainly but to help reduce dark spots slight change but still waiting to see more results</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I use it nightly and it is light, easy to apply and has been visibly improving my skin.  I have sensitive skin, however this product has not caused any issues and has had a positive impact (better looking skin, no breakouts, etc.) as I&#x27;ve used it with my usual skin care regime.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT makes m skin feel really soft</li>
            <li> Love this product! It will become my everyday go to... thank you for making this wonderful product... This is beyond my expectation...</li>
            <li> I have been using this once daily for the last two weeks and I can honestly say that my face is glowing and my pores are smaller. I wouldn&#x27;t believe it had I not used it myself. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> Left my skin feeling very nice!</li>
            <li> Product as described. I have to take daily vitamins and I don&#x27;t do well with a lot of pills. This worked well for me</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit stinky, I don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> I think this product is very good to use, I like it very much</li>
            <li> I also have just received this product for a very discounted price like some others here.  This product I have been using for a few acne scars on face, some fine wrinkles on my neck and some old scarring pigmentation problems from my baby cat scratching me.  This stuff works for me, as I like to apply it after washing and toning my face at night.  I then apply a moisturizer.  In the morning after my face wash toner I make sure to apply an spf.</li>
            <li> I love it. I got it by having a high discount code.Moist the skin, feels good. smells good.</li>
            <li> Love this serum I use it on my face at night I have really noticed my acne scars have improved.</li>
            <li> Noticed great improvement within a week!</li>
            <li> AFTER ONE WEEK USE.  THIS PROFESSIONAL CLINICAL STRENGTH VITAMIN C SERUM,  IT WORK GOOD.  I FEEL MY WRINKLE LESS AND MY SKIN FEEL SOFT AND MOISTURE, THE ONLY THING IS I DON&#x27;T LIKE THE SMELL.  I RATHER THEY DON&#x27;T HAVE ANY SMELL I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCTS AT DISCOUNT PRICE IN EXCHANGE MY REVIEW.</li>
            <li> Made my skin break out like crazy. Tightened my facial skin and smelt bad.</li>
            <li> I have used this for only a few days and so far it seems working quite well on my lip wrinkle and some dark spot on my cheek. Love this product and will definite recommend to my friends!</li>
            <li> **Update** okay have had this for a few weeks now and am really loving it. My skin is super super soft now and the few lines I wanted gone have faded to were they are almost not visible. I have had people ask what I use and have been telling them about this amazing Vitamin C serum. Just wish it was a bigger bottle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had this product for a week now and am liking it so far, it seems to make my skin a little brighter and softer. I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in a few lines I have but it&#x27;s only been a week</li>
            <li> Make my skin feel smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> First of all, I really love the smell of this bottle of vitamin C serum. I use this with with my hot/cold infuser and only at night time (I was told not to use vitamin c during day time). My face feels really hydrated and plump, the lines are less visible, pore is smaller&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW***</li>
            <li> I love trying vitamin c serums because they smell great and I always look forward to the brightening effect that I never get but I have never stopped searching. Decided to buy one online instead of in the store saw all the reviews and though mixed, overall they were good.&lt;br /&gt;This is nothing like any vitamin c serum I have ever tried. It stinks and it is offensive so I only wear it at night time BUT what it has done for my dark marks and skin tone outweighs the scent by far. It has been about one month since I have started using this and I refuse to wear makeup during the week now unless going out. My face glows it is even and the marks are almost unnoticeable. This is an overall fabulous must have product for/to me.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It is helping the dark spot on my face completely dissappear.</li>
            <li> Bought for a coworker and she was so excited to use it. She said her face is alot smoother and feels much more healthier! I would like to try it out myself :)</li>
            <li> Not sure as yet . Not working as fast as I thought</li>
            <li> I love this product. I will definitely be buying it again!</li>
            <li> I had been looking for something to try on my face to help with some spots that were starting to get dark. I saw this on my facebook feed and thought I should try it. I love how this leaves my skin so soft. I have been using this for about 10 days now and have noticed a little bit of a difference in my spots.</li>
            <li> I have been using Vitamin C on my face for the past few months. I&#x27;m never going to stop! My skin looks brighter, feels better and I don&#x27;t have to exfoliate it as much. Love love love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love it! It makes my skin smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> I like this product. It is light feeling on the skin, and not greasy at all! And no heavy odor, either!!</li>
            <li> This product feels great on my skin. I have not been using it long enough to report whether or not it&#x27;s actually doing anything, but so far so good!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much I Love It.</li>
            <li> I love this serum! My skin is very dry and I use this serum under my moisturizer day and night. It really helps my skin look and feel more supple.</li>
            <li> I have been using and feel like it is really helping already. Plus it just feels really good. Shipped fast and with no incident.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It makes me look brighter and health skin. My skin feel better and it seems to smooth out wrinkles as well!</li>
            <li> So far I have really liked this serum compared to others that I have tried. I do notice it has a faint smell of oranges which I like, it could just be my senses but I like the fresh smell.  I have a small dark spot on my face and its only been 2 weeks but I have noticed it to be slightly lighter.</li>
            <li> My first bottle arrived and I felt the effects after the first day. This is the only product I will ever use again</li>
            <li> Great Product! Worked fabulous for my face! Would highly recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Great deal. Great buy!</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C Serum is such a wonderful addition to my beauty routine. Within minutes, I can feel my skin tighten. It has diminished the fine lines I have around my eyes &amp; my skin looks so much younger. It looks like it did when I was in my 30&#x27;s, which was 20 + years ago! My skin is also clearer and more toned looking. I am extremely impressed with my results :-)</li>
            <li> I have been looking for products for my face.  So far I am pleased with this product, my skin seems to be getting brighter and that a great start I will keep you posted on how its working in a couple weeks! So far I would recommend this to any woman young and old. !</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product.  It works.  However, the I can&#x27;t get over the smell.  I purchased another brand on Amazon and it smells nicer and works the same.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and I have found it to be a great product. My husband had a spot on his hand and we applied this everyday  for a week and now that spot is gone. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love the texture of this serum and I LOVE the way it makes my face feel....I have been using it day and night for a few weeks and I can swear I see a difference in my face.....to be honest not sure exactly what the difference is ....but there is something. Plus the supplier is interested in opinion..</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling soft... smell is a little &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; but not too bad.</li>
            <li> I just recently purchased Health Plus Vitamin C after having used Obagi Professional-C Serum for the last seven years. I wanted to save some money, but I wanted a product that would replace and give me the same benefits as the Obagi product. I have been using Health Plus Vitamin C for about three weeks and have found it to be pleasant. It is thicker and more cloudy than the other serum. It dries quickly. My sensitive skin has not reacted in any negative way. My only complaint is that the bottle was not entirely full, but the seal was in place. My Obagi bottles which are exactly the same size and also hold 1 fluid ounce are always filled to the brim. When the Health Plus Vitamin C arrived, the serum only reached to the top of the paper label. Even though some of the serum was pulled into the dropper, it still didn&#x27;t equal the amount that was always in my Obagi bottles. I would like to think that I am saving money by purchasing this product, but if I don&#x27;t receive a full bottle it makes me wonder. The Health Plus serum appears to be a good product so I will probably purchase it again. I just hope that the next bottle is full.</li>
            <li> very nice serum, no irrtation and works well with my skin care routine. looking forward to amazing results with continued use.</li>
            <li> When my vitamin C serum came in the mail I was so excited to try it. I washed my face and applied 3 or 4 drops and worked into my face and neck in a circular motion. When it dried my face actually felt a little tighter. I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times my face broke out from something but I don&#x27;t think it was from my C serum. I&#x27;m still waiting on my rash to go away. Will let you no if my rash comes back after I start using my C serum again. I give it a four star because I&#x27;m not sure where my rash come from.</li>
            <li> Great for my ...love it</li>
            <li> I need to rewrite this review. I thought it was only me, but after I passed this to my mom, it&#x27;s proven that this serum caused skin irritation for both of us. The smell is bad, my babies refused me to hold them when I have it on. And my skin was ichy and having rash when I put it on. My mom, who has the best skin and never had any issue, also had the same problem. I know this serum works for lots of people, but I guess we are not one of them.  :(</li>
            <li> I have been looking for products for my face as I am 34 and I want to keep my skin looking and feeling young :)  So far I am pleased with this product, my skin seems to be getting brighter and that a great start I will keep you posted on how its working  in a couple weeks! So far I would recommend this to any woman young and old. !</li>
            <li> my first few weeks of using the product i notice that some of my freckles was lightened and i will continue using this :)</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels when using the Vitamin C Serum. It does have a slightly sour odor when I first apply, but fades very quickly. I follow up with the InstaNatural Anti Aging Facial Moisturizer.  I&#x27;ve only used this product for 1 week, but have noticed improvements with my skin feeling softer.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, very easy to absolve and made my skin feel so silky smooth. Thank u</li>
            <li> Love this product make my face smooth and moisturized, it works for me clearly. Very good product and I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for about a week now,  My skin looks brighter and is much smoother.  I am also finding that the sun spots have lightened up too.  I&#x27;m very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> Great product works well</li>
            <li> I love the way it leaves my face feeling and it looks a lot healthier.</li>
            <li> Got this at discounted price to try it out and I&#x27;m glad I did :) goes on nice, non greasy feeling and dries fast and as soon as u let dry u feel how soft it  makes u feel and I&#x27;m already notices dark spots on side of my face are already starting to fade</li>
            <li> Fast Service and I really like it and I use it again!</li>
            <li> This vitamin C serum has the recommended percentage of vitamin C so you know you&#x27;re getting the highest quality!! Plus the hylauronic acid is a huge plus for ant aging!!I find the smell of this product a little too overwhelming to continue use.I leave the 4 stars because the ingredients are great and if you can take the odor I&#x27;m sure you will be pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> great shipping very fast, the serum makes my skin a bit tinggling sensation but it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. I am sensitive skin type.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for only three weeks now. I apply it before bed after I wash my face. About two weeks after I started the process there was a visible difference in the fine lines underneath and around my eyes. I am 51 years old and I purchased the product to address the fine lines around my eyes. I am very satisfied and would highly recommend this product to anyone that was looking for an inexpensive serum that really works!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a week or so. I have not seen any drastic change on my face that I use it on but I can tell myself that my skin seems healthier already. This would be great to pair with a daily beauty regime as a natural option that will improve the way your skin looks! :)</li>
            <li> this stuff leaves my skin so soft</li>
            <li> I received a product that was spoil.  It smelled like something rotting and appeared murky.</li>
            <li> I loved this product. I even let my mom.borrow it so she can try it too she went and bought one too she said she can feel her skin smoother and her wrinkles less visible.</li>
            <li> I love this serum. It is not greasy and I can tell a huge difference in the brightness of my skin after only ten days. It doesn&#x27;t sting or irritate at all!</li>
            <li> Whether it&#x27;s old age sun burned skin or cold dry winter skin this cures it all. It goes on smoothly with a fresh scent and absorbs quickly. Every woman whatever age needs a bottle of this.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for potential benefits in anti aging and dark spots. I have used it a couple of times a week since purchase. It smooths nicely into my skin, leaving it feeling hydrated and not sticky. Doesn&#x27;t have the most pleasant smell, but the smell it does have fades fast. I will continue to use this product and look forward to it&#x27;s long term results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product now everyday for almost a month and I do see a difference in the fine lines on my forehead.  I have one crease between my eyebrows that has been bothering a lot but it has slowly been going down since I&#x27;ve been using the Vitamin C.  Yes, it does have a bit of an odor but it&#x27;s tolerable and goes away in about 30 minutes.  Plus I wait about 15 minutes and then place moisturizer on and you can&#x27;t smell it anymore.  Bottom line, I&#x27;ll take this over the wrinkles and it&#x27;s a more cost effective alternative to Botox.  Give it a shot, it&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I have been using the vitamin C serum for just over a week and I can tell a remarkable difference in my face! fine lines are going away and my complection is brighter and smoother! I recomend this product for anyone that is looking for help with your wrinkles and skin....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Picture coming soon!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this serum.  It was not sticky and made my skin feel and look softer. I didn&#x27;t care much for the smell, but it wasn&#x27;t so overpowering that I wouldn&#x27;t continue to use it.  I have sensitive skin and this didn&#x27;t cause any breakouts or reactions.  I like giving my skin the extra vitamins it needs and it definitely makes my skin look and feel better!</li>
            <li> In two weeks my face no only feels smoother but also brighter and tighter. The serum relieves your skin of dullness and reduces fine lines. This product is a keeper!</li>
            <li> Very very very good !!!</li>
            <li> Tlhe best I ever used,I will highly recommend it to anybody.I have some deep lines on my upper lip and they have diminish a lot.👍</li>
            <li> I received my free bottle very fast.  I have been using it twice a day and love it.  It is making my face feel great and I think it&#x27;s making my skin look a lot nicer too.I really like this product!!</li>
            <li> When I started using this ob my skin I got soft skin</li>
            <li> I absolutely Love this, its not greasy or sticky. I have rosacea and it doesn&#x27;t make it flare up which was a big concern. My bags are demolishing, my face just seems to have this ever lasting glow. I use this in conjunction with the dermawand and couldn&#x27;t be happier. Will be back for more as soon as i get low. My new regimen includes this and wouldn&#x27;t go with out it.</li>
            <li> Great product. Love it!</li>
            <li> just started using a few days ago.....have always heard great things about vitamin c as far as skin care . Can&#x27;t wait to see the results in a month !!!!! Well, it has been a few more weeks, and my skin does seem softer ,and when used with a natural moisturizer, my skin has a rejuvenated look and feel.</li>
            <li> Super product.  Feels like it working soon as you put it on.  Goes on easy and feels nice.  Will keep using this product.  Fash shipping.</li>
            <li> I like the way it feels but good lord why does it smell so bad. You have to mask the smell with something else. It did do a nice job on my skin tightening it up. But I was really hoping it smelled more like oranges and not this foul type of odor it does have. Fix the smell and I could rate it higher.</li>
            <li> I tried this on my first night, and I felt great. my skin looks smooth and younger.</li>
            <li> Great product! A few drops go a long way!</li>
            <li> This product does what it says. I have dark acne scars that started fading and I&#x27;ve only been using this for 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I used this on some zits and facial rough spots and it worked wonders for clearing my skin and removing dead cells. Yes, I can recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while now.  I&#x27;m starting to notice a difference in my skin.  It does have a odor to it. Not a strong one but if you put on moisturizer after it&#x27;s not noticeable. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> This is great serum!! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Since I bought the Vitamin C Serum for my mother, I don&#x27;t have a personal experience to go by. My mother did tell me though, that she loves the way it makes her skin feel and she can definitely see some difference in tightening of the skin around her mouth and forehead area. She will continue to use!</li>
            <li> It makes my skin rashes and allergies. My sister and my aunt have the same reaction.It smells horrible!!! Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
