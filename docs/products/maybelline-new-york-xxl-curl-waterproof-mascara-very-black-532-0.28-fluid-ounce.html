            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>I think I could find better mascara at the $ store.</li>
            <li>I have to curl my lashes, and many mascaras uncurl them.  </li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>It was a Christmas gift for my gf and when she got it she was all excited to get more make up</li>
            <li>but it washes off easily at the end of the day...</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>My original stock pile ran out</li>
            <li>I have somewhat curly lashes &amp; figured that usually Maybelline is the best mascara for me to use.</li>
            <li>Receiving the product I was excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>I have been using various waterproof mascara&#x27;s and this product is the best one I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>the same that good</li>
            <li>Ok so I&#x27;m older (50s) and have been looking for a mascara that would curl and hold my lashes.  </li>
            <li>This mascara has lengthened and curled my lashes tremendously.</li>
            <li>The 2 steps are the perfect way to achieve that extra effect for longer lashes that last longer, and it&#x27;s waterproof too!</li>
            <li>It is the best waterproof and the only one that actually curles my lashes does not come off till I take it off!</li>
            <li>Looks great, but for a waterproof mascara, it does smudge a little.</li>
            <li>I like a more natural feel.</li>
            <li>Most mascara&#x27;s completely make my eyelashes uncurl themselves</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>It got here right before I headed out for a birthday party.</li>
            <li>I really liked how long my lashes looked when using this product, but it tended to not be quite as waterproof as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>i usually love maybelline products, i like the mascara brush and the double ends.....</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t even worth that much.</li>
            <li>Love the Look and Curly and Long</li>
            <li>It may be better for those with longer lashes than my short little things.  :-)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just putting a lot of stuff on your eyelashes, really.</li>
            <li>and then I would look like a racoon....not very water proof in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>My lashes are very fickle and you have to heat the curler in order for my lashes to hold the curl.</li>
            <li>DIDNT REALLY LIKE THIS MASCARA--</li>
            <li>I found that when i was in a hurry it was just to much of a hassle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d much rather have used anything else.</li>
            <li>It holds a curl very well, but it&#x27;s waterproof meaning its a pain to take off</li>
            <li>but they stick straight out.  </li>
            <li>It really did neither</li>
            <li>I have stick straight eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now my new fav!</li>
            <li>I bought this many times before at retail stores and paid much more  makes your lashes look long and thick and does not clump</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Used together my lashes are well separated, long and full looking.</li>
            <li>If I could I would give:   NO STARS to Maybelline New York XXL Curl waterproof mascara.  </li>
            <li>The brush is curved, actually to curved to fit the shape of my lashes...that was not too big a deal.  </li>
            <li>I am asian and have very course, straight eyelashes</li>
            <li>i usually use 7 or more mascaras to achieve my look</li>
            <li>I want a natural look.</li>
            <li>so I can continue to have pretty, long, curled eyelashes.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t just straight some of them actually point downwards.  </li>
            <li>I do curl my eyelashes before using the product simply because mine are so straight.  </li>
            <li>So until I can no longer purchase them from Amazon or Ebay, I&#x27;m going to continue to search high and low for these baby&#x27;s</li>
            <li>and I received 3 New York XXL Curl Waterproof Mascara instead, a totally different product.</li>
            <li>This mascara has two sides, one end contains primer that you apply first and the other side has the mascara.</li>
            <li>I finally reverted to my old ways of ordering online while stationed overseas, and BAM!</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t extend eyelashes, and barely coats them!</li>
            <li>but apparently it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It did show a difference in curl but at the same time it seemed to be a very brittle and dry formula.</li>
            <li>When I ordered this I considered that it would give a slight curl &amp; that&#x27;s all I was really looking for.</li>

            <li> No major smudges though</li>
            <li> It is no better or no worse than other brands but does have the primer end with the white stuff, which is what I was after.  </li>
            <li> I had bought this in a drug store a long time ago.</li>
            <li> It makes you lashes long and somewhat curled but its clumpy.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;easier to handle than the long ones.</li>
            <li> I do not like batting my eyes &amp; feeling my lower lashes &amp; upper lashes \\&quot;hit\\&quot; each other.  </li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s a hard job considering my eyelashes grow STRAIGHT DOWN.</li>
            <li> but when she went to use it, it was all dry!</li>
            <li> Still looking for the white and black type that isn&#x27;t waterproof.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure for someone that doesn&#x27;t have as bad of an issue with it as I do they could get away with just the mascara.</li>
            <li> I think I spent $2 or $3 on this including shipping</li>
            <li> I was so exited I opened it without noticing it was not what I ordered and gave my friend and sister the other 2</li>
            <li> I hope you continue selling this , I can find other work</li>
            <li> I have tried literally dozens of other types of mascaras, like this one, and nothing measures up.</li>
            <li> To make matters worse when you check the reviews, both products have the same reviews, although they are completely different products.</li>
            <li> I LOOKED LIKE A RACCOON WITH DARK UNDER NEATH</li>
            <li> Love the primer, hate the mascara.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a mascara that darkens and lengthens my lashes without making them look like I just piled a bunch of black goop on them.</li>
            <li> The mascara doesn&#x27;t stay on and leaves black streaks under the eyes.  </li>
            <li> The brush doesn&#x27;t show black</li>
            <li> Not worth the money!</li>
            <li> Both mascaras were dried out.</li>
            <li> It made my lashes feel heavy &amp; it didn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li> Very Black 532.</li>
            <li> WASTE OF MONEY!  </li>
            <li> , it is difficult to remove with regular eye makeup remover.  </li>
            <li> The product was a waste of my money (and I purchased 3 of them!).  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> and it has a bruch that makes it incredibly difficult to apply, and it was just simply gross.</li>
            <li> Reeeeaaaallly hard to wash off.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get off in the shower....</li>
            <li> This mascara makes my lashes feel really hard when it dries...</li>
            <li> I have a really hard time finding a mascara that holds the curl.  </li>
            <li> It was thick and never worked</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes look thick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through at least 20 different mascaras to try and see if it will keep my eyelashes curled - including very expensive ones from Sephora and Macy&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Illegal Length Fiber Extensions Mascara in Blackest Black 930, packaged with a Line Express Eyeliner.</li>
            <li> It is vsry hard ro find an will have to switch soon infortunately!</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s waterproof, but it&#x27;s a bit too hard to remove!  </li>
            <li> IT WAS ALSO VERY HARD TO REMOVE EVEN WITH EYE MAKEUP REMOVER.</li>
            <li> it started irritating my eyes, so I would rub them</li>
            <li> The NEW YORK XXL CURL mascara is just disgusting, makes my eyelashes stick together, it runs all over when I sweat</li>
            <li> (so it is far from being water proof) and it just feels awful.</li>
            <li> Not happy with it!</li>
            <li> It is fairly difficult to remove also.</li>
            <li> Too bad this product has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED..</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It was thick and never worked well it got all over my eyelid and even on cheek why I don&#x27;t know. But I cleaned the brush and it was not what I was paid for.</li>
            <li> I always get compliments on my &amp;#34;long lashes&amp;#34; when I use this.  It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever found and now that it has been discontinued I can still locate it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 Maybelline XXL Pro Volume Waterproof Microfiber Mascara  a great  product I have been using for over 2 years now and I received 3 New York XXL Curl Waterproof Mascara instead, a totally different product. I was so exited I opened it without noticing it was not what I ordered and gave my friend and sister the other 2 so I cannot return them for a refund.   The NEW YORK XXL CURL mascara is just disgusting, makes my eyelashes stick together, it runs all over when I sweat (so it is far from being water proof) and it just feels awful. To make matters worse when you check the reviews, both products have the same reviews, although they are completely different products. I will not order from The Candy Depot again.  If I could I would give:   NO STARS to Maybelline New York XXL Curl waterproof mascara.  5 STARS to Maybelline XXL Pro Volume Waterproof Microfiber Mascara.</li>
            <li> I really liked how long my lashes looked when using this product, but it tended to not be quite as waterproof as I had hoped. No major smudges though--I would still use this product!</li>
            <li> It was a Christmas gift for my gf and when she got it she was all excited to get more make up but when she went to use it, it was all dry! Not happy with it! Had to spend more money to replace it at the store</li>
            <li> NOT WHAT I HOPED FOR. THIS PRODUCT CLAIMS TO CURL AND BE WATERPROOF...VERY DISAPPOINTED.. THIS PRODUCT DID NOT PERFORM AS ADVERTISED.</li>
            <li> I have been using various waterproof mascara&#x27;s and this product is the best one I&#x27;ve tried so far. This mascara has two sides, one end contains primer that you apply first and the other side has the mascara. The primer side helps separate and lengthen my eye lashes.  The mascara side coats the primer and gives my lashes color.  Used together my lashes are well separated, long and full looking. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> i usually use 7 or more mascaras to achieve my look but i only have to use this now! so happy</li>
            <li> Ok so I&#x27;m older (50s) and have been looking for a mascara that would curl and hold my lashes.  This one does it.  The step 1 side always adds some volume which is great.  I lOVE IT - LOVE IT - LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Love the primer, hate the mascara.</li>
            <li> Great product! Wish they still carried it in the stores! It is vsry hard ro find an will have to switch soon infortunately!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just putting a lot of stuff on your eyelashes, really. I have yet to find a mascara that darkens and lengthens my lashes without making them look like I just piled a bunch of black goop on them. I want a natural look. Maybe one day...</li>
            <li> Best mascara i have ever used(: i wont change it for nothing glad i can still purchase it on amazon! i love it</li>
            <li> Reeeeaaaallly hard to wash off.  I know it&#x27;s waterproof, but it&#x27;s a bit too hard to remove!  Still looking for the white and black type that isn&#x27;t waterproof.  That one works great.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. It&#x27;s now my new fav! It gives my lashes a lil umph while protecting my own lashes as well.</li>
            <li> I like the primer.  Too bad this product has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even want to give it a one star.  It SMUDGES within minutes!  I went on a date and applied this before I went.  Well, couple hours later, I went to the restroom and realized I had raccoon eyes!  Total embarrassment!  WASTE OF MONEY!  Not only that, it is difficult to remove with regular eye makeup remover.  Do not buy unless you enjoy looking like a raccoon!</li>
            <li> I bought this mascara while traveling and absolutely loved it. I seared far and wide at all my local stores, couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. I finally reverted to my old ways of ordering online while stationed overseas, and BAM! I found it :) Sooo happy over this find!!</li>
            <li> I ordered the XXL Curl Waterproof Mascara Very Black 532. What arrived in the mail today is&lt;br /&gt;Maybelline Illegal Length Fiber Extensions Mascara in Blackest Black 930, packaged with a Line Express Eyeliner. Totally different packaging, different product.</li>
            <li> I had bought this in a drug store a long time ago. I purchased this one on amazon because i thought it was similar but apparently it wasn&#x27;t. It makes you lashes long and somewhat curled but its clumpy. It is fairly difficult to remove also.</li>
            <li> The product was a waste of my money (and I purchased 3 of them!).  The packaging is deceiving - the mascara itself is 1/4 the size of the wand applicator - thus, you think the tube is much larger than it actually is.  The mascara doesn&#x27;t stay on and leaves black streaks under the eyes.  Not worth the money!</li>
            <li> This mascara does its job! It does what mascara needs to do. This mascara has lengthened and curled my lashes tremendously. And that&#x27;s a hard job considering my eyelashes grow STRAIGHT DOWN. It is what it says it is. Waterproof. It&#x27;s hard to get off in the shower....but that&#x27;s what waterproof means, right?</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t extend eyelashes, and barely coats them! The $2 ELF mascara at Target works 10x better! Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Looks great, but for a waterproof mascara, it does smudge a little. If you&#x27;re one to have a good cry, I&#x27;d go with another maybelline waterproof.</li>
            <li> There is no mascara in the tube. The brush doesn&#x27;t show black so I assume there was none to start with.</li>
            <li> I got this for a great price I think $2? So I figured I would give it a shot.  The brush is curved, actually to curved to fit the shape of my lashes...that was not too big a deal.  My only problem is around have way through the day it started irritating my eyes, so I would rub them and then I would look like a racoon....not very water proof in my opinion.  Maybe it&#x27;s just my eyes but I keep this in my purse just in case I forgot to put on mascara not my day to day favorite.</li>
            <li> The mascara was shipped in the nick of time. It got here right before I headed out for a birthday party. Great time to try it, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The primer side works quite well and it helps the mascara formula keep my lashes curled. It didn&#x27;t quite curl my lashes like it claimed it would on its own, but that&#x27;s okay. My lashes are very fickle and you have to heat the curler in order for my lashes to hold the curl. Ha!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this mascara for about a year now, and when I heard it was discontinued I&#x27;d stocked up. My original stock pile ran out so I decided to buy from this seller. I think this product itself was amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item I received was not what I ordered. Both mascaras were dried out. What a total bummer. I wouldn&#x27;t buy from this seller.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat curly lashes &amp; figured that usually Maybelline is the best mascara for me to use. When I ordered this I considered that it would give a slight curl &amp; that&#x27;s all I was really looking for. Receiving the product I was excited to try it out. It did show a difference in curl but at the same time it seemed to be a very brittle and dry formula. It made my lashes feel heavy &amp; it didn&#x27;t like it at all. If you don&#x27;t mind your lashes feeling this way then go ahead and buy it. I like a more natural feel. The delivery was great in terms of being prompt and arriving before it&#x27;s suggested date. The packaging was in great condition. The only complaints I have are the formula itself.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the Maybelline mascara with lash primer that&#x27;s been discontinued! When I ordered this one, I thought I&lt;br /&gt;was getting the same, but it is not. The primer makes mascara work much better, and the shorter wand is much&lt;br /&gt;easier to handle than the long ones.</li>
            <li> I love Mascara and kep trying all kinds. So I had to have this one. I love it. Makes my lashes look thick. Yea!</li>
            <li> This mascara makes my lashes feel really hard when it dries...to the point they feel like they may break off.  I do not like batting my eyes &amp; feeling my lower lashes &amp; upper lashes \\&quot;hit\\&quot; each other.  I will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> DIDNT REALLY LIKE THIS MASCARA--AFTER WEARING IT FOR 2 HOURS I LOOKED LIKE A RACCOON WITH DARK UNDER NEATH MY EYES. IT WAS ALSO VERY HARD TO REMOVE EVEN WITH EYE MAKEUP REMOVER.</li>
            <li> The 2 steps are the perfect way to achieve that extra effect for longer lashes that last longer, and it&#x27;s waterproof too!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  I am asian and have very course, straight eyelashes so I have to curl them with an eyelash curler that&#x27;s been warmed by my hairdryer.  Most mascara&#x27;s completely make my eyelashes uncurl themselves once I put the mascara on.  I&#x27;ve gone through at least 20 different mascaras to try and see if it will keep my eyelashes curled - including very expensive ones from Sephora and Macy&#x27;s.  None worked.  This is the only mascara I can use and now it&#x27;s discontinued.  So until I can no longer purchase them from Amazon or Ebay, I&#x27;m going to continue to search high and low for these baby&#x27;s so I can continue to have pretty, long, curled eyelashes.</li>
            <li> i usually love maybelline products, i like the mascara brush and the double ends.....but..... i do not like the fact that after you wear it all day that it smears under the eye........ i have to say that my Covergirl mascara is number one in this field!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this product. I think I spent $2 or $3 on this including shipping and it wasn&#x27;t even worth that much. I think I could find better mascara at the $ store.</li>
            <li> Got this and it has a bruch that makes it incredibly difficult to apply, and it was just simply gross. You get what you pay for I guess!</li>
            <li> This is just not for me.  Maybe people like taking the extra step, but I don&#x27;t.  I found that when i was in a hurry it was just to much of a hassle. I feel that its not waterproof also.  Most of the time the mascara got all over my eye!! not the best, but it was a good price!</li>
            <li> It just wasn&#x27;t for me. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone. I&#x27;d much rather have used anything else. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product. It holds a curl very well, but it&#x27;s waterproof meaning its a pain to take off but I don&#x27;t mind it. I would repurches</li>
            <li> This is a perfect mascara for those of us that have decent lashes but they stick straight out.  I have to curl my lashes, and many mascaras uncurl them.  I have a really hard time finding a mascara that holds the curl.  This one does it beautifully.  I can&#x27;t find it in the store anymore, so I order it on line.</li>
            <li> Love the Look and Curly and Long</li>
            <li> It is the best waterproof and the only one that actually curles my lashes does not come off till I take it off!</li>
            <li> I hope you continue selling this , I can find other work the same that good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great and stays on your lashes....it doesn&#x27;t chip or run all day..but it washes off easily at the end of the day...</li>
            <li> The product claimed to make your lashes curl more/better.  It really did neither but I didn&#x27;t expect it to.  It is no better or no worse than other brands but does have the primer end with the white stuff, which is what I was after.  This product has a curved brush that I personally don&#x27;t like but it still works okay.  It may be better for those with longer lashes than my short little things.  :-)</li>
            <li> Maybelline did me a huge disservice my discontinuing their best mascara, &amp;#34;Sky High Curls&amp;#34;.  I have tried literally dozens of other types of mascaras, like this one, and nothing measures up.</li>
            <li> I bought this many times before at retail stores and paid much more  makes your lashes look long and thick and does not clump</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  I have stick straight eyelashes.  I&#x27;m not kidding! They aren&#x27;t just straight some of them actually point downwards.  This is the only product I have used that actually keeps my eyelashes up, curled and visible.  I do curl my eyelashes before using the product simply because mine are so straight.  I&#x27;m sure for someone that doesn&#x27;t have as bad of an issue with it as I do they could get away with just the mascara.</li>
