            <li>Feels so good on face.</li>
            <li>I add vit C powder &amp; loved the combination.</li>
            <li>I was searching for good moisturizing serum with anti aging effect..</li>
            <li>Not as good as Oz Naturals.</li>
            <li>The price was really good too, compared to the price of this item in Ulta, you do save some money.</li>
            <li>Good product at a fair price.</li>
            <li>I think this product is good, but not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>I have used this product before and it is a good product.  </li>
            <li>The product came well packed and it  was in good condition.  </li>
            <li>Well, my wife is happy with the product :)</li>
            <li>All 3 products are excellent and priced right.</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>Since I started using this my skin is so much better!</li>
            <li>I put this on before I put on my moisturizer, it is just amazing...</li>
            <li>Dries nice.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs nicely without leaving a tacky film on the skin.</li>
            <li>Reviva Labs Hyaluronic Acid Serum is a nice product for use after a peel.</li>
            <li>It is wonderful and hydrates my skin very well.  </li>
            <li>This particular serum is awesome.</li>
            <li>I use this product and I deeply recomend it, is good, all products with hyaluronic acid are excellent for the skin.  </li>
            <li>I read a Review that said this product was just as good as ester Lauders advanced night repair,so I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>This is an inexpensive, but good alternative to the hyaluronic acid products available.</li>
            <li>You would be better off using the NOW brand Hyaluronic Acid Capsules, which are really good and help with joint lubrication, and reduction of fine lines on face.</li>
            <li>this is not difficult and feels good and looks nice.  </li>
            <li>for $13.59, so I won&#x27;t be buying more even though I want to.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to return it without a problem; however, it makes me question the quality of product handling and storage via amazon.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this serum, it is so smoothing and firming.</li>
            <li>But, why pay more?</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I have been buying/using this HA serum for many years</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I can say with honesty that my skin looks more plumped out with the use of this product.</li>
            <li>love love love love LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love it-</li>
            <li>I love this serum.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Every time I put this on I want to put on more.</li>
            <li>I am going to order more Reviva products.</li>
            <li>so I worked great at keeping my skin healthy all summer in a new city!</li>
            <li>Reviva labs is significantly cheaper and works just as well as Skin Medica!  </li>
            <li>It is more of a gel-like substance (skin medica is \\&quot;watery\\&quot;), but the product absorbs very quickly into the skin.  </li>
            <li>great benefit if you want soft feeling skin</li>
            <li>The serum is silky and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I liked the Reviva brand so much, I ordered 3 additional bottles!  </li>
            <li>I really consider this product a must have for the promotion of healthy looking skin!</li>
            <li>and she loves it, too, and has seen fantastic results.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use and works very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m becoming more high maintenance as life moves on. .</li>
            <li>It absorbs super quick and is easy to wear under your day or night cream.</li>
            <li>Juicing, clean lifestyle and plenty of water.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got the important ingredient, hyaluronic acid, higher up in the ingredient list than most similar products, so it&#x27;s better than most, but I&#x27;ll keep looking for a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased the same product from stores and spas and it should be a gel like texture with a mild, pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>Every product I have tried I have loved, I cannot get enough.</li>
            <li>It does plump the skin when used under a moisturizer though, so that part is true.</li>
            <li>first time trying this product, so far my skin feels good.</li>
            <li>It effectively plumps fine lines and helps skin look younger.</li>
            <li>Item was shipped quickly and I received it in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>This product provides all the moisturizing I need, soaks in quickly and leaves no oiliness.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly in the skin</li>
            <li>It does not burn my eyes at all, dries quickly, and leaves no residues.  </li>
            <li>Many reviewers said to put in on your bare skin first, then put your moisturize on top, so I did that.  </li>
            <li>My skin was a bit dry, even after using a good cleansing product.</li>
            <li>this product is absorbed quickly, but has the peeling effect if you add something else on it.</li>
            <li>My skin feels more soft as well!</li>
            <li>I love the pump bottle, too, since you can get nearly all of it out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine, even though rated with high marks I prefer Oz Natural&#x27;s version better.</li>
            <li>This seems a bit irresponsible, but I also use this brand of other things, so give the evaluation,I feel good</li>
            <li>I used it right after my shower when it arrived today.</li>
            <li>I recommend researching Hyaluronic Acid before deciding if it&#x27;s right for you.</li>
            <li>I put on the get, my skin was soft and smooth right away.</li>
            <li>If your looking for moisture retention in your skin mix a little of this amazing product in your every day moisteriser and see the results it fills in little lines and feel great</li>
            <li>I have been using it for several years and love it.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what I hoped it would, hydrates my skin and does not leave it oily.</li>
            <li>I waited awhile before purchasing, I am so glad I finally bought it.</li>
            <li>But, it absorbed very well.</li>
            <li>I use this product in conjunction with a makeup foundation as the first thing I put on my skin in the morning.</li>
            <li>It really holds the moisture on my face!  </li>
            <li>I will be back for more.</li>
            <li>I continue to like the light texture of the clear serum, but the metallic odor does cause me to wonder what is in it that is causing the odor.  </li>
            <li>This item wa exactly what I was looking for and what I oredered.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m 44, post-menopausal and on oral chemotherapy for several more years (in year 4 now).  </li>
            <li>This is the first  time I shopped for the product on line.  </li>
            <li>Since I tend to be allergic to so many things, I appreciate that this serum is gentle enough and doesn&#x27;t have an odor.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased at least 5 of these this year, so I can safely say that I love the results.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for a long time, and love it.</li>
            <li>Ladies, this stuff really works, and it is not expensive.</li>
            <li>I received this product fast</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much difference.</li>
            <li>However, when I order it from amazon it comes very liquidy or having a rancid smell.</li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>I noticed it was no longer colorless but did not think much of it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell until months from now.</li>
            <li>bought it after reading reviews and because the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>I would give it a 5 if it made me look 21 again, haha. .</li>
            <li>I use the  Reviva Light Skin Peel and Reviva Labs Gycolic Acid Facial Toner as part of my skin care routine too.  </li>
            <li>I purchased from sprouts but much cheaper on amazon.</li>
            <li>feels very silky on skin.  </li>
            <li>I am almost 80 years young and my skin is smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>My skin absorbs Reviva better than it absorbs the other brand.</li>
            <li>I became a regular user after seeing good results in less than a week&#x27;s time.</li>
            <li>Usually I use it at night time only as I have found that it does exfoliate the skin so if I am wearing foundation over it, my skin starts peeling which doesn&#x27;t look very nice.  </li>
            <li>I research main ingredient in this gel.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Normally, this does not have a smell or color and the consistency is gel like.</li>
            <li>I also use other moisturizers over it and or sunscreen and it seems to do fine.</li>
            <li>-WOW!</li>
            <li>I think it does help my skin retain water, am seeing some less fine lines and seems to help around lips.  </li>
            <li>I do use it every other night on clean toned skin before applying a nigh time moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The small bottle certainly does last a long time for sure!  </li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s clear you can also see how much you have left.</li>
            <li>Before buying, I always compare prices, and VitaCost, thus far, has always had the lowest price.</li>
            <li>my skin is soft but it did break me out</li>
            <li>Noticeably soft and clear skin</li>
            <li>my crow&#x27;s feet were nearly gone.  </li>
            <li>Oh, and I also use a scrub every morning after I use the glycolic acid to take off the old layer of skin,</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a few weeks since I purchased it and made sure I used it regularly before I posted a review.</li>
            <li>Only recently have I started ordering it from Amazon, because I found the price was right</li>
            <li>alone, it makes my skin feel taut, a little dry, so i have to put cream on top.</li>
            <li>I use several of Reviva Labs products and highly recommend them</li>
            <li>This apparently is one ingredient that helps mature hydrate.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not using Hyaluronic Acid and you&#x27;re concerned about fine lines, uneven skin tone, elasticity loss, clogged pores, and dry flaky skin...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received numerous compliments about how soft and moist my skin looks.</li>
            <li>I purchase this at a local natural foods store.  </li>

            <li> I have been using it for several years and love it.  </li>
            <li> Does exactly what I hoped it would, hydrates my skin and does not leave it oily.</li>
            <li> I waited awhile before purchasing, I am so glad I finally bought it.</li>
            <li> But, it absorbed very well.</li>
            <li> I use this product in conjunction with a makeup foundation as the first thing I put on my skin in the morning.</li>
            <li> It really holds the moisture on my face!  </li>
            <li> I will be back for more.</li>
            <li> I continue to like the light texture of the clear serum, but the metallic odor does cause me to wonder what is in it that is causing the odor.  </li>
            <li> This item wa exactly what I was looking for and what I oredered.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m 44, post-menopausal and on oral chemotherapy for several more years (in year 4 now).  </li>
            <li> This is the first  time I shopped for the product on line.  </li>
            <li> Since I tend to be allergic to so many things, I appreciate that this serum is gentle enough and doesn&#x27;t have an odor.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased at least 5 of these this year, so I can safely say that I love the results.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time, and love it.</li>
            <li> Ladies, this stuff really works, and it is not expensive.</li>
            <li> I received this product fast</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much difference.</li>
            <li> However, when I order it from amazon it comes very liquidy or having a rancid smell.</li>
            <li> This really works.</li>
            <li> I noticed it was no longer colorless but did not think much of it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell until months from now.</li>
            <li> bought it after reading reviews and because the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> I would give it a 5 if it made me look 21 again, haha. .</li>
            <li> I use the  Reviva Light Skin Peel and Reviva Labs Gycolic Acid Facial Toner as part of my skin care routine too.  </li>
            <li> I purchased from sprouts but much cheaper on amazon.</li>
            <li> feels very silky on skin.  </li>
            <li> I am almost 80 years young and my skin is smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> My skin absorbs Reviva better than it absorbs the other brand.</li>
            <li> I became a regular user after seeing good results in less than a week&#x27;s time.</li>
            <li> Usually I use it at night time only as I have found that it does exfoliate the skin so if I am wearing foundation over it, my skin starts peeling which doesn&#x27;t look very nice.  </li>
            <li> I research main ingredient in this gel.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Normally, this does not have a smell or color and the consistency is gel like.</li>
            <li> I also use other moisturizers over it and or sunscreen and it seems to do fine.</li>
            <li> -WOW!</li>
            <li> I think it does help my skin retain water, am seeing some less fine lines and seems to help around lips.  </li>
            <li> I do use it every other night on clean toned skin before applying a nigh time moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The small bottle certainly does last a long time for sure!  </li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s clear you can also see how much you have left.</li>
            <li> Before buying, I always compare prices, and VitaCost, thus far, has always had the lowest price.</li>
            <li> my skin is soft but it did break me out</li>
            <li> Noticeably soft and clear skin</li>
            <li> my crow&#x27;s feet were nearly gone.  </li>
            <li> Oh, and I also use a scrub every morning after I use the glycolic acid to take off the old layer of skin,</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks since I purchased it and made sure I used it regularly before I posted a review.</li>
            <li> Only recently have I started ordering it from Amazon, because I found the price was right</li>
            <li> alone, it makes my skin feel taut, a little dry, so i have to put cream on top.</li>
            <li> I use several of Reviva Labs products and highly recommend them</li>
            <li> This apparently is one ingredient that helps mature hydrate.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not using Hyaluronic Acid and you&#x27;re concerned about fine lines, uneven skin tone, elasticity loss, clogged pores, and dry flaky skin...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received numerous compliments about how soft and moist my skin looks.</li>
            <li> I purchase this at a local natural foods store.  </li>
            <li> a tiny bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I had tried a sampler on my forearm one day and three days later that little spot was still so soft and supple compared to the rest of my arm.  </li>
            <li> The glycolic takes away old skin, gives me a slight chemical peel and firms my skin</li>
            <li> I started using it and noticed a strange smell.</li>
            <li> odor to it when I apply it, similar to rust that is wet.  </li>
            <li> It arrived much earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> My skin tone has definitely improved and lines seem less deep.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for a long time you can see results in one month!</li>
            <li> It last forever since a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I am 65 years old and my skin has very few lines or wrinkles I&#x27;ve been using these products for about 5 years ...</li>
            <li> so my skin is very dry.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this stuff, especially when I use it in conjunction with my new microroller.</li>
            <li> Although, I have only had it a few days now, it truly made an immediate difference in my complexion.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll notice skin improvement after only a few days!</li>
            <li> My other products are pricey and this help stretch them.</li>
            <li> I prefer Reviva  Labs over the other brand.</li>
            <li> You only need a few drops for it to do its thing!</li>
            <li> recommend to use it alone rather than under some other moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have used other hyaluronic products and they seem to give me immediate results.</li>
            <li> I put this on the other 4 nights.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months now and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The dark circles under my eyes have improved, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> I tried this product several months ago while I was also using the Skin Medica Hydrating Complex (hyaluronic acid) brand.  </li>
            <li> As for results I am not sure how long you would have to use this product to see the desired results you are looking for.</li>
            <li> The problem is that my moisturizer does other things like fade my freckles and age spots and firm my skin, which it stopped doing because it couldn&#x27;t reach my skin with this product underneath.  </li>
            <li> However, the bottle I just received has a slight, but noticeable, &amp;#34;metallic&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn or sting but it has a slight cooling effect.</li>
            <li> Slightly plumps out your wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It takes very little to cover a wide area.  </li>
            <li> Seriously my secret to looking younger.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for a few years and it does the job advertised.</li>
            <li> There is no magic potion for wrinkles for my age, and I&#x27;ve found this skin food</li>
            <li> , im not sure if its the product i got or its the formula</li>
            <li> not sure if i see any results.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not all that expensive!  </li>
            <li> and I never got bad batch.</li>
            <li> This time I purchased two bottles and even though the exp date is 2/17, this serum went bad or was bad to start with.  </li>
            <li> but i didnt like its texture it absorbs and leave some residues which is annoying,</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The small bottle certainly does last a long time for sure!  Still using it every night but don&#x27;t notice any big changes.  Maybe I should&#x27;ve been using it twice a day.</li>
            <li> My skin tone has definitely improved and lines seem less deep.  Best product I have found yet and better, it&#x27;s not all that expensive!  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I use this product and I deeply recomend it, is good, all products with hyaluronic acid are excellent for the skin.  I received this product fast and I like that.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  You&#x27;ll notice skin improvement after only a few days!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much difference.</li>
            <li> I became a regular user after seeing good results in less than a week&#x27;s time. It effectively plumps fine lines and helps skin look younger. Since I tend to be allergic to so many things, I appreciate that this serum is gentle enough and doesn&#x27;t have an odor.  I apply the serum twice a day on my face, neck, and upper chest; and sometimes I use it on my hands at night before applying cream or lotion. Before buying, I always compare prices, and VitaCost, thus far, has always had the lowest price.</li>
            <li> $217 per pound? That&#x27;s the price of this stuff, 1 oz. for $13.59, so I won&#x27;t be buying more even though I want to.  It&#x27;s got the important ingredient, hyaluronic acid, higher up in the ingredient list than most similar products, so it&#x27;s better than most, but I&#x27;ll keep looking for a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It was recommended by my estethician. However, when I order it from amazon it comes very liquidy or having a rancid smell. I&#x27;ve been able to return it without a problem; however, it makes me question the quality of product handling and storage via amazon. I&#x27;ve purchased the same product from stores and spas and it should be a gel like texture with a mild, pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for several years and love it.  Item was shipped quickly and I received it in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It seems to work and the shipping was timely.</li>
            <li> I use Retin-A so my skin is very dry.  This product provides all the moisturizing I need, soaks in quickly and leaves no oiliness.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizing product.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd purchase of this product and I will buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;It is a temporary fix for my wrinkles, as I am in my 70s.  There is no magic potion for wrinkles for my age, and I&#x27;ve found this skin food last&#x27;s about 6-8 hours to lessing the lines and to help my confidence too!</li>
            <li> I have had the pleasure of batting 1000 with my Reviva purchases. I am an Olay convert and will never being going back lol. I love this serum, it is so smoothing and firming. It absorbs super quick and is easy to wear under your day or night cream. Every product I have tried I have loved, I cannot get enough.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I hoped it would, hydrates my skin and does not leave it oily.</li>
            <li> I love this! I like to use it at night, after serum and before moisturizer. My other products are pricey and this help stretch them.</li>
            <li> I waited awhile before purchasing, I am so glad I finally bought it. I used it right after my shower when it arrived today. My skin was a bit dry, even after using a good cleansing product. I put on the get, my skin was soft and smooth right away. I thought it would be sticky, it is a gel. But, it absorbed very well. I felt it working. I research main ingredient in this gel. I found some that were pricier, by quite a bit. But, why pay more? This really works. I tried it on the ends of my hair. It was only so-so.I applied it on my hands, and noticed a great difference.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and this product does wonders. Hydrates and plumps - lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Feels so good on face. Hope it helps retain moisture.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! I don&#x27;t let myself run out. I am almost 80 years young and my skin is smooth and soft. I have used this product for over a year.&lt;br /&gt;I have used another brand before trying this one. I prefer Reviva  Labs over the other brand. My skin absorbs Reviva better than it absorbs the other brand. I will definitely keep buying Reviva.</li>
            <li> Spoiled product?  I do not know what happened to this product but this is not what I am used to.  I have been buying/using this HA serum for many years and I never got bad batch. Normally, this does not have a smell or color and the consistency is gel like. This time I purchased two bottles and even though the exp date is 2/17, this serum went bad or was bad to start with.  I noticed it was no longer colorless but did not think much of it. I started using it and noticed a strange smell. Also, from the end of Oct until now, both bottles went from gel like consistency to liquid.  Anyway, I threw both bottles out and I guess I am not buying it anymore.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product..instanteously plumps up skin.</li>
            <li> Great price for hyaluronic. Absorbs quickly in the skin so I worked great at keeping my skin healthy all summer in a new city! Compare to Booster Serum by Philosophy. I add vit C powder &amp; loved the combination. Will purchase from again. It last forever since a little goes a long way. Dilute in distilled water and use as a refresher spray as well!</li>
            <li> my skin is soft but it did break me out</li>
            <li> I use this product in conjunction with a makeup foundation as the first thing I put on my skin in the morning. I&#x27;ve received numerous compliments about how soft and moist my skin looks.</li>
            <li> Love this product!! Noticeably soft and clear skin</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Although, I have only had it a few days now, it truly made an immediate difference in my complexion.  You only need a few drops for it to do its thing!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  It really holds the moisture on my face!  Excellent a aging.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot. I have purchased at least 5 of these this year, so I can safely say that I love the results. I do not use it every day, it depends on my activity. I do use it every other night on clean toned skin before applying a nigh time moisturizer. When I do wear it in the day time it is under my daily sunscreen of foundation. The product does work. I can say with honesty that my skin looks more plumped out with the use of this product. I also do my best to take care of the inside too. Juicing, clean lifestyle and plenty of water. I really consider this product a must have for the promotion of healthy looking skin!</li>
            <li> love love love love LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> I started using this with my microroller-WOW! I&#x27;m addicted to this stuff, especially when I use it in conjunction with my new microroller. The results are almost instant and it will have you looking in the mirror and smiling at yourself again.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 3 star because I just started using it. I read a Review that said this product was just as good as ester Lauders advanced night repair,so I decided to try it. It does seem a bit thinner than EL . I will have to report back after I have used it longer.</li>
            <li> I will be back for more. Very easy to use and works very well. My skin feels more soft as well!</li>
            <li> I have not reviewed this product before, and I should have, as I would heretofore have given it five stars.  However, the bottle I just received has a slight, but noticeable, &amp;#34;metallic&amp;#34; odor to it when I apply it, similar to rust that is wet.  I have been using it about a week now, and it seems to be decreasing over time.  I continue to like the light texture of the clear serum, but the metallic odor does cause me to wonder what is in it that is causing the odor.  The service in receiving the order, and its packaging, was excellent.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way. It feels great. I think it does help my skin retain water, am seeing some less fine lines and seems to help around lips.  Dries nice.  Love it- a tiny bit goes a long way.  Have been using for a month now. I also use other moisturizers over it and or sunscreen and it seems to do fine. I plan to buy again.</li>
            <li> This seems a bit irresponsible, but I also use this brand of other things, so give the evaluation,I feel good</li>
            <li> I was searching for good moisturizing serum with anti aging effect.. I use it with my derma roller sometimes but i didnt like its texture it absorbs and leave some residues which is annoying,, im not sure if its the product i got or its the formula</li>
            <li> The serum hyaluronic is excellent because give you a moisture that you need in one day.  I am 28 years.</li>
            <li> I use this as a daytime serum. I like the way it makes my skin feel!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine, even though rated with high marks I prefer Oz Natural&#x27;s version better. Not as good as Oz Naturals.</li>
            <li> this product is absorbed quickly, but has the peeling effect if you add something else on it. do not like it for this reason. recommend to use it alone rather than under some other moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Hydrates my skin. I have been using this product for a few months now and a little goes a long way. The price was really good too, compared to the price of this item in Ulta, you do save some money. My esthetician recommended this to me as part of a skin care regiment.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time, and love it. Only recently have I started ordering it from Amazon, because I found the price was right and the shipping was prompt. Ladies, this stuff really works, and it is not expensive.</li>
            <li> I put this on before I put on my moisturizer, it is just amazing... I am 65 years old and my skin has very few lines or wrinkles I&#x27;ve been using these products for about 5 years ... Amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I have been looking all over for the correct item.  Some people advertise a different item than they send out. This item wa exactly what I was looking for and what I oredered. THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> This serum is the best! If you&#x27;re not using Hyaluronic Acid and you&#x27;re concerned about fine lines, uneven skin tone, elasticity loss, clogged pores, and dry flaky skin... you should definitely try adding it to your skin care regimen. This particular serum is awesome. I&#x27;ve used Reviva Labs products before and have been completely happy with the quality and performance of their products so I had no reservations about ordering their Hyaluronic Acid serum. Even after one use, you will notice a difference in your skin. I only use this serum at night before moisturizing (I let it sit on the skin for about 15 mins before applying moisturizer). It absorbs nicely without leaving a tacky film on the skin. It doesn&#x27;t have a scent, either. It doesn&#x27;t burn or sting but it has a slight cooling effect. I recommend researching Hyaluronic Acid before deciding if it&#x27;s right for you.</li>
            <li> If your looking for moisture retention in your skin mix a little of this amazing product in your every day moisteriser and see the results it fills in little lines and feel great</li>
            <li> As represented. Good product at a fair price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for a long time you can see results in one month! Will be ordering again! Thank you</li>
            <li> This does not absorb into the skin. You would be better off using the NOW brand Hyaluronic Acid Capsules, which are really good and help with joint lubrication, and reduction of fine lines on face.</li>
            <li> I purchase this at a local natural foods store.  I had tried a sampler on my forearm one day and three days later that little spot was still so soft and supple compared to the rest of my arm.  I decided I had to go back and try it.  Then I got my 75-year-old mother hooked on it and she loves it, too, and has seen fantastic results.  She uses it on her entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 44, post-menopausal and on oral chemotherapy for several more years (in year 4 now).  I&#x27;m also on hormonal suppression, so my skin is horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this on my eyelids, under my eyes, and on my crow&#x27;s feet and forehead crease.  I put it on under my eye cream and facial moisturizer.  It does not burn my eyes at all, dries quickly, and leaves no residues.  In three months of use, my deep lines under my eyes and my crow&#x27;s feet were nearly gone.  The dark circles under my eyes have improved, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One bottle lasts me about 5 months using it as above.  It takes very little to cover a wide area.  I love the pump bottle, too, since you can get nearly all of it out.  Since it&#x27;s clear you can also see how much you have left.</li>
            <li> I tried this product several months ago while I was also using the Skin Medica Hydrating Complex (hyaluronic acid) brand.  Reviva labs is significantly cheaper and works just as well as Skin Medica!  It is more of a gel-like substance (skin medica is \\&quot;watery\\&quot;), but the product absorbs very quickly into the skin.  I also apply this to the tops of my hands a minute before I apply hand cream (which helps to plump my skin).  I liked the Reviva brand so much, I ordered 3 additional bottles!  This is an inexpensive, but good alternative to the hyaluronic acid products available.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks since I purchased it and made sure I used it regularly before I posted a review. I think this product is good, but not what I was expecting. I have used other hyaluronic products and they seem to give me immediate results. This product is to be used alone or with regular moisuturizer. I would recommend it as a day or night lotion. As for results I am not sure how long you would have to use this product to see the desired results you are looking for.</li>
            <li> I love this serum.  It arrived much earlier than expected. Thank you.</li>
            <li> great benefit if you want soft feeling skin</li>
            <li> first time trying this product, so far my skin feels good. I can&#x27;t really tell until months from now.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and it is a good product.  This is the first  time I shopped for the product on line.  The product came well packed and it  was in good condition.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Reviva Labs Hyaluronic Acid Serum is a nice product for use after a peel. I purchased this to aid in recovering moisture after I do at home peels and I like it. The serum is silky and easy to apply. It does not have a scent that to me which is great and I understand that is has some anti-aging properties as well which is always a plus.</li>
            <li> Seriously my secret to looking younger. Put it on at night and in morning. Slightly plumps out your wrinkles. I tried others and went back to Reviva.</li>
            <li> bought it after reading reviews and because the price was reasonable. i use it after cleansing under moisturizer. alone, it makes my skin feel taut, a little dry, so i have to put cream on top. been using it for about two months. not sure if i see any results.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, makes skin smoother, and found out after I shaved this product calms razor burns.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin. It just balled up and fell off when I tried to apply it.</li>
            <li> I would give it a 5 if it made me look 21 again, haha. . .it does diminish wrinkles but says not to discontinue your firming cream.  Since I put glycolic acid on my face 3 nights per week (yes it stings) I put this on the other 4 nights.  The glycolic takes away old skin, gives me a slight chemical peel and firms my skin and this erases the wrinkles and replenishes the water.  I&#x27;m becoming more high maintenance as life moves on. . .but this is not difficult and feels good and looks nice.  I advocate it with a firming lotion.  Oh, and I also use a scrub every morning after I use the glycolic acid to take off the old layer of skin,</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is wonderful and hydrates my skin very well.  Usually I use it at night time only as I have found that it does exfoliate the skin so if I am wearing foundation over it, my skin starts peeling which doesn&#x27;t look very nice.  If no foundation is being worn, then I will use it in the morning as well.  I use the  Reviva Light Skin Peel and Reviva Labs Gycolic Acid Facial Toner as part of my skin care routine too.  All 3 products are excellent and priced right.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get enough. Every time I put this on I want to put on more. It just feels great. I purchased from sprouts but much cheaper on amazon. I am going to order more Reviva products. I definitely feel it has improved my skin plumpness. It seems to have plumped up some hollowness in my cheeks. I am intrigued....</li>
            <li> Wife loves it. A bit pricey.</li>
            <li> Well, my wife is happy with the product :)</li>
            <li> Many reviewers said to put in on your bare skin first, then put your moisturize on top, so I did that.  The problem is that my moisturizer does other things like fade my freckles and age spots and firm my skin, which it stopped doing because it couldn&#x27;t reach my skin with this product underneath.  So I will not be using it because after a week my freckles got darker and my skin got saggier until I figured out what was happening.  It does plump the skin when used under a moisturizer though, so that part is true.</li>
            <li> Since I started using this my skin is so much better!</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for a few years and it does the job advertised. Great skin care product,</li>
            <li> excellent products.  feels very silky on skin.  This apparently is one ingredient that helps mature hydrate.  I use several of Reviva Labs products and highly recommend them</li>
