            <li>purchased to use with the 2 other Coochy products thinking all 3 products would give great results.</li>

            <li>The fact that it&#x27;s a spray also makes it really convenient and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Also shipped pretty fast. :)</li>
            <li>The scent should be a little sweeter but otherwise a great product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the coochy shaving cream for a few years, and so I was so happy when I discovered the after spray.</li>
            <li>I thought maybe that was &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; for a just freshly shaven area.</li>
            <li>I have black hair and fair skin.</li>

            <li> decrease ingrown hairs and general irritation.  </li>
            <li> When I shave my pubic area in the shower I use the Coochy shave cream, then dry off, spray the mist and allow some time for the product to air dry by putting on face lotion and body lotion and some product in my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that it actually moisturizes/protects or not though.</li>
            <li> This works extremely well for me.  </li>
            <li> Very minimal fragrance, smells like aloe.</li>
            <li> so I could have at least tried to get my money back!</li>
            <li> You can hold it upside down</li>
            <li> you can spray upside down to reach other areas!</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and my skin reacts so badly after shaving, but I can use this on my underarms or in the bikini area after shaving and it keeps it clear.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really notice it cutting down on the razor burn or after shaving redness.  </li>
            <li> Even though it is &amp;#34;botanical&amp;#34;, it still smells a little &amp;#34;chemically&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> By the time I get dressed the mist has dried.</li>
            <li> but you have to use with Coochy Body Shave Cream - Green Tea.</li>
            <li> Well, I now know NOT to waste my time on after shave products!</li>
            <li> and I mean nothing has worked for me besides this.</li>
            <li> No more razor burn!</li>
            <li> The smell is a little weird too.</li>
            <li> but they are not nearly as agitated and painful as when I don&#x27;t use the Mist.</li>
            <li> Well, little did I know, that not even 2 hours later my skin would be broken out in rash, leading to some of the WORST razor</li>
            <li> Whenever I would shave my legs, the hairs would not poke through and they would itch so badly</li>
            <li> I would scratch until it became painful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like the concept of this...I&#x27;m not sure that it actually moisturizes/protects or not though. I also am not so fond of the smell. It&#x27;s kind of like a musty hippie-ish smell. Not terrible..but not one that makes me feel like I smell good.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this off of amazon, but I wanted to write a review anyways. I love this stuff..  It&#x27;s actually amazing! Nothing and I mean nothing has worked for me besides this. I have really sensitive skin and my skin reacts so badly after shaving, but I can use this on my underarms or in the bikini area after shaving and it keeps it clear. I&#x27;ve been using the coochy shaving cream for a few years, and so I was so happy when I discovered the after spray. The fact that it&#x27;s a spray also makes it really convenient and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this spray! Its so easy to use, it smells AMAZING and it really does a great job!  I use it daily and it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue.  It was  GREAT purchase!</li>
            <li> This smells very nice - but I don&#x27;t really notice it cutting down on the razor burn or after shaving redness.  It is good in theory, but it just doesn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> You cant use the coochy shave cream without using this- it totally makes the shave!  When using the two together, there is no dry skin!! Nice pump also- you can spray upside down to reach other areas! Absorbs fasther than mositurizing lotions as well, so when you are in a rush in the morning, its helpful!  Very minimal fragrance, smells like aloe.</li>
            <li> Initially, I bought only the Coochy Shave Cream. I loved it and it helped with the razor burn better than anything else I had tried, however, I still had razor burn and lots of redness. Soon after that I purchased the Mist and I am SO glad that I did. It really completes the Shave Cream. I have black hair and fair skin. I have very course hair and I have come to realize that there is probably nothing out there to completely prevent razor burn and bumps. Coochy Mist by far has done the best in keeping razor burn and redness at bay. I still get some razor burn and bumps but they are not nearly as agitated and painful as when I don&#x27;t use the Mist. The Mist has a nice gentle smell and doesn&#x27;t burn at all. When I shave my pubic area in the shower I use the Coochy shave cream, then dry off, spray the mist and allow some time for the product to air dry by putting on face lotion and body lotion and some product in my hair. By the time I get dressed the mist has dried. It creates a nice barrier between your underwear and skin. I will never go without Coochy Mist. I have a feeling that the longer I make it a part of my daily skin regiment the softer my hair will become.</li>
            <li> it does exactly what it says. leaves everything feeling smooth and no bumps or ingrown hair. my wife is very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Great product!  It smells OK, really helps with irritation, redness, bumps and itching agree shaving.  I recommend this product for sure.</li>
            <li> The Coochy Mist spray has helped eliminate skin irritation after shaving.  I apply after showering, and I am able to get dressed immediately.  It smells great and leaves behind no residue on my skin or clothes!</li>
            <li> This is definitely a rip off. I bought this thinking it would get rid of my razor burn, but it did not. I was using post shave balms before this, like Nivea, Dove, etc.. I thought this would work better and it did not. Also, the pump doesn&#x27;t spray well and both bottles leaked around the pump, causing it to get everywhere, except where I wanted it.The smell is a little weird too. Even though it is &amp;#34;botanical&amp;#34;, it still smells a little &amp;#34;chemically&amp;#34;. I definitely would not buy this again or recommend it.</li>
            <li> I used this one time, and one time only after shaving! I wanted to try it out, but after I sprayed it on, it began to burn. I thought maybe that was &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; for a just freshly shaven area. Well, little did I know, that not even 2 hours later my skin would be broken out in rash, leading to some of the WORST razor burn I&#x27;ve ever experienced!! &amp;#60;-- I am prone to razor burn due to how sensitive my skin is, which I why I wanted to try this product in the first place! Well, I now know NOT to waste my time on after shave products! I wish I would have used it sooner so I could have at least tried to get my money back! Oh well, my loss this time!</li>
            <li> purchased to use with the 2 other Coochy products thinking all 3 products would give great results. Don&#x27;t bother with this spray or the powder.... the shaving cream is all you need.</li>
            <li> Lives up to its promises.  Used with coochie cream my shaving experience is no longer a dreaded one.  Almost no bumps ever.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast delivery. I use it with choochy shaving cream. Haven&#x27;t had razor burn since I began using it. Prevents friction between shaved area and clothing. Especially good for bikini area!</li>
            <li> I bought this product along with the coochy cream shave system (I still laugh saying the name!). I used to wax and was aware of the sales pitches of &amp;#34;serums&amp;#34; that helped with ingrown hairs. I don&#x27;t know if they made a difference for me, but when it came to this product I figured I was either going to buy the entire system or nothing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is used AFTER shaving! I was nervous about spraying on a freshly shaved...area (LOL), but it did not sting or cause discomfort. As a matter of fact, it made my skin even smoother and made my clothes glide over that area like silk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li> Very happy to have tried this!  I have used the Coochy shave cream but this item was new to me. I love it. If you still fear razor bumps or rash even after using the Coochy cream, use this spray! Soothes...love it!!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It noticeably helps reduce razor burn and ingrown hairs, and helps keep my legs very smooth. I would definitely purchase it again when I run out.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Whenever I would shave my legs, the hairs would not poke through and they would itch so badly I would scratch until it became painful. With this stuff, that NEVER happens anymore. It&#x27;s so nice to have smooth skin again and not fear shaving. Any body who has problems with this or ingrown hairs in general NEEDS to use this. Complete life saver. Does not burn, smells nice. Completely recommend.</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for years and can&#x27;t live without it!! A must have!! I use it with the Coochy Cream. Wonderful!! All over use!!</li>
            <li> i love this and it is great for any woman! works great! i will definatly buy this again! thank you</li>
            <li> This after shave mist works great to calm the skin after shaving. I&#x27;m fair skinned and sensitive, but this mist keeps the skin moisturized and smooth. Smells like lavender!</li>
            <li> Not overly impressed - can&#x27;t really tell if it helps or not.  I seem to have the same results regardless.</li>
            <li> I will recommended to everyone who after shave ,getting the ingrown hair. It is really a good product but you have to use with Coochy Body Shave Cream - Green Tea. That is perfect match.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Coochy Cream shaving products for years and they are great.  This spray is super helpful after I shave my bikini line.  Just make sure the skin is dry before you put it on and let it dry.  You can hold it upside down and it still sprays perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and was so happy to see it available for order on amazon.  It really works.  No more razor burn!</li>
            <li> This works extremely well for me.  I get waxed and use this product daily after I shower to help stop/decrease ingrown hairs and general irritation.  Of course each person skin is different!  But its a great product. Very light on your skin and dries very quickly. Not oily at all and does not have much of a scent to it. Love the bottle and sprayer- it can be sprayed at any angle and sprays to the very last drop!  Also its great natural ingredients and they do not test on animals.  I definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I think it works pretty good but it doesn&#x27;t smell that great. The scent should be a little sweeter but otherwise a great product. Also shipped pretty fast. :)</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling smooth and completely un-irritated in sensitive places.</li>
