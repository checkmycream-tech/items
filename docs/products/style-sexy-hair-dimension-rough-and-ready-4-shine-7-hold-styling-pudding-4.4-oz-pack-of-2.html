            <li> Best hair gel ever.  I. Don&#x27;t understand why they stopped  making this.  The new formula that they are selling in place of this doesn&#x27;t work as well, you get less, and it is more expensive.  I&#x27;m glad I can still buy this on Amazon for the time being.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I thought it was, but it works pretty good.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best for fine short hair..never greasy. Wish you would go back to selling it in 3 packs.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years.  It is sticky on your hands but not in your hair,  It really gives you lift.  I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I find rough and ready short sexy hair the very best product for my hair. It holds its shape and stays in place</li>
            <li> I love this product it doesn&#x27;t make my hair heavy or sticky. I put this on my hair while it&#x27;s wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Five star all the way</li>
            <li> You to style your hair and not have heaviness and a greasy feel, and it holds all day. I just wish you could still find it in salons.</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous.  Texturizes fine hair for that short, spiky, &amp;#34;messed-up&amp;#34; look without leaving hair waxy or greasy like so many other products.  I have researched everything on the market and can&#x27;t find anything that compares. The only negative is that for some inexplicable reason Short Sexy Hair is no longer making this product, so stock up now while you can still buy it online!  The Short Sexy Hair website says their products last for 5 years, so it should be good for a while.</li>
            <li> I have used this product many years. I have fine hair and this gives my hair the texture it needs.</li>

            <li> Best styling gel I&#x27;ve tried.  My son and I both use this product.  It smells great and you don&#x27;t need a lot of product.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> This was what I was looking for, works the way I wanted it to, love it as it makes my thinning hair appear thicker.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by our hair dresser so I know it is a quality product. My daughter won&#x27;t use anything else so I know it works.</li>
            <li> great product with an excellent price. Very happy with the fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Works great on my short hair.</li>
