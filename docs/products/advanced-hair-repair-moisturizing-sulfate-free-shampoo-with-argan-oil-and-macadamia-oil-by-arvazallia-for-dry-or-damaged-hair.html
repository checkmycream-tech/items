            <li>This doesn&#x27;t lather a lot because it&#x27;s sulfate free, but you don&#x27;t need to use a lot to see great results.</li>
            <li>my own based on my experience with the product.</li>
            <li>After using them, all I could focus on was petting my own head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The views in this statement are strictly my own and I am not affiliated with any of these companies.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Opinions are solely my own.</li>

            <li>It leaves a nice healthy shine to my hair.</li>
            <li>This is the probably th best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used for natural curly hair.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine, color treated, damaged hair so like many, I am always on the hunt for a good shampoo that will work with my hair and not against it.</li>
            <li>It lathers nicely for being sulfate free.</li>

            <li>I love how my hair looks, how shiny it is and how silky it feels when I use this shampoo!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Argan oil is one of the best oils to use in your hair, especially because it improves the texture of your hair follicles.</li>
            <li>received the product for free in an exchange of an honest review.rence.</li>
            <li>received the product for free in an exchange of an honest review.</li>
            <li>Plus the shampoo is OK.</li>
            <li>I am glad I found these products.  </li>
            <li>to get a nice smooth finish.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>Regardless this shampoo has been absolutely fantastic for me!</li>
            <li>every penny now my hair is amazing and smooth</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s most like gel shampoo more then liquid shampoo</li>
            <li>I love changing my shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>recommend these phenomenal products to all of those people who&#x27;ve given up on the idea of restoring damaged hair and also to those who want to prevent their hair from ever getting to the point of no-return.</li>
            <li>and it did that and more.</li>
            <li>This passed the hubband head sniffer test :-)</li>
            <li>I love the shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Feels better than when I go to the salon.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Love the smell but more importantly love what it did for my hair.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products to care for my color treated hair.</li>
            <li>I thought for sure I was going to have to cut my hair off.</li>
            <li>I also think this product has helped my hair to grow a lot longer because it&#x27;s so healthy.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I love that Argan Oil and Macadamia Oil are infused so those oils make this shampoo beneficial for healthy hair.</li>
            <li>also like the smell of the shampoo to me it has more of an Argan Oil smell.</li>
            <li>Amazing as well, this is different, I have fine blond hair with highlights and these products are AMAZING!!</li>
            <li>It is a nice shampoo that does not leave a build up, but for me, there was nothing special or miracle working about it.</li>
            <li>Something about the new scent just makes me happy</li>
            <li>The best shampoo I&#x27;ve used in a very long time.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s perfect for my dry</li>
            <li>Paired with the Conditioner, it makes my hair more manageable and feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this Shampoo because it is sulfate and paraben free.</li>
            <li>love the light scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li>Once I removed the shampoo, my hair had a nice fresh scent to it.</li>
            <li>So glad that I got to try this complimentary to review!</li>
            <li>Free and Paraben Free - Safe for Use with Brazilian Keratin or Color Treatments.</li>
            <li>However, I do love that the shampoo is sulfate free and paraben free.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sulfate free and paraben free, these are safe for all hair types including processed and color treated hair.</li>
            <li>cleans and make hair strong.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m just a coconut kind of woman and don&#x27;t care for flowery scents very much.  </li>
            <li>My hair was silky smooth, so soft, and smelt amazing!</li>
            <li>My hair is super fine, oily and fairly damaged and using the shampoo and conditioner together made my hair feel silky soft, look amazingly shiny and super clean without being stripped.</li>
            <li>shampoo has made a huge difference in my hair in just a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is sulfate free and paraben free, which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>my hair feels so smooth and shiny</li>
            <li>My hair feels fantastic after using it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Paraben free.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Sulfate free.</li>
            <li>It is also known that sulfates might cause cancers so that’s something to take into consideration.&lt;br /&gt;*Paraben free.</li>
            <li>But overall, I am extremely happy with the product results.</li>
            <li>amazing product my hair was very damaged</li>
            <li>Now when I run my fingers through my hair all I feel is smooth and silk, soft-to-the-touch</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this product to review on my blog.</li>
            <li>Not the most exciting do&#x27;</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shampoo, being sulfate free, doesn&#x27;t overfoam and strip your hair of</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m switching around with Dove Moisturizing Shampoo &amp; Conditioner &amp; Arvazallia Shampoo but with the Mask Conditioner or Suave&#x27;s Intense Smoothing Conditioner (which I use after coloring, it&#x27;s amazing).</li>
            <li>#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation, Licensed Cosmetologist as of 1996 (expired 2013</li>
            <li>I was given the opportunity to review Arvazallia Advanced Hair Repair Moisturizing Sulfate Free Shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hair is curly and often times quite frizzy, but this makes it feel smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>I was thinking of the Calgon Take Me Away commercial lol</li>
            <li>Plus for a shampoo that is sulfate free, it has a rich  lather.</li>
            <li>After using this shampoo, I see significant change in the texture of my hair.</li>
            <li>but i bought from original buyer.  </li>
            <li>So fresh smelling!</li>
            <li>So fresh smelling!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how much it&#x27;s doing for me, being sulfate free, but it doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m getting the best, most long-lasting, clean hair out of this.</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is also Sulfate free and therefore is much more gentle on your hair.</li>
            <li>I had the opportunity to try the Arvazallia line, and figured it would be worth it to see how it would work on my fine, yet damaged</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this brand since I haven&#x27;t heard much about it</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li>my full review on my blog-- Meandmyminime.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers</li>
            <li>Okay, that doesn&#x27;t really count as a review, huh?</li>
            <li>It helped restore my full hair hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, Need to rinse very well as it can leave hair coated and a greasy.</li>
            <li>I love this brand so much.  </li>
            <li>I received a full head of highlights from a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; stylist and my hair ended up fried and damaged.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells wonderful, a subtle fruity scent that had The Mister burying his face in my hear repeatedly.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this amazing product!</li>
            <li>After using it the first time you will notice a huge difference in your hair.</li>
            <li>When I applied the Arvazallia Hair Repair Shampoo to my hair the first thing I noticed is that the Arvazallia shampoo is sulfate free.</li>
            <li>, normal shampoo makes it look like i am bald more so than i already am and</li>
            <li>I love that this shampoo is not only paraben free but sulfate free as well.</li>
            <li>It does a really great job at getting a nice deep down clean, without stripping my hair.</li>
            <li>I also appreciated the follow-up message I received from the seller containing tips on how I can get the most from this shampoo and other available products to use in conjunction to achieve the best results for my dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also appreciated the follow-up message I received from the seller containing tips on how I can get the most from this shampoo and other available products to use in conjunction to achieve the best results for my dry hair.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, has so many beneficial ingredients, and leaves my fine hair feeling soft and strong, never weighed down by the argan oil.</li>
            <li>I did not experience those little pimply bumps that I get from some products, I was VERY pleased with this product line.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li>I used it the night it arrived &amp; pleasantly noticed my hair wasn&#x27;t bleeding color like with every other Shampoo &amp; Conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used, the water was completely clear &amp; I love the smell.</li>
            <li>I kicked my old shampoo aside and used this for a week straight to see what kind of results I would have.</li>
            <li>The bottles come shrink wrapped in plastic which I liked, however once I unscrewed the cap, the aluminum seal on both the shampoo and conditioner wasn&#x27;t properly sealed and some of the product had spilled out.</li>
            <li>The Arvazallia Advanced Hair Repair Sulfate Free Shampoo nourishes with both Argan Oil and Macadamia Oil, both of which help to promote natural growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;*got a fresh floral scent to it</li>
            <li>I received a complimentary bottle of this product from the seller to review on my blog.</li>
            <li>So far this product seems to be okay.  </li>
            <li>It has a bit if a stronger and somewhat masculine scent in my opinion, but I still love how it leaves my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclaimer: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free.</li>
            <li>After one use of Arvazallia shampoo my hair felt soft, moisturized and more manageable.</li>
            <li>My hair honestly feels so much healthier and soft after I use this.</li>
            <li>My nice hair is back!</li>
            <li>The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I received a complimentary product to facilitate this review.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is safe on color/chemically treated hair and wont strip the hair of its natural moisture.</li>
            <li>I have a tailbone length hair so keeping my hair as healthy and chemical free as possible is my first priority when it comes to that.</li>
            <li>The use of the shampoo and conditioner has elongated my hair allowing a more easy comb thru when wet.  </li>
            <li>I really thought that it was going to take years for my hair to stop breaking and look somewhat healthy, but with this Arvazallia Advanced Hair Care System it only took 4 days for my hair to improve drastically.</li>
            <li>Utilizes Highly Effective but Gentle Cleansing Agents that Deeply Cleanses without Drying, Fading, or Stripping Hair of Color or Moisture&lt;</li>
            <li>It is quite strong, so if you&#x27;re sensitive to scents, you may not appreciate this.</li>
            <li>afterwards!&lt;br /&gt;Arvazallia Advanced Hair Repair Moisturizing Shampoo and Repair Daily Conditioner are Members of the Arvazallia Advanced Hair Repair System.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is thick and really lathers up even though it doesn&#x27;t have sulfates or parabens which makes me love it even more!  </li>
            <li>A sulfate free shampoo is hard to come by and cones that are in most just leave a huge build up</li>
            <li>first of all, i should say the smell of all these  products are..</li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>First of all...</li>
            <li>Not even the first washing.  </li>
            <li>Firstly, the scent is just divine.</li>
            <li>After a week of use, I can confidently say that not only does my hair look and feel softer and silkier, but I had no issues with these products making my hair greasy or weighed-down!</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and smooth after use.</li>
            <li>not only does it look soft and smooth, it feels hydrated and healthy.</li>
            <li>I used to in place of my regular conditioner for over a week, and I have been SO in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s not expensive.  </li>
            <li>I initially purchased the conditioning cream and fell in love with how it worked so decided to try out the shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>This is my first day using the shampoo.</li>
            <li>is my first day using the shampoo.</li>
            <li>So far, my hair has stayed looking freshly dyed!</li>
            <li>then you really should because it’s the closest thing to natural chemical free shampoo you can get without having to make one yourself.&lt;br</li>
            <li>then you really should because it’s the closest thing to natural chemical free shampoo you can get without having to make one yourself.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most shampoos nowadays include a lot of chemicals that ruin and dry out your hair even more (even though they promise all kinds of miracles) so that’s definitely not a solution for it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was not required to give a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all).</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and full of volume which I struggle with.  </li>
            <li>I swear it actually stayed looking clean and fresh for longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>According to the &amp;#34;dramatic&amp;#34; differences in some of the reviews, I was hoping for really super soft, bouncy, manageable hair to come from this product.  </li>
            <li>I noticed my hair was being more frizzy &amp; dry.</li>
            <li>Made my relaxed hair very soft!!</li>
            <li>Bottles are huge, and will last you a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had to add numerous styling products like &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10 miracle leave-in spray to soften &amp; detangle, L&#x27;oreal smooth intense frizz</li>
            <li>taming serum to help calm it, &amp; even more Arvazallia Oil after my hair air dried to add moisture.</li>
            <li>/&gt;What&#x27;s different about this shampoo:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sulfate free.</li>
            <li>While I do not often use much product or heat tools in my hair, it still shows a bit of damage.</li>
            <li>I really wouldn&#x27;t even need conditioner with this, that is how conditioning the shampoo is.</li>
            <li>got this shampoo because I wanted something sulfate free for my recently color treated hair.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Advanced Hair Repair Moisturizing Shampoo, the Daily Hair Conditioner and the Hydrating Argan Oil Hair Mask and wanted to wait until I had used the products a couple times before commenting.  </li>
            <li>I reasonable priced product that works.</li>
            <li>I like especially that this is a sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li>decided to give Arvazallia a try because I have heard so much hype about argan oil for the hair.</li>
            <li>I do fallow this using the conditioner or the hair mask and the products really work well</li>
            <li>did receive this product for free, for testing and reviewing purposes ONLY!</li>
            <li>However, using this shampoo I now don&#x27;t have to worry nearly as much.</li>
            <li>This shampoo really helps to strengthen my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>By using this with the conditioner and mask, my hair was left feeling clean, super soft, manageable, and</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>did not feel my hair was weighed down, and I have very fine hair.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is a great detangler and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I have notices a significant different in the manageability of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I figured by now I would feel something new and exciting about the texture, but so far absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>The conditioner made my hair really soft and detangled; amazingly without weighing it down at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like I have new hair!</li>
            <li>I saw a difference immediately after using it and everytime I useit now, my hair feels softer, bouncier, more manageable, and less brittle.</li>
            <li>Left my hair soft, smooth, and shiny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first day was pretty rainy and I was out of mousse, so after washing I put my hair back in a headband.</li>
            <li>So if you have a sensitive sense of smell or do not heavy perfume scents then this might not be right for</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>BUT I can tell that my hair is shinier and has a little more bounce to it than it did before using so it must have helped somehow.</li>
            <li>While I probably haven&#x27;t used the system quite long enough to notice a huge difference, in the short term, I have noticed that my hair is much more smooth and less frizzy.</li>
            <li>It took a few weeks, but the more I use this product the healthier, softer and shinier my hair becomes.</li>
            <li>These products are specially formulated to work in combination to Restore, Strengthen, and Revitalize hair that is dry or that has been damaged or weakened by heat styling, chemical processing, or coloring.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>On top of that it is thin and dry making it challenging.</li>
            <li>This shampoo leaves my hair very soft and preserves the color better than any other sulfate free product I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li>I have extremely fine and thinning hair, so I tend to avoid anything that is &amp;#34;Deep Conditioning&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Moisturizing&amp;#34; in hair products, because I find that they can make my hair greasy or weighed down.</li>
            <li>Smells like a professional high end shampoo they would use at a hair salon.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell in the 4 washes that I&#x27;ve used it, that it is any different than the other Sulfate free shampoos that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>As is the case with red hair color, it tends to &amp;#34;bleed&amp;#34; for several washings after coloring, and will fade more readily than other colors.  </li>
            <li>This is ideal for dry, damaged, weak, and processed hair, which I definitely need.</li>
            <li>My overall results were positive.</li>
            <li>However, it has a very fresh, maybe slightly floral scent.</li>
            <li>When I was sent this haircare trio to review, all I could focus on was the hard to pronounce name :-)</li>
            <li>I will use the whole thing before actually giving up!!</li>
            <li>I found that this cleaned my hair very well, and left my hair feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li>I suffer from wild woman hair</li>
            <li>It also has Macadami Oil, and after using it several times, I find that it really works in maintaining the moisture in my hair.</li>
            <li>also recently re-colored my hair, and I really do think I&#x27;ve noticed the color staying in my hair longer.</li>
            <li>My hair is silky soft.</li>
            <li>It was incredibly soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very pleasantly surprised after shampoo/mask #1.</li>
            <li>In the instructions on all of the bottles this product is always mentioned, so it plays a big part in the hair repair system and i can really see why.</li>
            <li>I color my hair as well as use a straightener quite frequently, so I have a lot of factors against me.</li>
            <li>I use chemicals and heat tools on my hair regularly and using a shampoo such as this is like a breath of fresh air to my abused hair.</li>
            <li>This product is specially made to repair, restore and strengthen hair that has been previously damaged.</li>
            <li>and I like to straighten my hair by using a large roller brush with heat and sometimes use a flat iron.</li>
            <li>I had been ill for a couple of years leaving my beautiful curly hair dry, frizzy and</li>
            <li>Now I have promptly gone back to normal department store shampoos!</li>
            <li>I do have to heat style my hair ever so often which damages it and makes my hair and the ends pretty dry and damp like</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;you will find some other product are cheap please do not compare this one with others because it&#x27;s different</li>
            <li>Because my hair is so dry, I cannot just use shampoo alone, so I also paired this with the Arvazallia Advanced Hair Repair Daily Hair Conditioner as well as the Hydrating Argan Oil Hair Mask and Deep Conditioner by Arvazallia.</li>
            <li>At first I applied 3 drops to towel dried hair, but found that was a bit much.  </li>
            <li>my conclusion for my hair is that the shampoo cleans and lathers slightly and works super for me.</li>
            <li>My hair quit falling out in large amounts, the breaking stopped, and that dry feeling is gone.</li>
            <li>I was recently given the opportunity to try a new hair care system.</li>
            <li>It gently cleans the hair and does not leave it feeling dry or straw-like.</li>
            <li>have extremely fine, dull, damaged and brittle hair,</li>
            <li>I have used it about 5 times already and it feels like I have barely made a dent in it.</li>
            <li>My hair instantly felt soft.</li>
            <li>hair felt extremely soft after using the shampoo along with Arvazallia Daily Hair Conditioner.</li>
            <li>Then after I shampooed the third time using the conditioner, my hair was soft, flexible, and not weighed down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a 42 year old, Caucasian woman who has extremely dry, natural curly hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&amp;#34;I purchased this based on the great reviews, but was tremendously disappointed.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know the &amp;#34;why&amp;#34; reasoning behind the problem with sulfates in shampoo, but I&#x27;ve heard enough to realize that they are most likely something to avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair was soft, flexible, and definitely NOT heavy nor weighed down.</li>
            <li>Not only does the texture improve but that dry, unmanageable hair becomes silky, soft and luminous.</li>

            <li> my own based on my experience with the product.</li>
            <li> After using them, all I could focus on was petting my own head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The views in this statement are strictly my own and I am not affiliated with any of these companies.&amp;#34;</li>

            <li> Regardless this shampoo has been absolutely fantastic for me!</li>
            <li> every penny now my hair is amazing and smooth</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s most like gel shampoo more then liquid shampoo</li>
            <li> I love changing my shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> recommend these phenomenal products to all of those people who&#x27;ve given up on the idea of restoring damaged hair and also to those who want to prevent their hair from ever getting to the point of no-return.</li>
            <li> and it did that and more.</li>
            <li> This passed the hubband head sniffer test :-)</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Feels better than when I go to the salon.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Love the smell but more importantly love what it did for my hair.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products to care for my color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I thought for sure I was going to have to cut my hair off.</li>
            <li> I also think this product has helped my hair to grow a lot longer because it&#x27;s so healthy.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I love that Argan Oil and Macadamia Oil are infused so those oils make this shampoo beneficial for healthy hair.</li>
            <li> also like the smell of the shampoo to me it has more of an Argan Oil smell.</li>
            <li> Amazing as well, this is different, I have fine blond hair with highlights and these products are AMAZING!!</li>
            <li> It is a nice shampoo that does not leave a build up, but for me, there was nothing special or miracle working about it.</li>
            <li> Something about the new scent just makes me happy</li>
            <li> The best shampoo I&#x27;ve used in a very long time.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s perfect for my dry</li>
            <li> Paired with the Conditioner, it makes my hair more manageable and feeling silky smooth.</li>

            <li> However, I do love that the shampoo is sulfate free and paraben free.</li>

            <li> , I&#x27;m just a coconut kind of woman and don&#x27;t care for flowery scents very much.  </li>
            <li> My hair was silky smooth, so soft, and smelt amazing!</li>
            <li> My hair is super fine, oily and fairly damaged and using the shampoo and conditioner together made my hair feel silky soft, look amazingly shiny and super clean without being stripped.</li>
            <li> shampoo has made a huge difference in my hair in just a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is sulfate free and paraben free, which is a huge plus.</li>

            <li> My hair feels fantastic after using it.</li>

            <li> /&gt;*Sulfate free.</li>
            <li> It is also known that sulfates might cause cancers so that’s something to take into consideration.&lt;br /&gt;*Paraben free.</li>
            <li> But overall, I am extremely happy with the product results.</li>
            <li> amazing product my hair was very damaged</li>
            <li> Now when I run my fingers through my hair all I feel is smooth and silk, soft-to-the-touch</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product to review on my blog.</li>
            <li> Not the most exciting do&#x27;</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shampoo, being sulfate free, doesn&#x27;t overfoam and strip your hair of</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m switching around with Dove Moisturizing Shampoo &amp; Conditioner &amp; Arvazallia Shampoo but with the Mask Conditioner or Suave&#x27;s Intense Smoothing Conditioner (which I use after coloring, it&#x27;s amazing).</li>
            <li> #34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation, Licensed Cosmetologist as of 1996 (expired 2013</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to review Arvazallia Advanced Hair Repair Moisturizing Sulfate Free Shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair is curly and often times quite frizzy, but this makes it feel smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> I was thinking of the Calgon Take Me Away commercial lol</li>
            <li> Plus for a shampoo that is sulfate free, it has a rich  lather.</li>
            <li> After using this shampoo, I see significant change in the texture of my hair.</li>
            <li> but i bought from original buyer.  </li>
            <li> So fresh smelling!</li>
            <li> So fresh smelling!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much it&#x27;s doing for me, being sulfate free, but it doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m getting the best, most long-lasting, clean hair out of this.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is also Sulfate free and therefore is much more gentle on your hair.</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to try the Arvazallia line, and figured it would be worth it to see how it would work on my fine, yet damaged</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this brand since I haven&#x27;t heard much about it</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li> my full review on my blog-- Meandmyminime.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers</li>
            <li> Okay, that doesn&#x27;t really count as a review, huh?</li>
            <li> It helped restore my full hair hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, Need to rinse very well as it can leave hair coated and a greasy.</li>
            <li> I love this brand so much.  </li>
            <li> I received a full head of highlights from a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; stylist and my hair ended up fried and damaged.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells wonderful, a subtle fruity scent that had The Mister burying his face in my hear repeatedly.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this amazing product!</li>
            <li> After using it the first time you will notice a huge difference in your hair.</li>
            <li> When I applied the Arvazallia Hair Repair Shampoo to my hair the first thing I noticed is that the Arvazallia shampoo is sulfate free.</li>
            <li> , normal shampoo makes it look like i am bald more so than i already am and</li>
            <li> I love that this shampoo is not only paraben free but sulfate free as well.</li>
            <li> It does a really great job at getting a nice deep down clean, without stripping my hair.</li>
            <li> I also appreciated the follow-up message I received from the seller containing tips on how I can get the most from this shampoo and other available products to use in conjunction to achieve the best results for my dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also appreciated the follow-up message I received from the seller containing tips on how I can get the most from this shampoo and other available products to use in conjunction to achieve the best results for my dry hair.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing, has so many beneficial ingredients, and leaves my fine hair feeling soft and strong, never weighed down by the argan oil.</li>
            <li> I did not experience those little pimply bumps that I get from some products, I was VERY pleased with this product line.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> I used it the night it arrived &amp; pleasantly noticed my hair wasn&#x27;t bleeding color like with every other Shampoo &amp; Conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used, the water was completely clear &amp; I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I kicked my old shampoo aside and used this for a week straight to see what kind of results I would have.</li>
            <li> The bottles come shrink wrapped in plastic which I liked, however once I unscrewed the cap, the aluminum seal on both the shampoo and conditioner wasn&#x27;t properly sealed and some of the product had spilled out.</li>
            <li> The Arvazallia Advanced Hair Repair Sulfate Free Shampoo nourishes with both Argan Oil and Macadamia Oil, both of which help to promote natural growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;*got a fresh floral scent to it</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary bottle of this product from the seller to review on my blog.</li>
            <li> So far this product seems to be okay.  </li>
            <li> It has a bit if a stronger and somewhat masculine scent in my opinion, but I still love how it leaves my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclaimer: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free.</li>
            <li> After one use of Arvazallia shampoo my hair felt soft, moisturized and more manageable.</li>
            <li> My hair honestly feels so much healthier and soft after I use this.</li>
            <li> My nice hair is back!</li>
            <li> The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I received a complimentary product to facilitate this review.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is safe on color/chemically treated hair and wont strip the hair of its natural moisture.</li>
            <li> I have a tailbone length hair so keeping my hair as healthy and chemical free as possible is my first priority when it comes to that.</li>
            <li> The use of the shampoo and conditioner has elongated my hair allowing a more easy comb thru when wet.  </li>
            <li> I really thought that it was going to take years for my hair to stop breaking and look somewhat healthy, but with this Arvazallia Advanced Hair Care System it only took 4 days for my hair to improve drastically.</li>
            <li> Utilizes Highly Effective but Gentle Cleansing Agents that Deeply Cleanses without Drying, Fading, or Stripping Hair of Color or Moisture&lt;</li>
            <li> It is quite strong, so if you&#x27;re sensitive to scents, you may not appreciate this.</li>
            <li> afterwards!&lt;br /&gt;Arvazallia Advanced Hair Repair Moisturizing Shampoo and Repair Daily Conditioner are Members of the Arvazallia Advanced Hair Repair System.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is thick and really lathers up even though it doesn&#x27;t have sulfates or parabens which makes me love it even more!  </li>
            <li> A sulfate free shampoo is hard to come by and cones that are in most just leave a huge build up</li>
            <li> first of all, i should say the smell of all these  products are..</li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li> First of all...</li>
            <li> Not even the first washing.  </li>
            <li> Firstly, the scent is just divine.</li>
            <li> After a week of use, I can confidently say that not only does my hair look and feel softer and silkier, but I had no issues with these products making my hair greasy or weighed-down!</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and smooth after use.</li>
            <li> not only does it look soft and smooth, it feels hydrated and healthy.</li>
            <li> I used to in place of my regular conditioner for over a week, and I have been SO in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s not expensive.  </li>
            <li> I initially purchased the conditioning cream and fell in love with how it worked so decided to try out the shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> This is my first day using the shampoo.</li>
            <li> is my first day using the shampoo.</li>
            <li> So far, my hair has stayed looking freshly dyed!</li>
            <li> then you really should because it’s the closest thing to natural chemical free shampoo you can get without having to make one yourself.&lt;br</li>
            <li> then you really should because it’s the closest thing to natural chemical free shampoo you can get without having to make one yourself.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most shampoos nowadays include a lot of chemicals that ruin and dry out your hair even more (even though they promise all kinds of miracles) so that’s definitely not a solution for it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was not required to give a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all).</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and full of volume which I struggle with.  </li>
            <li> I swear it actually stayed looking clean and fresh for longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> According to the &amp;#34;dramatic&amp;#34; differences in some of the reviews, I was hoping for really super soft, bouncy, manageable hair to come from this product.  </li>
            <li> I noticed my hair was being more frizzy &amp; dry.</li>
            <li> Made my relaxed hair very soft!!</li>
            <li> Bottles are huge, and will last you a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to add numerous styling products like &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10 miracle leave-in spray to soften &amp; detangle, L&#x27;oreal smooth intense frizz</li>
            <li> taming serum to help calm it, &amp; even more Arvazallia Oil after my hair air dried to add moisture.</li>
            <li> /&gt;What&#x27;s different about this shampoo:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sulfate free.</li>
            <li> While I do not often use much product or heat tools in my hair, it still shows a bit of damage.</li>
            <li> I really wouldn&#x27;t even need conditioner with this, that is how conditioning the shampoo is.</li>
            <li> got this shampoo because I wanted something sulfate free for my recently color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Advanced Hair Repair Moisturizing Shampoo, the Daily Hair Conditioner and the Hydrating Argan Oil Hair Mask and wanted to wait until I had used the products a couple times before commenting.  </li>
            <li> I reasonable priced product that works.</li>
            <li> I like especially that this is a sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li> decided to give Arvazallia a try because I have heard so much hype about argan oil for the hair.</li>
            <li> I do fallow this using the conditioner or the hair mask and the products really work well</li>
            <li> did receive this product for free, for testing and reviewing purposes ONLY!</li>
            <li> However, using this shampoo I now don&#x27;t have to worry nearly as much.</li>
            <li> This shampoo really helps to strengthen my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> By using this with the conditioner and mask, my hair was left feeling clean, super soft, manageable, and</li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> did not feel my hair was weighed down, and I have very fine hair.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is a great detangler and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have notices a significant different in the manageability of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I figured by now I would feel something new and exciting about the texture, but so far absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> The conditioner made my hair really soft and detangled; amazingly without weighing it down at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like I have new hair!</li>
            <li> I saw a difference immediately after using it and everytime I useit now, my hair feels softer, bouncier, more manageable, and less brittle.</li>
            <li> Left my hair soft, smooth, and shiny.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first day was pretty rainy and I was out of mousse, so after washing I put my hair back in a headband.</li>
            <li> So if you have a sensitive sense of smell or do not heavy perfume scents then this might not be right for</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> BUT I can tell that my hair is shinier and has a little more bounce to it than it did before using so it must have helped somehow.</li>
            <li> While I probably haven&#x27;t used the system quite long enough to notice a huge difference, in the short term, I have noticed that my hair is much more smooth and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> It took a few weeks, but the more I use this product the healthier, softer and shinier my hair becomes.</li>
            <li> These products are specially formulated to work in combination to Restore, Strengthen, and Revitalize hair that is dry or that has been damaged or weakened by heat styling, chemical processing, or coloring.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> On top of that it is thin and dry making it challenging.</li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves my hair very soft and preserves the color better than any other sulfate free product I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> I have extremely fine and thinning hair, so I tend to avoid anything that is &amp;#34;Deep Conditioning&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Moisturizing&amp;#34; in hair products, because I find that they can make my hair greasy or weighed down.</li>
            <li> Smells like a professional high end shampoo they would use at a hair salon.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell in the 4 washes that I&#x27;ve used it, that it is any different than the other Sulfate free shampoos that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> As is the case with red hair color, it tends to &amp;#34;bleed&amp;#34; for several washings after coloring, and will fade more readily than other colors.  </li>
            <li> This is ideal for dry, damaged, weak, and processed hair, which I definitely need.</li>
            <li> My overall results were positive.</li>
            <li> However, it has a very fresh, maybe slightly floral scent.</li>
            <li> When I was sent this haircare trio to review, all I could focus on was the hard to pronounce name :-)</li>
            <li> I will use the whole thing before actually giving up!!</li>
            <li> I found that this cleaned my hair very well, and left my hair feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> I suffer from wild woman hair</li>
            <li> It also has Macadami Oil, and after using it several times, I find that it really works in maintaining the moisture in my hair.</li>
            <li> also recently re-colored my hair, and I really do think I&#x27;ve noticed the color staying in my hair longer.</li>
            <li> My hair is silky soft.</li>
            <li> It was incredibly soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very pleasantly surprised after shampoo/mask #1.</li>
            <li> In the instructions on all of the bottles this product is always mentioned, so it plays a big part in the hair repair system and i can really see why.</li>
            <li> I color my hair as well as use a straightener quite frequently, so I have a lot of factors against me.</li>
            <li> I use chemicals and heat tools on my hair regularly and using a shampoo such as this is like a breath of fresh air to my abused hair.</li>
            <li> This product is specially made to repair, restore and strengthen hair that has been previously damaged.</li>
            <li> and I like to straighten my hair by using a large roller brush with heat and sometimes use a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I had been ill for a couple of years leaving my beautiful curly hair dry, frizzy and</li>
            <li> Now I have promptly gone back to normal department store shampoos!</li>
            <li> I do have to heat style my hair ever so often which damages it and makes my hair and the ends pretty dry and damp like</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;you will find some other product are cheap please do not compare this one with others because it&#x27;s different</li>
            <li> Because my hair is so dry, I cannot just use shampoo alone, so I also paired this with the Arvazallia Advanced Hair Repair Daily Hair Conditioner as well as the Hydrating Argan Oil Hair Mask and Deep Conditioner by Arvazallia.</li>
            <li> At first I applied 3 drops to towel dried hair, but found that was a bit much.  </li>
            <li> my conclusion for my hair is that the shampoo cleans and lathers slightly and works super for me.</li>
            <li> My hair quit falling out in large amounts, the breaking stopped, and that dry feeling is gone.</li>
            <li> I was recently given the opportunity to try a new hair care system.</li>
            <li> It gently cleans the hair and does not leave it feeling dry or straw-like.</li>
            <li> have extremely fine, dull, damaged and brittle hair,</li>
            <li> I have used it about 5 times already and it feels like I have barely made a dent in it.</li>
            <li> My hair instantly felt soft.</li>
            <li> hair felt extremely soft after using the shampoo along with Arvazallia Daily Hair Conditioner.</li>
            <li> Then after I shampooed the third time using the conditioner, my hair was soft, flexible, and not weighed down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a 42 year old, Caucasian woman who has extremely dry, natural curly hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&amp;#34;I purchased this based on the great reviews, but was tremendously disappointed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know the &amp;#34;why&amp;#34; reasoning behind the problem with sulfates in shampoo, but I&#x27;ve heard enough to realize that they are most likely something to avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair was soft, flexible, and definitely NOT heavy nor weighed down.</li>
            <li> Not only does the texture improve but that dry, unmanageable hair becomes silky, soft and luminous.</li>
            <li> and once it is washed out, and my hair is dry, there is barely any smell to it at all.  </li>
            <li> I also put the mask in my hair, and then put a shower cap over it while I vacuum, and run around doing household chores.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other shampoos, whis shampoo (and I&#x27;ll also add their rinse) leaves your hair manageable, soft, plus it adds shine.</li>
            <li> my hair was still very soft and not weighed down.</li>
            <li> or they strip my hair completely dry to where it looks like wheat, this i was shocked to say doesnt it actually feels so good on my hair and scalp that my psoriasis doesnt act up and make me scratch my brains out.</li>
            <li> When using it you only need a quarter size amount, so the product will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> I am still figuring out how much conditioner my hair needs, since it sometimes makes my hair greasy (if conditioner is a bit excessively used).</li>
            <li> This bottle is bound to last me a long time.</li>
            <li> i will not renew it due to pricing on the license and renewal classes, major was skincare, haircare and makeup).</li>
            <li> I can only wash it every 3 - 4 days because it is so dry.  </li>
            <li> If your treated hair is dry and brittle, this shampoo will be the last one you&#x27;ll ever try and need to purchase.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product for everyone, especially for curly hair that tends to be dry.</li>
            <li> The shampoo left my hair dry and damaged.</li>
            <li> Usually such deep conditioners make my hair limp and lifeless, but this actually had the opposite effect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hot mess, and a lot of shampoos and conditioners just leave my hair feeling heavy with product and it gets greasy before the day is over.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural, scalp protecting oils but still makes it crazy clean.</li>
            <li> This is going to sound so weird, but I swear it&#x27;s true.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have thick color treated hair and very picky about what products I use.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly, and very often frizzy hair</li>
            <li> My hair has always been thick and straight.</li>
            <li> It was thick and didn&#x27;t lather as much.</li>
            <li> It was thick and didn&#x27;t lather as much.</li>
            <li> Using only a quarter size does not lather as well as other shampoos that I have tried.</li>
            <li> So I expect it to last for quite a while, unlike other shampoos.</li>
            <li> My hair is very long and tends to get tugged around on by kids, pets and who knows what else.</li>
            <li> and my hair ends aren’t as dry as they were so</li>
            <li> I suffer from frizzy, dry hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Caucasian with thick, coarse, frizz prone, middle back length, color treated hair that I&#x27;m trying to grow long &amp; make healthier.</li>
            <li> With summer coming, I usually do less with my hair and just pull it back or let it air dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to grow it out long so the only thing harsh</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I also have wavy hair that can get dry and brittle, so I&#x27;m always searching for a product line that can smooth and moisturize my hair without making it look like a greasy mess.</li>
            <li> This winter was rough on my hair.</li>
            <li> So I am really rough on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very frizzy, thin  hair.</li>
            <li> My ends were less dry after using the Mask.  </li>
            <li> In product, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> And a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have used it for about a week and there is not much difference than before I started!</li>
            <li> reason why this is getting 4 stars is due to a issue with how the bottles are sealed.</li>
            <li> It is used in a lot of shampoos and other household cleaning products.</li>
            <li> Macadamia oil on the other hand helps to prevent against hair breakage by penetrating the scalp and hair follicles to improve hair strength and</li>
            <li> In addition, i have below shoulder length hair and only need a small amount of this product.  </li>
            <li> I combine the conditioner and mask every other day...</li>
            <li> Second, it seems as though I don&#x27;t have to work my hair so hard, with the dryer, etc.</li>
            <li> It is so hard to find products that actually work.  </li>
            <li> Then I tried applying just two drops to partially heat dried hair, just the ends, before using the roller brush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Recently I was asked to give a product that works to repair your hair and remove the layers of product buildup that weigh down and case breakage.</li>
            <li> The less chemicals the better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its smoother and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed less breakage when I shampoo and condition with these products.</li>
            <li> and when it was a little damp it still gave my hair bounce and shine and did not weigh down my waves.</li>
            <li> It might take a little getting used to it because it doesn’t bubble up like typical shampoos do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these bottles in my shower with the lids on tightly, so</li>
            <li> My hair was feeling course and the ends were being damaged from a previous shampoo and conditioner that really dried out my hair and highlighting.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using this shampoo does take a little while to see the results.</li>
            <li> It was just a hassle cleaning up the bottles and wasted some product.</li>
            <li> It has a heavy perfumey smell to it that doesn&#x27;t bother me, however, my mother was offended by it.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t colored my hair in a few years</li>
            <li> I used it a few times a week to soften my fried hair.</li>
            <li> toweled dried it</li>
            <li> If you didn’t know then sulfates is what makes the shampoo turn into a thick lather in the shower and is also used in other household cleaning products.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing my hair a little longer than my usual chin length bob of some sort</li>
            <li> So, my hair is curly, dry, thin...</li>
            <li> My only very slight issue with this is that it is a bit difficult to get the product out.</li>
            <li> Texture and volume without weighing it down at all, I will NEVER be without this stuff!!</li>
            <li> They were like these small gnat type things.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m often skeptical when shampoos and such claim to work on all hair textures, but I believe it now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll continue using the Shampoo &amp; Conditioner.</li>
            <li> I posted a pic of my hair from this past weekend.</li>
            <li> The bottle is quite tall and the product is thick enough to where it is a bit difficult to &#x27;shake&#x27; to the opening.</li>
            <li> My hair will probably always be curly.. and even thin, but the dryness is definitely less...  </li>
            <li> It took at least a week (4-6 uses) before I noticed my hair was not as tangled or frizzy after washing, even if I didn&#x27;t have time to condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sulfate</li>
            <li> The shampoo has a thick consistency, and it almost looks like a gel.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> This does not look like the hair of someone who&#x27;s been lying in bed like a dirty mop for half a month!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is so thin that you can see almost through it</li>
            <li> and this doesnt make it worse</li>
            <li> The shampoo came with broken seal and packed badly.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed &amp; confused as of why my hair started looking worse.</li>
            <li> am obsessed with how these products smell!  </li>
            <li> Nothing bad to say with this product.</li>
            <li> I has a floral smell which isn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> The layers around my face were burned so bad they were crispy and singed.</li>
            <li> It was very inconvenient.</li>
            <li> That means my hair looks like crap on rainy days.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Us this along with the conditioner. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> first of all, i should say the smell of all these  products are..just amazing...i have oily hair..this product works on my hair very good, this work on all hair types..i dilute shampoo with water and wash my hair..after that i apply conditioner and wait for 5 mins then rinse with water..my hair feels so smooth and shiny</li>
            <li> I cannot say it is a miracle for my hair! I have used it for about a week and there is not much difference than before I started! I figured by now I would feel something new and exciting about the texture, but so far absolutely nothing. I will use the whole thing before actually giving up!!</li>
            <li> Smells really good, Great texture, and lathers really nice. Leaves your hair feeling clean. Bottles are huge, and will last you a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample Provided.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine, color treated, damaged hair so like many, I am always on the hunt for a good shampoo that will work with my hair and not against it. Thankfully this one has seemed to be friends with my hair and is helping it become tame!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am the type of person that cannot stand unwashed hair, and therefore I have to wash my hair daily. I kicked my old shampoo aside and used this for a week straight to see what kind of results I would have. I found that this cleaned my hair very well, and left my hair feeling refreshed. Because my hair is so dry, I cannot just use shampoo alone, so I also paired this with the Arvazallia Advanced Hair Repair Daily Hair Conditioner as well as the Hydrating Argan Oil Hair Mask and Deep Conditioner by Arvazallia. By using this with the conditioner and mask, my hair was left feeling clean, super soft, manageable, and sleek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason why this is getting 4 stars is due to a issue with how the bottles are sealed. The bottles come shrink wrapped in plastic which I liked, however once I unscrewed the cap, the aluminum seal on both the shampoo and conditioner wasn&#x27;t properly sealed and some of the product had spilled out. If the bottles weren&#x27;t shrink wrapped, I wouldn&#x27;t have used them. But since they were, I figured they were alright. It was just a hassle cleaning up the bottles and wasted some product. Hopefully this was just a freak thing that happened with my bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> LOVE this shampoo!! My hair feels fantastic after using it. It lathers nicely for being sulfate free. This bottle is bound to last me a long time. I have used it about 5 times already and it feels like I have barely made a dent in it. Paired with the Conditioner, it makes my hair more manageable and feeling silky smooth. *sample provided for review*</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this brand since I haven&#x27;t heard much about it so I was a bit nervous to try it. When I applied the Arvazallia Hair Repair Shampoo to my hair the first thing I noticed is that the Arvazallia shampoo is sulfate free. Plus for a shampoo that is sulfate free, it has a rich  lather. The shampoo has a thick consistency, and it almost looks like a gel. When I applied the Arvazallia Shampoo I immediately felt it moisturizing my hair.  My hair instantly felt soft. Once I removed the shampoo, my hair had a nice fresh scent to it. I like it and it&#x27;s perfect for my dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: Sent for review purposes. However, the opinions expressed are 100% my own based on my experience with the product.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shampoo I have ever used. My hair was feeling course and the ends were being damaged from a previous shampoo and conditioner that really dried out my hair and highlighting. Used this shampoo and the matching conditioner and it repaired it all. My hair was silky smooth, so soft, and smelt amazing! I am telling all my friends and family about it.I am purchasing it a second time. Definitely a repeat customer!</li>
            <li> Is your hair breaking and frizzy? With summer coming, I usually do less with my hair and just pull it back or let it air dry. This winter was rough on my hair. I suffer from wild woman hair most mornings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I was asked to give a product that works to repair your hair and remove the layers of product buildup that weigh down and case breakage. The Arvazallia Advanced Hair Repair Sulfate Free Shampoo nourishes with both Argan Oil and Macadamia Oil, both of which help to promote natural growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this shampoo does take a little while to see the results. It took at least a week (4-6 uses) before I noticed my hair was not as tangled or frizzy after washing, even if I didn&#x27;t have time to condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sulfate Free and Paraben Free - Safe for Use with Brazilian Keratin or Color Treatments. Utilizes Highly Effective but Gentle Cleansing Agents that Deeply Cleanses without Drying, Fading, or Stripping Hair of Color or Moisture&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s different about this shampoo:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sulfate free. Sulfates are what makes the shampoo lather up in the shower. It is used in a lot of shampoos and other household cleaning products. Sulfates are what causes your hair to be frizzy, especially in curly hair. It pulls the color from treated hair too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paraben free. Parabens contain agents called xenoestrogens. These agents have been reported to mimic estrogen in the body and has been linked to several types of cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Includes Argan and Macadamia oil. Both Argan and Macadamia oils are known for being wonder products on your hair and skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo has made a huge difference in my hair in just a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
            <li> Both the shampoo and the conditioner smell amazing but if you want a lot of lather you must use a lot of this shampoo. Using only a quarter size does not lather as well as other shampoos that I have tried. However, I do love that the shampoo is sulfate free and paraben free. The less chemicals the better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I can not tell if these products do improve the condition of your hair or not BUT I can tell that my hair is shinier and has a little more bounce to it than it did before using so it must have helped somehow.</li>
            <li> Nothing bad to say with this product.</li>
            <li> Love it.  cleans and make hair strong.  It smells good.  LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Shampoo because it is sulfate and paraben free. It also has Macadami Oil, and after using it several times, I find that it really works in maintaining the moisture in my hair. I use chemicals and heat tools on my hair regularly and using a shampoo such as this is like a breath of fresh air to my abused hair. I love how my hair looks, how shiny it is and how silky it feels when I use this shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I&#x27;m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user&#x27;s standpoint.</li>
            <li> I have a tailbone length hair so keeping my hair as healthy and chemical free as possible is my first priority when it comes to that. I do have to heat style my hair ever so often which damages it and makes my hair and the ends pretty dry and damp like so that’s why I need something that actually helps to nurse my hair back to health. Most shampoos nowadays include a lot of chemicals that ruin and dry out your hair even more (even though they promise all kinds of miracles) so that’s definitely not a solution for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is great about the Arvazallia Repair Moisturizing shampoo:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Sulfate free. If you didn’t know then sulfates is what makes the shampoo turn into a thick lather in the shower and is also used in other household cleaning products. This is what actually causes frizziness especially in curly hair and damages hair that is color treated and makes it fade off quicker. It might take a little getting used to it because it doesn’t bubble up like typical shampoos do. It is also known that sulfates might cause cancers so that’s something to take into consideration.&lt;br /&gt;*Paraben free. It has been found that parabens contain agents called xenoestrogens which are what mimic estrogen in the body and what has been linked to breast cancer and reproductive issues.&lt;br /&gt;*Includes Argan and Macadamia oil. Argan oil is one of the best oils to use in your hair, especially because it improves the texture of your hair follicles. Macadamia oil on the other hand helps to prevent against hair breakage by penetrating the scalp and hair follicles to improve hair strength and elasticity.&lt;br /&gt;*got a fresh floral scent to it&lt;br /&gt;*is for all hair types&lt;br /&gt;*helps to repair the heat damage and fully hydrate your hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair felt extremely soft after using the shampoo along with Arvazallia Daily Hair Conditioner. The floral scent is still there even the day after and my hair ends aren’t as dry as they were so I can definitely see a difference. If you haven’t tried Arvazallia Repair Moisturizing shampoo yet along with Daily Hair Conditioner then you really should because it’s the closest thing to natural chemical free shampoo you can get without having to make one yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product for free in an exchange of an honest review.rence.

            <li> I suffer from frizzy, dry hair. After using this shampoo, I see significant change in the texture of my hair. I also use the deep conditioner product, and it has definitely improved my hair. Its smoother and less frizzy. I am still figuring out how much conditioner my hair needs, since it sometimes makes my hair greasy (if conditioner is a bit excessively used). But overall, I am extremely happy with the product results.</li>
            <li> The shampoo came with broken seal and packed badly. It was very inconvenient. Plus the shampoo is OK. Also, its bottle reads made in China but i bought from original buyer.  I will not buy it again and will not recommend it at all</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary bottle of this product from the seller to review on my blog. This product has a great smell to it. It gently cleans the hair and does not leave it feeling dry or straw-like. While I do like the smell of it, some may not. It has a heavy perfumey smell to it that doesn&#x27;t bother me, however, my mother was offended by it. So if you have a sensitive sense of smell or do not heavy perfume scents then this might not be right for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It performs how a SLS-free shampoo should. It just isn&#x27;t one of the best I&#x27;ve tried that my kinky curly hair loves.</li>
            <li> I color my hair, medium auburn,  about every 6 to 8 weeks.  As is the case with red hair color, it tends to &amp;#34;bleed&amp;#34; for several washings after coloring, and will fade more readily than other colors.  My hair is also curly/wavy and I like to straighten my hair by using a large roller brush with heat and sometimes use a flat iron. So I am really rough on my hair.  I needed a product that not only would help retain the color and not wash it out, but also repair and protect my hair.  I am glad I found these products.  I just started using the shampoo, Hair Mask and Oil Leave in treatment, and I can already tell the difference in my hair.  First of all...my color did not &amp;#34;bleed&amp;#34; after coloring.  Not even the first washing.  Second, it seems as though I don&#x27;t have to work my hair so hard, with the dryer, etc. to get a nice smooth finish.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I did learn, with the Oil Leave In product, a little goes a long way.  Experiment with it, see which way will suit your needs.  At first I applied 3 drops to towel dried hair, but found that was a bit much.  Then I tried applying just two drops to partially heat dried hair, just the ends, before using the roller brush.  That seems to work best for me.  It leaves a nice healthy shine to my hair.</li>
            <li> This product is specially made to repair, restore and strengthen hair that has been previously damaged. It also helps lock in moisture and gives your hair a nice shine! While I do not often use much product or heat tools in my hair, it still shows a bit of damage. My hair is very long and tends to get tugged around on by kids, pets and who knows what else. While I probably haven&#x27;t used the system quite long enough to notice a huge difference, in the short term, I have noticed that my hair is much more smooth and less frizzy. The shampoo is also Sulfate free and therefore is much more gentle on your hair. While not a make or break factor, the scent is also AMAZING! It is quite strong, so if you&#x27;re sensitive to scents, you may not appreciate this. However, it has a very fresh, maybe slightly floral scent. My only very slight issue with this is that it is a bit difficult to get the product out. The bottle is quite tall and the product is thick enough to where it is a bit difficult to &#x27;shake&#x27; to the opening. But then again....maybe I&#x27;m just picky! So glad that I got to try this complimentary to review! (:</li>
            <li> I have extremely fine and thinning hair, so I tend to avoid anything that is &amp;#34;Deep Conditioning&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Moisturizing&amp;#34; in hair products, because I find that they can make my hair greasy or weighed down. Unfortunately, I also have wavy hair that can get dry and brittle, so I&#x27;m always searching for a product line that can smooth and moisturize my hair without making it look like a greasy mess. I had the opportunity to try the Arvazallia line, and figured it would be worth it to see how it would work on my fine, yet damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used both the shampoo and conditioner daily for a week before deciding my final thoughts. Firstly, the scent is just divine. I had 4 people ask me what perfume I was wearing only to realize it was my hair they were referring to! If you don&#x27;t like strongly scented hair products, these might not be up your alley, however I love when my hair smells amazing! After a week of use, I can confidently say that not only does my hair look and feel softer and silkier, but I had no issues with these products making my hair greasy or weighed-down! Halleluiah!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also recently re-colored my hair, and I really do think I&#x27;ve noticed the color staying in my hair longer. For some reason, almost as soon as I dye my hair, it begins to wash out of the root-area. So far, my hair has stayed looking freshly dyed! That also could have to do with the fact that I don&#x27;t always use sulfate-free products, though. Regardless this shampoo has been absolutely fantastic for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much it&#x27;s doing for me, being sulfate free, but it doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m getting the best, most long-lasting, clean hair out of this.</li>
            <li> amazing product my hair was very damaged&lt;br /&gt;worth every penny now my hair is amazing and smooth&lt;br /&gt;you will find some other product are cheap please do not compare this one with others because it&#x27;s different&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s most like gel shampoo more then liquid shampoo&lt;br /&gt;but have very nice smell and treat your hair well</li>
            <li> So far this product seems to be okay.  I can&#x27;t really tell in the 4 washes that I&#x27;ve used it, that it is any different than the other Sulfate free shampoos that I have tried.  I has a floral smell which isn&#x27;t bad, I&#x27;m just a coconut kind of woman and don&#x27;t care for flowery scents very much.  It isn&#x27;t overpowering though and once it is washed out, and my hair is dry, there is barely any smell to it at all.  I am a 42 year old, Caucasian woman who has extremely dry, natural curly hair.  I can only wash it every 3 - 4 days because it is so dry.  According to the &amp;#34;dramatic&amp;#34; differences in some of the reviews, I was hoping for really super soft, bouncy, manageable hair to come from this product.  It is a nice shampoo that does not leave a build up, but for me, there was nothing special or miracle working about it.</li>
            <li> The Shampoo is very good and has some conditioning powers itself. It has a bit if a stronger and somewhat masculine scent in my opinion, but I still love how it leaves my hair. I really wouldn&#x27;t even need conditioner with this, that is how conditioning the shampoo is. I see why this is the Repairing line. I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts and opinions</li>
            <li> I was recently given the opportunity to try a new hair care system. I love changing my shampoo and conditioner. Something about the new scent just makes me happy and it&#x27;s always an added bonus when your hair feels amazing afterwards!&lt;br /&gt;Arvazallia Advanced Hair Repair Moisturizing Shampoo and Repair Daily Conditioner are Members of the Arvazallia Advanced Hair Repair System. These products are specially formulated to work in combination to Restore, Strengthen, and Revitalize hair that is dry or that has been damaged or weakened by heat styling, chemical processing, or coloring.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t colored my hair in a few years but I have been putting highlights in.  I have been wearing my hair a little longer than my usual chin length bob of some sort so I have noticed the damage that has been done.&lt;br /&gt;I am obsessed with how these products smell!  I feel like I just stepped out of a salon each time I shower!  My hair is so soft and full of volume which I struggle with.  The shampoo is thick and really lathers up even though it doesn&#x27;t have sulfates or parabens which makes me love it even more!  The conditioner is a great detangler and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is going to sound so weird, but I swear it&#x27;s true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this shampoo because I wanted something sulfate free for my recently color treated hair. I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and conditioner for about a week. This morning I squirted some shampoo onto my hand and realized there were multiple bugs in the shampoo. Seriously. They were like these small gnat type things. It freaked me out. I&#x27;ve had these bottles in my shower with the lids on tightly, so I know the bugs didn&#x27;t get in at my house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sufficiently creeped out now.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Advanced Hair Repair Moisturizing Shampoo, the Daily Hair Conditioner and the Hydrating Argan Oil Hair Mask and wanted to wait until I had used the products a couple times before commenting.  I have notices a significant different in the manageability of my hair.  The use of the shampoo and conditioner has elongated my hair allowing a more easy comb thru when wet.  I have also noticed less breakage when I shampoo and condition with these products. My ends were less dry after using the Mask.  My overall results were positive.</li>
            <li> Takes some getting used to but my hair looks great</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and smooth after use. Will try the conditioner.</li>
            <li> After using it the first time you will notice a huge difference in your hair. Not only does the texture improve but that dry, unmanageable hair becomes silky, soft and luminous. The three-part system deep conditions and moisturizes hair getting to the root of the problem and improves elasticity--so your hair won&#x27;t break every time you touch, brush, or style it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how grateful I am for this incredible hair care system. I saw an instant difference-- not only does it look soft and smooth, it feels hydrated and healthy. I really thought that it was going to take years for my hair to stop breaking and look somewhat healthy, but with this Arvazallia Advanced Hair Care System it only took 4 days for my hair to improve drastically. My hair quit falling out in large amounts, the breaking stopped, and that dry feeling is gone. Now when I run my fingers through my hair all I feel is smooth and silk, soft-to-the-touch hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend these phenomenal products to all of those people who&#x27;ve given up on the idea of restoring damaged hair and also to those who want to prevent their hair from ever getting to the point of no-return. Not only will this hair care line help you restore already-damaged hair but it will nourish and hydrate curly, color-treated and heat-exposed hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read my full review on my blog-- Meandmyminime.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers</li>
            <li> Excellent product! My hair is silky soft.</li>
            <li> The best shampoo I&#x27;ve used in a very long time. I have thick color treated hair and very picky about what products I use. This shampoo leaves my hair very soft and preserves the color better than any other sulfate free product I&#x27;ve tried in the past. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> This product worked great ! Left my hair soft, smooth, and shiny. I have thick, curly, and very often frizzy hair so this was a miracle !!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product to review on my blog. I used to in place of my regular conditioner for over a week, and I have been SO in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;( I used it with the conditioner from the same line)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first day was pretty rainy and I was out of mousse, so after washing I put my hair back in a headband. Not the most exciting do&#x27; but it works when the mousse is gone. I literally sat and petted my hair that day. It was incredibly soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the light scent. It is not drowning out my perfume, or making me smell it all day. But I can smell it on my hands after all the petting ( A LOT OF PETTING.) It did not bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not feel my hair was weighed down, and I have very fine hair. I did not experience those little pimply bumps that I get from some products, I was VERY pleased with this product line.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> WOW! Okay, that doesn&#x27;t really count as a review, huh? When I was sent this haircare trio to review, all I could focus on was the hard to pronounce name :-) After using them, all I could focus on was petting my own head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sulfate free and paraben free, these are safe for all hair types including processed and color treated hair. I&#x27;m often skeptical when shampoos and such claim to work on all hair textures, but I believe it now. My hair is super fine, oily and fairly damaged and using the shampoo and conditioner together made my hair feel silky soft, look amazingly shiny and super clean without being stripped. I swear it actually stayed looking clean and fresh for longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo, being sulfate free, doesn&#x27;t overfoam and strip your hair of it&#x27;s natural, scalp protecting oils but still makes it crazy clean. The conditioner made my hair really soft and detangled; amazingly without weighing it down at all. Usually such deep conditioners make my hair limp and lifeless, but this actually had the opposite effect. After being basically bedridden the last 2 weeks, I used the hair mask to try and bring it back to life and it did that and more. This does not look like the hair of someone who&#x27;s been lying in bed like a dirty mop for half a month!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells wonderful, a subtle fruity scent that had The Mister burying his face in my hear repeatedly. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;2&amp;#34; and he&#x27;s 6&#x27;4&amp;#34;, so he spends a lot of time smelling my head! This passed the hubband head sniffer test :-)</li>
            <li> If your treated hair is dry and brittle, this shampoo will be the last one you&#x27;ll ever try and need to purchase.  Unlike other shampoos, whis shampoo (and I&#x27;ll also add their rinse) leaves your hair manageable, soft, plus it adds shine. It helped restore my full hair hair.  I&#x27;m so happy to never have to shop around and try and find a shampoo again.  Thank goodness.  Also, it&#x27;s not expensive.  I&#x27;m not paying a fortune for a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t work.  I reasonable priced product that works.</li>
            <li> I had been ill for a couple of years leaving my beautiful curly hair dry, frizzy and 1/3 of it fell out. After one use of Arvazallia shampoo my hair felt soft, moisturized and more manageable. With every use it just gets better!  I recommend this product for everyone, especially for curly hair that tends to be dry.</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;Will get the conditioner!👍🏼</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing. I initially purchased the conditioning cream and fell in love with how it worked so decided to try out the shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely fine, dull, damaged and brittle hair, yeah I&#x27;m a hot mess, and a lot of shampoos and conditioners just leave my hair feeling heavy with product and it gets greasy before the day is over. With this stuff though none of that happens. My hair honestly feels so much healthier and soft after I use this. Feels better than when I go to the salon.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff also smells AMAZING!! It&#x27;s very clean, fresh.. Just delicious.</li>
            <li> Love the smell but more importantly love what it did for my hair. My nice hair is back!</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy, thin  hair. That means my hair looks like crap on rainy days. But this shampoo makes my hair shiny, frizz free and just glamorous!! I am in love with this product.</li>
            <li> Bought the conditioner and the defining cream as well.  This line is excellent for curly headed girls like myself.  It is so hard to find products that actually work.  I would highly recommend this product.  In addition, i have below shoulder length hair and only need a small amount of this product.  So I expect it to last for quite a while, unlike other shampoos.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, Need to rinse very well as it can leave hair coated and a greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Caucasian with thick, coarse, frizz prone, middle back length, color treated hair that I&#x27;m trying to grow long &amp; make healthier. I&#x27;ve been using the Arvazallia Oil religiously for about 2 years now. I even bought extras so I&#x27;d never run out &amp; gave 1 to my daughter when she over processed her hair. I also bought the Deep Treatment Mask &amp; noticed it worked well so when I saw they had a Shampoo &amp; Conditioner I immediately ordered the box set that included Shampoo, Conditioner, &amp; Deep Treatment Mask. I couldn&#x27;t wait to try the Shampoo &amp; Conditioner. I used it the night it arrived &amp; pleasantly noticed my hair wasn&#x27;t bleeding color like with every other Shampoo &amp; Conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used, the water was completely clear &amp; I love the smell. I continued to use them along with the Oil, Shampooing every 2-3 days &amp; Deep treating with the Mask 1x weekly, but after a few straight weeks of use I noticed my hair was being more frizzy &amp; dry. It didn&#x27;t appear moisturized at all &amp; the ends felt crunchy. I had to add numerous styling products like &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10 miracle leave-in spray to soften &amp; detangle, L&#x27;oreal smooth intense frizz taming serum to help calm it, &amp; even more Arvazallia Oil after my hair air dried to add moisture. I do not use any form of heat on my hair. I&#x27;m trying to grow it out long so the only thing harsh I use is AgeBeautiful hair color with vitamin E to cover my roots &amp; I add the Arvazallia Oil to my dye mixture as recommended on the box for the Oil. I&#x27;m switching around with Dove Moisturizing Shampoo &amp; Conditioner &amp; Arvazallia Shampoo but with the Mask Conditioner or Suave&#x27;s Intense Smoothing Conditioner (which I use after coloring, it&#x27;s amazing). I am very disappointed &amp; confused as of why my hair started looking worse. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll continue using the Shampoo &amp; Conditioner.</li>
            <li> A sulfate free shampoo is hard to come by and cones that are in most just leave a huge build up or they strip my hair completely dry to where it looks like wheat, this i was shocked to say doesnt it actually feels so good on my hair and scalp that my psoriasis doesnt act up and make me scratch my brains out. My hair is so thin that you can see almost through it and this doesnt make it worse, normal shampoo makes it look like i am bald more so than i already am and this doesn&#x27;t make my hair fall out or even feel like it is burning. and with the conditioner i had a match made in heaven!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FTC Disclosure: &amp;#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation, Licensed Cosmetologist as of 1996 (expired 2013 i will not renew it due to pricing on the license and renewal classes, major was skincare, haircare and makeup).

            <li> what a great Product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i was given this product in order to do a review</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to review Arvazallia Advanced Hair Repair Moisturizing Sulfate Free Shampoo. I don&#x27;t have &amp;#34;damaged&amp;#34; hair, but I do have &amp;#34;aging&amp;#34; hair. My hair has always been thick and straight. I like especially that this is a sulfate free shampoo. I don&#x27;t know the &amp;#34;why&amp;#34; reasoning behind the problem with sulfates in shampoo, but I&#x27;ve heard enough to realize that they are most likely something to avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give Arvazallia a try because I have heard so much hype about argan oil for the hair. So after receiving the product, I tried to follow the basic instructions. 1) Wash hair with the Moisturizing Shampoo and follow that with the Argon Oil Mask. I did this for two successive shampoo occasions. 2) After following the shampoo and &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; procedure twice, I shampooed and followed with the Arvazallia Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very pleasantly surprised after shampoo/mask #1. My hair was soft, flexible, and definitely NOT heavy nor weighed down. After shampoo/mask #2 my hair was still very soft and not weighed down. It was not, however, as manageable as it was after #2. Then after I shampooed the third time using the conditioner, my hair was soft, flexible, and not weighed down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my conclusion for my hair is that the shampoo cleans and lathers slightly and works super for me. I intend to share these with my daughters to see how they like them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary product to facilitate this review. Opinions are solely my own.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products to care for my color treated hair. On top of that it is thin and dry making it challenging. This is tHe ONLY product that has actually helped my hair I use the hair mask and the oil in addition to the products in this purchase. My hair feels and looks very healthy</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference the first time I used it. My hair felt smoother and was easier to comb out. The smell is mild and very pleasant.</li>
            <li> NOT for African American people hair type.</li>
            <li> This is my first day using the shampoo. I have to say the fragrance is great! So fresh smelling! It was thick and didn&#x27;t lather as much. My hair feels great today though. I also appreciated the follow-up message I received from the seller containing tips on how I can get the most from this shampoo and other available products to use in conjunction to achieve the best results for my dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first day using the shampoo.

            <li> So, my hair is curly, dry, thin... I&#x27;ve tried several products... and I love this one!  This set has shampoo, conditioner AND a mask...  I combine the conditioner and mask every other day... I also put the mask in my hair, and then put a shower cap over it while I vacuum, and run around doing household chores.  My hair will probably always be curly.. and even thin, but the dryness is definitely less...  Will buy again for sure!</li>
            <li> All of these products get an E for excellence. Very happy with their performance.</li>
            <li> I love this brand so much.  My hair is curly and often times quite frizzy, but this makes it feel smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> One of the very best sulfate free shampoos I have used. Impressed!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this amazing product! I received a full head of highlights from a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; stylist and my hair ended up fried and damaged. It felt and looked like straw.  I thought for sure I was going to have to cut my hair off. The layers around my face were burned so bad they were crispy and singed. I found this product on amazon and decided to try it. Let me just say it has brought my hair back to life. It took a few weeks, but the more I use this product the healthier, softer and shinier my hair becomes. I will never use anything else going forward. I initially bought the 3 pack of the shampoo, conditioner, and mask. The mask was so wonderful. I used it a few times a week to soften my fried hair. I&#x27;m extremely happy with this product and the fragrance smells so good! My fiance is always telling me my hair smells great. I also think this product has helped my hair to grow a lot longer because it&#x27;s so healthy. Try this product. You will be happy you did! :)  I posted a pic of my hair from this past weekend.</li>
            <li> This is the probably th best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used for natural curly hair. And a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Smells like a professional high end shampoo they would use at a hair salon. When using it you only need a quarter size amount, so the product will last you a long time. This shampoo is safe on color/chemically treated hair and wont strip the hair of its natural moisture. In the instructions on all of the bottles this product is always mentioned, so it plays a big part in the hair repair system and i can really see why. I do fallow this using the conditioner or the hair mask and the products really work well together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I did receive this product for free, for testing and reviewing purposes ONLY!</li>
            <li> Amazing as well, this is different, I have fine blond hair with highlights and these products are AMAZING!! It&#x27;s like I have new hair! Texture and volume without weighing it down at all, I will NEVER be without this stuff!!</li>
            <li> Made my relaxed hair very soft!!</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I purchased this based on the great reviews, but was tremendously disappointed. The shampoo left my hair dry and damaged. I experienced the maximum hair fall I have ever had – I still stuck to the shampoo for three weeks to give it a fair shot. Now I have promptly gone back to normal department store shampoos! My experience might be an exception here, but I wanted to share it anyway.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I recieved this shampoo for testing and review purposes.&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo from Arvazallia smells amazing !&lt;br /&gt;As I was washing my hair I was thinking of the Calgon Take Me Away commercial lol&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s how wonderful this shampoo smelled and felt while massaging it into my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;I toweled dried it and when it was a little damp it still gave my hair bounce and shine and did not weigh down my waves. I love that Argan Oil and Macadamia Oil are infused so those oils make this shampoo beneficial for healthy hair. The results are in the picture below.</li>
            <li> I love that this shampoo is not only paraben free but sulfate free as well. It does a really great job at getting a nice deep down clean, without stripping my hair. I color my hair as well as use a straightener quite frequently, so I have a lot of factors against me. However, using this shampoo I now don&#x27;t have to worry nearly as much. This shampoo really helps to strengthen my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the smell of the shampoo to me it has more of an Argan Oil smell. It is also neutral enough, so that if my husband wanted to use it he could as it is not too &amp;#34;flowery.&amp;#34;It is definitely a must-have sort of shampoo for the upcoming summer months.</li>
            <li> This is sulfate free and paraben free, which is a huge plus. It also has great ingredients in them, like argan oil and macadamia oil. The bottle also feels really nice in your hands, almost like plastic velvet. This has helped thicken and strengthen my hair and all produce a nice shine. This is ideal for dry, damaged, weak, and processed hair, which I definitely need. I saw a difference immediately after using it and everytime I useit now, my hair feels softer, bouncier, more manageable, and less brittle. Great stuff and super beneficial to the hair and scalp. This is great. It smells amazing, has so many beneficial ingredients, and leaves my fine hair feeling soft and strong, never weighed down by the argan oil. This doesn&#x27;t lather a lot because it&#x27;s sulfate free, but you don&#x27;t need to use a lot to see great results.</li>
