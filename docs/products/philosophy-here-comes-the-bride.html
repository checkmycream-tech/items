            <li> I use Pro-activ facial cleanser for minor facial blemishes &amp; this</li>
            <li> In general, it is not a good idea to use new products on the day of your wedding!</li>
            <li> She requested a gift receipt which I took as quite bald and rude, but I guess she didn&#x27;t like that much.</li>
            <li> long enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it was a lot smaller than expected a whopping 7&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed, i haven&#x27;t really had too bad of an experience with amazon or the companies they are partnered with, but this is the first time i got something completely different then pictured: the picture shows a cute white round box with and blonde bride and brunette groom</li>
            <li> I was a little at a loss as to what to bring to the bridal shower since she (thankfully) has so much she is almost hard to shop for.</li>
            <li> Not close to what I expected.</li>
            <li> As with other reviews, I wish the fragrance wasn&#x27;t so dull.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing</li>
            <li> Not worth the price in my opinion.</li>
            <li> the plastic holding the bottles together had to be wiped down.</li>
            <li> This and a few other things turned out to be perfectâ™¥</li>
            <li> Mine has a little girl on it holding an adults hand.</li>
            <li> For the cost, the bottles were small</li>
            <li> Since the description did not have a size, I knew it would be small</li>
            <li> A little disappointed because the picture on the box I received did not match the one in the picture.</li>
            <li> missing product :(</li>
            <li> Also, it was very dusty on the inside and</li>
            <li> The face wash dried out the skin on my chin horribly to the point that I was hurting.</li>
            <li> VARY UNHAPPY.</li>
            <li> Bride hated the gift, thought this was from Target or BBB.</li>

            <li> really nice gift set.  Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I thought that this set was cute so I purchased it to use in my bridal suite. As others have said, the bottles are trial sizes. You are paying for the messages on plastic bottles. The face wash dried out the skin on my chin horribly to the point that I was hurting. In general, it is not a good idea to use new products on the day of your wedding!</li>
            <li> Great gift for a bride!</li>
            <li> For the cost, the bottles were small</li>
            <li> A little disappointed because the picture on the box I received did not match the one in the picture. Mine has a little girl on it holding an adults hand. Also, it was very dusty on the inside and the plastic holding the bottles together had to be wiped down. It seems like it probably sat on display somewhere and collected dust.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed, i haven&#x27;t really had too bad of an experience with amazon or the companies they are partnered with, but this is the first time i got something completely different then pictured: the picture shows a cute white round box with and blonde bride and brunette groom (my friend whose getting married exactly) i received a different shaped box purple with a small weird looking little brunette girl looking back of her shoulder... and then the best i open it to just see the jar of HOPE is not in it!!! missing product :( i was so bummed...i looked on back to make sure all that i saw on pic and description was suppose to be in there and yes it was so there mistake, and now i have to wait on my refund for something they messed up and repack to have them come by sometime and pick up to return back! VARY UNHAPPY.</li>
            <li> I am a wedding photographer and have begun purchasing this set as a gift to my brides who purchase my larger wedding packages.  They love receiving something just for them, and I know I&#x27;m giving them a great product that I would love to have for myself.  It&#x27;s cute and the top comes off so I can easily slip a card inside and close it back, making it self-packaging and easy to carry with me as I&#x27;m walking out the door and into a wedding.  I&#x27;ve used the products in it myself and love them.</li>
            <li> I did not want to spend the money on a product I was unsure about. This was perfect for testing the product.  I waited to write a review until I had used the product long enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope in a Jar - thinner, watery feeling when applied but, have noticed a difference in my skin and will purchase again.  I use Pro-activ facial cleanser for minor facial blemishes &amp; this is a great product to keep my skin hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;Purity - gentle and used for removing eye make-up in the shower.  Will purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing Grace body wash - hydrating and it truly is a wonderful scent.  As with other reviews, I wish the fragrance wasn&#x27;t so dull.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing Grace lotion- This lotion DOES NOT smell like the Amazing Grace body wash.  Mine smelled like sunscreen lotion.  I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Perfect gift for the bride to be. Who doesn&#x27;t like Philosophy products?</li>
            <li> Bride hated the gift, thought this was from Target or BBB. She requested a gift receipt which I took as quite bald and rude, but I guess she didn&#x27;t like that much. I thought the concept was great though.</li>
            <li> Perfect gift for a wedding shower!</li>
            <li> Got this as a shower gift for a good friend of mine who is getting married for the second time. She really loved it!</li>
            <li> Great gift for a bridal shower.  Future bride really seemed to enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for a bride&#x27;s bachelorette party gift. It is some of Philosophy&#x27;s best products, Amazing Grace and Purity are awesome. Cute case for the bride. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Excellent products, cute packaging, nice gift.</li>
            <li> Got this for my future daughter-in-law&#x27;s Bridal Shower . She loved it !! Great size to introduce Philosophy products . This is the best price I found too . Thank you :)</li>
            <li> My soon to be daughter in law loves all things Philosophy so she loved this set. I was a little at a loss as to what to bring to the bridal shower since she (thankfully) has so much she is almost hard to shop for. This and a few other things turned out to be perfectâ™¥</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my best friend to give her the night before her wedding! She brought it with her to use in the bridal suite because everything was travel size! She loved it and thought it was really thoughtful!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product and recommend it as a bridal shower gift. My daughter was very happy with it!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Lightly scented.</li>
            <li> Great way to test the products! The face moisturizer was my favorite part. I used these for traveling abroad and they lasted about a month or two with daily use</li>
            <li> Trial size bottles. Not worth the price in my opinion.</li>
            <li> use for travel, love all these products</li>
            <li> Perfect packaging,  items new and sealed.  Long-time fan of every item and got this set for travel.  Hope in a jar is my go to moisturizer year-round.  Light and fluffy,  my skin drinks it in and stays hydrated.  Amazing Grace fragrance is the best ever.  The cute package also makes it ideal for a gift.</li>
            <li> Great gift set-- I bought this for my friend&#x27;s bridal shower and she loved it!  Now she&#x27;s hooked on philosophy products!</li>
            <li> This was a hit at a bridal shower! perfect for pampering the bride to be! Shipped quickly!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter as a side gift for Christmas, since she got engaged recently. She loved it!</li>
            <li> Since the description did not have a size, I knew it would be small but it was a lot smaller than expected a whopping 7&amp;#34;. I can live with that but the cute little picture on the bag forget it. No picture at all it only says &amp;#34;philosophy: to give is to receive. Not close to what I expected.</li>
