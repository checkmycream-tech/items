            <li>I have tried many dandruff shampoos,but this is the best!</li>
            <li>Smells nice, unlike a lot of shampoos for scalp conditions.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy like some head and shoulders formulas and effective on scaling.&lt;br /&gt;would</li>
            <li>(dog shampoos dont), and helped his flakes better than the dog shampoo alone</li>
            <li>Head &amp; Shoulders extra strength is the best.</li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome, better than selsun blue in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Really great shampoo that really works.</li>
            <li>Better than anything on the market.</li>
            <li>For really oily hair, this appears very effective.</li>
            <li>it lathered up fine</li>
            <li>I wanted to make sure that I came in here and wrote a quick review for this product before I forgot again.</li>
            <li>Below is my original review.    </li>
            <li>Out of the the HS shampoos this one is closest to the 1980&#x27;s original.</li>
            <li>I wish we had the original</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, the clinical strength shampoo cites it controls oiliness, but this extra strength shampoo does not mention oily hair.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>The 2% zinc works great to keep the itch away and patches down.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it is supposed to do!</li>
            <li>It works great for smelly scalp, I am not sure how well it works for dandruff.</li>
            <li>They arrived very fast.</li>
            <li>If you have oily hair, I recommend trying the clinical strength shampoo first.  </li>
            <li>This is what my dermatologist recommended for large flakes coming off my scalp.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The whole family can use this.</li>
            <li>While I still have to use two washings when using this 2% solution or their Clinical Strength version, my (short) hair remains light and presentable for longer using this formulation.  </li>
            <li>This is effective for dandruff, especially in the dry winter months.  </li>
            <li>the box was bigger than what I wondered was necessary, which meant that the space was filled with air pillows.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I have tried the fruity HS, the mens line etc even the clinical strength but this extra 2% is the only HS that compares to the original bluish/green.</li>
            <li>My wife loves my soft hair, no itching, no flakes!</li>
            <li>The zinc ingredient is at 2%, the same as the many $$$ shampoos touted to encourage regrowth due to their zinc content.</li>
            <li>But make sure you&#x27;re buying extra strength, because it really is a big difference from regular Head &amp; Shoulders!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really hard to find now since Target doesn&#x27;t sell it anymore, so I was glad to find it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Neither the last bottle of this (or in its new packaging), created foaming.  </li>
            <li>better than regular head and shoulders and hard to find even at the bigger pharmacies.</li>
            <li>Apparently doubling the pyrithione zinc raises cleansing power above the Clinical Strength shampoo using selenium sulfide.  </li>
            <li>I was having difficulty locating the large extra strength product in the stores, and this one cost me less money</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have been using head and shoulders for the last few years due to my scalp problem, I&#x27;m still trying to find a doctor to help me with a more permanent solution but in the mean time, head and shoulders does the trick.</li>
            <li> Works well, and after less than a week, no more flakes (more like small white scabs than tiny flakes of dandruff).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too bad, I really liked this product.  </li>
            <li> However, it is shiny and soft, not shampooed harshly.  </li>
            <li> It left my hair with a slightly oily feel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m slightly apprehensive due to the &#x27;extra strength&#x27; on the label and  concerned it may damage my hair.</li>
            <li> It stopped the slight itching to the sides of my scalp within a few days of regular use.</li>
            <li> Six years ago, when I lost my hair due to chemotherapy, I researched for shampoos/treatments that might speed regrowth.</li>
            <li> Now I have had some scalp surgery which resulted in a fifty-cent coin-sized bald spot (due to scalp stress of stretching the skin flap during surgery).  </li>
            <li> I think it has to do with the 2% active ingredient.</li>
            <li> I find that I have to wash my hair at least twice a week with H&amp;S in order to keep my scalp irritation under control, but with the extra strength I can wash once a week maybe even once every other week.</li>
            <li> I typically use argan oil to soften my hair after use.</li>
            <li> I no longer recommend this for cleaning hair, since it does not clean hair; thus, no removal of oil or grease.  </li>
            <li> So when I get my hair done I like it to last at least two weeks, but washing my hair every week makes it hard to keep my hair done.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting a shampoo which left my hair in poor condition.  </li>
            <li> The only bad thing about this product is I can&#x27;t seem to find H&amp;S extra strength in stores anywhere.</li>
            <li> I use it for my son who has thick hair and he plays lots of sports,</li>
            <li> This helps a lot because my hair is very thick and kinky.</li>
            <li> I have had bad dandruff</li>
            <li> My husband has the worst dandruff, for years we&#x27;ve tried every product you can imagine.</li>

            <li> I am happy with the results. It stopped the slight itching to the sides of my scalp within a few days of regular use. I try to use any type of conditioner afterwards. I&#x27;m slightly apprehensive due to the &#x27;extra strength&#x27; on the label and  concerned it may damage my hair.</li>
            <li> . Very pretty. They arrived very fast.</li>
            <li> If you have psoriasis, this works wonderfully! The 2% zinc works great to keep the itch away and patches down. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought this to shampoo my dog - he has quite a case of seborrhea.  I used it on myself first.&lt;br /&gt;it lathers up well, and tingles the scalp, which feels wonderful to me.  I mixed it with my dog&#x27;s $20 seborrhea shampoo and it worked wonders.  it lathered up fine (dog shampoos dont), and helped his flakes better than the dog shampoo alone did.&lt;br /&gt;this is an off-use, but I can imagine it would do a great job on people dandruff.</li>
            <li> The whole family can use this.</li>
            <li> i use it as a body wash and it keeps my skin so purty.</li>
            <li> Has worked well in husband&#x27;s dandruff-shampoo rotation for decades. Smells nice, unlike a lot of shampoos for scalp conditions.</li>
            <li> I have been using head and shoulders for the last few years due to my scalp problem, I&#x27;m still trying to find a doctor to help me with a more permanent solution but in the mean time, head and shoulders does the trick. I find that I have to wash my hair at least twice a week with H&amp;S in order to keep my scalp irritation under control, but with the extra strength I can wash once a week maybe even once every other week. This helps a lot because my hair is very thick and kinky. So when I get my hair done I like it to last at least two weeks, but washing my hair every week makes it hard to keep my hair done. That&#x27;s why I use the extra strength. I even take it with me to my hair stylist for her to use when she is washing my hair. The only bad thing about this product is I can&#x27;t seem to find H&amp;S extra strength in stores anywhere.</li>
            <li> Head &amp; Shoulders extra strength is the best. I think it has to do with the 2% active ingredient. Nothing works like this strength.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome, better than selsun blue in my opinion. I have had bad dandruff but this seems to have helped a lot.</li>
            <li> Really great shampoo that really works. It&#x27;s really hard to find now since Target doesn&#x27;t sell it anymore, so I was glad to find it here on Amazon. Great price and does the job!</li>
            <li> Shampoo! Does exactly what it is supposed to do!</li>
            <li> The very best shampoo for itchy scalp. I&#x27;ve tried them ALL. This is simply terrific. What a surprise. Better than anything on the market. WOW!</li>
            <li> Neither the last bottle of this (or in its new packaging), created foaming.  The dates for expiration are 2016,long away. I no longer recommend this for cleaning hair, since it does not clean hair; thus, no removal of oil or grease.  Too bad, I really liked this product.  Below is my original review.    Apparently doubling the pyrithione zinc raises cleansing power above the Clinical Strength shampoo using selenium sulfide.  While I still have to use two washings when using this 2% solution or their Clinical Strength version, my (short) hair remains light and presentable for longer using this formulation.  Surprisingly, the clinical strength shampoo cites it controls oiliness, but this extra strength shampoo does not mention oily hair.  If you have oily hair, I recommend trying the clinical strength shampoo first.  For really oily hair, this appears very effective.</li>
            <li> I wanted to make sure that I came in here and wrote a quick review for this product before I forgot again.I have tried many dandruff shampoos,but this is the best!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy like some head and shoulders formulas and effective on scaling.&lt;br /&gt;would also recommend green apple and simply gentle formulas.</li>
            <li> Out of the the HS shampoos this one is closest to the 1980&#x27;s original. Smells the best and works like HS should. I have tried the fruity HS, the mens line etc even the clinical strength but this extra 2% is the only HS that compares to the original bluish/green. I wish we had the original but finally HS got back on track! My wife loves my soft hair, no itching, no flakes! Smells good!</li>
            <li> This is what my dermatologist recommended for large flakes coming off my scalp.  Works well, and after less than a week, no more flakes (more like small white scabs than tiny flakes of dandruff).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting a shampoo which left my hair in poor condition.  However, it is shiny and soft, not shampooed harshly.  No need for separate conditioner, just another unneeded chemical on my hair.</li>
            <li> This is effective for dandruff, especially in the dry winter months.  Although, this product does have a tendency to leave hair feeling frizzy.  I typically use argan oil to soften my hair after use.</li>
            <li> This head and shoulders was comparably priced and I didn&#x27;t have to go to the store. It works great for smelly scalp, I am not sure how well it works for dandruff. I use it for my son who has thick hair and he plays lots of sports, regular shampoo just doesn&#x27;t quite get that stinky scalp/hair smell out for him and this does!</li>
            <li> Does what it is suppose to</li>
            <li> Takes care of the dandruff I had.</li>
            <li> the box was bigger than what I wondered was necessary, which meant that the space was filled with air pillows.</li>
            <li> It left my hair with a slightly oily feel. Wasn&#x27;t the best.</li>
            <li> better than regular head and shoulders and hard to find even at the bigger pharmacies.</li>
            <li> I was having difficulty locating the large extra strength product in the stores, and this one cost me less money</li>
            <li> Six years ago, when I lost my hair due to chemotherapy, I researched for shampoos/treatments that might speed regrowth. I found multiple online references to using a shampoo with zinc.  I read a lot of labels and used H&amp;S extra strength shampoo. The zinc ingredient is at 2%, the same as the many $$$ shampoos touted to encourage regrowth due to their zinc content. Now I have had some scalp surgery which resulted in a fifty-cent coin-sized bald spot (due to scalp stress of stretching the skin flap during surgery).  So I have reordered this H&amp;S Extra Strength Dandruff Shampoo to help things along.  I will update this review in six months and let you know if I noticed speedier regrowth.</li>
            <li> My husband has the worst dandruff, for years we&#x27;ve tried every product you can imagine. Nothing has worked as well as this extra strength version! But make sure you&#x27;re buying extra strength, because it really is a big difference from regular Head &amp; Shoulders!</li>
