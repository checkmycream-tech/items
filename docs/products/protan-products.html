            <li>This tanning lotion smells great, however after I had used it the areas I had applied the cream to were covered in a very sore itchy red rash.</li>

            <li> On second review, this does not work like average tanning salon tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> It simply gives a little burn and then it does not turn to tan.</li>
            <li> I use it with other pro Tan products as well.  </li>
            <li> I have used other pro tan sunbed creams and have never had a reaction like this.</li>
            <li> so you won&#x27;t get really dark, but you don&#x27;t want to look like a carrot</li>
            <li> mine is a lotion with a slight bronzer in it</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion because I wanted one that had little to no bronzer in it.</li>
            <li> it is not at least not the one I received...</li>
            <li> I like the thick moisture this lotion provides.</li>
            <li> I went to the tanning bed for a week before using any lotion to get a base.  </li>
            <li> I already had a base tan I was hopeing it would make me darker</li>

            <li> I bought this lotion because I wanted one that had little to no bronzer in it. This was the perfect one, smells amazing and leaves my skin feeling great. The lotion is sort of a orange creamy color and goes on really nice. It really helps to boost my natural color which is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Great product! That funny smell everyone said about it wasn&#x27;t even close to what it is. Besides after two days of using this. I don&#x27;t notice the &amp;#34;melon&amp;#34; scent people had a problem with. Great lotion, love this product</li>
            <li> I love the consistency and ease that it goes on.  The smell is wonderful.  Very light and not over powering.  Seems to work well.  I went to the tanning bed for a week before using any lotion to get a base.  I have to tan slowly at first so I don&#x27;t burn.  Once I started using this I noticed a huge difference in color.</li>
            <li> this is a great lotion it has a slight bronzer in it.... even though it says its a gelee it is not at least not the one I received... mine is a lotion with a slight bronzer in it and it smells just like cake mix and it worx GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten good of a tan in a long time.  Love the smell also.  I use it with other pro Tan products as well.  Great product!!!</li>
            <li> I was impressed with the fast delivery. Great smell not overwhelming and faded pretty quickly leaves your skin feeling soft and healthy. I recommend!</li>
            <li> I like the thick moisture this lotion provides. I used to use a tingle lotion, but decided to try this one due to the good reviews and really great price. It&#x27;s been great. I like the light scent and my skin feels great.</li>
            <li> I like it, it feels nice on your skin and it smells like cake.  It&#x27;s only 10x so you won&#x27;t get really dark, but you don&#x27;t want to look like a carrot do you ?</li>
            <li> The price was right. I likecthe brand.Creamy and is nice on my skin.Helps in maintaining a nice,natural tan</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion smells great, however after I had used it the areas I had applied the cream to were covered in a very sore itchy red rash. Seems to be an allergic reaction. I have used other pro tan sunbed creams and have never had a reaction like this.</li>
            <li> Smells really good, i cant really tell thats its helped with my tan tho</li>
            <li> On second review, this does not work like average tanning salon tanning lotions. It simply gives a little burn and then it does not turn to tan. I am a hardcore tanner and I happened upon this product line and now know it was a monumental mistake. Stay away. I will never buy lotions on Amazon again. Buy them in your gym or salon where you can sample a packet before you spend $36 to get the free S/H for four lotions.&lt;br /&gt;I donated the four to the gym so others who wouldn&#x27;t normally buy the lotions could use them for free.</li>
            <li> shipping process is fast, but the product doesn&#x27;t work better than i thought..lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try to buy hot tingle tanning lotion which is level8. This product is level2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s why it doesn&#x27;t work well..lol. I will try level8 tanning lotion next time..lol.</li>
            <li> Love it! Would buy again!</li>
            <li> It smells great and keeps my skin hydrated and smooth afterwards. I&#x27;m only giving it three stars because I haven&#x27;t used it enough to tell if it helps my tan any.</li>
            <li> Not the same product in the picture kinda pissed</li>
            <li> I thought I would Have better results I already had a base tan I was hopeing it would make me darker but I really can not tell a difference.....</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, like almond/cherry/cupcake but I have no clue how it works for tans, haha.

            <li> Smells great,  applies easily,  and great value!!!! Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> MAKES A GOOD MOISTURIZER</li>
