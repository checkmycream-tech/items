            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel and look wonderful.  </li>
            <li>ON OF THE BEST PRODUCTS I HAVE TRIED ON MY HAIR.</li>
            <li>Best shampoo I ever used, it smells beautiful</li>
            <li>Very good product.</li>
            <li>Lol</li>
            <li>The smell of the shampoo is great too.</li>
            <li>I love it and told others about it!!</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product that I have used for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo!  </li>
            <li>shampoo is rich, cleans thoroughly, lasts forever, and is safe for color-treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;Also, try the conditioner, mouse, and oil treatments - the best!</li>
            <li>This shampoo works great, it leaves your hair feeling moisturized and light weight.  </li>
            <li>BUT THE RESULS ARE AMAZING</li>
            <li>Hair feels wonderful and soft after every use...</li>
            <li>This shampoo is great not only that it smells wonderful and leave ur hair shinny and clean..</li>
            <li>Great for retaining hair color and gentle to the hair!  </li>
            <li>Love this product, my stylist uses it in me.</li>
            <li>My hair is strong and shiny all the time.</li>
            <li>My hair is manageable, healthy and has a golden shine.  </li>
            <li>Smells so good and leaves my hair really soft.</li>
            <li>Gives your hair that beautiful shine without weighing it down</li>
            <li>so I need a gentle shampoo that will leave my hair easy to comb out after washing.  </li>
            <li>I wish it was sold in stores as well as online, but it is worth waiting for my order.</li>
            <li>I bought another bottle right after I bought this one .</li>
            <li>I loved the previous version but not this one.</li>
            <li>im sure the $6 a bottle stuff does the same......</li>
            <li>I first came across this shampoo at a friends beach house and was hooked on its scent and the noticeable amount of shine after just the first wash.</li>
            <li>Exactly does what is said.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for a few years now and I love it!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand how a bright pink bottle could be shipped in place of a white one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d also highly suggest buying this with the conditioner as well.</li>
            <li>THE PRICE IS HIGH</li>
            <li>This is the only shampoo I ever use for several years now and was originally recommended to me by my hair stylist</li>
            <li>Not the same as the first one made.</li>
            <li>Does not smell the same as the first one made.</li>
            <li>I have likes other products by the same line so much more.</li>
            <li>This seems a new line, very different from what it used to be.</li>

            <li> My haircare professional introduces me to Alfaparf several years ago - I won&#x27;t use any other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shampoo is very expensive when you&#x27;re considering the 8 ounce bottle... with the 1 litre size (you will want a pump for it, and its not included, i used a starbucks syrup pump and it works perfectly) its economically priced and you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the way it smells.</li>
            <li> not sure what else its supposed to do ???</li>
            <li> The shampoo for color treated hair that was sent in error dries out my hair and leaves a dull appearance.</li>
            <li> I am not happy since the wrong product was shipped.</li>

            <li> cant quite figure out if this works or not...??? its shampoo and it makes suds and washes your hair... not sure what else its supposed to do ??? im sure the $6 a bottle stuff does the same......</li>

            <li> This shampoo is great not only that it smells wonderful and leave ur hair shinny and clean.. Luv it! I recommend this product to everyone even if u have kinky hair.... Lol</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo!  Smells so good and leaves my hair really soft.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works great, it leaves your hair feeling moisturized and light weight.  The smell of the shampoo is great too.</li>
            <li> Awesome smell! Item is as described.</li>
            <li> My biggest problem with this shampoo is that it doesn&#x27;t detangle well enough.  My hair is already fragile from chemical treatments so I need a gentle shampoo that will leave my hair easy to comb out after washing.  Will finish using it but still look for another shampoo.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo I ever used, it smells beautiful I love it and told others about it!! I bought another bottle right after I bought this one . My mom bought a bottle too and likes it</li>
            <li> Very good product. Exactly does what is said. wife has been using for months and won&#x27;t settle for anything else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for a few years now and I love it! Great product! Gives your hair that beautiful shine without weighing it down</li>
            <li> This seems a new line, very different from what it used to be. I loved the previous version but not this one. After rinsing my hair with a lot of water, it feels the shampoo is still in my hair...</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo I ever use for several years now and was originally recommended to me by my hair stylist</li>
            <li> My haircare professional introduces me to Alfaparf several years ago - I won&#x27;t use any other products.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is rich, cleans thoroughly, lasts forever, and is safe for color-treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;Also, try the conditioner, mouse, and oil treatments - the best!</li>
            <li> A friend gave me this product for my 60th birthday and I have been using it ever since.  I just turned 66!  It makes my hair feel and look wonderful.  My hair is manageable, healthy and has a golden shine.  The product also lasts forever!  A little goes a long way.  I wish it was sold in stores as well as online, but it is worth waiting for my order.</li>
            <li> Not the same as the first one made. No comparison. Does not smell the same as the first one made. Also , does not leave your hair feeling the same.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way!  This bottle would cost $60 in any salon...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the way it smells. I have likes other products by the same line so much more.</li>
            <li> Great for retaining hair color and gentle to the hair!  I have used this product before and therefore, ordered another bottle for myself!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product that I have used for more than 10 years. My hair is strong and shiny all the time.</li>
            <li> ON OF THE BEST PRODUCTS I HAVE TRIED ON MY HAIR. THE PRICE IS HIGH BUT THE RESULS ARE AMAZING</li>
