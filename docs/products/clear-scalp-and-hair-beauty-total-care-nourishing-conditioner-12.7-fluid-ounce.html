    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>. . . an excellent product and an excellent value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reviewed both the \\&quot;Clear\\&quot; shampoo and the \\&quot;Clear\\&quot; conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I like best, however, is the bottle.</li>
            <li>and it smells awesome as well.</li>
            <li>It smelled awesome, but that&#x27;s not what my mailbox is supposed to smell like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not convinced that it&#x27;s the best online purchase.</li>
            <li>I think this product is a very good conditioner.</li>
            <li>This was a happy accident.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-leaves hair feeling great and not &#x27;coated&#x27; with product after you rinse it out&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product is great, no complaints there.  </li>
            <li>However, I was still very impressed as this conditioner was as good as many salon brand conditioners at a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant scent that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>but it is pleasant.</li>
            <li>because this time, it wasn&#x27;t a good change!&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed to use alot to get good detangling and conditioning.</li>
            <li>This is a good all-purpose conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It smells good.  </li>
            <li>Great smell, it was okay</li>
            <li>For my very fine hair the product was successful but not pleasing.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27; ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried MANY in my 42 years!</li>
            <li>(I do wish they had more leave-in products!)</li>
            <li>It was a nice change.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed with the Clear Shampoo and decided to try this product in conjunction with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very happy with the Clear line of products.</li>
            <li>By far it is the best hair conditioner among all</li>
            <li>This is by far the best conditioner I have ever used.</li>
            <li>But after just three weeks using this product I have a fist full if hair after I shower!!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m always on the hunt for a new product that will be the latest and greatest</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this shampoo and the way it leaves my hair feeling.</li>
            <li>Amazon knows this, and takes some precautions (taping the cap on and wrapping the bottles in plastic bags), but it doesn&#x27;t make this the most shipment-friendly product in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m it sure it will stop eventually</li>
            <li>this product is ok</li>
            <li>I had to wonder why the opening is on the bottom instead of the top like the shampoo.</li>
            <li>The consistency of the conditioner is okay</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>My scalp does feel better.</li>
            <li>Without exception, we were more than pleased -- to the extent that we have already purchased more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to use cream rinse in forever and have a stash of used-it-once-but-never-again shampoo bottles practically the size of Mount Everest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Besides the end results, I love the scent; it reminds me of a tropical drink or island because of the coconut.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have tried several from the brand, and so far I like this one the best, although it still is not my ideal</li>
            <li>I end up using a leave in conditioner afterwards most times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think the most noticeable difference I have seen from this conditioner is the shine my hair has now.</li>
            <li>I am completely in love.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering more when I run out of the products I received from the Vine program.</li>
            <li>this is my favorite product atm since i always jump from products to product.</li>
            <li>a delight.&lt;br /&gt;Smells as refreshing as it feels</li>
            <li>--it helps get the most product out of the bottle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But after reading the reviews I cannot believe that there are so many people that are having this issue and these products remain on the market.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very nice and does the job without leaving too much coating on the hair.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, and has a clean aroma.</li>
            <li>If this conditioner did just a tad more conditioning it would be a pretty good conditioner.</li>
            <li>I am very very surprised and happy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This has a light clean scent and leaves hair nicely manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, cool looking bottle (hey!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The bottles are also fairly easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to squeeze out the conditioner</li>
            <li>It rinses out easily, but once it&#x27;s out, it&#x27;s out -</li>
            <li>I was very pleased that it was super easy to comb out the tangles and after blow-drying my hair had a nice sheen to it and felt very soft.  </li>
            <li>It says nourishing daily conditioner for scalp and strong beautiful hair.</li>
            <li>and best of all, it doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down with repeated use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s fine for me or my wife.  </li>
            <li>The light, pleasant scent doesn&#x27;t rinse completely out, but also doesn&#x27;t clash with any of the perfumes I wear.</li>
            <li>This product goes well with the Clear Scalp&#x27;s line of dandruff shampoo (with pyrithione zinc), and has a pleasant, light scent.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After conditioning the conditioner rinsed out easily leaving my hair feeling clean, frizz free, and shiny.</li>
            <li>Love makes my curly hair frizz free and soft and amazing â™¡</li>
            <li>Left my hair smelling and feeling great.</li>
            <li>I threw the product away because I switched to cruelty free products.</li>
            <li>and it leaves your hair more soft and manageable than shampoo would on its own.</li>
            <li>As many of you who follow my reviews know, I&#x27;ve had the very devil of a time with hair products for more than five years now.  </li>
            <li>A light pleasing scent begins the experience, the bottle is shower friendly, and the conditioner is smooth and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is very nice and seems to last throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It have a nice smell, leaves my hair soft and easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several of the Clear Scalp conditioners and they have all been very impressive.  </li>
            <li>After a week of use my hair never quite felt clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clean fragrance</li>
            <li>and I think Clear Scalp &amp; Hair is better than any salon stuff!</li>
            <li>I have gotten tons of compliments from my hair cutter saying that my hair is so soft and healthy!</li>
            <li>right?!)...</li>
            <li>The Clear Hair shampoo had a nice clean scent.</li>
            <li>My hair does seem to be better off for using it, and that&#x27;s the most important thing (especially some of its renewed strength).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, it is a good conditioner.</li>
            <li>Total Care is also a good conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It had a mild and unoffensive scent.</li>
            <li>The bottle is easy to hold and very easy to click open in the shower.  </li>
            <li>One opens from the top and the other from the bottom which is nice</li>
            <li>Good size bottle and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>The open/close tab is large and moves easily.</li>
            <li>If you have normal hair, this would be a great daily conditioner for you.</li>
            <li>Although my hair continues to grow and look great, it hasn&#x27;t gotten the accolades that it did with the previous conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I had been using [[ASIN:B007RTR8UW CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Strong Lengths Nourishing Conditioner]], which got fabulous results.  </li>
            <li>, it is light and rinses out easily, but leaves my hair soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure that when I run out of this I will buy more, either here on Amazon or locally, because the price is right for the results I received.</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t justify using so much at a time, even if it is a cheap brand.</li>
            <li>If you have fingernails of any kind, you will break them trying to squeeze the product out of this tiny hole that habitually clogs!</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this conditioner, and it does make your hair feel soft after drying.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the better CLEAR conditioners.</li>
            <li>It would be better if it had a flip top or some other easier way to get it out.</li>
            <li>She absolutely LOVED this conditioner and the other two products she test</li>
            <li>It is just the right about of conditioning.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just the right size</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent too, but might be a little strong for some.</li>
            <li>I have straight, fine hair and using this conditioner daily keeps it healthy looking.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad scent, but it is a very perfumey, \\&quot;cosmetic\\&quot; scent.</li>
            <li>It has a very pleasant and subtle floral scent which I like very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>conditioner is thick, like the kind you get when you buy the boxed hair dye (which I really love)</li>
            <li>CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Total Care Nourishing Conditioner makes my hair feel pretty good and not greasy.</li>
            <li>like this product very much and would suggest it to friends and family.</li>
            <li>I have long, very straight, very fine hair, and need conditioning without weight or buildup.</li>
            <li>When I first used this, the first thing I noticed was the scent - sunflower seeds.</li>
            <li>Checked the ingredients, sure enough - sunflower seed oil (as well as Aloe and others.)</li>
            <li>When I first used this product, I noticed a difference in how my hair felt.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner bottles look almost exactly alike,</li>
            <li>It made my hair soft, shiny and smooth</li>
            <li>It was noticably softer, it had more shine and it actually looked thicker than before...</li>
            <li>Again, my lovely hubs asked what I was doing differently...</li>
            <li>After a friend recommended it to me, I am not sorry I bought this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Its very thick and smells great yet light enough to not compete with the light perfume I wear on occasion.</li>
            <li>all, the Clear Total Care Nourishing Conditioner is a good product at a decent price.</li>
            <li>Nourishing Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce]], which left my hair lovely and smooth.  </li>
            <li>and this is 3 to 4 times the price of other conditioners I have used with much greater success.</li>
            <li>I have normal hair, and rarely use conditioner.</li>
            <li>The conditioner worked exceptionally well, to the extent that with regular shampooing, we found that the conditioner was only needed every couple of days or so.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a shame, because the bottle is designed to rest upside down (which is normally a nice feature for a product like this</li>
            <li>Because Strong Lengths gave me stronger applause, I&#x27;ll give Total Care 4 1/2 stars.</li>
            <li>I have fine, very short hair with growing out highlights.  </li>
            <li>I bought the little tester bottles and now I have an inexpensive product that moisturizes well, gives shine and smells amazing</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li>My scalp is very itchy as well.</li>
            <li>but how much hair will I lose in the meantime?</li>
            <li>I really like this conditioner and will continue to use them both.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for damaged hair!</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t squeeze out too much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-very gentle scent...doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling like you just had a shower</li>
            <li>than the fact that people don&#x27;t compliment my hair as much as they used to, I would have given this product five stars.  </li>
            <li>is a message your scalp while cleansing product that feel luxurious yet is really very beneficial.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>I realize that packaging and shipping shouldn&#x27;t really be part of the product review, but I have to point out that this product really didn&#x27;t ship well.  </li>
            <li>but my hair appeared to be more damaged (I also have naturally wavy hair, so I used the blow dryer and straightener or curling iron on a daily basis) and it also appeared that my hair stopped growing for those 6 weeks that I switched.</li>
            <li>Hard is full and soft, love it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I like this line of conditioners I have to say that there does not seem to be a significant difference between the various ones in this line.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a deal-breaker and is largely a non-issue, but I&#x27;ve received other products in the Clear line with the same bottle design that opened in transit, dumping a good bit of the product into the packaging.</li>
            <li>My hair still feels as soft as when I first used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product to anyone in need of a good conditioner, especially as it does work with the same line&#x27;s dandruff shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>because I did have a very slight reaction to the conditioner - some minor flakes - and the anti-dandruff shampoo leaves my hair so shiny, manageable and easy to comb out that I don&#x27;t really need a conditioner, but if you do I think you&#x27;ll be pleased with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;We have extremely hard water, so I was particularly interested in how this product worked under less than ideal circumstances.  </li>
            <li>You just press one side of the top and it opens up, press down</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed my waves are more pronounced because they aren&#x27;t dragging down from build up.</li>
            <li>I did, however, wait until I had washed my hair 4 times without becoming sensitive to the shampoo before I tried conditioning with the [[ASIN:B007RTR8UC CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Total Care</li>
            <li>stars, highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barb Caffrey</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Needless to say, I&#x27;m a lifer for Clear shampoo &amp; conditioner!!</li>
            <li>I think at this price, there is little value and you can find better.</li>
            <li>As long as you don&#x27;t mind the fragrance and it doesn&#x27;t open during shipping, you&#x27;ll be satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>Some shedding is normal for me when I wash my hair.</li>
            <li>normally if I find one that conditions</li>
            <li>I recommend this conditioner for people with normal hair.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and it makes my hair easy to brush.</li>
            <li>Like the other ones I&#x27;ve tried, this one is lightly scented and I would have to say that I like the scent.</li>
            <li>We have tried quite a few of the Clear hair products and this conditioner is one of the better ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE:  My teenage granddaughter spent most of the month of August with Grandma.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately what&#x27;s left behind after rinsing is just a hint of it, so that won&#x27;t be a problem for most.</li>
            <li>Alot more than my usual brands (Infusium23 or Redken).</li>
            <li>Again I expected to try it out for a week to really see the results, but I noticed some difference after the first day.  </li>
            <li>It was super soft and I didn&#x27;t notice that filmy feeling I have with other shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li>I gave the Clear scalp and Hair beauty conditioner a try</li>
            <li>I got both the shampoo and the condition Clear Scalp.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been using Clear s&amp;c for almost a year now.</li>
            <li>While the Clear Scalp  Hair Beauty does condition, it leaves my hair feeling greasy,</li>
            <li>this conditioner did not work as well for me as Clear Scalp&#x27;s conditioner designed for color-treated hair.  </li>
            <li>I found that this product added a slightly greasy feel to my hair and DID NOT leave me with a clean feeling as advertised.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels soft, but not oily either.  </li>
            <li>and they did a stupendous job on her hair, leaving it soft &amp; manageable while taming the frizzies.  </li>
            <li>It comes out like a paste, but it works into my hair with no trouble at all.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, so dryness/frizz is an issue and</li>
            <li>It rinsed out very well and still left my hair moisturized which I can appreciate.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair manageable and soft.</li>
            <li>Like the rest of the Clear products I have tried so far, scent is not its forte.  </li>
            <li>Cleans hair and scalp and leaves hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>if you scalp burns like fire for a good 20 minutes after getting out of the shower, it&#x27;s not a good thing!!!!!</li>
            <li>It has a very pleasant scent, I need only a tiny amount, even though I have very long and very thick hair, and it rinses out easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No mess.</li>
            <li>The cap on this particular bottle would not open all the way</li>
            <li>Knowing that each formula of a particular brand of shampoo will be different, I decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li>It spreads easily through my thick hair, and the scent is unoffensive.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really sure why, but it&#x27;s obvious that something about Strong Lengths made people take notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li>Perhaps that&#x27;s being a little picky, but you do have to make sure it&#x27;s closed properly</li>
            <li>The Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty Total Care Nourishing Conditioner is about what you&#x27;d expect...</li>
            <li>The Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty Total Care Nourishing Conditioner works, and works well.  </li>
            <li>This Clear \\&quot;Total Care</li>
            <li>B007JT7AIK CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]]</li>
            <li>My hair is definitely healthier for using Clear....</li>
            <li>B007JT7AIK CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]] and was utterly overjoyed to have my scalp problems almost completely disappear, literally overnight.  </li>
            <li>I hope that in the near future they release styling products to correspond with this hair care system.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s less waste this way.</li>
            <li>I go dry at the first hint of winter heat and dry means sore and uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>A little of this product goes a long way, which means it&#x27;s economical in its fashion . . .</li>
            <li>Her hair is much coarser than mine, naturally curly and definitely stressed - dyed, straightened, blow dried regularly.  </li>
            <li>I switched to another shampoo promising less strand loss, etc</li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t fall out as much (not sure if that is from my change of diet though or the shampoo), and my hair still feels soft.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use conditioner as the ones I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried many, usually leave my hair limp and greasy, and they take forever to rinse out.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair</li>
            <li>This conditioner is fine and I liked it, but the bottle is the worst design!</li>

            <li> . . . an excellent product and an excellent value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reviewed both the \\&quot;Clear\\&quot; shampoo and the \\&quot;Clear\\&quot; conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I like best, however, is the bottle.</li>
            <li> and it smells awesome as well.</li>
            <li> It smelled awesome, but that&#x27;s not what my mailbox is supposed to smell like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not convinced that it&#x27;s the best online purchase.</li>
            <li> I think this product is a very good conditioner.</li>
            <li> This was a happy accident.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-leaves hair feeling great and not &#x27;coated&#x27; with product after you rinse it out&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product is great, no complaints there.  </li>
            <li> However, I was still very impressed as this conditioner was as good as many salon brand conditioners at a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li> It has a pleasant scent that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> but it is pleasant.</li>
            <li> because this time, it wasn&#x27;t a good change!&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed to use alot to get good detangling and conditioning.</li>
            <li> This is a good all-purpose conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It smells good.  </li>
            <li> Great smell, it was okay</li>
            <li> For my very fine hair the product was successful but not pleasing.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27; ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried MANY in my 42 years!</li>
            <li> (I do wish they had more leave-in products!)</li>
            <li> It was a nice change.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with the Clear Shampoo and decided to try this product in conjunction with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with the Clear line of products.</li>
            <li> By far it is the best hair conditioner among all</li>
            <li> This is by far the best conditioner I have ever used.</li>
            <li> But after just three weeks using this product I have a fist full if hair after I shower!!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m always on the hunt for a new product that will be the latest and greatest</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this shampoo and the way it leaves my hair feeling.</li>
            <li> Amazon knows this, and takes some precautions (taping the cap on and wrapping the bottles in plastic bags), but it doesn&#x27;t make this the most shipment-friendly product in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m it sure it will stop eventually</li>
            <li> this product is ok</li>
            <li> I had to wonder why the opening is on the bottom instead of the top like the shampoo.</li>
            <li> The consistency of the conditioner is okay</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> My scalp does feel better.</li>
            <li> Without exception, we were more than pleased -- to the extent that we have already purchased more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to use cream rinse in forever and have a stash of used-it-once-but-never-again shampoo bottles practically the size of Mount Everest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Besides the end results, I love the scent; it reminds me of a tropical drink or island because of the coconut.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have tried several from the brand, and so far I like this one the best, although it still is not my ideal</li>
            <li> I end up using a leave in conditioner afterwards most times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think the most noticeable difference I have seen from this conditioner is the shine my hair has now.</li>
            <li> I am completely in love.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering more when I run out of the products I received from the Vine program.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite product atm since i always jump from products to product.</li>
            <li> a delight.&lt;br /&gt;Smells as refreshing as it feels</li>
            <li> --it helps get the most product out of the bottle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But after reading the reviews I cannot believe that there are so many people that are having this issue and these products remain on the market.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s very nice and does the job without leaving too much coating on the hair.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, and has a clean aroma.</li>
            <li> If this conditioner did just a tad more conditioning it would be a pretty good conditioner.</li>
            <li> I am very very surprised and happy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This has a light clean scent and leaves hair nicely manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , cool looking bottle (hey!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The bottles are also fairly easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to squeeze out the conditioner</li>
            <li> It rinses out easily, but once it&#x27;s out, it&#x27;s out -</li>
            <li> I was very pleased that it was super easy to comb out the tangles and after blow-drying my hair had a nice sheen to it and felt very soft.  </li>
            <li> It says nourishing daily conditioner for scalp and strong beautiful hair.</li>
            <li> and best of all, it doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down with repeated use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s fine for me or my wife.  </li>
            <li> The light, pleasant scent doesn&#x27;t rinse completely out, but also doesn&#x27;t clash with any of the perfumes I wear.</li>
            <li> This product goes well with the Clear Scalp&#x27;s line of dandruff shampoo (with pyrithione zinc), and has a pleasant, light scent.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After conditioning the conditioner rinsed out easily leaving my hair feeling clean, frizz free, and shiny.</li>
            <li> Love makes my curly hair frizz free and soft and amazing â™¡</li>
            <li> Left my hair smelling and feeling great.</li>
            <li> I threw the product away because I switched to cruelty free products.</li>
            <li> and it leaves your hair more soft and manageable than shampoo would on its own.</li>
            <li> As many of you who follow my reviews know, I&#x27;ve had the very devil of a time with hair products for more than five years now.  </li>
            <li> A light pleasing scent begins the experience, the bottle is shower friendly, and the conditioner is smooth and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is very nice and seems to last throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It have a nice smell, leaves my hair soft and easy to manage.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several of the Clear Scalp conditioners and they have all been very impressive.  </li>
            <li> After a week of use my hair never quite felt clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clean fragrance</li>
            <li> and I think Clear Scalp &amp; Hair is better than any salon stuff!</li>
            <li> I have gotten tons of compliments from my hair cutter saying that my hair is so soft and healthy!</li>
            <li> right?!)...</li>
            <li> The Clear Hair shampoo had a nice clean scent.</li>
            <li> My hair does seem to be better off for using it, and that&#x27;s the most important thing (especially some of its renewed strength).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, it is a good conditioner.</li>
            <li> Total Care is also a good conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It had a mild and unoffensive scent.</li>
            <li> The bottle is easy to hold and very easy to click open in the shower.  </li>
            <li> One opens from the top and the other from the bottom which is nice</li>
            <li> Good size bottle and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The open/close tab is large and moves easily.</li>
            <li> If you have normal hair, this would be a great daily conditioner for you.</li>
            <li> Although my hair continues to grow and look great, it hasn&#x27;t gotten the accolades that it did with the previous conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I had been using [[ASIN:B007RTR8UW CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Strong Lengths Nourishing Conditioner]], which got fabulous results.  </li>
            <li> , it is light and rinses out easily, but leaves my hair soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure that when I run out of this I will buy more, either here on Amazon or locally, because the price is right for the results I received.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t justify using so much at a time, even if it is a cheap brand.</li>
            <li> If you have fingernails of any kind, you will break them trying to squeeze the product out of this tiny hole that habitually clogs!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this conditioner, and it does make your hair feel soft after drying.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the better CLEAR conditioners.</li>
            <li> It would be better if it had a flip top or some other easier way to get it out.</li>
            <li> She absolutely LOVED this conditioner and the other two products she test</li>
            <li> It is just the right about of conditioning.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just the right size</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent too, but might be a little strong for some.</li>
            <li> I have straight, fine hair and using this conditioner daily keeps it healthy looking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad scent, but it is a very perfumey, \\&quot;cosmetic\\&quot; scent.</li>
            <li> It has a very pleasant and subtle floral scent which I like very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> conditioner is thick, like the kind you get when you buy the boxed hair dye (which I really love)</li>
            <li> CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Total Care Nourishing Conditioner makes my hair feel pretty good and not greasy.</li>
            <li> like this product very much and would suggest it to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I have long, very straight, very fine hair, and need conditioning without weight or buildup.</li>
            <li> When I first used this, the first thing I noticed was the scent - sunflower seeds.</li>
            <li> Checked the ingredients, sure enough - sunflower seed oil (as well as Aloe and others.)</li>
            <li> When I first used this product, I noticed a difference in how my hair felt.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner bottles look almost exactly alike,</li>
            <li> It made my hair soft, shiny and smooth</li>
            <li> It was noticably softer, it had more shine and it actually looked thicker than before...</li>
            <li> Again, my lovely hubs asked what I was doing differently...</li>
            <li> After a friend recommended it to me, I am not sorry I bought this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Its very thick and smells great yet light enough to not compete with the light perfume I wear on occasion.</li>
            <li> all, the Clear Total Care Nourishing Conditioner is a good product at a decent price.</li>
            <li> Nourishing Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce]], which left my hair lovely and smooth.  </li>
            <li> and this is 3 to 4 times the price of other conditioners I have used with much greater success.</li>
            <li> I have normal hair, and rarely use conditioner.</li>
            <li> The conditioner worked exceptionally well, to the extent that with regular shampooing, we found that the conditioner was only needed every couple of days or so.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a shame, because the bottle is designed to rest upside down (which is normally a nice feature for a product like this</li>
            <li> Because Strong Lengths gave me stronger applause, I&#x27;ll give Total Care 4 1/2 stars.</li>
            <li> I have fine, very short hair with growing out highlights.  </li>
            <li> I bought the little tester bottles and now I have an inexpensive product that moisturizes well, gives shine and smells amazing</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li> My scalp is very itchy as well.</li>
            <li> but how much hair will I lose in the meantime?</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner and will continue to use them both.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for damaged hair!</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t squeeze out too much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-very gentle scent...doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling like you just had a shower</li>
            <li> than the fact that people don&#x27;t compliment my hair as much as they used to, I would have given this product five stars.  </li>
            <li> is a message your scalp while cleansing product that feel luxurious yet is really very beneficial.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> I realize that packaging and shipping shouldn&#x27;t really be part of the product review, but I have to point out that this product really didn&#x27;t ship well.  </li>
            <li> but my hair appeared to be more damaged (I also have naturally wavy hair, so I used the blow dryer and straightener or curling iron on a daily basis) and it also appeared that my hair stopped growing for those 6 weeks that I switched.</li>
            <li> Hard is full and soft, love it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I like this line of conditioners I have to say that there does not seem to be a significant difference between the various ones in this line.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a deal-breaker and is largely a non-issue, but I&#x27;ve received other products in the Clear line with the same bottle design that opened in transit, dumping a good bit of the product into the packaging.</li>
            <li> My hair still feels as soft as when I first used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product to anyone in need of a good conditioner, especially as it does work with the same line&#x27;s dandruff shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> because I did have a very slight reaction to the conditioner - some minor flakes - and the anti-dandruff shampoo leaves my hair so shiny, manageable and easy to comb out that I don&#x27;t really need a conditioner, but if you do I think you&#x27;ll be pleased with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;We have extremely hard water, so I was particularly interested in how this product worked under less than ideal circumstances.  </li>
            <li> You just press one side of the top and it opens up, press down</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my waves are more pronounced because they aren&#x27;t dragging down from build up.</li>
            <li> I did, however, wait until I had washed my hair 4 times without becoming sensitive to the shampoo before I tried conditioning with the [[ASIN:B007RTR8UC CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Total Care</li>
            <li> stars, highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barb Caffrey</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Needless to say, I&#x27;m a lifer for Clear shampoo &amp; conditioner!!</li>
            <li> I think at this price, there is little value and you can find better.</li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t mind the fragrance and it doesn&#x27;t open during shipping, you&#x27;ll be satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Some shedding is normal for me when I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> normally if I find one that conditions</li>
            <li> I recommend this conditioner for people with normal hair.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and it makes my hair easy to brush.</li>
            <li> Like the other ones I&#x27;ve tried, this one is lightly scented and I would have to say that I like the scent.</li>
            <li> We have tried quite a few of the Clear hair products and this conditioner is one of the better ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE:  My teenage granddaughter spent most of the month of August with Grandma.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately what&#x27;s left behind after rinsing is just a hint of it, so that won&#x27;t be a problem for most.</li>
            <li> Alot more than my usual brands (Infusium23 or Redken).</li>
            <li> Again I expected to try it out for a week to really see the results, but I noticed some difference after the first day.  </li>
            <li> It was super soft and I didn&#x27;t notice that filmy feeling I have with other shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> I gave the Clear scalp and Hair beauty conditioner a try</li>
            <li> I got both the shampoo and the condition Clear Scalp.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using Clear s&amp;c for almost a year now.</li>
            <li> While the Clear Scalp  Hair Beauty does condition, it leaves my hair feeling greasy,</li>
            <li> this conditioner did not work as well for me as Clear Scalp&#x27;s conditioner designed for color-treated hair.  </li>
            <li> I found that this product added a slightly greasy feel to my hair and DID NOT leave me with a clean feeling as advertised.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels soft, but not oily either.  </li>
            <li> and they did a stupendous job on her hair, leaving it soft &amp; manageable while taming the frizzies.  </li>
            <li> It comes out like a paste, but it works into my hair with no trouble at all.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, so dryness/frizz is an issue and</li>
            <li> It rinsed out very well and still left my hair moisturized which I can appreciate.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair manageable and soft.</li>
            <li> Like the rest of the Clear products I have tried so far, scent is not its forte.  </li>
            <li> Cleans hair and scalp and leaves hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> if you scalp burns like fire for a good 20 minutes after getting out of the shower, it&#x27;s not a good thing!!!!!</li>
            <li> It has a very pleasant scent, I need only a tiny amount, even though I have very long and very thick hair, and it rinses out easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No mess.</li>
            <li> The cap on this particular bottle would not open all the way</li>
            <li> Knowing that each formula of a particular brand of shampoo will be different, I decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> It spreads easily through my thick hair, and the scent is unoffensive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure why, but it&#x27;s obvious that something about Strong Lengths made people take notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> Perhaps that&#x27;s being a little picky, but you do have to make sure it&#x27;s closed properly</li>
            <li> The Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty Total Care Nourishing Conditioner is about what you&#x27;d expect...</li>
            <li> The Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty Total Care Nourishing Conditioner works, and works well.  </li>
            <li> This Clear \\&quot;Total Care</li>
            <li> B007JT7AIK CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]]</li>
            <li> My hair is definitely healthier for using Clear....</li>
            <li> B007JT7AIK CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]] and was utterly overjoyed to have my scalp problems almost completely disappear, literally overnight.  </li>
            <li> I hope that in the near future they release styling products to correspond with this hair care system.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s less waste this way.</li>
            <li> I go dry at the first hint of winter heat and dry means sore and uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> A little of this product goes a long way, which means it&#x27;s economical in its fashion . . .</li>
            <li> Her hair is much coarser than mine, naturally curly and definitely stressed - dyed, straightened, blow dried regularly.  </li>
            <li> I switched to another shampoo promising less strand loss, etc</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t fall out as much (not sure if that is from my change of diet though or the shampoo), and my hair still feels soft.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use conditioner as the ones I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried many, usually leave my hair limp and greasy, and they take forever to rinse out.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair</li>
            <li> This conditioner is fine and I liked it, but the bottle is the worst design!</li>
            <li> /&gt;While other people have said \\&quot;A little goes a long way\\&quot;- that&#x27;s somewhat true.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product and does the job as well as other more expensive brands (and a handful of less expensive ones).</li>
            <li> My hair feels silky and soft after using it, both wet and dry.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner left my hair a bit snarled, but when it dried, it was very soft.  </li>
            <li> and it really doesn&#x27;t even feel like there is any conditioner on it after a rinse off which with every other conditioner the hair at least feels soft and tangle free.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I found that my hair was a bit harder to comb out following my shower as if my hair wasn&#x27;t quite moisturized enough.</li>
            <li> The Total Care nourishing conditioner left my hair soft with only a few tangles and it did not weigh my hair down at all.  </li>
            <li> I previously tried [[ASIN:B007RTR8TS CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Damage &amp; Color Repair Nourishing Conditioner]] since I routinely color and blow dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> far as the packaging, this gets the same complaint as every other product in the Clear line, and that&#x27;s the cap being on the bottom of the container.</li>
            <li> Standing upside down in the shower, the cap seeps the liquid out, just a bit, but no other brand does this</li>
            <li> I honestly never thought in a million years that this stuff would really work well.</li>
            <li> Blow drying my hair after use does not diminish the effects of the conditioner and even in this dry, cold weather, I do not have static or fly-away hair.</li>
            <li> Several other members of my family tried these products as well.  </li>
            <li> My hair falls about 8\\&quot; below my shoulders, so I have used this conditioner in the same manner as other brands.</li>
            <li> I have problems with itchy scalp, hair loss, and dry hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using shampoos and conditioners from everything from Lazartigue to Kiehls and always had a problem with a dry, itchy scalp and dandruff.</li>
            <li> and this winter was not a nightmare with the dry hair and dry beanie</li>
            <li> there is the usual problem with the Clear line.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this product at all as the last thing I want to use is a product that makes my hair feel LESS clean...</li>
            <li> You might think it&#x27;s not a big deal to squeeze the container, but the plastic is on the harder side and with wet hands, I find myself struggling especially once the contents get a little lower.</li>
            <li> I am asian with blabk average thickness , shoulder length hair that tends to become frizzy, wiry and unmanageable a few hours after I shampoo and condition, even if I put an after shampoo treatment ... 2 weeks ago I went to a local pharmacy chain and saw a small bottle of CLEAR conditioner selling for $1.99.</li>
            <li> It was sealed in a plastic bag (taped shut) and wrapped tightly in a cardboard mailer similar to the mailers for a paperback book.  </li>
            <li> conditioner leaves my hair feeling very soft and touchable even when it&#x27;s been exposed to being out in the cold which can be very drying.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair silky and you only need to use a little so it lasts a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several; different varieties of the Care shampoo and also conditioner products and this is the one that works the least.</li>
            <li> Obviously it&#x27;s not necessarily important, but definitely a bonus.</li>
            <li> For a few simple reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As expected for a conditioner, it helps reduce tangles and keeps my scalp from drying out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> (Garnier Fructus, Pert, or some other green bottled generic equivalent).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after trying this product I&#x27;m going to have to rethink my time honored strategy.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or dry it out after 12 hours as some conditioners have.</li>
            <li> plus is that a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> little palm of product will go a long way</li>
            <li> As with a lot of other reviewees, I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of other products... from philip kingsley to pantene....</li>
            <li> the other with the opening pops up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male, which means I usually just grab the cheapest conditioner on the shelf</li>
            <li> Furthermore, the product is extremely concentrated -- a little goes a very long way, increasing the value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair or leave it limp, which is a bonus for me.  </li>
            <li> I do use less of it than other conditioners, but still go through conditioner faster than shampoo.</li>
            <li> The opening is one of those see saw type things in which you press down on one side and</li>
            <li> This opening is at the bottom of the bottle, so as it sits in the shower, all the conditioner is moving down to be used.</li>
            <li> well, it also weighs my hair down, but this did not.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or leave it feeling coated or with any residue or buildup.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> Since I started using it, my hair sheds so much less.</li>
            <li> I have used several different products from this company and have never had a problem with the actual dispensing, so maybe I got a bad one.</li>
            <li> A very small amount of the product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few of the \\&quot;Clear\\&quot; brand conditioners.</li>
            <li> I have very coarse, thin hair (almost seems like a contridiction,</li>
            <li> hair isn&#x27;t awfully dry or damaged, but can feel a bit worse at times depending what styling products I have used.</li>
            <li> It was heavier (but not greasy) and a little dull.</li>
            <li> This conditioner has very little scent, which I like a lot.  </li>
            <li> I used to find dozens of hairs stuck to my shirts, or circling the drain after washing my hair, now I find very few in either instance.</li>
            <li> the record, I have hair that goes past my shoulders and is thick and wavy.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even hardly detect any perfume in this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> and it was hard to squeee out.</li>
            <li> So hard to dispense.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for at least a year, and I won&#x27;t use anything else.  </li>
            <li> My sister purchased this product for colored hair and complained of build up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick, rich-looking conditioner, and if I have one complaint, it&#x27;s that the scent can be a bit overpowering when it&#x27;s on your hair.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is thick.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes well without being too thick or greasy.  </li>
            <li> It is very hard to rinse of.</li>
            <li> Very hard to squeeze.</li>
            <li> (hey, I have thin hair - I can&#x27;t afford to lose</li>
            <li> and I just didnt connect the dots that this shampoo and conditioner was making it worse.</li>
            <li> I was using the expensive salon products before this</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t see any improvements after a week of use and gave up.</li>
            <li> this time I&#x27;m very disappointed because the shampoo I received is NOT original.</li>
            <li> Not that it&#x27;s bad</li>
            <li> However, getting it out of the bottle is very difficult!  </li>
            <li> My hair has come out of the shower horribly knotted</li>
            <li> The container design is awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love makes my curly hair frizz free and soft and amazing â™¡</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner!  I have been using it for at least a year, and I won&#x27;t use anything else.  I was using the expensive salon products before this and I think Clear Scalp &amp; Hair is better than any salon stuff!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this shampoo and the way it leaves my hair feeling. I have gotten tons of compliments from my hair cutter saying that my hair is so soft and healthy!</li>
            <li> Great smell, it was okay</li>
            <li> The Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty Total Care Nourishing Conditioner is about what you&#x27;d expect...it&#x27;s conditioner and it leaves your hair more soft and manageable than shampoo would on its own. It&#x27;s a good product and does the job as well as other more expensive brands (and a handful of less expensive ones). It&#x27;s a thick, rich-looking conditioner, and if I have one complaint, it&#x27;s that the scent can be a bit overpowering when it&#x27;s on your hair. It&#x27;s not a bad scent, but it is a very perfumey, \\&quot;cosmetic\\&quot; scent. Fortunately what&#x27;s left behind after rinsing is just a hint of it, so that won&#x27;t be a problem for most. My hair does seem to be better off for using it, and that&#x27;s the most important thing (especially some of its renewed strength).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the packaging, this gets the same complaint as every other product in the Clear line, and that&#x27;s the cap being on the bottom of the container. It&#x27;s not a deal-breaker and is largely a non-issue, but I&#x27;ve received other products in the Clear line with the same bottle design that opened in transit, dumping a good bit of the product into the packaging. Amazon knows this, and takes some precautions (taping the cap on and wrapping the bottles in plastic bags), but it doesn&#x27;t make this the most shipment-friendly product in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, the Clear Total Care Nourishing Conditioner is a good product at a decent price. As long as you don&#x27;t mind the fragrance and it doesn&#x27;t open during shipping, you&#x27;ll be satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I reviewed the Shampoo in this line, so I thought I might as well say something about the Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner is thick, like the kind you get when you buy the boxed hair dye (which I really love) I have tried it ALL, Garnier (the entire line), Pantene, Sauve...and finally this came to the market, so I thought, \\&quot;Why not?\\&quot; FINALLY! I really like this stuff.  I bought the little tester bottles and now I have an inexpensive product that moisturizes well, gives shine and smells amazing (the scent lasts into the next day).  I just hope they don&#x27;t change the formula!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is fine and I liked it, but the bottle is the worst design! If you have fingernails of any kind, you will break them trying to squeeze the product out of this tiny hole that habitually clogs! I won&#x27;t be buying this again unless the bottle is improved. You might think it&#x27;s not a big deal to squeeze the container, but the plastic is on the harder side and with wet hands, I find myself struggling especially once the contents get a little lower. Please ask anyone with fingernails of any length to try to get this conditioner out without difficulty!</li>
            <li> Works well for my daughters.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this conditioner, and it does make your hair feel soft after drying.  However, I found that my hair was a bit harder to comb out following my shower as if my hair wasn&#x27;t quite moisturized enough.</li>
            <li> The combination of this shampoo and conditioner has caused my hair to fall out. Some shedding is normal for me when I wash my hair. But after just three weeks using this product I have a fist full if hair after I shower!! It continues to fall out all day. My scalp is very itchy as well. I stopped using it last week and it&#x27;s still falling out. I&#x27;m it sure it will stop eventually but how much hair will I lose in the meantime? DON&#x27;T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li> this product is ok but i&#x27;m at a point where i&#x27;m working on rehydrating my hair. after using this product (after using salon products) just didn&#x27;t show any improvement in my hair. i switched back to my salon products and am happier</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with the Clear Shampoo and decided to try this product in conjunction with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very nice and does the job without leaving too much coating on the hair. It has a pleasant scent that is not overpowering. My only problem is with the container. I had to wonder why the opening is on the bottom instead of the top like the shampoo. Perhaps that&#x27;s being a little picky, but you do have to make sure it&#x27;s closed properly so it doesn&#x27;t leak out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few of the \\&quot;Clear\\&quot; brand conditioners. Like the other ones I&#x27;ve tried, this one is lightly scented and I would have to say that I like the scent. I&#x27;m not sure exactly what the scent is but it is pleasant. The consistency of the conditioner is okay but I prefer thicker conditioners. It rinses out well enough and leaves my hair soft.&lt;br /&gt;I like that the spout is on the bottom because this helps the conditioner settle and makes it easier to get the last bit of conditioner out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;While I like this line of conditioners I have to say that there does not seem to be a significant difference between the various ones in this line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with the Clear line of products. They&#x27;ve performed as well as pricier brands and work well for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner leaves my hair feeling very soft and touchable even when it&#x27;s been exposed to being out in the cold which can be very drying. I have long, very straight, very fine hair, and need conditioning without weight or buildup. This works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While other people have said \\&quot;A little goes a long way\\&quot;- that&#x27;s somewhat true. I do use less of it than other conditioners, but still go through conditioner faster than shampoo. The light, pleasant scent doesn&#x27;t rinse completely out, but also doesn&#x27;t clash with any of the perfumes I wear.</li>
            <li> accidentally clicked on the conditioner when I meant to buy shampoo. I don&#x27;t use conditioner as the ones I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried many, usually leave my hair limp and greasy, and they take forever to rinse out. This was a happy accident. I gave the Clear scalp and Hair beauty conditioner a try and I love it. A light pleasing scent begins the experience, the bottle is shower friendly, and the conditioner is smooth and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After conditioning the conditioner rinsed out easily leaving my hair feeling clean, frizz free, and shiny. I am a convert and will be using this conditioner from now on! Love it.</li>
            <li> When I first used this, the first thing I noticed was the scent - sunflower seeds. Checked the ingredients, sure enough - sunflower seed oil (as well as Aloe and others.) Left my hair smelling and feeling great. What else could I ask for?</li>
            <li> I got both the shampoo and the condition Clear Scalp. I have problems with itchy scalp, hair loss, and dry hair. When I first used this product, I noticed a difference in how my hair felt. It was super soft and I didn&#x27;t notice that filmy feeling I have with other shampoos and conditioners. It was a nice change. A month later, I am still using both products. My scalp does feel better. My hair doesn&#x27;t fall out as much (not sure if that is from my change of diet though or the shampoo), and my hair still feels soft. My sister purchased this product for colored hair and complained of build up. I have not noticed this. My hair still feels as soft as when I first used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottles are also fairly easy to use. One opens from the top and the other from the bottom which is nice otherwise you can get the bottles mixed up (which on is the conditioner and which one is the shampoo). You just press one side of the top and it opens up, press down and it snaps back in place. No mess. The shampoo and conditioner bottles look almost exactly alike, but like I said, they open differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record, I have hair that goes past my shoulders and is thick and wavy. I&#x27;ve noticed my waves are more pronounced because they aren&#x27;t dragging down from build up. I really like this conditioner and will continue to use them both.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair silky and you only need to use a little so it lasts a while. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This conditioner has very little scent, which I like a lot.  I can&#x27;t stand smelling perfume after a minute or so.  I couldn&#x27;t even hardly detect any perfume in this conditioner.  I applied to my hair after shampooing and worked it thoroughly in my hair.  I rinsed it out a couple of minutes later. I was very pleased that it was super easy to comb out the tangles and after blow-drying my hair had a nice sheen to it and felt very soft.  I think this product is a very good conditioner.</li>
            <li> The Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty Total Care Nourishing Conditioner works, and works well.  This product goes well with the Clear Scalp&#x27;s line of dandruff shampoo (with pyrithione zinc), and has a pleasant, light scent.  A little of this product goes a long way, which means it&#x27;s economical in its fashion . . . and best of all, it doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down with repeated use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product to anyone in need of a good conditioner, especially as it does work with the same line&#x27;s dandruff shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five stars, highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barb Caffrey</li>
            <li> . . . an excellent product and an excellent value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reviewed both the \\&quot;Clear\\&quot; shampoo and the \\&quot;Clear\\&quot; conditioner.  Several other members of my family tried these products as well.  Without exception, we were more than pleased -- to the extent that we have already purchased more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have extremely hard water, so I was particularly interested in how this product worked under less than ideal circumstances.  The conditioner worked exceptionally well, to the extent that with regular shampooing, we found that the conditioner was only needed every couple of days or so.  Furthermore, the product is extremely concentrated -- a little goes a very long way, increasing the value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product will become a staple in our household.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> As with a lot of other reviewees, I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of other products... from philip kingsley to pantene.... I am asian with blabk average thickness , shoulder length hair that tends to become frizzy, wiry and unmanageable a few hours after I shampoo and condition, even if I put an after shampoo treatment ... 2 weeks ago I went to a local pharmacy chain and saw a small bottle of CLEAR conditioner selling for $1.99. I bought one and have been using it DAILY eversince. By far it is the best hair conditioner among all I&#x27; ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried MANY in my 42 years! It made my hair soft, shiny and smooth I am very very surprised and happy. I use it together with Fructis shampoo for color treated hair and somehow the combination worked soo well on my hair. ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> This Clear \\&quot;Total Care Conditioner\\&quot; works well on my daughter&#x27;s hair. We have tried quite a few of the Clear hair products and this conditioner is one of the better ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has a light clean scent and leaves hair nicely manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH</li>
            <li> I have very coarse, thin hair (almost seems like a contridiction, right?!)...and I&#x27;ve been using Clear s&amp;c for almost a year now. About a month into using it, my husband literally asked what I was doing differently. It was noticably softer, it had more shine and it actually looked thicker than before...I switched to another shampoo promising less strand loss, etc (hey, I have thin hair - I can&#x27;t afford to lose any!)...but my hair appeared to be more damaged (I also have naturally wavy hair, so I used the blow dryer and straightener or curling iron on a daily basis) and it also appeared that my hair stopped growing for those 6 weeks that I switched. Again, my lovely hubs asked what I was doing differently...because this time, it wasn&#x27;t a good change!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I&#x27;m a lifer for Clear shampoo &amp; conditioner!! (I do wish they had more leave-in products!)</li>
            <li> I use this conditioner with the matching shampoo daily.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair or leave it limp, which is a bonus for me.  My hair feels soft, but not oily either.  It is just the right about of conditioning.</li>
            <li> While the Clear Scalp  Hair Beauty does condition, it leaves my hair feeling greasy, like there is a bit of film over it. I don&#x27;t like that feeling. It is very hard to rinse of. It smells nice, and has a clean aroma. The cap on this particular bottle would not open all the way and it was hard to squeee out. I have used several different products from this company and have never had a problem with the actual dispensing, so maybe I got a bad one. My wife tried this product and also did not like it for the same reasons. I think at this price, there is little value and you can find better.</li>
            <li> As many of you who follow my reviews know, I&#x27;ve had the very devil of a time with hair products for more than five years now.  I haven&#x27;t been able to use cream rinse in forever and have a stash of used-it-once-but-never-again shampoo bottles practically the size of Mount Everest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 10 days ago I started using [[ASIN:B007JT7AIK CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]] and was utterly overjoyed to have my scalp problems almost completely disappear, literally overnight.  I did, however, wait until I had washed my hair 4 times without becoming sensitive to the shampoo before I tried conditioning with the [[ASIN:B007RTR8UC CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Total Care Nourishing Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce]], which left my hair lovely and smooth.  It has a very pleasant scent, I need only a tiny amount, even though I have very long and very thick hair, and it rinses out easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m back to using just the [[ASIN:B007JT7AIK CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]] because I did have a very slight reaction to the conditioner - some minor flakes - and the anti-dandruff shampoo leaves my hair so shiny, manageable and easy to comb out that I don&#x27;t really need a conditioner, but if you do I think you&#x27;ll be pleased with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  My teenage granddaughter spent most of the month of August with Grandma.  Her hair is much coarser than mine, naturally curly and definitely stressed - dyed, straightened, blow dried regularly.  She absolutely LOVED this conditioner and the other two products she test drove for me and they did a stupendous job on her hair, leaving it soft &amp; manageable while taming the frizzies.  Highly recommended for damaged hair!</li>
            <li> This Total Care conditioner works well for my hair. I have straight, fine hair and using this conditioner daily keeps it healthy looking. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and it makes my hair easy to brush. The conditioner is thick. It comes out like a paste, but it works into my hair with no trouble at all. It has a very pleasant and subtle floral scent which I like very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like best, however, is the bottle. The opening is one of those see saw type things in which you press down on one side and the other with the opening pops up. It&#x27;s easy to squeeze out the conditioner and it&#x27;s just the right size so you don&#x27;t squeeze out too much. This opening is at the bottom of the bottle, so as it sits in the shower, all the conditioner is moving down to be used. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s less waste this way. And the bottom of the container is the biggest, so no worries about it tipping over because it&#x27;s top-heavy. Overall, it&#x27;s a convenient conditioner that works well for my hair.</li>
            <li> I previously tried [[ASIN:B007RTR8TS CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Damage &amp; Color Repair Nourishing Conditioner]] since I routinely color and blow dry my hair.  Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t see any improvements after a week of use and gave up. Knowing that each formula of a particular brand of shampoo will be different, I decided to give this a try. Again I expected to try it out for a week to really see the results, but I noticed some difference after the first day.  I have naturally curly hair, so dryness/frizz is an issue and normally if I find one that conditions well, it also weighs my hair down, but this did not. It rinsed out very well and still left my hair moisturized which I can appreciate. Besides the end results, I love the scent; it reminds me of a tropical drink or island because of the coconut. Obviously it&#x27;s not necessarily important, but definitely a bonus. I&#x27;m pretty sure that when I run out of this I will buy more, either here on Amazon or locally, because the price is right for the results I received.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. Doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or dry it out after 12 hours as some conditioners have. Its very thick and smells great yet light enough to not compete with the light perfume I wear on occasion.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better CLEAR conditioners. I have tried several from the brand, and so far I like this one the best, although it still is not my ideal conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed to use alot to get good detangling and conditioning. Alot more than my usual brands (Infusium23 or Redken). The smell is very nice and seems to last throughout the day. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or leave it feeling coated or with any residue or buildup. It rinses out easily, but once it&#x27;s out, it&#x27;s out - I end up using a leave in conditioner afterwards most times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair isn&#x27;t awfully dry or damaged, but can feel a bit worse at times depending what styling products I have used. If this conditioner did just a tad more conditioning it would be a pretty good conditioner. I just can&#x27;t justify using so much at a time, even if it is a cheap brand.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best conditioner I have ever used. It outshines ever much, much more expensive brands. It leaves my hair manageable and soft. I think the most noticeable difference I have seen from this conditioner is the shine my hair has now. I am almost thru my second bottle and have been using it for about 2 months. I am completely in love. I hope that in the near future they release styling products to correspond with this hair care system.</li>
            <li> I have normal hair, and rarely use conditioner. Sometimes they tend to make my hair feel greasy. CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Total Care Nourishing Conditioner makes my hair feel pretty good and not greasy. It also doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. It has a nice scent too, but might be a little strong for some. Overall, it is a good conditioner.</li>
            <li> I honestly never thought in a million years that this stuff would really work well. I&#x27;ve been using shampoos and conditioners from everything from Lazartigue to Kiehls and always had a problem with a dry, itchy scalp and dandruff. After a month or so of using this shampoo and conditioner I don&#x27;t have a problem. I&#x27;m ordering more when I run out of the products I received from the Vine program.</li>
            <li> This conditioner left my hair a bit snarled, but when it dried, it was very soft.  I have fine, very short hair with growing out highlights.  I threw the product away because I switched to cruelty free products.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite product atm since i always jump from products to product. been stocking up on this brand so it should last me a while.</li>
            <li> Hard is full and soft, love it!</li>
            <li> After a friend recommended it to me, I am not sorry I bought this conditioner.  I could not find it anywhere else, so I got it on Amazon where everything can be found.  This is a great product.  It have a nice smell, leaves my hair soft and easy to manage.  A plus is that a little goes a long way.  My visiting daughter used it and asked me where she could buy it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several; different varieties of the Care shampoo and also conditioner products and this is the one that works the least. It says nourishing daily conditioner for scalp and strong beautiful hair. My hair falls about 8\\&quot; below my shoulders, so I have used this conditioner in the same manner as other brands. My hair has come out of the shower horribly knotted and it really doesn&#x27;t even feel like there is any conditioner on it after a rinse off which with every other conditioner the hair at least feels soft and tangle free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there is the usual problem with the Clear line. Standing upside down in the shower, the cap seeps the liquid out, just a bit, but no other brand does this and this is 3 to 4 times the price of other conditioners I have used with much greater success.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male, which means I usually just grab the cheapest conditioner on the shelf (Garnier Fructus, Pert, or some other green bottled generic equivalent).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after trying this product I&#x27;m going to have to rethink my time honored strategy. For a few simple reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-very gentle scent...doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling like you just had a shower&lt;br /&gt;-a little palm of product will go a long way&lt;br /&gt;-leaves hair feeling great and not &#x27;coated&#x27; with product after you rinse it out&lt;br /&gt;-sleek, cool looking bottle (hey!  I&#x27;m a marketing guy...I&#x27;m seduced by such things)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try.</li>
            <li> I have tried several of the Clear Scalp conditioners and they have all been very impressive.  The Total Care nourishing conditioner left my hair soft with only a few tangles and it did not weigh my hair down at all.  I recommend this conditioner for people with normal hair.  I have damaged color-treated hair and this conditioner did not work as well for me as Clear Scalp&#x27;s conditioner designed for color-treated hair.  However, I was still very impressed as this conditioner was as good as many salon brand conditioners at a fraction of the price.  If you have normal hair, this would be a great daily conditioner for you.</li>
            <li> I had been using [[ASIN:B007RTR8UW CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Strong Lengths Nourishing Conditioner]], which got fabulous results.  Total Care is also a good conditioner.  Like the rest of the Clear products I have tried so far, scent is not its forte.  Not that it&#x27;s bad, it&#x27;s just not memorable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I look for is shiny, silky hair that doesn&#x27;t break.  Although my hair continues to grow and look great, it hasn&#x27;t gotten the accolades that it did with the previous conditioner.  I&#x27;m not really sure why, but it&#x27;s obvious that something about Strong Lengths made people take notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the fact that people don&#x27;t compliment my hair as much as they used to, I would have given this product five stars.  Because Strong Lengths gave me stronger applause, I&#x27;ll give Total Care 4 1/2 stars.</li>
            <li> I found that this product added a slightly greasy feel to my hair and DID NOT leave me with a clean feeling as advertised.  Not impressed with this product at all as the last thing I want to use is a product that makes my hair feel LESS clean...</li>
            <li> I go dry at the first hint of winter heat and dry means sore and uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;This is a message your scalp while cleansing product that feel luxurious yet is really very beneficial.&lt;br /&gt;What a delight.&lt;br /&gt;Smells as refreshing as it feels and this winter was not a nightmare with the dry hair and dry beanie top(scalp)&lt;br /&gt;I like this product very much and would suggest it to friends and family.</li>
            <li> This is a good all-purpose conditioner.  It moisturizes well without being too thick or greasy.  It spreads easily through my thick hair, and the scent is unoffensive.  My hair feels silky and soft after using it, both wet and dry.  I would definitely buy this conditioner again.  The bottle is easy to hold and very easy to click open in the shower.  The open/close tab is large and moves easily.</li>
            <li> I have been using this conditioner for about 2 months now. Before I started using it I had alot of shedding. Since I started using it, my hair sheds so much less. I used to find dozens of hairs stuck to my shirts, or circling the drain after washing my hair, now I find very few in either instance. My hair is definitely healthier for using Clear....and it smells awesome as well.</li>
            <li> I found this product worked as advertised. It had a mild and unoffensive scent. A very small amount of the product goes a long way. While I noticed a reduction in breakage, I wouldn&#x27;t use this product again. After a week of use my hair never quite felt clean. It was heavier (but not greasy) and a little dull. I felt like I had product in my hair even though I no longer use any type of mousse or pomade. For my very fine hair the product was successful but not pleasing.</li>
            <li> The product is great, no complaints there.  However, getting it out of the bottle is very difficult!  It would be better if it had a flip top or some other easier way to get it out.</li>
            <li> I like the conditioner, it is light and rinses out easily, but leaves my hair soft and silky.  Blow drying my hair after use does not diminish the effects of the conditioner and even in this dry, cold weather, I do not have static or fly-away hair.</li>
            <li> I realize that packaging and shipping shouldn&#x27;t really be part of the product review, but I have to point out that this product really didn&#x27;t ship well.  It was sealed in a plastic bag (taped shut) and wrapped tightly in a cardboard mailer similar to the mailers for a paperback book.  The result was a disaster.  I could smell the fragrance when I opened my mailbox.  It smelled awesome, but that&#x27;s not what my mailbox is supposed to smell like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the package, it was a big yucky bag of goo.  A lot of the product had seeped out into the plastic bag.  I washed it off, but the lid and cap had also been damaged, so it leeks if I just squeeze the bottle.  That&#x27;s a shame, because the bottle is designed to rest upside down (which is normally a nice feature for a product like this--it helps get the most product out of the bottle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what about the product itself?  It smells good.  It&#x27;s a clean fragrance that&#x27;s fine for me or my wife.  As expected for a conditioner, it helps reduce tangles and keeps my scalp from drying out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this conditioner, but I&#x27;m not convinced that it&#x27;s the best online purchase.</li>
            <li> The Clear Hair shampoo had a nice clean scent. Cleans hair and scalp and leaves hair soft and shiny. Doesn&#x27;t seem to strip hair of all the oils and doesn&#x27;t leave hair like straw. Good size bottle and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have been a client of Amazon for several years, never had a complain before but this time I&#x27;m very disappointed because the shampoo I received is NOT original. I&#x27;m accustomed to this shampoo and only use it once and my scalp is red and inching.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The container design is awful. So hard to dispense. Very hard to squeeze. I wind up dropping it while trying to despense enough conditioner.</li>
            <li> I feel compelled to write a review on this product because of the damage it has done to my hair. I have fine, thin hair and I&#x27;m always on the hunt for a new product that will be the latest and greatest, this is not it!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE TAKE CAUTION THIS PRODUCT CAN MAKE YOUR HAIR FALL OUT AND IRRITATE YOUR SCALP&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have issues with hair breakage to begin with and I just didnt connect the dots that this shampoo and conditioner was making it worse. But after reading the reviews I cannot believe that there are so many people that are having this issue and these products remain on the market. FYI... if you scalp burns like fire for a good 20 minutes after getting out of the shower, it&#x27;s not a good thing!!!!!</li>
