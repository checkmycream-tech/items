            <li>Truly impressed.</li>
            <li>Best Hair Gel</li>
            <li>I Have Ever Used, Very Happy.</li>
            <li>I also bought them at an incredible price.</li>
            <li>Great hair gel.  </li>
            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>Works great.  </li>
            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>This latest purchase had the best packaging.</li>
            <li>My favorite Gel at a great price... delivered!</li>
            <li>The box was in good shape, but bottle was cracked across the bottom.</li>
            <li>It work s really good</li>
            <li>And absolutely amazing shipping time.</li>
            <li>wise, but this thing is so huge that it&#x27;ll take forever to run out.</li>
            <li>I used to use KMS, but I like the smell of this more than the Cranberry Pomegranate that KMS switched to...</li>
            <li>The top didn&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li>I debated on buying the 2 pack as it was a better deal per oz.</li>
            <li>may be a fine product</li>
            <li>Since then I have been a loyal customer!</li>
            <li>the bottle probably had a secure ride.</li>
            <li>fantastic price.</li>
            <li>Great wet look hold all day.</li>
            <li>There was plastic wrap around the top, in a bag and next to a balloon-bag.</li>
            <li>but you should be aware that you may not get an intact bottle.</li>
            <li>More than likely not purchase this particular product again as it did not meet my expectations.</li>
            <li>Really cranberry pomegranate for a MENS hair gel.</li>
            <li>The only suggestion i would make to Woody is to offer a fragrance free option - although the fragrance is not offensive and smells like a shower gel application, it does conflict with the much-liked aroma of cologne which women prefer.</li>
            <li>As a hair gel this is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used as just a little bit will hold even big and/or hair in place for a long time.</li>
            <li>I expected this gel to be a strong hold gel hence the name &amp;#34;mega&amp;#34; but not the case.</li>
            <li>(Sounds funny, but I have gotten broken top and leaked bottles.)&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li>the firm hold much better</li>
            <li>There is no going back, nothing comes close to the clean natural hold it provides the entire day.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t feel like sending it back, since I am doing too much already.</li>
            <li>I have found other products labeled as &amp;#34;mega firm&amp;#34; much stronger than this product.</li>

            <li> Great hair gel.  I also bought them at an incredible price. Like around $13. I used to use KMS, but I like the smell of this more than the Cranberry Pomegranate that KMS switched to...Really cranberry pomegranate for a MENS hair gel.</li>
            <li> Great wet look hold all day.</li>
            <li> Bottle was damaged and leaking upon receipt.  The box was in good shape, but bottle was cracked across the bottom.</li>
            <li> As a hair gel this is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used as just a little bit will hold even big and/or hair in place for a long time. The only suggestion i would make to Woody is to offer a fragrance free option - although the fragrance is not offensive and smells like a shower gel application, it does conflict with the much-liked aroma of cologne which women prefer.</li>
            <li> My husband wanted this hairgel.  I usually purchase something inexpensive for him, but it must have a pump.  Our hairstylist uses this brand.  I searched for it and found it here on amazon.com!!! It was pictured with a pump.  It did not come with a pump!  Now as I write the review it is pictured without the pump... grrr&lt;br /&gt;My husband is using it and I didn&#x27;t feel like sending it back, since I am doing too much already. :(&lt;br /&gt;Update: purchased the large bottle, 33.9 oz/1 liter. I refill the pump. My husband loves this gel. We&#x27;ve been doings this for years, now. This latest purchase had the best packaging. There was plastic wrap around the top, in a bag and next to a balloon-bag. The top didn&#x27;t break. There was no leaking and the bottle probably had a secure ride. (Sounds funny, but I have gotten broken top and leaked bottles.)&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> fantastic price. And absolutely amazing shipping time. I think I got it in only two days. Truly impressed.</li>
            <li> I expected this gel to be a strong hold gel hence the name &amp;#34;mega&amp;#34; but not the case. I have found other products labeled as &amp;#34;mega firm&amp;#34; much stronger than this product. More than likely not purchase this particular product again as it did not meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> Best Hair Gel I Have Ever Used, Very Happy.</li>
            <li> It work s really good</li>
            <li> Another customer review said they got a broken bottle but I did not think it would happen to me. It happened EXACTLY the same way, Woody&#x27;s Gel bottle broken at the bottom, gel leaked into packaging. Bottle is a very hard, brittle plastic that you really should not ship without bubble wrap. Shipped in a plastic bag with two airbags at the side.&lt;br /&gt;Learned my lesson, I will honor reviews from now on.&lt;br /&gt;This may be a fine product but you should be aware that you may not get an intact bottle.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to woody&#x27;s gel last year by my barber. There is no going back, nothing comes close to the clean natural hold it provides the entire day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this forever and it&#x27;s the gold standard for hair Gel for men!</li>
            <li> Great price. I usually buy wholesale at same price.</li>
            <li> This is a gigantic bottle! I debated on buying the 2 pack as it was a better deal per oz. wise, but this thing is so huge that it&#x27;ll take forever to run out.</li>
            <li> As expected and on time</li>
            <li> Tried both the firm hold and the mega hold and I like the firm hold much better</li>
            <li> Works great.  Great price.</li>
            <li> I was given a sample set of Woody&#x27;s a few years back. Since then I have been a loyal customer! The gel holds all day and does not flake like some cheep gels.</li>
            <li> My favorite Gel at a great price... delivered!</li>
