            <li>I haven&#x27;t found anything better for curl, body, and staying power!</li>

            <li>and I have not found a mousse yet that I liked better.</li>
            <li>I sent it to my sister-in-law who has very fine hair</li>
            <li>Love this mousse.</li>
            <li>but for some reason I thought it would have gave me more volume1</li>
            <li>so I am glad I can buy it here and continue to buy from this seller.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff---not gummy  and gives shine and body.</li>
            <li>My daughter had a can of this mousse and like most teenagers wanted to try something else</li>
            <li>I love this mousse.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this on the recommendation of my hairdresser and am extremely pleased.</li>
            <li>Love this product I have fine hair</li>
            <li>Strong hold.</li>
            <li>their Strong Mousse just doesn&#x27;t have the power to do what I need.  </li>
            <li>my daughter, not fining anything else she liked as much, has asked me to order her more of the Tigi Catwalk Extra Strong Mousse.  </li>
            <li>, so I need a product that is kind to my bleached hair but strong enough to curl my hair.</li>
            <li>This mousse and my special way to set curls  gives me a full head of really curly hair.  </li>
            <li>For many years I&#x27;ve been looking for mousse/gel for my fine, naturally curly hair and thus by far exceeds all.  </li>
            <li>Strong but still leaves hair soft.</li>
            <li>absolutely love this product, I wash my hair put some in my palm and put in my hair, dry and style  </li>
            <li>and this is the only product that can curl strongly and keep the curl....</li>
            <li>Fine hair definitely benefits from these products.</li>
            <li>BUT the price has gone way too high!</li>
            <li>I would recommend it highly to everyone.</li>
            <li>Either it&#x27;s not the real deal or it&#x27;s really old.</li>
            <li>I have fine straight hair that is heavily highlighted every 3 months</li>
            <li>Pay the extra for the real thing!</li>
            <li>While in the past, I&#x27;ve enjoyed this mousse, working for me better than any other I tried, recently, I got at least one can of this that seems to have none of the ingredient(s) that make it able to give body and</li>
            <li>(I tuck my curls up into a tight fitting night cap and voila, next morning</li>
            <li>I have short straight hair that I use a curling iron on and if the hair doesn&#x27;t have some &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; to it, it doesn&#x27;t stay curled.</li>
            <li>I tried a new mousse recently when I ran out of this, and it made my head itch, which this mousse does not do.  </li>
            <li>Especially when drying naturally</li>
            <li>I like my curls messy and fun</li>

            <li> I love it and it is the best mousse ever!  BUT the price has gone way too high!</li>
            <li> Best mousse in the world!  Strong but still leaves hair soft.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mousse for years and made the mistake of ordering it from amazon. I threw both bottles away! Either it&#x27;s not the real deal or it&#x27;s really old. It was liquidy and slimey and did not do the job. Gross! Pay the extra for the real thing!</li>
            <li> Great product for fine hair.</li>
            <li> Love this mousse. My previous hair stylist recommended it years ago and I have not found a mousse yet that I liked better. Strong hold. I can even skip a day washing my hair.</li>
            <li> My search us over!!!  For many years I&#x27;ve been looking for mousse/gel for my fine, naturally curly hair and thus by far exceeds all.  Beautiful, yet strong hold.  Especially when drying naturally</li>
            <li> Wife said she  loves it. That&#x27;s the only one  she uses.</li>
            <li> This is the best mousse I have ever used!  I can do anything I want with my style and it smells wonderful.  I sent it to my sister-in-law who has very fine hair and she also loves it.</li>
            <li> While in the past, I&#x27;ve enjoyed this mousse, working for me better than any other I tried, recently, I got at least one can of this that seems to have none of the ingredient(s) that make it able to give body and hold.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m working with them to return this, as usually this is non-returnable, but I feel this can, at least, is defective in its product content  and will have to check my other two cans to see if they too, are like this one.</li>
            <li> I have very heavy hair and this is the only product that helps bring volume to my hair without leaving it feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I thought the formula was stronger.  so I was a little bit disappointed.  I&#x27;m still going to use it but for some reason I thought it would have gave me more volume1</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it. Hair gets volume without being sticky. Pair with Root Boost for maximum lift.Fine hair definitely benefits from these products.</li>
            <li> absolutely love this product, I wash my hair put some in my palm and put in my hair, dry and style  I have no body and this product does the trick</li>
            <li> I have been using this mousse for about two years.  It is hard to find locally,  so I am glad I can buy it here and continue to buy from this seller.  I have fine straight hair that is heavily highlighted every 3 months and my hair has thinned as I have aged, so I need a product that is kind to my bleached hair but strong enough to curl my hair. This mousse and my special way to set curls  gives me a full head of really curly hair.  I like my curls messy and fun and this is the only product that can curl strongly and keep the curl....sometimes for 2-3 days without recurling.  (I tuck my curls up into a tight fitting night cap and voila, next morning my curls spring out.)  Extra Strong is the best for me....their Strong Mousse just doesn&#x27;t have the power to do what I need.  I tried a new mousse recently when I ran out of this, and it made my head itch, which this mousse does not do.  I haven&#x27;t found anything better for curl, body, and staying power!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and years. It never flakes or weighs down my hair. I wouldn&#x27;t use anyother mousse.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t go a day without using my catwalk mousse!  People are always wanting to know what product works so well for my curly hair.  It makes the curls stay together and not get fuzzy throughout the day.  Won&#x27;t use anything and haven&#x27;t for years.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I have used it for two years. I would recommend it highly to everyone. You will not be sorry</li>
            <li> Excellent product!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff---not gummy  and gives shine and body.</li>
            <li> Love this product I have fine hair and it gives me a lot of volume. Do you sell a travel size , if not I wish you would.</li>
            <li> I have short straight hair that I use a curling iron on and if the hair doesn&#x27;t have some &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; to it, it doesn&#x27;t stay curled. This gives it some body without being sticky or hard as a rock.</li>
            <li> My daughter had a can of this mousse and like most teenagers wanted to try something else so she gave me her can of mousse.  I love this mousse.  I won&#x27;t buy anything else now.  It holds perfectly, isn&#x27;t sticky, smells wonderful and my daughter, not fining anything else she liked as much, has asked me to order her more of the Tigi Catwalk Extra Strong Mousse.  I buy it whenever I find it on sale and hope they never stop making it.</li>
            <li> leaves my hair very crunchy and not to much volume, was disappointed</li>
            <li> is the best mousee and it&#x27;s very hard to find...I believe they may be discontinuing the product line.  I hope they aren&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> Nice hold, doesn&#x27;t make my hair sticky feeling!</li>
            <li> I purchased this on the recommendation of my hairdresser and am extremely pleased. It provides gentile hold an increases the volume of my thinning hair.</li>
