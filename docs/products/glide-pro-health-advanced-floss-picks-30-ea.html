            <li>This is an Excellent product and it makes it much easier to floss.</li>
            <li>yes, squeezing it tightens the floss, which is quite nice.  </li>
            <li>and my wife prefers a tidy alternative.</li>
            <li>These are absolutely the best.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to find the squeeze-to-tighten kind in stores for a while now</li>
            <li>I love them because I can effectively floss with them.</li>
            <li>The best flossers on the market by far.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best pick on the market today.</li>
            <li>Are by far the BEST floss picks!!  </li>
            <li>I have yet to find a more effective Oral Hygiene product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so fast and easy to floss my teeth now, and the best part is that they are disposable - use it then toss it!  </li>
            <li>They work much better than rigid picks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Glide Floss Picks for years, and have always found them to be the easiest to use and most effective picks available.  </li>
            <li>Their durability and variable tension feature are outstanding.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t find these in the retale stores any more</li>
            <li>but Amazon&#x27;s price is better and you have the choice of buying by the package up to a case.</li>
            <li>We are glad we can get them here.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are the best and easiest way to do your daily flossing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found them here.  </li>
            <li>Have tried several picks, but this is the best.  </li>
            <li>but it requires more effort</li>
            <li>These picks have a lot more going for them than any of the others.  </li>
            <li>- we treat these somewhat like a toothbrush and use them more than once.</li>
            <li>i love love love these things.</li>
            <li>WAY better than any store brand.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how many I had ordered, but I&#x27;m glad I got so many.  </li>
            <li>I am just glad I found them online.</li>
            <li>I love this item -</li>
            <li>I love these things.</li>
            <li>I bought these at Amazon since I can&#x27;t seem to find these anywhere else any more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these for many years.</li>
            <li>So glad to see it here.</li>
            <li>When her dentist told me they were no longer being made, I was glad to find these on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Glad to find them on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>They work as well as the originals and the kids love them.  </li>
            <li>These are so much better then</li>
            <li>sure you have to buy alot at one time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them exclusively, and recommended them to my patients for many years.  </li>
            <li>order some more.</li>
            <li>These picks work better than anything being sold today.</li>
            <li>Our favorite flosser.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I love &#x27;em.</li>
            <li>My dental hygienist noticed immediately and was impressed with the design because they easily reach the back</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Flossers SO superior to \\&quot;regular\\&quot; floss that one has to wonder why they were not the original, logical, obvious, perfect invention.</li>
            <li>the only design - with quality floss! - that I can use successfully to keep my smile bright and my gums healthy.  </li>
            <li>The other five-star reviewers have described these perfectly.</li>
            <li>These picks are the best on the market, they don&#x27;t shear like other brands and glide between teeth.  </li>
            <li>So I give these two stars because I think they&#x27;re better than not flossing at all, and they&#x27;re certainly easy and clean to use.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get myself over-enthused easily</li>
            <li>Shape makes it easy to reach anywhere in the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thet are sturdy and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the product is easy to use.</li>
            <li>These picks are so easy to use (I have found no others like this brand).</li>
            <li>I easily reach everywhere.</li>
            <li>It is strong, easy to slide between teeth, does not cut your gums, and I can&#x27;t find them in stores.</li>
            <li>The Glide dental picks are easy to use, and convenient for the car, office, bathroom or travel.  </li>
            <li>Easy to floss with.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t break easily.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t break too easily either.</li>
            <li>So easy, and there is something aesthetically pleasing about the shape and the feel of these floss picks.</li>
            <li>These floss fit in between my teeth which are crowded but they tend to break off quite easily.</li>
            <li>I never used to floss before I found these, but they make it so easy and comfortable</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;Glide&amp;#34; floss is smooth and yet easy to use and still cleans out the areas between your teeth without wearing them out like some unwaxed floss can.  </li>
            <li>Previous purchases of this product from Amazon were branded \\&quot;Crest Glide Picks\\&quot; and they were excellent.</li>
            <li>Great price for an xcellent product good value on a product that is hard 2 find these days and hope</li>
            <li>They are fabulous.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, Amazon carries them.</li>
            <li>Thank goodness they are still available through Amazon.</li>
            <li>Much more useful than a toothpick.</li>
            <li>This brand is so far superior, I don&#x27;t know how the others stay on the market.</li>
            <li>but much faster, much more hygienic, and much more efficient.</li>
            <li>Glide design makes a lot more sense!&lt;br /&gt;Glide picks are not only much more user friendly and effective,  but the quality way exceeds the others.  </li>
            <li>Excellent grip - the ribbed sides make it easy to hold, usually with the thumb and index.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>The Glide floss pick is by far the best one, good design for hard to reach places, and easily slides between teeth without fraying, breaking, or getting snagged.</li>
            <li>By far the best flossers I&#x27;ve found as an older person (and they are absolutely the more effective, efficient, comfortable, and overall better flossing method, to be sure*)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been flossing every night because the Glide makes flossing easy, quick and painless.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use.  </li>
            <li>These are great for fitting around the entire tooth/gums and glide much easier, never fraying or breaking.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>places like Walgreens and CVS stock row upon row of crappy, identical F-shaped picks and not a single bag of the good ones</li>
            <li>the picks work far better than floss for me, one has more leverage to get between the teeth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many brands and kinds and this one is the only kind that works for me.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so easy to use flossing is actually fun.</li>
            <li>You can thoroughly clean all of your teeth will one pick without snapping.</li>
            <li>Love the tensioning handle, simple but effective.  </li>
            <li>Your teeth feel clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>They are so very easy to use, unlike dental floss or more simple floss picks.</li>
            <li>The floss is strong, rarely breaks; the shape allows for reaching the back teeth easily and effectively.</li>
            <li>They are strong, resistant to shredding, and have a great feature that allows you to tighten the tension to help get them between and out of tight teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using DenTek Comfort Clean Floss Picks, which are bargain-priced at the store, but I often use 4 or 5 for one flossing, as they tend to stretch and break quickly.</li>
            <li>The tail end is a full 1/2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>2 purchase more thanks again Amazon.</li>
            <li>Perhaps we who love them are uncoordinated, but the ability to control the tension should be appreciated by anyone who hasn&#x27;t tried them.  </li>
            <li>The problem is pretty easily solved by bending the pick so it doesn&#x27;t pierce your hand</li>
            <li>I tried others and the floss quickly breaks (although they may work for some people).  </li>
            <li>Amazon also ships quick.</li>
            <li>Even better, the kids too seem to be a lot more likely to floss with the Glide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love these dental picks after they came highly recommended from my dentist and hygenist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried others but these are clearly the best due to their shape and durability.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much come out on the floss, but it was so easy</li>
            <li>Worth any amount--they are really teeth savers and extremely easy to use</li>
            <li>These are great because you can keep the tension on the floss tight.</li>
            <li>The pick side of the floss picks is a little too flimsy to use with much success (hence the four stars) but the floss side works great</li>
            <li>Makes flossing more enjoyable, so we&#x27;re more likely to actually do it!</li>
            <li>Of all the \\&quot;floss\\&quot; products we&#x27;ve found Glide is far and away the most efficient.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>After checking every drugstore in my area, I&#x27;m driven to ordering online and paying shipping fees--but this product is worth it.</li>
            <li>No cutting off the circulation to your fingertips, no stringy things for the dog to pick out of the trash.</li>
            <li>These things are worth their weight in gold</li>
            <li>but well worth the peace of mind</li>
            <li>I bought a years worth.</li>
            <li>Barbara has inspired me to hit the road in search of the adventure and fun</li>
            <li>but I guess it&#x27;s worth mentioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Obviously I&#x27;m not the only one who realizes how awesome this product is, apparently it becomes quickly scarce to find in stores ( they must sell out quick)  </li>
            <li>I like these particular device primarily because you can change the tension of the floss with the handle.</li>
            <li>Easy to fit in the back teeth.  </li>
            <li>These flossers are gentle and easy to use for my whole family.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had them in the past and they work great.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re durable and comfortable, and don&#x27;t tear like the cheap ones I can buy in my local stores.</li>
            <li>The mechanics of it are simple and elegant...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many brands and kinds and this one is the only one that works for me.</li>
            <li>The picks themselves are exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>They work better for me than regular floss.  </li>
            <li>You end up having to put your whole fist in the mouth to turn them in a position that will work!  </li>
            <li>Sure they get between teeth but with these you can actual go around them.</li>
            <li>Much more likely to get children to use these.</li>
            <li>First these floss picks are Crest and then Oral B.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Way better than regular dental floss.</li>
            <li>I bought a different brand by accident the last time, but came back to these because they&#x27;re the best.</li>
            <li>Only way it could be better is if the body were made of recyclable/recycled plastic.</li>
            <li>Consistent problems with breakage and getting stuck.</li>
            <li>The most recent shipment I received as part of a \\&quot;subscribe and save\\&quot; purchase were branded \\&quot;Oral B Glide Picks\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>This makes it MUCH more like using a traditional string of floss</li>
            <li>Love these floss pics just wish they came individually wrapped so you could carry some in your pocket.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll certainly order more when I finally run out.</li>
            <li>So much easier and more convenient than regular floss.  </li>
            <li>sure you can find some at a drug store with a big cost, but these are the real thing..</li>
            <li>Friends have laughed when I have said that, but several have, once they have tried them themselves, admitted that my enthusiasm is actually justified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Must</li>
            <li>These Glide Floss Picks make flossing so easy that there is no excuse not to floss.  </li>
            <li>This is a second order and I was reluctant to order so much since some reviewers say the new ones are inferior quality to the original ones and may break easily.  </li>
            <li>This product was hard to find in my area, so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon and thrilled to receive it two days later using my Amazon Prime membership.</li>
            <li>Overall satisfied, but will try another type next time to see what else may be available.</li>
            <li>I have no problem with Glide Floss Picks; miraculously, I&#x27;m flossing pretty much every day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other brands and shapes, but these are the most usable in terms of getting at the back teeth and the ease with which they slide between the teeth to the gumline.</li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s a large quantity, it still beats the cost of the item if purchased in the store.  </li>
            <li>this is one of the best flossers i have used, easy and convinient and less messy than traditional floss.</li>
            <li>The floss is not flimsy like some other brands, the handle is easy to hold &amp; it all seems to be a better design overall.</li>
            <li>They are very convenient when traveling.</li>
            <li>These picks have held up very well.</li>
            <li>And I like the straight wishbone design vs. the ones that are sideways.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend these floss picks for anyone wanting to save their teeth from cavities!</li>
            <li>Finding them at Amazon was a very fortunite break.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t understand why they&#x27;re no longer available locally.  </li>
            <li>This really cuts the cost down.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You really should give them a try and decide for yourself.</li>
            <li>They work very well for her tightly-spaced teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never managed to get comfortable with regular floss, but these things make up for it.  </li>
            <li>For whatever reason, the children&#x27;s seem to be far better than the \\&quot;adult\\&quot; ones (not that there ought to be much of a difference in the products aside from the obvious shapes and colors.)</li>
            <li>Take my word for it, if you&#x27;re in to floss picks as much as me, these are the ones you want.</li>
            <li>These work really well for flossing.  </li>
            <li>This makes flossing so much easier.</li>
            <li>I like using the floss picks &amp; have found them only available on the internet.</li>
            <li>These things are much easier.</li>
            <li>FAR superior to plain dental floss.</li>
            <li>These picks are more sturdy than other brands.</li>
            <li>I just tried several other disposable flossers because I couldn&#x27;t find this one and ended up using four of the first kind and still having shreds stuck in my teeth (they kept breaking)</li>
            <li>The photo doesn&#x27;t show the rear of the picks very well but they also serve double duty as a light soft tip scraper.  </li>
            <li>so much easier to use these than normal floss.</li>
            <li>This particular floss pick design has changed everything for me and my family.</li>
            <li>I just wish I could find locally in my drugstore, super marts, and grocery stores, but non one stocks them.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find these in any local drugstores, grocery stores or super walmarts.</li>
            <li>Be sure to check prices - several vendors sell these on Amazon for very different prices.</li>
            <li>All the others are flimsy, cheap and the string breaks or gets so loose</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying them out.</li>
            <li>I hope that does not mean they are going to quit selling this product</li>
            <li>I keep these near my desk and clean my teeth regularly</li>
            <li>It makes it easy for the kids to floss each day and they don&#x27;t break or get caught in between teeth like other flossers.</li>
            <li>I think those dentek green ones do a better job than these.</li>
            <li>They are well worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>Most dental floss sticks have when we&#x27;ll call a &amp;#34;crossbar&amp;#34; design, where the floss is stretched between two solid arms of plastic.</li>
            <li>Plus on the ones I got (not pictured on Amazon) they have a little plaque scraper on the other end, which is always handy!</li>
            <li>I feel like I do a much better job flossing with these picks than I would  with plain floss.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without them</li>
            <li>Do you have \\&quot;leftovers\\&quot; after visiting that new Brazilian Meat Restaurant?  </li>
            <li>They are very easy to use and go between the teeth without hard pulling between each tooth.  </li>
            <li>It makes the back teeth so much easier to reach for flossing!</li>
            <li>Unless your teeth have huge gaps in them, or you like using half a bag of floss picks per flossing because they are always breaking, stay away from this Oral-B trash.</li>
            <li>Whether you&#x27;ve got tight gaps and need it to get the floss in there, or very wide gaps and need a good tool to dislodge trapped food, this is a very useful item.</li>
            <li>You simple squeeze the floss pick to create sufficient tension in the floss to make it easy to get it between your teeth, then release it to floss each of the two teeth it is between, then squeeze to create enough tension to draw it out and move on to the next bit.</li>
            <li>One of the best things is that the pick end is not sharp but rounded so that you can carry it in your pocket and not worry about stabbing yourself in the leg!  </li>
            <li>These picks are much easier to use than regular floss; I have closely spaced teeth and</li>
            <li>I even got my then 5 year old grandchild hooked.</li>
            <li>I got so much gunk out with the regular floss</li>
            <li>We need floss picks because my young daughters are not able/willing to use string floss</li>
            <li>(if it hasn&#x27;t completely snapped off).</li>
            <li>and this came up in a \\&quot;Frequently Bought Together\\&quot; package</li>
            <li>Glide is also a very silky floss so it actually glides on your teeth...</li>
            <li>your own flossers just loosen up and I have to keep tightening and retightening the floss, both time consuming and frustrating.</li>
            <li>Not hard to get in between your teeth... and not hard to get back out.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several other brands but Glide is the strongest  and silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Sure, it says you can push the handle together to make it tense</li>
            <li>and I find it does not tense it well enough.</li>
            <li>I can verify that this is the exact same product that I ordered from this page in 2011, with the only difference being that it has the Oral-B name on the package instead of Crest.  </li>
            <li>Regular floss is still better, but this tool is the lazy person&#x27;s answer to flossing.</li>
            <li>But these particular unusual-shaped floss picks are very different.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d be surprised at a feature that these have which no other pick I&#x27;ve seen does; the ability to provide tension on the floss just by squeezing the handle.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend if you are a regular flosser.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands I&#x27;ve found in stores, but they&#x27;re generally more expensive and only slightly better than DenTek.</li>
            <li>These by far are my one and only choice as far as floss, floss picks are concerned.  </li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t believe that these flossers have nothing but positive reviews; I&#x27;ve tried just about every style available, and these Glide ones were the worst.</li>
            <li>They are hard to find in most retail brick &amp; mortar stores, probably because they&#x27;re more expensive.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s too bad that they don&#x27;t sell these in the stores, but i was really happy to find them on amazon.</li>
            <li>My entire family including my 5 yr old does it themselves.</li>
            <li>the floss is barely even usable</li>
            <li>The GUM ones were mostly okay; the Wild Flossers dinosaur-shaped ones were great except that the shapes are sometimes difficult to hold and can make them very uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li>The only complaint I would have is that the Oral-B/Glide company has not made it easy for me to purchase sample or pre-packaged products from them to give to my patients.  </li>
            <li>For a start, you don&#x27;t have to open your mouth very far at all, unlike when wrestling with dental floss and back teeth.</li>
            <li>They do shred somewhat easier than other brands I have tried, but do a reasonable job for the cost.</li>
            <li>very strong, glide floss is slick enough to slide between tight spaces</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended these to me, and they are great if you have a small mouth or for those hard to reach places that other picks can&#x27;t get into.</li>
            <li>I could never get my hand far enough back in my mouth to get my molars.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if its possible for them to be as thin as they need to be and be more sturdy</li>
            <li>getting my fingers all gross from the floss and nearly cutting off my circulation, so I was excited to try these (excited enough to buy a pack of 8!).  </li>
            <li>So much easier to use than the other picks and regular dental floss.</li>
            <li>No excuse not to floss.  </li>
            <li>I have crowns that are tough to get between - easy to snap floss.</li>

            <li> These are absolutely the best.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find the squeeze-to-tighten kind in stores for a while now</li>

            <li> The best flossers on the market by far.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best pick on the market today.</li>
            <li> Are by far the BEST floss picks!!  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s so fast and easy to floss my teeth now, and the best part is that they are disposable - use it then toss it!  </li>
            <li> They work much better than rigid picks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Glide Floss Picks for years, and have always found them to be the easiest to use and most effective picks available.  </li>
            <li> Their durability and variable tension feature are outstanding.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t find these in the retale stores any more</li>
            <li> but Amazon&#x27;s price is better and you have the choice of buying by the package up to a case.</li>
            <li> We are glad we can get them here.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are the best and easiest way to do your daily flossing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found them here.  </li>
            <li> Have tried several picks, but this is the best.  </li>
            <li> but it requires more effort</li>
            <li> These picks have a lot more going for them than any of the others.  </li>
            <li> - we treat these somewhat like a toothbrush and use them more than once.</li>
            <li> i love love love these things.</li>
            <li> WAY better than any store brand.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how many I had ordered, but I&#x27;m glad I got so many.  </li>
            <li> I am just glad I found them online.</li>
            <li> I love this item -</li>
            <li> I love these things.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for many years.</li>
            <li> So glad to see it here.</li>
            <li> When her dentist told me they were no longer being made, I was glad to find these on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Glad to find them on Amazon.  </li>

            <li> These are so much better then</li>
            <li> sure you have to buy alot at one time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them exclusively, and recommended them to my patients for many years.  </li>
            <li> order some more.</li>
            <li> These picks work better than anything being sold today.</li>
            <li> Our favorite flosser.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I love &#x27;em.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist noticed immediately and was impressed with the design because they easily reach the back</li>
            <li> /&gt;*Flossers SO superior to \\&quot;regular\\&quot; floss that one has to wonder why they were not the original, logical, obvious, perfect invention.</li>
            <li> the only design - with quality floss! - that I can use successfully to keep my smile bright and my gums healthy.  </li>
            <li> The other five-star reviewers have described these perfectly.</li>
            <li> These picks are the best on the market, they don&#x27;t shear like other brands and glide between teeth.  </li>
            <li> So I give these two stars because I think they&#x27;re better than not flossing at all, and they&#x27;re certainly easy and clean to use.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get myself over-enthused easily</li>
            <li> Shape makes it easy to reach anywhere in the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thet are sturdy and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, the product is easy to use.</li>
            <li> These picks are so easy to use (I have found no others like this brand).</li>
            <li> I easily reach everywhere.</li>
            <li> It is strong, easy to slide between teeth, does not cut your gums, and I can&#x27;t find them in stores.</li>
            <li> The Glide dental picks are easy to use, and convenient for the car, office, bathroom or travel.  </li>
            <li> Easy to floss with.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t break easily.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t break too easily either.</li>
            <li> So easy, and there is something aesthetically pleasing about the shape and the feel of these floss picks.</li>
            <li> These floss fit in between my teeth which are crowded but they tend to break off quite easily.</li>
            <li> I never used to floss before I found these, but they make it so easy and comfortable</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;Glide&amp;#34; floss is smooth and yet easy to use and still cleans out the areas between your teeth without wearing them out like some unwaxed floss can.  </li>
            <li> Previous purchases of this product from Amazon were branded \\&quot;Crest Glide Picks\\&quot; and they were excellent.</li>
            <li> Great price for an xcellent product good value on a product that is hard 2 find these days and hope</li>
            <li> They are fabulous.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, Amazon carries them.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness they are still available through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Much more useful than a toothpick.</li>
            <li> This brand is so far superior, I don&#x27;t know how the others stay on the market.</li>
            <li> but much faster, much more hygienic, and much more efficient.</li>
            <li> Glide design makes a lot more sense!&lt;br /&gt;Glide picks are not only much more user friendly and effective,  but the quality way exceeds the others.  </li>
            <li> Excellent grip - the ribbed sides make it easy to hold, usually with the thumb and index.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The Glide floss pick is by far the best one, good design for hard to reach places, and easily slides between teeth without fraying, breaking, or getting snagged.</li>
            <li> By far the best flossers I&#x27;ve found as an older person (and they are absolutely the more effective, efficient, comfortable, and overall better flossing method, to be sure*)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been flossing every night because the Glide makes flossing easy, quick and painless.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use.  </li>
            <li> These are great for fitting around the entire tooth/gums and glide much easier, never fraying or breaking.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> places like Walgreens and CVS stock row upon row of crappy, identical F-shaped picks and not a single bag of the good ones</li>
            <li> the picks work far better than floss for me, one has more leverage to get between the teeth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many brands and kinds and this one is the only kind that works for me.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so easy to use flossing is actually fun.</li>
            <li> You can thoroughly clean all of your teeth will one pick without snapping.</li>
            <li> Love the tensioning handle, simple but effective.  </li>
            <li> Your teeth feel clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> They are so very easy to use, unlike dental floss or more simple floss picks.</li>
            <li> The floss is strong, rarely breaks; the shape allows for reaching the back teeth easily and effectively.</li>
            <li> They are strong, resistant to shredding, and have a great feature that allows you to tighten the tension to help get them between and out of tight teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using DenTek Comfort Clean Floss Picks, which are bargain-priced at the store, but I often use 4 or 5 for one flossing, as they tend to stretch and break quickly.</li>
            <li> The tail end is a full 1/2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> 2 purchase more thanks again Amazon.</li>
            <li> Perhaps we who love them are uncoordinated, but the ability to control the tension should be appreciated by anyone who hasn&#x27;t tried them.  </li>
            <li> The problem is pretty easily solved by bending the pick so it doesn&#x27;t pierce your hand</li>
            <li> I tried others and the floss quickly breaks (although they may work for some people).  </li>
            <li> Amazon also ships quick.</li>
            <li> Even better, the kids too seem to be a lot more likely to floss with the Glide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love these dental picks after they came highly recommended from my dentist and hygenist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried others but these are clearly the best due to their shape and durability.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much come out on the floss, but it was so easy</li>
            <li> Worth any amount--they are really teeth savers and extremely easy to use</li>
            <li> These are great because you can keep the tension on the floss tight.</li>
            <li> The pick side of the floss picks is a little too flimsy to use with much success (hence the four stars) but the floss side works great</li>
            <li> Makes flossing more enjoyable, so we&#x27;re more likely to actually do it!</li>
            <li> Of all the \\&quot;floss\\&quot; products we&#x27;ve found Glide is far and away the most efficient.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> After checking every drugstore in my area, I&#x27;m driven to ordering online and paying shipping fees--but this product is worth it.</li>
            <li> No cutting off the circulation to your fingertips, no stringy things for the dog to pick out of the trash.</li>
            <li> These things are worth their weight in gold</li>
            <li> but well worth the peace of mind</li>
            <li> I bought a years worth.</li>
            <li> Barbara has inspired me to hit the road in search of the adventure and fun</li>
            <li> but I guess it&#x27;s worth mentioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Obviously I&#x27;m not the only one who realizes how awesome this product is, apparently it becomes quickly scarce to find in stores ( they must sell out quick)  </li>
            <li> I like these particular device primarily because you can change the tension of the floss with the handle.</li>
            <li> Easy to fit in the back teeth.  </li>
            <li> These flossers are gentle and easy to use for my whole family.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had them in the past and they work great.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re durable and comfortable, and don&#x27;t tear like the cheap ones I can buy in my local stores.</li>
            <li> The mechanics of it are simple and elegant...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many brands and kinds and this one is the only one that works for me.</li>
            <li> The picks themselves are exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> They work better for me than regular floss.  </li>
            <li> You end up having to put your whole fist in the mouth to turn them in a position that will work!  </li>
            <li> Sure they get between teeth but with these you can actual go around them.</li>
            <li> Much more likely to get children to use these.</li>
            <li> First these floss picks are Crest and then Oral B.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Way better than regular dental floss.</li>
            <li> I bought a different brand by accident the last time, but came back to these because they&#x27;re the best.</li>
            <li> Only way it could be better is if the body were made of recyclable/recycled plastic.</li>
            <li> Consistent problems with breakage and getting stuck.</li>
            <li> The most recent shipment I received as part of a \\&quot;subscribe and save\\&quot; purchase were branded \\&quot;Oral B Glide Picks\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This makes it MUCH more like using a traditional string of floss</li>
            <li> Love these floss pics just wish they came individually wrapped so you could carry some in your pocket.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll certainly order more when I finally run out.</li>
            <li> So much easier and more convenient than regular floss.  </li>
            <li> sure you can find some at a drug store with a big cost, but these are the real thing..</li>
            <li> Friends have laughed when I have said that, but several have, once they have tried them themselves, admitted that my enthusiasm is actually justified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Must</li>
            <li> These Glide Floss Picks make flossing so easy that there is no excuse not to floss.  </li>
            <li> This is a second order and I was reluctant to order so much since some reviewers say the new ones are inferior quality to the original ones and may break easily.  </li>
            <li> This product was hard to find in my area, so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon and thrilled to receive it two days later using my Amazon Prime membership.</li>
            <li> Overall satisfied, but will try another type next time to see what else may be available.</li>
            <li> I have no problem with Glide Floss Picks; miraculously, I&#x27;m flossing pretty much every day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other brands and shapes, but these are the most usable in terms of getting at the back teeth and the ease with which they slide between the teeth to the gumline.</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s a large quantity, it still beats the cost of the item if purchased in the store.  </li>
            <li> this is one of the best flossers i have used, easy and convinient and less messy than traditional floss.</li>
            <li> The floss is not flimsy like some other brands, the handle is easy to hold &amp; it all seems to be a better design overall.</li>
            <li> They are very convenient when traveling.</li>
            <li> These picks have held up very well.</li>
            <li> And I like the straight wishbone design vs. the ones that are sideways.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend these floss picks for anyone wanting to save their teeth from cavities!</li>
            <li> Finding them at Amazon was a very fortunite break.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understand why they&#x27;re no longer available locally.  </li>
            <li> This really cuts the cost down.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You really should give them a try and decide for yourself.</li>
            <li> They work very well for her tightly-spaced teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never managed to get comfortable with regular floss, but these things make up for it.  </li>
            <li> For whatever reason, the children&#x27;s seem to be far better than the \\&quot;adult\\&quot; ones (not that there ought to be much of a difference in the products aside from the obvious shapes and colors.)</li>
            <li> Take my word for it, if you&#x27;re in to floss picks as much as me, these are the ones you want.</li>
            <li> These work really well for flossing.  </li>
            <li> This makes flossing so much easier.</li>
            <li> I like using the floss picks &amp; have found them only available on the internet.</li>
            <li> These things are much easier.</li>
            <li> FAR superior to plain dental floss.</li>
            <li> These picks are more sturdy than other brands.</li>
            <li> I just tried several other disposable flossers because I couldn&#x27;t find this one and ended up using four of the first kind and still having shreds stuck in my teeth (they kept breaking)</li>
            <li> The photo doesn&#x27;t show the rear of the picks very well but they also serve double duty as a light soft tip scraper.  </li>
            <li> so much easier to use these than normal floss.</li>
            <li> This particular floss pick design has changed everything for me and my family.</li>
            <li> I just wish I could find locally in my drugstore, super marts, and grocery stores, but non one stocks them.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find these in any local drugstores, grocery stores or super walmarts.</li>
            <li> Be sure to check prices - several vendors sell these on Amazon for very different prices.</li>
            <li> All the others are flimsy, cheap and the string breaks or gets so loose</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying them out.</li>
            <li> I hope that does not mean they are going to quit selling this product</li>
            <li> I keep these near my desk and clean my teeth regularly</li>
            <li> It makes it easy for the kids to floss each day and they don&#x27;t break or get caught in between teeth like other flossers.</li>
            <li> I think those dentek green ones do a better job than these.</li>
            <li> They are well worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Most dental floss sticks have when we&#x27;ll call a &amp;#34;crossbar&amp;#34; design, where the floss is stretched between two solid arms of plastic.</li>
            <li> Plus on the ones I got (not pictured on Amazon) they have a little plaque scraper on the other end, which is always handy!</li>
            <li> I feel like I do a much better job flossing with these picks than I would  with plain floss.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without them</li>
            <li> Do you have \\&quot;leftovers\\&quot; after visiting that new Brazilian Meat Restaurant?  </li>
            <li> They are very easy to use and go between the teeth without hard pulling between each tooth.  </li>
            <li> It makes the back teeth so much easier to reach for flossing!</li>
            <li> Unless your teeth have huge gaps in them, or you like using half a bag of floss picks per flossing because they are always breaking, stay away from this Oral-B trash.</li>
            <li> Whether you&#x27;ve got tight gaps and need it to get the floss in there, or very wide gaps and need a good tool to dislodge trapped food, this is a very useful item.</li>
            <li> You simple squeeze the floss pick to create sufficient tension in the floss to make it easy to get it between your teeth, then release it to floss each of the two teeth it is between, then squeeze to create enough tension to draw it out and move on to the next bit.</li>
            <li> One of the best things is that the pick end is not sharp but rounded so that you can carry it in your pocket and not worry about stabbing yourself in the leg!  </li>
            <li> These picks are much easier to use than regular floss; I have closely spaced teeth and</li>
            <li> I even got my then 5 year old grandchild hooked.</li>
            <li> I got so much gunk out with the regular floss</li>
            <li> We need floss picks because my young daughters are not able/willing to use string floss</li>
            <li> (if it hasn&#x27;t completely snapped off).</li>
            <li> and this came up in a \\&quot;Frequently Bought Together\\&quot; package</li>
            <li> Glide is also a very silky floss so it actually glides on your teeth...</li>
            <li> your own flossers just loosen up and I have to keep tightening and retightening the floss, both time consuming and frustrating.</li>
            <li> Not hard to get in between your teeth... and not hard to get back out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other brands but Glide is the strongest  and silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Sure, it says you can push the handle together to make it tense</li>
            <li> and I find it does not tense it well enough.</li>
            <li> I can verify that this is the exact same product that I ordered from this page in 2011, with the only difference being that it has the Oral-B name on the package instead of Crest.  </li>
            <li> Regular floss is still better, but this tool is the lazy person&#x27;s answer to flossing.</li>
            <li> But these particular unusual-shaped floss picks are very different.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d be surprised at a feature that these have which no other pick I&#x27;ve seen does; the ability to provide tension on the floss just by squeezing the handle.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend if you are a regular flosser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands I&#x27;ve found in stores, but they&#x27;re generally more expensive and only slightly better than DenTek.</li>
            <li> These by far are my one and only choice as far as floss, floss picks are concerned.  </li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t believe that these flossers have nothing but positive reviews; I&#x27;ve tried just about every style available, and these Glide ones were the worst.</li>
            <li> They are hard to find in most retail brick &amp; mortar stores, probably because they&#x27;re more expensive.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too bad that they don&#x27;t sell these in the stores, but i was really happy to find them on amazon.</li>
            <li> My entire family including my 5 yr old does it themselves.</li>
            <li> the floss is barely even usable</li>
            <li> The GUM ones were mostly okay; the Wild Flossers dinosaur-shaped ones were great except that the shapes are sometimes difficult to hold and can make them very uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I would have is that the Oral-B/Glide company has not made it easy for me to purchase sample or pre-packaged products from them to give to my patients.  </li>
            <li> For a start, you don&#x27;t have to open your mouth very far at all, unlike when wrestling with dental floss and back teeth.</li>
            <li> They do shred somewhat easier than other brands I have tried, but do a reasonable job for the cost.</li>
            <li> very strong, glide floss is slick enough to slide between tight spaces</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended these to me, and they are great if you have a small mouth or for those hard to reach places that other picks can&#x27;t get into.</li>
            <li> I could never get my hand far enough back in my mouth to get my molars.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if its possible for them to be as thin as they need to be and be more sturdy</li>
            <li> getting my fingers all gross from the floss and nearly cutting off my circulation, so I was excited to try these (excited enough to buy a pack of 8!).  </li>
            <li> So much easier to use than the other picks and regular dental floss.</li>
            <li> No excuse not to floss.  </li>
            <li> I have crowns that are tough to get between - easy to snap floss.</li>
            <li> For me, since I have very tight teeth, these still shred, and they don&#x27;t stimulate my gums as much as separate string floss.</li>
            <li> My gripe is that the string is very loose and when you glide it in between teeth, it isnt tense enough to clean the grit between teeth.</li>
            <li> I usually leave my tighter teeth to floss after I have done the easy ones,  and this way I can usually accomplish a thorough flossing with only one pick without the floss breaking.  </li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t think they do nearly as good of a job removing food particles as regular floss does. :-(</li>
            <li> it used to be in local drug stores, but for some strange reason they&#x27;ve stopped carrying it in favor of those flat floss/picks that can&#x27;t get all the way in the back of your mouth without twisting and turning the pick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I floss pretty hard.</li>
            <li> They are much easier to manouver around your mouth than ordinary dental floss.  </li>
            <li> Overall I give these a 5 star and will continue to use them as long as they are still made.</li>
            <li> These floss picks are sturdy and will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> I have very small spaces between each tooth and they glide very gently between my teeth, without feeling like I am going to lose a filling or crown.</li>
            <li> Most of the other brands have the floss strung across the bottom of an arch like design making it difficult to accomplish molar flossing.  </li>
            <li> Or, rather I was that way until not so long ago.</li>
            <li> problem is they sometime break after only minimal use.</li>
            <li> When you use regular floss picks the floss gets all saggy and becomes harder to use.  </li>
            <li> I also detested the long strings of used floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> have used these picks for more than 5 years now, but they have become impossible to find locally in stores.</li>
            <li> Putting a pick from each package next to each other, I could not tell the difference, so this is an example of Oral-B buying the product from Crest and keeping it the way it was.  </li>
            <li> (flip it the other way for the upper teeth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Especially for those of us who were searching for other drugstore-type items</li>
            <li> You would not normally think someone could get so excited about flossing, but you would be wrong.</li>
            <li> We rinse them off like a toothbrush and store them like a toothbrush until they get too loose or break.</li>
            <li> I actually get emotionally down when I go out of town or need to floss in the day and don&#x27;t have one of these picks (with the multi pack I bought here</li>
            <li> They are way less messy and gross than regular floss.</li>
            <li> The harder you squeeze the sides the tighter the floss gets.&lt;br /&gt;- Super-resistant floss - it never broke on me.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> My only gripe here is that the floss seems to wear out after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> My CVS has had an empty slot on the rack for this for months, but never gets it in stock.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they aren&#x27;t available in stores anymore, for some ridiculous reason only known by Glide.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never floss any other way, ever again.</li>
            <li> It must be that other people haven&#x27;t discovered that Amazon.com sells them.</li>
            <li> like you do with other pick flossers.</li>
            <li> The other picks all have a hacksaw shape which is not convenient for the job.</li>
            <li> I discarded other forms of floss years ago.  </li>
            <li> when the floss loosens after being used in a few tight spaces you just apply pressure to the sides to tighten it back up again.</li>
            <li> and when they get loose you can make them tight by squeezing them.</li>
            <li> They are the only ones that I can use to reach all the way back behind my wisdom teeth.</li>
            <li> I have big bear hands and always had a hard time flossing my teeth -</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the mfg. has stopped making one brand of these identical picks which work really well.  </li>
            <li> And the yoke that holds the floss curves slightly down to make it easier to get the floss between teeth</li>
            <li> I hope that they keep making them, they bet all others hands down.</li>
            <li> Squeeze the flat sides and it increase the tension for those stubborn tight gaps between teeth that are hard to penetrate.  </li>
            <li> The less expensive picks just plain don&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> They work very well for flossing between teeth very tightly spaced, when regular floss is almost impossible to make work.</li>
            <li> teeth are so tightly packed together in my mouth that I shred dental floss</li>
            <li> These little guys came the day after I ordered (Soap.com).  </li>
            <li> It will eventually break if you have quite a few tight teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> long (beyond the bottom opening) tapering down to a thin, flexible pick, with a slightly blunted end</li>
            <li> Floss stays firm to allow ease of use.</li>
            <li> I have a bag a work, a few bags here and there around the house.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of flossing...</li>
            <li> I used to buy them at Walmart or other drug stores, but for some reason they have been increasingly hard to find.  </li>
            <li> My husband loves these because they are stiff and he can get them between his teeth without them bending and/or breaking.</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth and tight teeth.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they are the only floss picks that work for me because of my tightly bound teeth.</li>
            <li> They also get between my very tight teeth.</li>
            <li> I just looked past that.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the same situation, unable to find these on store shelves.</li>
            <li> This type flosser is easier to handle -- no more contorting your hand and wrist</li>
            <li> The F-shaped picks are useless for back teeth</li>
            <li> Small</li>
            <li> Or maybe I just have small teeth, who knows...</li>
            <li> I usually need to order online to get any.</li>
            <li> I really do not know why it is impossible to obtain them locally.</li>
            <li> so we purchased what we assumed was shown in the photo, only to open up a box of stupid picks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Due to the arthritis in my hands, regular flossing is painful.</li>
            <li> Then the reason my teeth are packed so tightly is that my mouth is so small, my lips too, so trying to get my big hands in my mouth with just floss always leaves me frustrated and the corners of my mouth all pulled out of shape and swollen.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find it in the store now.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So Glide floss doesn&#x27;t shred on me, but it is really hard for me to use it without a flosser.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, they&#x27;re hard to find - I&#x27;ve bought them at Walmart and online.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> As you can tell I am a fanatic about my teeth</li>
            <li> They were too thick.  </li>
            <li> and then I shredded my gums with the next variety (was bleeding profusely) because it was so hard to snap the floss past the tight spaces (kudos for it not breaking, but I don&#x27;t need lacerations in my gums either) and it was awkward and difficult to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more frustration!</li>
            <li> Other floss picks have angles that make it difficult for me to use them.</li>
            <li> (I seriously worry about that).</li>
            <li> Seriously Amazon, what&#x27;s the point of subscribe and save if you keep changing the product that the subscription is for.</li>
            <li> Physically they appear identical, but the quality of the Oral B product is horrible and the floss breaks constantly.</li>
            <li> The other brands are also awkward in flossing front teeth as well.  </li>
            <li> Very hard to find</li>
            <li> Very hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Every dental hygienist says to me \\&quot;Yeah, you&#x27;re really tough to floss.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Poor service from Oral-B, but</li>
            <li> negative is that the base of the handle has a pick in it (for those who use a pick) and when you&#x27;re holding this thing to floss, that pick can be sharp and dig into your hand.</li>
            <li> Once I started flossing with these I realized how terrible my old floss picks were.  </li>
            <li> The photo shows Glide floss, but the item description says \\&quot;floss picks.\\&quot; Very confusing!</li>
            <li> They are expensive, until you compare using one of them per flossing to 4 or 5 picks of another brand.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t find them in the stores anymore.  </li>
            <li> Useless.</li>
            <li> These are impossible to find at a discount store..</li>
            <li> My experience has not been bad.  </li>
            <li> :-(.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> My dentist is very unhappy that I&#x27;ve found these.  </li>
            <li> I never flossed growing up as it is really annoying to do.</li>
            <li> I have always hated dental floss, which I often seemed to cut myself with when using, to say nothing of the pain in my fingers from winding it around them to get sufficient traction to get between my teeth.</li>
            <li> My teeth are very bad</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without them</li>
            <li> These floss fit in between my teeth which are crowded but they tend to break off quite easily. I don&#x27;t know if its possible for them to be as thin as they need to be and be more sturdy but I go thru one a day.</li>
            <li> I think I ordered these on a Saturday and received them on Monday. It was AMAZING.  I have been ordering these for several years now.  They are fabulous.  I keep a pack in each car as well as the kitchen and linen closet.</li>
            <li> These picks are much easier to use than regular floss; I have closely spaced teeth and the picks work far better than floss for me, one has more leverage to get between the teeth.  They are very convenient when traveling.</li>
            <li> I tried others and the floss quickly breaks (although they may work for some people).  These work well and are the best I&#x27;ve tried. They have a feature allowing you to squeeze the handle which increases the tension of the floss...this is helpful (along with the superior durability of the floss) if your teeth are close together.</li>
            <li> this is one of the best flossers i have used, easy and convinient and less messy than traditional floss. it&#x27;s too bad that they don&#x27;t sell these in the stores, but i was really happy to find them on amazon.</li>
            <li> I had used Glide Floss for years but wanted to try another approach.&lt;br /&gt;A floss pick could be an answer but the various ones I found in the stores were&lt;br /&gt;impossible for me to deal with.  They were too thick.  I wanted to try Glide brand but&lt;br /&gt;I could not find any of their picks locally.  Then I went on-line. Now I have them and they are WONDERFUL.&lt;br /&gt;Problem solved.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different disposable floss picks. This one works the best for me. I have crowns that are tough to get between - easy to snap floss. These picks have held up very well. And I like the straight wishbone design vs. the ones that are sideways.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product from my dentist years ago.  I&#x27;ve been using it since.  I even got my then 5 year old grandchild hooked.</li>
            <li> I have big bear hands and always had a hard time flossing my teeth - I could never get my hand far enough back in my mouth to get my molars.  With these floss picks, that isn&#x27;t an issue anymore.  It&#x27;s so fast and easy to floss my teeth now, and the best part is that they are disposable - use it then toss it!  I&#x27;d highly recommend these floss picks for anyone wanting to save their teeth from cavities!</li>
            <li> I have looked all over Park City and Salt Lake City Utah and Eugene Oregon for these picks and couldn&#x27;t find them. I&#x27;ve had them in the past and they work great. I love them because I can effectively floss with them. (My dentist says so.) Due to the arthritis in my hands, regular flossing is painful. They work much better than rigid picks. Why else would I buy 8 bags of 30!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price was very good and ...free shipping! Ya can&#x27;t beat that with a pick!</li>
            <li> My husband like this floss pic. It is hard to find it in the store now.&lt;br /&gt;I found it in here with great price.  Wonderful.</li>
            <li> Overall satisfied, but will try another type next time to see what else may be available. They do shred somewhat easier than other brands I have tried, but do a reasonable job for the cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Glide Floss Picks for years, and have always found them to be the easiest to use and most effective picks available.  Their durability and variable tension feature are outstanding.  I used to buy them at Walmart or other drug stores, but for some reason they have been increasingly hard to find.  Then I found them on Amazon, and bought a year&#x27;s supply (8 pkgs of 30)!!  Best decision ever!</li>
            <li> Great price and service.  You can&#x27;t find these in the retale stores any more I don&#x27;t know if they are discontinued or why they are not on the shelves anymore.  Finding them at Amazon was a very fortunite break.  They are also on ebay but Amazon&#x27;s price is better and you have the choice of buying by the package up to a case.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended Glide floss years ago, and I used to use the great refillable Glide floss pick holders which were discontinued when the company was bought by Procter &amp; Gamble. I&#x27;ve only used these newer Glide Floss Picks when my dentist gives me samples; I&#x27;ve never seen them in a store. I&#x27;ve been using DenTek Comfort Clean Floss Picks, which are bargain-priced at the store, but I often use 4 or 5 for one flossing, as they tend to stretch and break quickly. I&#x27;ve tried other brands I&#x27;ve found in stores, but they&#x27;re generally more expensive and only slightly better than DenTek. When I found these Glide Floss Picks on Amazon, I immediately put them in my cart. They are expensive, until you compare using one of them per flossing to 4 or 5 picks of another brand. They are strong, resistant to shredding, and have a great feature that allows you to tighten the tension to help get them between and out of tight teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of flossing...getting my fingers all gross from the floss and nearly cutting off my circulation, so I was excited to try these (excited enough to buy a pack of 8!).  I used these for over a week and felt like I was in heaven.  I didn&#x27;t see much come out on the floss, but it was so easy I just looked past that.  Then I used regular floss.  O.M.G.  I got so much gunk out with the regular floss you&#x27;d think I hadn&#x27;t flossed at all in that week.  So I give these two stars because I think they&#x27;re better than not flossing at all, and they&#x27;re certainly easy and clean to use.  I just don&#x27;t think they do nearly as good of a job removing food particles as regular floss does. :-(</li>
            <li> These flossers are gentle and easy to use for my whole family. It makes it easy for the kids to floss each day and they don&#x27;t break or get caught in between teeth like other flossers.</li>
            <li> Once I started flossing with these I realized how terrible my old floss picks were.  These are great for fitting around the entire tooth/gums and glide much easier, never fraying or breaking.  You will notice the difference immediately.  I highly recommend trying them out.</li>
            <li> We like these floss picks the best of any we&#x27;ve tried, but can&#x27;t find in stores now?? We are glad we can get them here. They are angled so you can reach the back teeth, and after you&#x27;ve flossed and the floss gets slack, you can tighten it up by pinching the plastic handle. We keep these by our lamp table in the living room and reach for them at news time and we&#x27;re done in a flash. Makes flossing more enjoyable, so we&#x27;re more likely to actually do it!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B003CP12PC Glide Floss Picks, 30-count Packages (Pack of 8)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the best and easiest way to do your daily flossing.  Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t find them in the stores anymore.  I&#x27;m glad I found them here.  Now I&#x27;m set for awhile.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t, bother trying anything else. These flossers are the best product on the market. I have tried everything else in hopes of finding something close.  No luck. Buy them by the case. You will be thrilled. Amazon also ships quick.</li>
            <li> I was so upset when I couldn&#x27;t find these in the store anymore. I&#x27;ve tried so many brands and kinds and this one is the only kind that works for me. Thank you Amazon for carrying them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth are so tightly packed together in my mouth that I shred dental floss like there&#x27;s no tomorrow. Then the reason my teeth are packed so tightly is that my mouth is so small, my lips too, so trying to get my big hands in my mouth with just floss always leaves me frustrated and the corners of my mouth all pulled out of shape and swollen. So Glide floss doesn&#x27;t shred on me, but it is really hard for me to use it without a flosser. Regular thread your own flossers just loosen up and I have to keep tightening and retightening the floss, both time consuming and frustrating. Every dental hygienist says to me \\&quot;Yeah, you&#x27;re really tough to floss.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add to that I have had TMJ since my wisdom teeth were extracted and I was so happy when I found this product. The mechanics of it are simple and elegant... when the floss loosens after being used in a few tight spaces you just apply pressure to the sides to tighten it back up again. The angle is perfect and I can floss my teeth without traumatizing my lips and cheeks, plus it&#x27;s EASY! No more frustration! I just tried several other disposable flossers because I couldn&#x27;t find this one and ended up using four of the first kind and still having shreds stuck in my teeth (they kept breaking) and then I shredded my gums with the next variety (was bleeding profusely) because it was so hard to snap the floss past the tight spaces (kudos for it not breaking, but I don&#x27;t need lacerations in my gums either) and it was awkward and difficult to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, as others have stated, these Glide Floss Picks are the best flossers ever! I&#x27;ve tried so many brands and kinds and this one is the only one that works for me. Please do not stop making them Procter and Gamble!</li>
            <li> This product was discontinued when OralB bought out Crest a couple of years ago.  I am SO grateful to have it back.  I have only one hand and it is the only design - with quality floss! - that I can use successfully to keep my smile bright and my gums healthy.  Thank you for bringing it back!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get myself over-enthused easily but the Glide must be the best in its class. And this is why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Excellent grip - the ribbed sides make it easy to hold, usually with the thumb and index.&lt;br /&gt;- You can actually control the floss tension. The harder you squeeze the sides the tighter the floss gets.&lt;br /&gt;- Super-resistant floss - it never broke on me.&lt;br /&gt;- Shape makes it easy to reach anywhere in the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I can call myself flossing-reluctant. Or, rather I was that way until not so long ago. Ever since I started to use Glide I&#x27;ve been flossing every night because the Glide makes flossing easy, quick and painless. Even better, the kids too seem to be a lot more likely to floss with the Glide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good product and it just became the official and exclusive floss pick in our household.</li>
            <li> I loved the idea of being able to buy this product with ease.  The local drugstores no longer have it on their shelves.  My dentist will be thrilled.  The picks keep my gums healthy!  thankyou.</li>
            <li> The source was wonderful. They had the product I wanted  at a fair price and they shipped it ASAP. The product  arrived promptly in great condition. The picks themselves are exactly what I wanted. For some reason, none of the local drug or grocery stores carry these picks anymore. They work very well for flossing between teeth very tightly spaced, when regular floss is almost impossible to make work. I&#x27;m happy and satisfied.</li>
            <li> Floss makes me gag so I used to floss about 6 times a year. I have no problem with Glide Floss Picks; miraculously, I&#x27;m flossing pretty much every day.  My dental hygienist noticed immediately and was impressed with the design because they easily reach the back teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, they&#x27;re hard to find - I&#x27;ve bought them at Walmart and online.</li>
            <li> As someone who flosses two or three times a day I have to say these are simply incredible. My teeth are very bad but I have no problems whatsoever reaching every gap and crevice with these things. They&#x27;re so easy to use flossing is actually fun. I&#x27;ll never floss any other way, ever again. Plus on the ones I got (not pictured on Amazon) they have a little plaque scraper on the other end, which is always handy!</li>
            <li> These picks are more sturdy than other brands. You can thoroughly clean all of your teeth will one pick without snapping. Great Product!</li>
            <li> The other five-star reviewers have described these perfectly. I&#x27;m in the same situation, unable to find these on store shelves. Other floss picks have angles that make it difficult for me to use them. This brand is so far superior, I don&#x27;t know how the others stay on the market. It must be that other people haven&#x27;t discovered that Amazon.com sells them.</li>
            <li> These are the best dental floss pics I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;ve tried many other brands and shapes, but these are the most usable in terms of getting at the back teeth and the ease with which they slide between the teeth to the gumline.</li>
            <li> This product has been discontinued I believe. Unfortunately they are the only floss picks that work for me because of my tightly bound teeth. Glide by itself is too cumbersome but in pick form it makes it very easy to floss!</li>
            <li> These are the best to be had. Unfortunately I have not been able to find in the stores. PLEASE keep offering them. Thet are sturdy and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Have tried several picks, but this is the best.  Super easy to use.  Floss stays firm to allow ease of use.</li>
            <li> My dentist gave me a sample of these picks.  They work better for me than regular floss.  I couldn&#x27;t find them in my drug or grocery stores and am grateful to find them at Amazon.</li>
            <li> These floss are ineffective at its purpose: flossing. My gripe is that the string is very loose and when you glide it in between teeth, it isnt tense enough to clean the grit between teeth. Sure, it says you can push the handle together to make it tense but it requires more effort and I find it does not tense it well enough. I think those dentek green ones do a better job than these.</li>
            <li> I like these particular device primarily because you can change the tension of the floss with the handle. Otherwise, the product is easy to use. And in the glide case, the floss with resilient to shredding.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every brand out there.  These picks have a lot more going for them than any of the others.  The number one advantage is the the horseshoe/wishbone  shaped design enables one to get in between the molars with ease.  Most of the other brands have the floss strung across the bottom of an arch like design making it difficult to accomplish molar flossing.  You end up having to put your whole fist in the mouth to turn them in a position that will work!  The other brands are also awkward in flossing front teeth as well.  Glide design makes a lot more sense!&lt;br /&gt;Glide picks are not only much more user friendly and effective,  but the quality way exceeds the others.  I usually leave my tighter teeth to floss after I have done the easy ones,  and this way I can usually accomplish a thorough flossing with only one pick without the floss breaking.  It will eventually break if you have quite a few tight teeth.&lt;br /&gt;  I feel like I do a much better job flossing with these picks than I would  with plain floss.  AND I can read as I do it if I want!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m ordering these from Amazon because I can&#x27;t find them at any of my local stores.  Should be enough to last about seven or eight months.</li>
            <li> For those who can&#x27;t get their fingers in their mouths to floss these are ideal.  I&#x27;ve tried others but these are clearly the best due to their shape and durability.  I can&#x27;t understand why they&#x27;re no longer available locally.  Fortunately, Amazon carries them.</li>
            <li> I buy a TON of stuff on Amazon and have never felt the need to write a review...until now. These floss picks break CONSTANTLY. Unless your teeth have huge gaps in them, or you like using half a bag of floss picks per flossing because they are always breaking, stay away from this Oral-B trash.</li>
            <li> I love these dental picks after they came highly recommended from my dentist and hygenist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only problem is they sometime break after only minimal use.</li>
            <li> These were recommended by my dentist.  After using them over a year, they disappeared from store schelves. :-(. Thank goodness they are still available through Amazon.</li>
            <li> This type flosser is easier to handle -- no more contorting your hand and wrist like you do with other pick flossers. The thread stays taut and doesn&#x27;t break, unlike cheaper brands. Great for kids, too. You will be happy and your dentist will be happy! This product was hard to find in my area, so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon and thrilled to receive it two days later using my Amazon Prime membership.</li>
            <li> easiest to use of all it&#x27;s competitors -- I&#x27;m happy, my dentist is happy....what can you say about a floss pick?</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best out there. The other picks all have a hacksaw shape which is not convenient for the job. Sure they get between teeth but with these you can actual go around them. FAR superior to plain dental floss. Much more likely to get children to use these. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> When you use regular floss picks the floss gets all saggy and becomes harder to use.  These are great because you can keep the tension on the floss tight.</li>
            <li> Of all the \\&quot;floss\\&quot; products we&#x27;ve found Glide is far and away the most efficient.&lt;br /&gt;When they were unavailable,a short time back,it was\\&quot;panic time\\&quot; at our house.</li>
            <li> You would not normally think someone could get so excited about flossing, but you would be wrong. This particular floss pick design has changed everything for me and my family. I never flossed growing up as it is really annoying to do. These picks are so easy to use (I have found no others like this brand). My entire family including my 5 yr old does it themselves. It is actually easier to get my kids to floss than it is to get them to brush with these picks. I actually get emotionally down when I go out of town or need to floss in the day and don&#x27;t have one of these picks (with the multi pack I bought here, I now keep a bag of picks in the car). I think schools and dentist offices should give this specific pick to kids and it would dramatically increase regular flossing habits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used these picks for more than 5 years now, but they have become impossible to find locally in stores. I hope that does not mean they are going to quit selling this product (I seriously worry about that). Please do yourself a favor and buy this item. You will not regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI - we treat these somewhat like a toothbrush and use them more than once. We rinse them off like a toothbrush and store them like a toothbrush until they get too loose or break. This really cuts the cost down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Change your flossing life forever!</li>
            <li> After checking every drugstore in my area, I&#x27;m driven to ordering online and paying shipping fees--but this product is worth it. The F-shaped picks are useless for back teeth and I don&#x27;t know why anyone would want to use them. Y-shaped gets the back teeth as well as the front. I never used to floss before I found these, but they make it so easy and comfortable that I recommend them to any reluctant flossers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why places like Walgreens and CVS stock row upon row of crappy, identical F-shaped picks and not a single bag of the good ones, I just don&#x27;t understand.</li>
            <li> These Glide Floss Picks are the best on the market!  They are very easy to use and go between the teeth without hard pulling between each tooth.  I have very small spaces between each tooth and they glide very gently between my teeth, without feeling like I am going to lose a filling or crown.</li>
            <li> These are the best. I easily reach everywhere. Some may scoff at the habit, but I use each one for 3 or 4 rounds before the thread gets a bit too worn down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please keep stocking them.</li>
            <li> i love love love these things. so much easier to use these than normal floss. and when they get loose you can make them tight by squeezing them. and i wash mine after using so i can use them twice. no, that is not gross.</li>
            <li> WAY better than any store brand.  Love the tensioning handle, simple but effective.  I didn&#x27;t realize how many I had ordered, but I&#x27;m glad I got so many.  I have a bag a work, a few bags here and there around the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll certainly order more when I finally run out.</li>
            <li> Worth any amount--they are really teeth savers and extremely easy to use</li>
            <li> They are the best flossers on the market.  Anyone who tells you differently, look closely at their teeth.  The evidence will prove itself.</li>
            <li> As always these are the best of the Glide floss picks, so I was glad to replenish my supply. I have no idea why I can&#x27;t find them in my area. I am just glad I found them online.</li>
            <li> First these floss picks are Crest and then Oral B. I understand that the product changed branding. HOWEVER,now they aren&#x27;t even picks anymore? Seriously Amazon, what&#x27;s the point of subscribe and save if you keep changing the product that the subscription is for.</li>
            <li> This is the only floss pick I will use! It is strong, easy to slide between teeth, does not cut your gums, and I can&#x27;t find them in stores. Thank you! You have a customer for life!</li>
            <li> Very hard to find but they are the best in the market.  I especially like the grip and the floss doesn&#x27;t split.  Your teeth feel clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> The Glide dental picks are easy to use, and convenient for the car, office, bathroom or travel.  They are much easier to manouver around your mouth than ordinary dental floss.  Do you have \\&quot;leftovers\\&quot; after visiting that new Brazilian Meat Restaurant?  No problem, these Glide floss picks will make short work of it.  The seller shipped the product on time and it was well packaged.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love this item - it used to be in local drug stores, but for some strange reason they&#x27;ve stopped carrying it in favor of those flat floss/picks that can&#x27;t get all the way in the back of your mouth without twisting and turning the pick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the floss pick that rules them all.  Great design.  My only gripe here is that the floss seems to wear out after a few uses.  Perhaps it&#x27;s my imagination, but it seemed like earlier versions of this pick would last longer than that.  Small concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to buy a case every couple of months, and stick a bag in my car.  Flossing during my drives makes me feel (and my dentist) feel good.</li>
            <li> I love these things. Way better than regular dental floss. I wish they still sold them locally in my area.</li>
            <li> I received my order promptly and I was able to floss my teeth! This is an Excellent product and it makes it much easier to floss. I am a quadriplegic and I&#x27;m able to floss my teeth without help!</li>
            <li> These are the best on the market.  I just wish I could find locally in my drugstore, super marts, and grocery stores, but non one stocks them.</li>
            <li> These are the best floss sticks I have ever used!  I would recommend them.  Even though it&#x27;s a large quantity, it still beats the cost of the item if purchased in the store.  We bought enough to get free shipping which really decreased the price of the item.</li>
            <li> I can verify that this is the exact same product that I ordered from this page in 2011, with the only difference being that it has the Oral-B name on the package instead of Crest.  Putting a pick from each package next to each other, I could not tell the difference, so this is an example of Oral-B buying the product from Crest and keeping it the way it was.  Good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The supplied picture isn&#x27;t very good.  The tail end is a full 1/2&amp;#34; long (beyond the bottom opening) tapering down to a thin, flexible pick, with a slightly blunted end so you don&#x27;t poke yourself. Much more useful than a toothpick. And the yoke that holds the floss curves slightly down to make it easier to get the floss between teeth (flip it the other way for the upper teeth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, squeezing it tightens the floss, which is quite nice.  Whether you&#x27;ve got tight gaps and need it to get the floss in there, or very wide gaps and need a good tool to dislodge trapped food, this is a very useful item.</li>
            <li> great hygiene ite. Very hard to find in stores. This is the only brand my wife uses. Kee in stock.</li>
            <li> This is a very handy and sturdy tool.  It makes the back teeth so much easier to reach for flossing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these since 2005, when I broke my left wrist and needed an alternative to flossing, since I could only use one hand to floss.  I&#x27;ve been using them ever since.  These are great to travel with, use in the car, store in purse, etc.  I use them daily.  The floss is strong, rarely breaks; the shape allows for reaching the back teeth easily and effectively.</li>
            <li> I am a dentist and bought hundreds of these to give out to my patients.  The best flossers on the market by far.  Easy to floss with.  Not hard to get in between your teeth... and not hard to get back out.  That&#x27;s because of the tape floss and the ability to squeeze the handle to make the floss taught.  Easy to fit in the back teeth.  No excuse not to floss.  The only complaint I would have is that the Oral-B/Glide company has not made it easy for me to purchase sample or pre-packaged products from them to give to my patients.  They just refer me to the retail stores.  Poor service from Oral-B, but Amazon delivered these in a day or 2.  Excellent service.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find these in any local drugstores, grocery stores or super walmarts. They are the only ones that I can use to reach all the way back behind my wisdom teeth. They also get between my very tight teeth. I hope they are still being made!</li>
            <li> I have found these picks to have the strongest floss. It doesn&#x27;t break easily.You won&#x27;t be disappointed. My brand of choice.</li>
            <li> I bought these at Amazon since I can&#x27;t seem to find these anywhere else any more.  Local Wallgreens and CVS carry only the cheaper ones that don&#x27;t work as well.  These floss picks allow you to squeeze the handle to tighten the floss.</li>
            <li> I bought a different brand by accident the last time, but came back to these because they&#x27;re the best. The floss is not flimsy like some other brands, the handle is easy to hold &amp; it all seems to be a better design overall. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the mfg. has stopped making one brand of these identical picks which work really well.  My dentist is very unhappy that I&#x27;ve found these.  I would recommend these to a friend.  I hope I can buy them again.</li>
            <li> I cannot under stand why their not carried in local stores. I hope that they keep making them, they bet all others hands down.</li>
            <li> Our family has tried every floss pick on the market, and these are the best we&#x27;ve found. We need floss picks because my young daughters are not able/willing to use string floss and my wife prefers a tidy alternative. For me, since I have very tight teeth, these still shred, and they don&#x27;t stimulate my gums as much as separate string floss. Still, I think they&#x27;re really good for what they are.</li>
            <li> For any of you that are wondering, these are the best floss picks out there.  All the others are flimsy, cheap and the string breaks or gets so loose you feel like your tring to pull out your teeth instead of floss them. There is an area you squeeze to tighten the string up again, it is amazing. As you can tell I am a fanatic about my teeth and I have tried everything.  These by far are my one and only choice as far as floss, floss picks are concerned.  You really should give them a try and decide for yourself.</li>
            <li> best floss tool. very strong, glide floss is slick enough to slide between tight spaces</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for many years. They were manufactured by Gore before being taken over by Crest. They are hard to find in most retail brick &amp; mortar stores, probably because they&#x27;re more expensive. They are well worth the extra money. The less expensive picks just plain don&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> My CVS has had an empty slot on the rack for this for months, but never gets it in stock. So glad to see it here. Only way it could be better is if the body were made of recyclable/recycled plastic. Otherwise, one of technology&#x27;s great triumphs. (Imagine, being so taken by a floss pick?!!) It&#x27;s THAT good.</li>
            <li> These are the best and well worth the price.  Tried others and none are as good.  Be sure to check prices - several vendors sell these on Amazon for very different prices.</li>
            <li> My 5-yr-old daughter loves these flossers!  When her dentist told me they were no longer being made, I was glad to find these on Amazon.  They work very well for her tightly-spaced teeth.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best pick on the market today. I&#x27;ve tried several other brands but Glide is the strongest  and silky smooth.</li>
            <li> These Glide Floss Picks make flossing so easy that there is no excuse not to floss.  You only need one hand. Regular floss is still better, but this tool is the lazy person&#x27;s answer to flossing. I use it daily and carry one in my purse.</li>
            <li> If you like floss picks this is the best one I have ever found.  One of the best things is that the pick end is not sharp but rounded so that you can carry it in your pocket and not worry about stabbing yourself in the leg!  The side of the pick bend so that you can adjust the tension on the floss piece as needed.  Try it - you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> Good product. I use them regularly. I really do not know why it is impossible to obtain them locally. End</li>
            <li> Great price for an xcellent product good value on a product that is hard 2 find these days and hope 2 purchase more thanks again Amazon.</li>
            <li> These are absolutely the best.  No cutting off the circulation to your fingertips, no stringy things for the dog to pick out of the trash. Perhaps we who love them are uncoordinated, but the ability to control the tension should be appreciated by anyone who hasn&#x27;t tried them.  Unfortunately, they aren&#x27;t available in stores anymore, for some ridiculous reason only known by Glide. Thank heaven for AMAZON; I stocked up.  Try &#x27;em!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never managed to get comfortable with regular floss, but these things make up for it.  They&#x27;re durable and comfortable, and don&#x27;t tear like the cheap ones I can buy in my local stores.</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t believe that these flossers have nothing but positive reviews; I&#x27;ve tried just about every style available, and these Glide ones were the worst. Consistent problems with breakage and getting stuck. D: The GUM ones were mostly okay; the Wild Flossers dinosaur-shaped ones were great except that the shapes are sometimes difficult to hold and can make them very uncomfortable to use. By far the best flossers I&#x27;ve found as an older person (and they are absolutely the more effective, efficient, comfortable, and overall better flossing method, to be sure*) are the Crayola kid&#x27;s ones! For whatever reason, the children&#x27;s seem to be far better than the \\&quot;adult\\&quot; ones (not that there ought to be much of a difference in the products aside from the obvious shapes and colors.) Or maybe I just have small teeth, who knows...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Flossers SO superior to \\&quot;regular\\&quot; floss that one has to wonder why they were not the original, logical, obvious, perfect invention.</li>
            <li> Great product, have not been able to find these at the place I used to buy them.  Glad to find them on Amazon.  They are great.</li>
            <li> I bought these a while back but ran out.  This is a second order and I was reluctant to order so much since some reviewers say the new ones are inferior quality to the original ones and may break easily.  My experience has not been bad.  They work as well as the originals and the kids love them.  The photo doesn&#x27;t show the rear of the picks very well but they also serve double duty as a light soft tip scraper.  Squeeze the flat sides and it increase the tension for those stubborn tight gaps between teeth that are hard to penetrate.  The &amp;#34;Glide&amp;#34; floss is smooth and yet easy to use and still cleans out the areas between your teeth without wearing them out like some unwaxed floss can.  Overall I give these a 5 star and will continue to use them as long as they are still made.</li>
            <li> Previous purchases of this product from Amazon were branded \\&quot;Crest Glide Picks\\&quot; and they were excellent. The most recent shipment I received as part of a \\&quot;subscribe and save\\&quot; purchase were branded \\&quot;Oral B Glide Picks\\&quot;. Physically they appear identical, but the quality of the Oral B product is horrible and the floss breaks constantly. I will not be buying these again and have cancelled the S&amp;S option.</li>
            <li> These little guys came the day after I ordered (Soap.com).  I&#x27;ve been trying to find the squeeze-to-tighten kind in stores for a while now but they seem to have disappeared - these work great.</li>
            <li> Most dental floss sticks have when we&#x27;ll call a &amp;#34;crossbar&amp;#34; design, where the floss is stretched between two solid arms of plastic. The problem there is that the floss breaks away from the plastic bars while you&#x27;re using it so by the time you get to your last rows of teeth the floss is barely even usable (if it hasn&#x27;t completely snapped off). These sticks fix that problem by giving you the ability to make the floss stretch by squeezing the &amp;#34;bow and arrow&amp;#34; style contraption. This makes it MUCH more like using a traditional string of floss but much faster, much more hygienic, and much more efficient. These things are worth their weight in gold and I would never even think about getting a different floss stick.</li>
            <li> Everyone who knows me knows I have an &amp;#34;issue&amp;#34; when it comes to floss picks. I use 2-4 per day. So I can say with confidence that I&#x27;ve tried them all. The Glide floss pick is by far the best one, good design for hard to reach places, and easily slides between teeth without fraying, breaking, or getting snagged. Take my word for it, if you&#x27;re in to floss picks as much as me, these are the ones you want.</li>
            <li> These work really well for flossing.  So much easier and more convenient than regular floss.  The pick side of the floss picks is a little too flimsy to use with much success (hence the four stars) but the floss side works great and I have yet to have one break.</li>
            <li> The photo shows Glide floss, but the item description says \\&quot;floss picks.\\&quot; Very confusing! Especially for those of us who were searching for other drugstore-type items and this came up in a \\&quot;Frequently Bought Together\\&quot; package so we purchased what we assumed was shown in the photo, only to open up a box of stupid picks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who uses these things, anyway? Are your fingers THAT big, you can&#x27;t get &#x27;em in your mouth?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boo!</li>
            <li> These picks are the best on the market, they don&#x27;t shear like other brands and glide between teeth.  Although some might think this gross, they are reusable for several uses!  Hard to find in stores.  Load up while you can.</li>
            <li> Are by far the BEST floss picks!!  The design allows you to squeeze the handle which provides tension for the floss.  Glide is also a very silky floss so it actually glides on your teeth...I have tried them all and these are the best!</li>
            <li> These floss picks are sturdy and will last you a long time. They are way less messy and gross than regular floss. I highly recommend if you are a regular flosser.</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth and tight teeth. This is the ONLY brand I&#x27;ve found that works for me. No way to use string wrapped around my fingers. Even the dental hygienists have a problem after their cleanings using the finger method. These are so much better then the ones with the skinny pointed handle end supposed to function as a pick. You cannot grip them and control the angle and turn them. Useless. I get 2-3X use out of each one of these Crest floss before the string shreds. The ones I tried with the unbreakable floss felt like wire jamming into my gums. Aweful. THESE ARE THE BEST!!</li>
            <li> Have been buying these for years.  So much easier to use than the other picks and regular dental floss.</li>
            <li> These are impossible to find at a discount store..sure you can find some at a drug store with a big cost, but these are the real thing..sure you have to buy alot at one time but well worth the peace of mind</li>
            <li> I keep these near my desk and clean my teeth regularly (I work from home so its not too gross). This makes flossing so much easier. you can floss twice or three times a day once you get used to it. They don&#x27;t break too easily either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a DDS (retired).  I discarded other forms of floss years ago.  I&#x27;ve used them exclusively, and recommended them to my patients for many years.  I have yet to find a more effective Oral Hygiene product.</li>
            <li> My husband loves these because they are stiff and he can get them between his teeth without them bending and/or breaking.</li>
            <li> I used to get these at Target but not anymore.  My dentist recommended these to me, and they are great if you have a small mouth or for those hard to reach places that other picks can&#x27;t get into.</li>
            <li> I like using the floss picks &amp; have found them only available on the internet. They are the best for me.</li>
            <li> best floss pick in the market. Store it everything: in the cars, bathroom, office....Buy bulk to save from this vendor.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended these and after baulking at the price for a while I thought I&#x27;d try them, and they are a-mazing! I have always hated dental floss, which I often seemed to cut myself with when using, to say nothing of the pain in my fingers from winding it around them to get sufficient traction to get between my teeth. I also detested the long strings of used floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had tried more standard floss picks and completely failed to use them, such that I had gone back to the dratted dental floss. But these particular unusual-shaped floss picks are very different. They are so very easy to use, unlike dental floss or more simple floss picks. They are so perfect ergonomically -- a work of ergonomic design art, indeed. For a start, you don&#x27;t have to open your mouth very far at all, unlike when wrestling with dental floss and back teeth. You simple squeeze the floss pick to create sufficient tension in the floss to make it easy to get it between your teeth, then release it to floss each of the two teeth it is between, then squeeze to create enough tension to draw it out and move on to the next bit. So easy, and there is something aesthetically pleasing about the shape and the feel of these floss picks. Friends have laughed when I have said that, but several have, once they have tried them themselves, admitted that my enthusiasm is actually justified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Must order some more. Everyone seems to want to try them so the quantity I thought would last ages hasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, to avoid confusion, their actual name is not just &amp;#34;Glide floss picks&amp;#34;, it is &amp;#34;Oral-B Glide Pro-health Clinical Protection floss picks&amp;#34;. The &amp;#34;pro-health&amp;#34; makes a difference in internet searches for this product.</li>
            <li> Love these floss pics just wish they came individually wrapped so you could carry some in your pocket. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> These picks work better than anything being sold today. The fact that they are not manufactured anymore is a shame. I bought a years worth. Don&#x27;t know what I will do when they are gone. Maybe some enterprising manufacturer will see the potential and pick them up and put them back in stores.</li>
            <li> Wonderful read! Barbara has inspired me to hit the road in search of the adventure and fun I&#x27;ve been longing for.</li>
            <li> Our favorite flosser.  The angle is the best available.</li>
            <li> then try this. My teeth are close together. And I have a hell of a time getting regular floss in and out of every gap. These things are much easier.</li>
            <li> Obviously I&#x27;m not the only one who realizes how awesome this product is, apparently it becomes quickly scarce to find in stores ( they must sell out quick)  I usually need to order online to get any.</li>
            <li> The best picks for cleaning the teeth</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d be surprised at a feature that these have which no other pick I&#x27;ve seen does; the ability to provide tension on the floss just by squeezing the handle. I&#x27;ve never had one of them break on me and I floss pretty hard. I also like the orientation of the floss relative to the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only negative is that the base of the handle has a pick in it (for those who use a pick) and when you&#x27;re holding this thing to floss, that pick can be sharp and dig into your hand. The problem is pretty easily solved by bending the pick so it doesn&#x27;t pierce your hand but I guess it&#x27;s worth mentioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I love &#x27;em.</li>
