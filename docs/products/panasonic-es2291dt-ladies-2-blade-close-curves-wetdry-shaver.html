    <ol>
            <li>got this for my lady,  she says it works great!  </li>
            <li>The best part about it is that is runs on batteries.</li>
            <li>If this lasts six years I will be extremely happy!</li>
            <li>Best shaver I have ever</li>
            <li>Not the best shaver I ever had, but</li>
            <li>This shaver is not the best choice for the bikini area...  </li>
            <li>Great Shaver!</li>
            <li>I am very impressed.</li>
            <li>Not quite, but I have to say it does a great job, and I don&#x27;t cut myself!</li>
            <li>The best thing about this is that you don&#x27;t cut yourself while you&#x27;re shaving.</li>

            <li>Works great!!</li>

            <li>daughter loved it ...arrived on time for christmas..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a great price for an incredibly handy product.</li>
            <li>The cap stays on well, which is good for travel.  </li>
            <li>I found to my surprise that this razor was good.  </li>

            <li>I was pleased that it also was a great purchase.</li>
            <li>Love the pop up trimmer, works great for for longer out of control hairs.</li>
            <li>it looked nice and i was hoping it would cut good</li>
            <li>I love this item!  </li>
            <li>spend more and get the rechargeable one!</li>
            <li>What more could a girl want?!</li>
            <li>Just remove the top and rinse it under the shower head!</li>
            <li>Love everything about this!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>and it has tackled that nicely.</li>
            <li>and I liked that one.</li>
            <li>Like it but kind of hurts sometimes.</li>
            <li>my skin used to get really irritated when i shaved and now is just perfect.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure if i would like this but with the good reviews i took a chance.</li>
            <li>I suppose my own fault as you get what you pay for</li>
            <li>This shaver is quite handy.  </li>
            <li>I am so impressed with the product and ease in which I was able to locate exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>a shaver should, and the design is very easy to work with.  </li>
            <li>And her favorite color is orange - what more can a girl ask for?!?</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve been very happy with this purchase and lets see how it holds up for shorts season!</li>
            <li>I look forward to using the razor as it is the most comfortable and fits my hand extremely good.  </li>
            <li>I have very light hair on my legs (like a tweenager).</li>
            <li>Lucky me, my leg hair is sparse and fair</li>
            <li>but its not- :)</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this shaver.</li>
            <li>Over all I am very happy with this shaver especially for the price! :)</li>
            <li>I think there are definitely better electric shavers out there</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes it works better than others.  </li>
            <li>I have now purchased a women&#x27;s Remington and love it.</li>
            <li>I could not be more pleased with the Panasonic ES2291.  </li>
            <li>Love it, Love it..</li>
            <li>I love this shaver as it is nice, and smooth on your skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve discovered a MUCH better shaver,</li>
            <li>also scratches, a problem with many of these Chinese-made ladies shavers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that it is battery operated and doesn&#x27;t need to be charged.  </li>
            <li>I picked this brand because I wasn&#x27;t sure what to pick.</li>
            <li>I found I do love this product.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>The pop-up trimmer is especially good at trimming some of the longer out of control hairs that the foil simply cannot get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Says this is a much better alternative than using a cartridge blade shaver that can nick the skin.  </li>
            <li>This is an update as below I stated I love the razor</li>
            <li>love this Shaver...</li>
            <li>Most of the reviews raved about the product, but not for me.  </li>
            <li>NOT RECHARGEABLE and BATTERIES NEEDED should be prominent in the description.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the fact that I can use in the shower.</li>
            <li>Works better if use with a lubricant...conditioner etc.  </li>
            <li>Easy to order and not outrageously priced.</li>
            <li>It is handy for travel or when I just need a quick touch-up.</li>
            <li>Good product, fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>But it works pretty nicely on my legs which mostly have fine hairs.</li>
            <li>I have not read reviews for any other product that that state they are perfect.  </li>
            <li>However, this is an excellent product and works extremely well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and is easy to pack for travel.  </li>
            <li>It gets the job done easily.</li>
            <li>gives  a clean cut better</li>
            <li>She loves the  petite size and it&#x27;s easy operation.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product if you are looking for a darn good wet/dry ladies shaver.</li>
            <li>The design fits your hand perfectly and you can use it upside down, in circles, etc.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s fine with me.</li>
            <li>It worked fine, until one day, it just stopped working mid-shave.</li>
            <li>Did a fine job on bikini line also.  </li>
            <li>but it works fine either way.</li>
            <li>Maybe leave a fine layer of stuble.</li>
            <li>The trimmer feature was fine, but I wanted a closer shave.  </li>
            <li>i do find that using a razor gives me more time between each leg shave, but this is a quick process when you are in a rush.</li>
            <li>For the price this is the best little electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li>Although looking nice and stylish, it&#x27;s a complete junk.</li>
            <li>All the way around this is just a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is not as smooth as it should be</li>
            <li>I wish I would have fought my cheap urge and bought one that works.</li>
            <li>razor is fantastic as it can be used either in the shower or out of the shower.</li>
            <li>This razor fit in your hand well and like the fact it runs on batterys so traveling is a breeze.  </li>
            <li>Liked it so much</li>
            <li>Works great and batteries last awhile.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as fast as a hand held (maybe that&#x27;s why I nick myself), but it does a nice job.  </li>
            <li>For a smooth comfortable shave, use this two blade shaver.</li>
            <li>Panasonic fits comfortably in my hand and works like a charm.  </li>
            <li>But if all you want is something cheap that works, this will do.</li>
            <li>Very good for underarms due to the curves of the blades.</li>
            <li>Really great, get the long hairs with the one blade and the shorter blade shaves really smoothly</li>
            <li>I own one, and it does just as good a job as this shaver, but for a lot less money.</li>
            <li>Now that it&#x27;s past the return window, and I made the mistake of throwing out the package and warranty info, I&#x27;m S.O.L. Lesson learned: stick with what works (disposable Bic Daisy shavers for the win)!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get much of a clean shave</li>
            <li>VERY close shave and easy to clean!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad razor, but it&#x27;s nothing special either.</li>
            <li>Overall the performance is reasonably good.</li>
            <li>Well when I did after using the shaver - I noticed that my hair was very long and the razor was combing it over nicely when I thought it was shaving the hair off!  </li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>and this was a pretty cheap purchase.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I&#x27;m good enough with a scissors that I can take care of that on my own, but if I wasn&#x27;t I might have been sending this back.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already purchased a new one for when this one gets dropped one to many times.  </li>
            <li>Product Arrived on time and looks exactly like the picture!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lighter than the one it replaced and works on AAA batteries, which may be why it&#x27;s not as powerful.  </li>
            <li>I may add comments after using shaver more frequently.</li>
            <li>Well worth its price.&lt;br /&gt;An</li>
            <li>Nor is it much good as a &#x27;wet&#x27; shaver.  </li>
            <li>the Panasonic ES3831 Wet/Dry battery operated shaver never bites/snags your skin and is very easy for daily use; it&#x27;s my new favorite</li>
            <li>At first you will get some mild razor burn.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to get new batteries</li>
            <li>I liked the attractive color, and the price was even less than I expected.  </li>
            <li>Great little razor!  </li>
            <li>if needs be (or to bring more eneloop reusable longer lasting than disposable batteries).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This shaver is more environmentally friendly than rechargeable-shavers as rechargeable shavers do not have mass recycling options as standard batteries do.  </li>
            <li>She is very particular about getting the right product to shave her legs.  </li>
            <li>I have had many different electric shavers that are \\&quot;rechargeable\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Thanks!  </li>
            <li>Fast quality packing and shipping though!</li>
            <li>It works exactly like</li>
            <li>, not sorry I got it.  </li>
            <li>a first timer using the shaver could use this with no problem ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,</li>
            <li>My first electric shaver.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>I think batteries can sometimes be better for the simple reason</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The wet/dry shaver is ok, especially when I travel.  </li>
            <li>you will have to &amp;#34;go over&amp;#34; the area multiple times but it is better than having to lather and shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will become a natural part of my normal grooming process.</li>
            <li>Does a great job, (have only used it dry)</li>
            <li>Wife and daughter very happy with razors, didn&#x27;t want built in rechargeable battery after several past experiences with built in dying after short period of time and razors becoming e-waste.</li>
            <li>Will be using a regular disposable razor and new bikini trimmer until I can find a suitable replacement.</li>
            <li>Works great, light weight,fits into the hand nicely, no recharging needed (simply change batteries).</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m always sure to lotion up after I use it on dry</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a trimmer than \\&quot;shaver\\&quot; -- and if done dry.</li>
            <li>It is simple and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is reasonably priced and does a pretty decent job.  </li>
            <li>No sharp instruments allowed in the nursing home, and I never expected my mom to be pleased with an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>It works better and I can just plug it in again to charge, also the charger is very small and easy to pack.</li>
            <li>and I can be ready for a touch up anywhere.</li>
            <li>but this Panasonic product is stainless steel</li>
            <li>The description is very deceiving, as the guard shown in the picture is not a part of the package.</li>
            <li>AND it pulls nearly as much hair as it</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>The shave is very smooth--as smooth as can be expected from a wet/dry razor, but given the cost and time savings (legs are shaved within 10 minutes), this is well worth purchasing.</li>
            <li>The razor give a very close shave if used with shaving cream on your legs and armpits.  </li>
            <li>so dont really use this as a trimmer.</li>
            <li>- didn&#x27;t really look under my arms.  </li>
            <li>The razor, not so much.  </li>
            <li>Much nicer.</li>
            <li>I really like this shaver.  </li>
            <li>I have been  very hesitant in even buying an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>Not quite what I had expected but works ok.</li>
            <li>Also the anti slip grip works really well</li>
            <li>This died way too fast.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to have to change the batteries that much.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a cheap, basic shaver with a pop-up trimmer and</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;m just either a good reader or just totally naive.</li>
            <li>Had no idea that this razor runs on batteries; not very cost effective for major hair removal days, which by the way is every Saturday, thanks for asking.</li>
            <li>Love that it isnt pink!  </li>
            <li>Lightweight, easy to hold and to use, shaves close even dry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier on your skin in the long run if you take the minute or two to just go over it daily with the Panasonic ES3831 and your significant other may like that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE that it takes a full month for skin to adjust to any new shaving system; to avoid skin irritation use a shaving rash product more than once a day</li>
            <li>The popup shaver did a nice job under arms and other areas that require a more delicate touch.  </li>
            <li>After my more expensive Empoli razor, more than triple the price of this razor, quit after two years, I vowed never to pay that amount of money again for a wet/dry razor.</li>
            <li>This razor does not promise the world, but it sure promised more than the expensive razor could produce.</li>
            <li>It eventually cuts most of the hair, but it takes multiple passes at different angles and directions to accomplish this.  </li>
            <li>actually I get a better shave with a regular razor    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend it to any woman.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>High quality product and works as promised.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and gives a close shave when compared to other shavers.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually found that it works a bit better on dry skin</li>
            <li>I used it after trimming down everything with scissors first, then used the shaver to carefully remove the remains to a clean shave, you do have to be careful though, but even doing this for the first time it went very well, and the second time was even better.</li>
            <li>It will do a decent job, but I find that I have to let my leg hair get mighty long to get a close enough shave.</li>
            <li>I was surprised on how close it gets for an electric shaver!</li>
            <li>My first &amp; last .</li>
            <li>It comes with a little cleaning brush too so cleaning is easy.</li>
            <li>I love the wet and dry shaving capability.</li>
            <li>I pretty much agree with all the other reviews.</li>
            <li>The blades are dull and the trimmer is more nicking than trimming.</li>
            <li>The cutting power is great as well.</li>
            <li>I never saw that clearly in the description--that you have to keep putting AA batteries in.</li>
            <li>my legs are smooth without the harsh pull of an epilator.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The battery lasts pretty long, although towards the end of the battery life, the motor isn&#x27;t as powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve since donated all of my old shavers (including the one I&#x27;m reviewing here).  </li>
            <li>For what I paid, it does a reasonable job, but at its present price, I&#x27;d look elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>It does a reasonable job on underarms with multiple passes required to get the job done.  </li>
            <li>I really like this shaver because it allows me to get a close enough shave that I would wear a swimsuit but not so close that I get the ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>then my old razor..</li>
            <li>I have an old Panasonic which doesn&#x27;t hold a charge well anymore, but still shaves closer than this one.  </li>
            <li>This shaver does an adequate job, but the batteries don&#x27;t last long at all.  </li>
            <li>ok if you use it daily, move the shaver as slowly as possible to avoid pulling/snags, and avoid the pop-up feature as it is sharp and will scratch you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is no,pinching, it&#x27;s easy to use and it runs on two small AAA batteries.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive, allergy prone skin and have not had success using other products for hair</li>
            <li>First time I tried it dry.</li>
            <li>The item was returned after first use, highly NOT recommended.</li>
            <li>Was decent enough.</li>
            <li>I  think it did a little bit better  job in the shower than it did dry</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t give you the same close shave that you&#x27;ll get with a traditional double or triple blade razor, but it&#x27;s good in a pinch when you don&#x27;t have time to shave your legs or underarms and you need to at least look hairless.</li>
            <li>I can use dry or wet and gives a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money, spend a few extra bucks and get something good.</li>
            <li>item is new so have no further comment until I have used it for awhile...</li>
            <li>for winter its much easier on my dry legs.  </li>
            <li>I was specifically looking for a low cost battery operated shaver as I had read all the reviews about the low cost rechargeables that seemed to loose their battery life too quickly.</li>
            <li>and I am planning on trying other brand at higher prices.</li>
            <li>by no means a razor shave, but fairly close for my dark thick hairs, and only takes a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>The blade is too wide for certain areas, and it catches the hair without clipping it.</li>
            <li>And in a pinch, you have to get your whole bathroom wet to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Back to my old fashioned razor.</li>
            <li>Stopped working after barely 2 months use.</li>
            <li>; I mean my husband can&#x27;t really see it until it&#x27;s super long.</li>
            <li>good item.. but design flaw because difficult to read plus or minus to install batteries...</li>
            <li>The first couple of times I used it dry, but then decided to try it wet.</li>
            <li>This shaver is particularly environmentally friendly if you use Eneloop rechargeable batteries and Eneloops last MUCH longer between charges than built-in-battery shavers (Eneloops lasts at least twice as long as disposables and they&#x27;ll pay for themselves within a few uses).</li>
            <li>This was my first razor that was not a cheap throwaway.  </li>
            <li>beef with this thing is that once the batteries ran down (which didn&#x27;t seem to take much), it stopped working.</li>
            <li>electric razor is really lifesaver when you&#x27;re in a rush and look down to find than your legs have 3 inches of hair on them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Left scratches on my legs &amp; didn&#x27;t shave very close (probably the same as 3-4 days after shaving with a razor), really loud, waste of money.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised with such a low quality product made by a pretty reputable brand, but it was indeed a very disappointing experience.</li>
            <li>After reading several reviews of this particular product, both on Amazon, and other sites, I decided to get this shaver.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted something to use dry, as if I shave wet, I might as well use a razor blade.</li>

            <li> I love this item!  </li>
            <li> spend more and get the rechargeable one!</li>
            <li> What more could a girl want?!</li>

            <li> Love everything about this!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> and it has tackled that nicely.</li>
            <li> and I liked that one.</li>
            <li> Like it but kind of hurts sometimes.</li>
            <li> my skin used to get really irritated when i shaved and now is just perfect.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if i would like this but with the good reviews i took a chance.</li>
            <li> I suppose my own fault as you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> This shaver is quite handy.  </li>
            <li> I am so impressed with the product and ease in which I was able to locate exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> a shaver should, and the design is very easy to work with.  </li>
            <li> And her favorite color is orange - what more can a girl ask for?!?</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been very happy with this purchase and lets see how it holds up for shorts season!</li>
            <li> I look forward to using the razor as it is the most comfortable and fits my hand extremely good.  </li>
            <li> I have very light hair on my legs (like a tweenager).</li>
            <li> Lucky me, my leg hair is sparse and fair</li>
            <li> but its not- :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shaver.</li>
            <li> Over all I am very happy with this shaver especially for the price! :)</li>
            <li> I think there are definitely better electric shavers out there</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes it works better than others.  </li>
            <li> I have now purchased a women&#x27;s Remington and love it.</li>
            <li> I could not be more pleased with the Panasonic ES2291.  </li>
            <li> Love it, Love it..</li>
            <li> I love this shaver as it is nice, and smooth on your skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve discovered a MUCH better shaver,</li>
            <li> also scratches, a problem with many of these Chinese-made ladies shavers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that it is battery operated and doesn&#x27;t need to be charged.  </li>
            <li> I picked this brand because I wasn&#x27;t sure what to pick.</li>
            <li> I found I do love this product.</li>
            <li> Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> The pop-up trimmer is especially good at trimming some of the longer out of control hairs that the foil simply cannot get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Says this is a much better alternative than using a cartridge blade shaver that can nick the skin.  </li>
            <li> This is an update as below I stated I love the razor</li>
            <li> love this Shaver...</li>
            <li> Most of the reviews raved about the product, but not for me.  </li>
            <li> NOT RECHARGEABLE and BATTERIES NEEDED should be prominent in the description.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the fact that I can use in the shower.</li>
            <li> Works better if use with a lubricant...conditioner etc.  </li>
            <li> Easy to order and not outrageously priced.</li>
            <li> It is handy for travel or when I just need a quick touch-up.</li>
            <li> Good product, fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> But it works pretty nicely on my legs which mostly have fine hairs.</li>
            <li> I have not read reviews for any other product that that state they are perfect.  </li>
            <li> However, this is an excellent product and works extremely well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and is easy to pack for travel.  </li>
            <li> It gets the job done easily.</li>
            <li> gives  a clean cut better</li>
            <li> She loves the  petite size and it&#x27;s easy operation.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product if you are looking for a darn good wet/dry ladies shaver.</li>
            <li> The design fits your hand perfectly and you can use it upside down, in circles, etc.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s fine with me.</li>
            <li> It worked fine, until one day, it just stopped working mid-shave.</li>
            <li> Did a fine job on bikini line also.  </li>
            <li> but it works fine either way.</li>
            <li> Maybe leave a fine layer of stuble.</li>
            <li> The trimmer feature was fine, but I wanted a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> i do find that using a razor gives me more time between each leg shave, but this is a quick process when you are in a rush.</li>
            <li> For the price this is the best little electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li> Although looking nice and stylish, it&#x27;s a complete junk.</li>
            <li> All the way around this is just a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is not as smooth as it should be</li>
            <li> I wish I would have fought my cheap urge and bought one that works.</li>
            <li> razor is fantastic as it can be used either in the shower or out of the shower.</li>
            <li> This razor fit in your hand well and like the fact it runs on batterys so traveling is a breeze.  </li>
            <li> Liked it so much</li>
            <li> Works great and batteries last awhile.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as fast as a hand held (maybe that&#x27;s why I nick myself), but it does a nice job.  </li>
            <li> For a smooth comfortable shave, use this two blade shaver.</li>
            <li> Panasonic fits comfortably in my hand and works like a charm.  </li>
            <li> But if all you want is something cheap that works, this will do.</li>
            <li> Very good for underarms due to the curves of the blades.</li>
            <li> Really great, get the long hairs with the one blade and the shorter blade shaves really smoothly</li>
            <li> I own one, and it does just as good a job as this shaver, but for a lot less money.</li>
            <li> Now that it&#x27;s past the return window, and I made the mistake of throwing out the package and warranty info, I&#x27;m S.O.L. Lesson learned: stick with what works (disposable Bic Daisy shavers for the win)!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get much of a clean shave</li>
            <li> VERY close shave and easy to clean!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad razor, but it&#x27;s nothing special either.</li>
            <li> Overall the performance is reasonably good.</li>
            <li> Well when I did after using the shaver - I noticed that my hair was very long and the razor was combing it over nicely when I thought it was shaving the hair off!  </li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> and this was a pretty cheap purchase.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Fortunately I&#x27;m good enough with a scissors that I can take care of that on my own, but if I wasn&#x27;t I might have been sending this back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already purchased a new one for when this one gets dropped one to many times.  </li>
            <li> Product Arrived on time and looks exactly like the picture!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lighter than the one it replaced and works on AAA batteries, which may be why it&#x27;s not as powerful.  </li>
            <li> I may add comments after using shaver more frequently.</li>
            <li> Well worth its price.&lt;br /&gt;An</li>
            <li> Nor is it much good as a &#x27;wet&#x27; shaver.  </li>
            <li> the Panasonic ES3831 Wet/Dry battery operated shaver never bites/snags your skin and is very easy for daily use; it&#x27;s my new favorite</li>
            <li> At first you will get some mild razor burn.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to get new batteries</li>
            <li> I liked the attractive color, and the price was even less than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Great little razor!  </li>
            <li> if needs be (or to bring more eneloop reusable longer lasting than disposable batteries).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This shaver is more environmentally friendly than rechargeable-shavers as rechargeable shavers do not have mass recycling options as standard batteries do.  </li>
            <li> She is very particular about getting the right product to shave her legs.  </li>
            <li> I have had many different electric shavers that are \\&quot;rechargeable\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Thanks!  </li>
            <li> Fast quality packing and shipping though!</li>
            <li> It works exactly like</li>
            <li> , not sorry I got it.  </li>
            <li> a first timer using the shaver could use this with no problem ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,</li>
            <li> My first electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> I think batteries can sometimes be better for the simple reason</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> The wet/dry shaver is ok, especially when I travel.  </li>
            <li> you will have to &amp;#34;go over&amp;#34; the area multiple times but it is better than having to lather and shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it will become a natural part of my normal grooming process.</li>
            <li> Does a great job, (have only used it dry)</li>
            <li> Wife and daughter very happy with razors, didn&#x27;t want built in rechargeable battery after several past experiences with built in dying after short period of time and razors becoming e-waste.</li>
            <li> Will be using a regular disposable razor and new bikini trimmer until I can find a suitable replacement.</li>
            <li> Works great, light weight,fits into the hand nicely, no recharging needed (simply change batteries).</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m always sure to lotion up after I use it on dry</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a trimmer than \\&quot;shaver\\&quot; -- and if done dry.</li>
            <li> It is simple and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is reasonably priced and does a pretty decent job.  </li>
            <li> No sharp instruments allowed in the nursing home, and I never expected my mom to be pleased with an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> It works better and I can just plug it in again to charge, also the charger is very small and easy to pack.</li>
            <li> and I can be ready for a touch up anywhere.</li>
            <li> but this Panasonic product is stainless steel</li>
            <li> The description is very deceiving, as the guard shown in the picture is not a part of the package.</li>
            <li> AND it pulls nearly as much hair as it</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> The shave is very smooth--as smooth as can be expected from a wet/dry razor, but given the cost and time savings (legs are shaved within 10 minutes), this is well worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> The razor give a very close shave if used with shaving cream on your legs and armpits.  </li>
            <li> so dont really use this as a trimmer.</li>
            <li> - didn&#x27;t really look under my arms.  </li>
            <li> The razor, not so much.  </li>
            <li> Much nicer.</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver.  </li>
            <li> I have been  very hesitant in even buying an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Not quite what I had expected but works ok.</li>
            <li> Also the anti slip grip works really well</li>
            <li> This died way too fast.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to have to change the batteries that much.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cheap, basic shaver with a pop-up trimmer and</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m just either a good reader or just totally naive.</li>
            <li> Had no idea that this razor runs on batteries; not very cost effective for major hair removal days, which by the way is every Saturday, thanks for asking.</li>
            <li> Love that it isnt pink!  </li>
            <li> Lightweight, easy to hold and to use, shaves close even dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier on your skin in the long run if you take the minute or two to just go over it daily with the Panasonic ES3831 and your significant other may like that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE that it takes a full month for skin to adjust to any new shaving system; to avoid skin irritation use a shaving rash product more than once a day</li>
            <li> The popup shaver did a nice job under arms and other areas that require a more delicate touch.  </li>
            <li> After my more expensive Empoli razor, more than triple the price of this razor, quit after two years, I vowed never to pay that amount of money again for a wet/dry razor.</li>
            <li> This razor does not promise the world, but it sure promised more than the expensive razor could produce.</li>
            <li> It eventually cuts most of the hair, but it takes multiple passes at different angles and directions to accomplish this.  </li>
            <li> actually I get a better shave with a regular razor    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend it to any woman.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> High quality product and works as promised.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and gives a close shave when compared to other shavers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually found that it works a bit better on dry skin</li>
            <li> I used it after trimming down everything with scissors first, then used the shaver to carefully remove the remains to a clean shave, you do have to be careful though, but even doing this for the first time it went very well, and the second time was even better.</li>
            <li> It will do a decent job, but I find that I have to let my leg hair get mighty long to get a close enough shave.</li>
            <li> I was surprised on how close it gets for an electric shaver!</li>
            <li> My first &amp; last .</li>
            <li> It comes with a little cleaning brush too so cleaning is easy.</li>
            <li> I love the wet and dry shaving capability.</li>
            <li> I pretty much agree with all the other reviews.</li>
            <li> The blades are dull and the trimmer is more nicking than trimming.</li>
            <li> The cutting power is great as well.</li>
            <li> I never saw that clearly in the description--that you have to keep putting AA batteries in.</li>
            <li> my legs are smooth without the harsh pull of an epilator.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The battery lasts pretty long, although towards the end of the battery life, the motor isn&#x27;t as powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve since donated all of my old shavers (including the one I&#x27;m reviewing here).  </li>
            <li> For what I paid, it does a reasonable job, but at its present price, I&#x27;d look elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> It does a reasonable job on underarms with multiple passes required to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> I really like this shaver because it allows me to get a close enough shave that I would wear a swimsuit but not so close that I get the ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> then my old razor..</li>
            <li> I have an old Panasonic which doesn&#x27;t hold a charge well anymore, but still shaves closer than this one.  </li>
            <li> This shaver does an adequate job, but the batteries don&#x27;t last long at all.  </li>
            <li> ok if you use it daily, move the shaver as slowly as possible to avoid pulling/snags, and avoid the pop-up feature as it is sharp and will scratch you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is no,pinching, it&#x27;s easy to use and it runs on two small AAA batteries.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive, allergy prone skin and have not had success using other products for hair</li>
            <li> First time I tried it dry.</li>
            <li> The item was returned after first use, highly NOT recommended.</li>
            <li> Was decent enough.</li>
            <li> I  think it did a little bit better  job in the shower than it did dry</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t give you the same close shave that you&#x27;ll get with a traditional double or triple blade razor, but it&#x27;s good in a pinch when you don&#x27;t have time to shave your legs or underarms and you need to at least look hairless.</li>
            <li> I can use dry or wet and gives a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, spend a few extra bucks and get something good.</li>
            <li> item is new so have no further comment until I have used it for awhile...</li>
            <li> for winter its much easier on my dry legs.  </li>
            <li> I was specifically looking for a low cost battery operated shaver as I had read all the reviews about the low cost rechargeables that seemed to loose their battery life too quickly.</li>
            <li> and I am planning on trying other brand at higher prices.</li>
            <li> by no means a razor shave, but fairly close for my dark thick hairs, and only takes a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> The blade is too wide for certain areas, and it catches the hair without clipping it.</li>
            <li> And in a pinch, you have to get your whole bathroom wet to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Back to my old fashioned razor.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after barely 2 months use.</li>
            <li> ; I mean my husband can&#x27;t really see it until it&#x27;s super long.</li>
            <li> good item.. but design flaw because difficult to read plus or minus to install batteries...</li>
            <li> The first couple of times I used it dry, but then decided to try it wet.</li>
            <li> This shaver is particularly environmentally friendly if you use Eneloop rechargeable batteries and Eneloops last MUCH longer between charges than built-in-battery shavers (Eneloops lasts at least twice as long as disposables and they&#x27;ll pay for themselves within a few uses).</li>
            <li> This was my first razor that was not a cheap throwaway.  </li>
            <li> beef with this thing is that once the batteries ran down (which didn&#x27;t seem to take much), it stopped working.</li>
            <li> electric razor is really lifesaver when you&#x27;re in a rush and look down to find than your legs have 3 inches of hair on them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Left scratches on my legs &amp; didn&#x27;t shave very close (probably the same as 3-4 days after shaving with a razor), really loud, waste of money.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised with such a low quality product made by a pretty reputable brand, but it was indeed a very disappointing experience.</li>
            <li> After reading several reviews of this particular product, both on Amazon, and other sites, I decided to get this shaver.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted something to use dry, as if I shave wet, I might as well use a razor blade.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m back to using a razor blade and looking yet again for a ladies dry shaver that actually works.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Rechargeable shavers do not hold a charge long enough.</li>
            <li> well because I am physically challenged and it was almost impossible for me to independently shave, now since getting this shaver I am able to shave independently with out any help.</li>
            <li> I am never going back to dry razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d actually recommend not to use it dry.  </li>
            <li> I have had other more expensive shavers, and in my experience, none of them are.  </li>
            <li> I prefer a regular battery razor due to traveling extensively for work.  </li>
            <li> is too long.  </li>
            <li> Why do all product people think women only do pink or purple?  </li>
            <li> Even after going over and over an area it left rough stubble.</li>
            <li> This shaver struggles a bit when you hit really course, thick hair.</li>
            <li> I only use it dry and cannot imagine using it wet, as not having to get into the shower or tub to shave is one of the reasons I use an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> I mean, who wants to keep doing that all the time?</li>
            <li> Only thing I wish was different was that I wish it was a little quieter.</li>
            <li> Even though I read the reviews before purchasing I threw away the original packaging so was unable to return.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on reviews and after having tried several other brands and styles.</li>
            <li> I have a skin disorder that prevents me from taking very long showers.</li>
            <li> problem is, this does not shave dry.</li>
            <li> A few days later i tried it out in the shower with my regular shower gel.</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased an epilator in-store, and after only one try at shaving, I threw it in a box.  </li>
            <li> both wet and dry.  </li>
            <li> I tried it wet and dry.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything I ever dreamed and my old one was so hard to replace.</li>
            <li> giving it two stars because if you intend to use it wet, it works, albeit not as well as a razor blade.</li>
            <li> The price was enough that if it wasn&#x27;t for me, it wouldn&#x27;t be much of a waste of money, Mind you this was bought in the winter time</li>
            <li> Read carefully....</li>
            <li> I would certainly not recommend anyone buy this item.</li>
            <li> Making this extremely portable.</li>
            <li> It does not prick into your skin like other ones do.</li>
            <li> I purchased this recently when I was in the hospital, and could not shave using a razor as I usually do.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t drop it like other electric shavers.</li>
            <li> If you were out of the country for a couple of weeks than I might take this one (or just use a razor) since I can not plug the other one in without a convertor and a transformer.</li>
            <li> It takes 2 AAA batteries, and when the batteries run down, you just replace them.</li>
            <li> $20 down the drain.</li>
            <li> This is battery operated; in other words, no electrical charging required!  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter when her other razor quit after just a few months.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also being compared to the previous shaver I had for 25 years.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver less than a year ago.  </li>
            <li> I found this on Amazon.com and was very surprised at the price yet was a bit skeptical to see if it would be comparable to the Empoli.</li>
            <li> I got this because I was tired of getting bumps from allergies from regular razor blades.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money.</li>
            <li> I bought this electric shaver because I got tired of nicking my legs with a regular shaver.  </li>
            <li> but after a few months of use</li>
            <li> but as I have aged my skin has become delicate and this shaver does not harm my skin at all.</li>
            <li> On top of that it did a terrible job.</li>
            <li> An earlier version I had of the Panasonic shaver lasted almost 10 years, and I was disappointed to see that this one didn&#x27;t even last one.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to expensive wet/dry razors that promise everything.</li>
            <li> And it was past the 30 days to return -</li>
            <li> And... no more nicks.</li>
            <li> The change from AA batteries to AAA was unfortunate as they don&#x27;t have the power needed for long.  </li>
            <li> I have had this for at least 6 months and have not had to change the batteries yet.</li>
            <li> This was a big disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I also saw this on QVC but it was less expensive here</li>
            <li> When I purchased this shaver about a year ago to replace a dying Remington rechargeable, it was considerably less expensive (about $19, as I recall) than it is now ($39.95).  </li>
            <li> But it fails to cut little longer hair.</li>
            <li> This was very disappointing as this is why I ordered it over a newer model (and that  it&#x27;s orange instead of pink).  </li>
            <li> It is just too painful  for everyday shaving needs.  </li>
            <li> its not worth the 20 dollars I paid for it :(</li>
            <li> It was very dull in cutting and was returned because of this.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> the expensive razor could not do that</li>
            <li> For the price, you really can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t purchase the rechargeable shaver.</li>
            <li> Very poor performance.</li>
            <li> This razor snags hair really bad.</li>
            <li> does not cut at all really bad shave</li>
            <li> The trimmer part is worthless - doesn&#x27;t shave as close as the razor</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Does not keep a charge, unless you use it in the shower with cream, it leaves scratch marks on your legs and under arm. Will not buy another one.[[ASIN:B0018A32XS Panasonic ES2207P Ladies 3-Blade \\&quot;Close Curves\\&quot; Wet/Dry Shaver]]</li>
            <li> Bought it for armpit hair trimming. But it fails to cut little longer hair. Very poor performance. This is the last panasonic shaver for me.</li>
            <li> This shaver takes longer to shave, but enjoys having batteries instead of plug-in. Would recommend it if you aren&#x27;t in a hurry.  It&#x27;s also being compared to the previous shaver I had for 25 years.</li>
            <li> got this for my lady,  she says it works great!  and said she likes that the trimmer slides easy-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;to me it seems solid!  by the pics i thought it may be to flimsy- but its not- :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shaver. The best part about it is that is runs on batteries. I have had many different electric shavers that are \\&quot;rechargeable\\&quot; however, after a while they don&#x27;t hold their charge anymore, and you can&#x27;t replace their batteries. That is why I was so drawn to this shaver. It takes 2 AAA batteries, and when the batteries run down, you just replace them. Plus you don&#x27;t have to plug this one in and wait 8 hours for a recharge. Making this extremely portable. I just toss it in my purse and I can be ready for a touch up anywhere. The cutting power is great as well. All the way around this is just a fantastic product. I&#x27;d highly recommend it to any woman.</li>
            <li> I got this because I was tired of getting bumps from allergies from regular razor blades. I was surprised on how close it gets for an electric shaver! It is almost as close as a razor when used in the shower with shaving cream. I&#x27;ve used it on legs, arms, underarms, and bikini area and it has tackled that nicely. Only thing I wish was different was that I wish it was a little quieter. Over all I am very happy with this shaver especially for the price! :)</li>
            <li> This shaver is a good value and does a good job. I needed one in a hurry for medical reasons, so I just bought this for the price. I was pleased that it also was a great purchase. Bonus!</li>
            <li> I ordered this to replace an inexpensive trimmer. I thought this would be great because of the dual purpose.....so not the case.  The trimmer is not as smooth as it should be and I have nicked myself.  In regards to the shaver, I had to go over the area several times and it was still not close.  Will be using a regular disposable razor and new bikini trimmer until I can find a suitable replacement.</li>
            <li> I pretty much agree with all the other reviews. I have very light hair on my legs (like a tweenager). I can use this while I&#x27;m watching TV and it does the trick. I find that I have to redo about every three weeks and that&#x27;s fine with me. I like that I don&#x27;t need to have yet another charging station because it runs on batteries and it runs well. I had a similar one for about six years and I liked that one. If this lasts six years I will be extremely happy! That would make it a great value as well.</li>
            <li> I saw this shaver at QVC so I decided to get one for my vacation.  The item has anti-slip grip so I can use in shower.  The pop-up trimmer is great.  This is battery operated; in other words, no electrical charging required!  I have allergy to nickel but this Panasonic product is stainless steel so I won&#x27;t have any irritation.  It&#x27;s great price.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Like it but kind of hurts sometimes.</li>
            <li> Did not work a swell as I wanted it too and it sometimes hurts as well. I think there are definitely better electric shavers out there and I am planning on trying other brand at higher prices. I think this is just a very low end basic unit.</li>
            <li> There is nothing I do not like about this shaver. Works great, light weight,fits into the hand nicely, no recharging needed (simply change batteries). Best shaver I have ever purchased.[[ASIN:B003U7BK5O Panasonic ES2291DT Wet/dry Ladies Shaver, Orange]]</li>
            <li> i love it. i can finally wear shorts every day if i ever want to. my skin used to get really irritated when i shaved and now is just perfect. wish i had found this product years ago!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter when her other razor quit after just a few months.  She LOVES it!  And her favorite color is orange - what more can a girl ask for?!?</li>
            <li> Good product, fast shipping.  Thanks!  We will definitely order the same product again if we need another device and will recommend to our friends.</li>
            <li> This razor snags hair really bad. It misses hair so you have to go over an area 10 times. I wish I would have fought my cheap urge and bought one that works. Fast quality packing and shipping though!</li>
            <li> Not the best shaver I ever had, but it&#x27;s OK.  Sometimes it works better than others.  I would not buy another one like this.</li>
            <li> it looked nice and i was hoping it would cut good but it didn&#x27;t work on my this hair. its not worth the 20 dollars I paid for it :(</li>
            <li> It worked one time and quit. On top of that it did a terrible job. Even though I read the reviews before purchasing I threw away the original packaging so was unable to return. Believe me I kicked myself for that one. Don&#x27;t waste your time and money. I have now purchased a women&#x27;s Remington and love it.</li>
            <li> I have had this for at least 6 months and have not had to change the batteries yet. It does good on getting even the coarsest hairs cut. I haven&#x27;t had a problem with it pulling hairs either.</li>
            <li> I always get razor bumps no matter what brand razor i use.  I&#x27;m so glad I got this - it works awesome!</li>
            <li> Although looking nice and stylish, it&#x27;s a complete junk. Don&#x27;t waste your money, spend a few extra bucks and get something good. The description is very deceiving, as the guard shown in the picture is not a part of the package. I was very surprised with such a low quality product made by a pretty reputable brand, but it was indeed a very disappointing experience. The blades are dull and the trimmer is more nicking than trimming. The item was returned after first use, highly NOT recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my bikini area, and it does not do the job. The blade is too wide for certain areas, and it catches the hair without clipping it. I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I look forward to using the razor as it is the most comfortable and fits my hand extremely good.  Very good for underarms due to the curves of the blades.</li>
            <li> This razor has changed my life..you may ask why? well because I am physically challenged and it was almost impossible for me to independently shave, now since getting this shaver I am able to shave independently with out any help.</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased an epilator in-store, and after only one try at shaving, I threw it in a box.  It is just too painful  for everyday shaving needs.  I decided to purchase a good old-fashioned ladies electric shaver.  I could not be more pleased with the Panasonic ES2291.  It works exactly like a shaver should, and the design is very easy to work with.  I liked the attractive color, and the price was even less than I expected.  I can zip-shave with it and my legs are smooth without the harsh pull of an epilator.  The popup shaver did a nice job under arms and other areas that require a more delicate touch.  I would highly recommend this product if you are looking for a darn good wet/dry ladies shaver.</li>
            <li> I love this item!  There is no,pinching, it&#x27;s easy to use and it runs on two small AAA batteries.  How I wish I would&#x27;ve had this item years ago.</li>
            <li> I like that you can put any regular batteries in this. I use rechargeable ones, so it  works well. Still using it.</li>
            <li> daughter loved it ...arrived on time for christmas..shaver works well  both wet and dry.  will get one for myself now.</li>
            <li> For the price this is the best little electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned.  Never as close as a nice razor job, but great for touch ups!</li>
            <li> Really great, get the long hairs with the one blade and the shorter blade shaves really smoothly, not sorry I got it.  Love it, Love it..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,&lt;br /&gt;Even a first timer using the shaver could use this with no problem ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier! High quality product and works as promised. I love the wet and dry shaving capability. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this back in May, at which time it worked well. It won&#x27;t give you the same close shave that you&#x27;ll get with a traditional double or triple blade razor, but it&#x27;s good in a pinch when you don&#x27;t have time to shave your legs or underarms and you need to at least look hairless. The trimmer part is worthless - doesn&#x27;t shave as close as the razor AND it pulls nearly as much hair as it trims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beef with this thing is that once the batteries ran down (which didn&#x27;t seem to take much), it stopped working. Now that it&#x27;s past the return window, and I made the mistake of throwing out the package and warranty info, I&#x27;m S.O.L. Lesson learned: stick with what works (disposable Bic Daisy shavers for the win)!</li>
            <li> It worked fine, until one day, it just stopped working mid-shave. Changing batteries did nothing. The motor just died. An earlier version I had of the Panasonic shaver lasted almost 10 years, and I was disappointed to see that this one didn&#x27;t even last one.</li>
            <li> Great ladies shaver.  Works very well.</li>
            <li> After 2 months of usage The batteries leaked in it and it stopped working...spend more and get the rechargeable one!</li>
            <li> My first &amp; last . This thing sucked ! Left scratches on my legs &amp; didn&#x27;t shave very close (probably the same as 3-4 days after shaving with a razor), really loud, waste of money.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver as it is nice, and smooth on your skin. It does not prick into your skin like other ones do. I will recommend it to family, and friends.</li>
            <li> I am never going back to dry razors. They aren&#x27;t great for your skin. They cut you. And in a pinch, you have to get your whole bathroom wet to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is fantastic as it can be used either in the shower or out of the shower. I&#x27;ve actually found that it works a bit better on dry skin and I&#x27;m always sure to lotion up after I use it on dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An electric razor is really lifesaver when you&#x27;re in a rush and look down to find than your legs have 3 inches of hair on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery lasts pretty long, although towards the end of the battery life, the motor isn&#x27;t as powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great price for an incredibly handy product.</li>
            <li> After my more expensive Empoli razor, more than triple the price of this razor, quit after two years, I vowed never to pay that amount of money again for a wet/dry razor. I found this on Amazon.com and was very surprised at the price yet was a bit skeptical to see if it would be comparable to the Empoli. Yes, it was! The design fits your hand perfectly and you can use it upside down, in circles, etc. the expensive razor could not do that and I kept dropping it. The shave is very smooth--as smooth as can be expected from a wet/dry razor, but given the cost and time savings (legs are shaved within 10 minutes), this is well worth purchasing. I will never go back to expensive wet/dry razors that promise everything. This razor does not promise the world, but it sure promised more than the expensive razor could produce.</li>
            <li> I also saw this on QVC but it was less expensive here so bought it.The razor give a very close shave if used with shaving cream on your legs and armpits.  I had bought a ladies wet/dry razor before but it did not shave well a bit hit or miss deal.  This razor fit in your hand well and like the fact it runs on batterys so traveling is a breeze.  Great purchase</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to go looking for a shaver so decided to try Amazon as I use their site all the time for music. I am so impressed with the product and ease in which I was able to locate exactly what I wanted. Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> Great little razor!  For the money, you just can&#x27;t beat it.  Liked it so much I bought two of them...one for the bathroom and one for the bedroom.</li>
            <li> This shaver is not the best choice for the bikini area...  It may work ok if you use it daily, move the shaver as slowly as possible to avoid pulling/snags, and avoid the pop-up feature as it is sharp and will scratch you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve discovered a MUCH better shaver, the Panasonic ES3831 Wet/Dry battery operated shaver never bites/snags your skin and is very easy for daily use; it&#x27;s my new favorite and I&#x27;ve since donated all of my old shavers (including the one I&#x27;m reviewing here).  I&#x27;ve been using the Panasonic ES3831 daily without any problems, yet it&#x27;s intended for short hair / daily use as it&#x27;s a foil system (no comb), so it doesn&#x27;t work if you&#x27;re hair is too long.  It&#x27;s much easier on your skin in the long run if you take the minute or two to just go over it daily with the Panasonic ES3831 and your significant other may like that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE that it takes a full month for skin to adjust to any new shaving system; to avoid skin irritation use a shaving rash product more than once a day and it&#x27;ll prevent shaving rash (tend skin is good).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery operated shavers are the best for travel as they are more compact and it&#x27;s easy to get new batteries* if needs be (or to bring more eneloop reusable longer lasting than disposable batteries).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This shaver is more environmentally friendly than rechargeable-shavers as rechargeable shavers do not have mass recycling options as standard batteries do.  This shaver is particularly environmentally friendly if you use Eneloop rechargeable batteries and Eneloops last MUCH longer between charges than built-in-battery shavers (Eneloops lasts at least twice as long as disposables and they&#x27;ll pay for themselves within a few uses).</li>
            <li> When I purchased this shaver about a year ago to replace a dying Remington rechargeable, it was considerably less expensive (about $19, as I recall) than it is now ($39.95).  For what I paid, it does a reasonable job, but at its present price, I&#x27;d look elsewhere.  It&#x27;s lighter than the one it replaced and works on AAA batteries, which may be why it&#x27;s not as powerful.  It eventually cuts most of the hair, but it takes multiple passes at different angles and directions to accomplish this.  I only use it dry and cannot imagine using it wet, as not having to get into the shower or tub to shave is one of the reasons I use an electric shaver.  It does a reasonable job on underarms with multiple passes required to get the job done.  The cap stays on well, which is good for travel.  Take a look at the Palmperfect ladies shavers.  I own one, and it does just as good a job as this shaver, but for a lot less money.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on reviews and after having tried several other brands and styles. It seems no one makes an electric (plug-in, non-rechargeable) ladies shaver these days. I really wanted something to use dry, as if I shave wet, I might as well use a razor blade. This one said \\&quot;wet/dry.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is, this does not shave dry. It simply does not remove the hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;It also scratches, a problem with many of these Chinese-made ladies shavers.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m back to using a razor blade and looking yet again for a ladies dry shaver that actually works.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it two stars because if you intend to use it wet, it works, albeit not as well as a razor blade.</li>
            <li> This shaver struggles a bit when you hit really course, thick hair. But it works pretty nicely on my legs which mostly have fine hairs. There is also, as others have mentioned, a period of time to get your skin used to shaving with this. At first you will get some mild razor burn.</li>
            <li> It does a satisfactory job. It&#x27;s lightweight and is easy to pack for travel.  That&#x27;s all I have to say now.</li>
            <li> My first electric shaver. Love that it isnt pink!  Why do all product people think women only do pink or purple?  Does a great job, (have only used it dry) by no means a razor shave, but fairly close for my dark thick hairs, and only takes a couple of minutes. for winter its much easier on my dry legs.  Did a fine job on bikini line also.  I use a remington bikini trimmer so dont really use this as a trimmer.</li>
            <li> Works great.  I love that it is battery operated and doesn&#x27;t need to be charged.  Rechargeable shavers do not hold a charge long enough.</li>
            <li> This does not come with the bikini attachment as it is supposed to. It was very dull in cutting and was returned because of this.</li>
            <li> Great Shaver! It gets the job done easily.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver less than a year ago.  It was used about once a week for underarms and places on my legs I couldn&#x27;t get with a regular razor.  I went to use it this morning and with no warning the motor sputtered and gave out.  I will replace it with a model from a different company.</li>
            <li> I would certainly not recommend anyone buy this item. It&#x27;s more of a trimmer than \\&quot;shaver\\&quot; -- and if done dry.</li>
            <li> This was my first razor that was not a cheap throwaway.  Thought I would like the wet/dry for the shower and bathtub.  Was using this for over a month and not having my glasses and it being winter - didn&#x27;t really look under my arms.  Well when I did after using the shaver - I noticed that my hair was very long and the razor was combing it over nicely when I thought it was shaving the hair off!  Very disappointed!! And it was past the 30 days to return - so unless I want to go thru the steps and still not get all my money back - I guess I am stuck with it!  I will just continue to use it as an underarm comb!</li>
            <li> I purchased this recently when I was in the hospital, and could not shave using a razor as I usually do. I looked on Amazon, and found this gem.  It runs on batteries, and I think it does a great job.  I am very impressed. Is it as close as my razor? Not quite, but I have to say it does a great job, and I don&#x27;t cut myself! What more could a girl want?!</li>
            <li> Product Arrived on time and looks exactly like the picture! works wonderfully on legs and underarms, easy to use and easy to hang onto! I would order again in a heartbeat--I bought this razor hoping to eliminate using disposal razors (to save money basically) and by ordering this I&#x27;ve done that&lt;br /&gt;now I will admit if your looking to shave your pubic area with this it is more difficult but it does work</li>
            <li> I picked this brand because I wasn&#x27;t sure what to pick. Hit and Miss decision.&lt;br /&gt;And I found I do love this product. Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> The best thing about this is that you don&#x27;t cut yourself while you&#x27;re shaving. Overall the performance is reasonably good.</li>
            <li> $20 down the drain. I returned the item after I determined thr shaver was flimsy,and no way watertight. The company denies receiving the return. I,m out $20.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if i would like this but with the good reviews i took a chance. Works great and batteries last awhile. Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought this electric shaver because I got tired of nicking my legs with a regular shaver.  It&#x27;s not as fast as a hand held (maybe that&#x27;s why I nick myself), but it does a nice job.  And... no more nicks.</li>
            <li> Only used it once and it does make a close shave.  I may add comments after using shaver more frequently.</li>
            <li> Easy to order and not outrageously priced. Got it for my wife. Only thing was, could not tell when ordering if it was electric or battery.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Exactly what I needed.  AND it uses regular batteries.  Hooray</li>
            <li> This shaver is reasonably priced and does a pretty decent job.  I have not read reviews for any other product that that state they are perfect.  I have had other more expensive shavers, and in my experience, none of them are.  It does the job I intended it to do.  I think batteries can sometimes be better for the simple reason, you don&#x27;t have to wait for a recharge-just replace the batteries. For the price, you really can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Ouch!  I returned and received great service, like always, from Amazon, I love Amazon!  The razor, not so much.  I instead bought a Philips.  Much nicer.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because when shaving my bikini area with a razor I ALWAYS get ingrown hairs no matter what I do (shaving cream, lotions, oils, etc) because of my course curly hair.  I really like this shaver because it allows me to get a close enough shave that I would wear a swimsuit but not so close that I get the ingrown hairs. The pop-up trimmer is especially good at trimming some of the longer out of control hairs that the foil simply cannot get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given this produce 5 stars except, unlike the description states, it DOES NOT come with the bikini trimmer attachment.  This was very disappointing as this is why I ordered it over a newer model (and that  it&#x27;s orange instead of pink).  Fortunately I&#x27;m good enough with a scissors that I can take care of that on my own, but if I wasn&#x27;t I might have been sending this back.</li>
            <li> Forget razor burns, cuts, and scrapes when you ladies use this Panasonic wet/dry shaver.  For a smooth comfortable shave, use this two blade shaver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad razor, but it&#x27;s nothing special either.</li>
            <li> good item.. but design flaw because difficult to read plus or minus to install batteries...item is new so have no further comment until I have used it for awhile...</li>
            <li> Yes, finally, a product that works as advertised!  I have had it about 2 months and it meets my expectations for removing facial hair and shaving legs.  Have not tried the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; feature.  Buy with confidence!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife.  She is very particular about getting the right product to shave her legs.  After reading several reviews of this particular product, both on Amazon, and other sites, I decided to get this shaver.  It is battery operated which is a plus for trips.  She can&#x27;t say enough about how well the shaver works.  Do not think she has tried it &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;.  Says this is a much better alternative than using a cartridge blade shaver that can nick the skin.  Would recommend this to all you guys looking for something that your wife will appreciate and works.</li>
            <li> This is an update as below I stated I love the razor but after a few months of use I don&#x27;t get much of a clean shave actually I get a better shave with a regular razor    love this Shaver... wished it was electrical instead...gives  a clean cut better then my old razor.. i would definitely  recommend</li>
            <li> There is nothing my wife does not like about this shaver. Works great, light weight,fits into her hand nicely, Best shaver she has ever purchased</li>
            <li> I prefer a regular battery razor due to traveling extensively for work.  I have sensitive, allergy prone skin and have not had success using other products for hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic fits comfortably in my hand and works like a charm.  It shaves close to my skin without irritation.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This shaver does an adequate job, but the batteries don&#x27;t last long at all.  I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t purchase the rechargeable shaver.</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver.  It is easy to use and gives a close shave when compared to other shavers.  The shave is not as close as a blade but as I have aged my skin has become delicate and this shaver does not harm my skin at all.</li>
            <li> ESTE PRODUCTO FUE ADQUIRIDO CON RECELOS POR DESCONOCER ARTICULOS DE ESTE TIPO LIVIANO, ERGONOMICO, COMODO PARA EL USO CUMPLE CON LAS ESPECTATIVAS ESPERADAS ADEMAS DE SER ECONOMICA</li>
            <li> I have been  very hesitant in even buying an electric shaver. But I decided to cave in and purchase this one. The price was enough that if it wasn&#x27;t for me, it wouldn&#x27;t be much of a waste of money, Mind you this was bought in the winter time so I had some hair to actually shave off on my legs. First time I tried it dry. Was decent enough. Not a close shave you would expect from say Venus shavers but was doable. A few days later i tried it out in the shower with my regular shower gel. VERY close shave and easy to clean! Just remove the top and rinse it under the shower head! So far I&#x27;ve been very happy with this purchase and lets see how it holds up for shorts season!</li>
            <li> does not cut at all really bad shave I would not recommend this product its a one time use then you can throw it away.</li>
            <li> ...and I&#x27;ve had several much more expensive than this one. Lightweight, easy to hold and to use, shaves close even dry. Nothing to dislike at all!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had any luck with electric/battery razors so this one has not made a difference in my opinion.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> This was a big disappointment.  I suppose my own fault as you get what you pay for and this was a pretty cheap purchase.  Most of the reviews raved about the product, but not for me.  I tried it wet and dry.  It just didn&#x27;t work.  Back to my old fashioned razor.</li>
            <li> This shaver is quite handy.  I can use dry or wet and gives a smooth shave.  I would recommend to my friends</li>
            <li> Read carefully....this product uses AAA batteries. I overlooked that fact and was expecting an electrical cord with charger. However, this is an excellent product and works extremely well. Overall, I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I ordered this razor because of it&#x27;s ratings. Not quite what I had expected but works ok. I would recommend it tho</li>
            <li> This Electric Shaver is awesome! The first couple of times I used it dry, but then decided to try it wet. I  think it did a little bit better  job in the shower than it did dry but it works fine either way. Also the anti slip grip works really well so you don&#x27;t drop it like other electric shavers. It comes with a little cleaning brush too so cleaning is easy. And its battery operated so you don&#x27;t have to worry about charging it. Love the pop up trimmer, works great for for longer out of control hairs. Love everything about this! I Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The wet/dry shaver is ok, especially when I travel.  It just doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade.  It is handy for travel or when I just need a quick touch-up.</li>
            <li> Had no idea that this razor runs on batteries; not very cost effective for major hair removal days, which by the way is every Saturday, thanks for asking.</li>
            <li> Great for travel. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after barely 2 months use.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Works great!!</li>
            <li> I have a skin disorder that prevents me from taking very long showers. I bought this as an alternative to shaving in the shower. It will do a decent job, but I find that I have to let my leg hair get mighty long to get a close enough shave. Lucky me, my leg hair is sparse and fair, so gorilla leg hair doesn&#x27;t show up on me. And when I say &amp;#34;doesn&#x27;t show up&amp;#34; I mean my husband can&#x27;t really see it until it&#x27;s super long. If you have darker hair and/or lot of it, you&#x27;ll want to take a pass.</li>
            <li> Everything it was presented to be. Well worth its price.&lt;br /&gt;An attractive, practical, and functional device.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> you will have to &amp;#34;go over&amp;#34; the area multiple times but it is better than having to lather and shave. i do find that using a razor gives me more time between each leg shave, but this is a quick process when you are in a rush.</li>
            <li> This shaver IS NOT RECHARGEABLE!!! I never saw that clearly in the description--that you have to keep putting AA batteries in. I mean, who wants to keep doing that all the time? I guess I&#x27;m just either a good reader or just totally naive. NOT RECHARGEABLE and BATTERIES NEEDED should be prominent in the description. Thankful this was a Prime order and I could send it back.</li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to.  I am pleased with the fact that I can use in the shower.</li>
            <li> I was not looking for a battery operated razor.  But I could not find anything else.  I found to my surprise that this razor was good.  It is simple and easy to use.  Shaves well.  And I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I travel a lot and wanted a to take a shaver. This died way too fast. I don&#x27;t want to have to change the batteries that much. I then got the Panasonic ES2207P Ladies 3-Blade &amp;#34;Close Curves&amp;#34; Wet/Dry Shaver. The charge has lasted for days. It works better and I can just plug it in again to charge, also the charger is very small and easy to pack. If you were out of the country for a couple of weeks than I might take this one (or just use a razor) since I can not plug the other one in without a convertor and a transformer.</li>
            <li> Wife and daughter very happy with razors, didn&#x27;t want built in rechargeable battery after several past experiences with built in dying after short period of time and razors becoming e-waste.</li>
            <li> The shaver does work in water.  I&#x27;d actually recommend not to use it dry.  Works better if use with a lubricant...conditioner etc.  Maybe leave a fine layer of stuble. Nothing will get as close as a razor.</li>
            <li> I was specifically looking for a low cost battery operated shaver as I had read all the reviews about the low cost rechargeables that seemed to loose their battery life too quickly. I also purposely chose a ladies shaver as I wanted to use it to trim the \\&quot;lower regions\\&quot;. This shaver works great. I used it after trimming down everything with scissors first, then used the shaver to carefully remove the remains to a clean shave, you do have to be careful though, but even doing this for the first time it went very well, and the second time was even better. I&#x27;m sure it will become a natural part of my normal grooming process.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cheap, basic shaver with a pop-up trimmer and this qualifies.  The change from AA batteries to AAA was unfortunate as they don&#x27;t have the power needed for long.  After only a couple of uses you have to replace the batteries, even though they still have plenty of &#x27;life&#x27; in them.  The shaver is designed to work only in one direction, which prevents a close shave despite the name.  Nor is it much good as a &#x27;wet&#x27; shaver.  But if all you want is something cheap that works, this will do.</li>
            <li> No sharp instruments allowed in the nursing home, and I never expected my mom to be pleased with an electric razor.  She loves the  petite size and it&#x27;s easy operation.  I&#x27;ve already purchased a new one for when this one gets dropped one to many times.  I would definintey purchase this again.</li>
            <li> This shaver just didn&#x27;t shave my legs well.  Even after going over and over an area it left rough stubble. The trimmer feature was fine, but I wanted a closer shave.  I have an old Panasonic which doesn&#x27;t hold a charge well anymore, but still shaves closer than this one.  I returned it.</li>
            <li> Once and a while I feel this annoyance that only shaving can fix. when there is a build up I can depend on it. It&#x27;s everything I ever dreamed and my old one was so hard to replace. Thanks.</li>
