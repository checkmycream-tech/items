            <li>that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
            <li>Nice to receive a 4 pack too</li>
            <li>my feet never felt so clean !!  </li>
            <li>Keeps my husbands nails and hands looking clean and gorgeous</li>
            <li>I bought these in the four-pack and was pleased with the quality for the price.</li>
            <li>I have average-size women&#x27;s hands, and I can&#x27;t imagine thicker fingers being able to go into the handle .</li>
            <li>These are soo much better, and when we wear out these 4 I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>The Libman hand and nail brush is a better nail brush, but It is too bulky for my hands</li>
            <li>, I consider it more a nail brush or feet.</li>
            <li>Wish that came in another color though : )</li>
            <li>What is not to love?</li>
            <li>Gets the nails and fingers nice and clean.  </li>
            <li>Gentle but effective!</li>
            <li>Most of the readily available nail brushes come with a pumice stone which I did not want.  </li>
            <li>Easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li>So I got these not as nail brushes, but as grout brushes, and they do the job fine.</li>
            <li>The rest of the brush is just fine.</li>
            <li>This brush works just fine for what I wanted it for.  </li>
            <li>The nail brushes I received are fine, but they aren&#x27;t this brush.  </li>
            <li>Let me start by saying the nail brushes I received work fine - they are fingernail brushes, how could they not work ok, right?  </li>
            <li>The pic shown isn&#x27;t entirely accurate.  </li>
            <li>Worth buying for sure (throw them in if you need free shipping).</li>
            <li>These are great - we keep in various locations, kitchen sink, kids shower, master shower, etc.  </li>
            <li>These are cheap and plentiful nail scrubbers that I station all over the house.  </li>
            <li>I love the handle so you can properly hold the brush for a good scrubbing.</li>
            <li>Perfect stiff but not abrasive.  </li>
            <li>This brush is good design, but I would like the handles a little deeper for ease of finger gripping for a more relaxed scrub while cleaning nails.</li>
            <li>Simple effective way to get the dirt out of your nails!  </li>
            <li>We purchased these brushes for our two sons (ages 8 and 6) so that they can clean playground grit out from under their nails.</li>
            <li>and I like the way they clean grease out from under my nails.  </li>
            <li>I bout these to clean under nails</li>
            <li>so we can have one in the bathroom to clean our nails.  </li>
            <li>I use it to clean the grout in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Just the right size, and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>Good price for a basic item.  </li>
            <li>Good, solid nail brushes.  </li>
            <li>Not a bad price for 4 brushes.  </li>
            <li>Nice size--not huge, not tiny.  </li>
            <li>Not a lot of room for large fingers, but still easy to hold.</li>
            <li>They are just right for nails and would be great for cleaning other items as well</li>
            <li>I just care that much!!  </li>
            <li>They took a while to arrive but it was worth it.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>and I got 3 ivory colored brushes (which is even better than the bright green for my bathroom) and 1 turquoise blue brush.  </li>
            <li>These will last me a lifetime : )  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this larger, more comfy brush for you:&lt;br</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>larger then expected but great size.</li>
            <li>It is a good brush, regular as others the same type.</li>
            <li>so handle is not deep enough for me to put more than two fingers through on each end, so it is not so comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>-- I wanted to try them for a long time to make sure I had a \\&quot;valid\\&quot; opinion.  </li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t really get under my nails--the bristles are too long and soft--but they are good for general hand cleaning.</li>
            <li>They definitely do the job and love that you get 4 for such a cheap price.</li>
            <li>, you really can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>Better quality than I expected.</li>
            <li>My whole life i have owned nail scrubbers that, I thought, were just like the one pictured here.</li>
            <li>So unless this is for a child or someone with very petite hands, I would recommend looking elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Well, imagine the center ends of that handle caved in quite a bit more into a v-shape...</li>
            <li>I really prefer it, over these that I&#x27;d also purchased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a real customer.. not a paid advertiser...</li>
            <li>I really like this brush...</li>
            <li>I have small fingers and can&#x27;t fit them into the handle, but it&#x27;s easy to hold along the sides while using .  </li>
            <li>Upon first use our 11 year old said \\&quot;These work good.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>The brush is easy to hold, the bristles are not too harsh but strong enough, and there&#x27;s nothing to get rusty.</li>
            <li>Bristles are strong but not too rough.</li>
            <li>These were exactly what I was looking for, cheap little brushes for cleaning my nails.</li>
            <li>Just the right stiffness to get under nails, and no extra gadgets you don&#x27;t need.</li>
            <li>Bristles get mashed down very quickly.</li>
            <li>and I also use them to scrub my veggies and clean a lot of other stuff.</li>
            <li>Fine for little kid hands.  </li>
            <li>though I don&#x27;t have very long nails, the long and wide brush area makes cleaning quick and the handle makes them easy to hold with soapy</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft enough to not hurt but sturdy enough to get mild dirt out from under my fingernails.</li>
            <li>Since I can&#x27;t be certain to get what I actually ordered, I will not buy again.</li>
            <li>Not too soft as someone else claiming.</li>
            <li>The brush is well made, however the bristles are too soft.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t go straight across like the picture shows but dips in the middle.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are NOT too soft.  </li>
            <li>Gentle enough that it doesn&#x27;t tear the skin off your fingers.</li>
            <li>I bought it because someone said the brush is soft...  </li>
            <li>The bristle aren&#x27;t too soft</li>
            <li>Too soft.</li>
            <li>I just put a little soap on the brush and go work away under the nails while in the shower and come out with sparkly clean nails.</li>
            <li>The brushes are stiff enough to do a fine job without peeling away their skin.</li>
            <li>The bristles are firm enough to do a good job of cleaning garden dirt from under my nails but not so hard they hurt my cuticles.  </li>
            <li>I use these brushes to remove dirt that collects under my nails from gardening, general yard work and working on the cars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you are teaching young children about germs and personal hygiene</li>
            <li>and I can barely force my fingers into the handle.</li>
            <li>My 5 yr old son loves to play outside and comes in with dirt caked under his finger nails.</li>
            <li>Bristles are soft enough.</li>
            <li>I loved them because that space between the handles allowed me to hang the brush from the edge of my utility sink, so it would stay put and not get knocked onto the dirty floor</li>
            <li>The new brushes are the same size and shape, but have a solid handle.</li>
            <li>contrary to previous reviewers, i have no problems holding this brush, just don&#x27;t stick your fingers in the handles!!!!&lt;br /&gt;works exactly as a nail brush should.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really have a lot to say about these, other than that they&#x27;re nail brushes, for $1 each.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for nail brushes for a long time but most physical stores only carry large complicated ones with pumice stones attached.</li>
            <li>Only big enough for two adult fingers, but still usable.  </li>
            <li>My first order of these brushes included the brushes shown in the photo, green with two curved handles that do not meet in the middle.</li>
            <li>Very small, but adequate for cleaning under fingernails.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good quality brush. Not too soft as someone else claiming. Handle opening is too small for my hand, I can hold it with only 2 fingers.</li>
            <li> These were exactly what I was looking for, cheap little brushes for cleaning my nails. They are just right for nails and would be great for cleaning other items as well (I think I might put one in with my bathroom cleaning stuff for crevices and such). You can&#x27;t go wrong for the price.</li>
            <li> Gets the dirt out, even when my nails are VERY short. Easy to hold and use. Bristles are strong but not too rough.</li>
            <li> So I got these not as nail brushes, but as grout brushes, and they do the job fine.</li>
            <li> The brush is well made, however the bristles are too soft. It is very difficult to scrub dirt from under your nails when the bristles are not firm. I cannot recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought these in the four-pack and was pleased with the quality for the price. Heavy plastic with soft bristles.</li>
            <li> Good length and width. The middle of the handle is angled down quite far--not like the picture--so handle is not deep enough for me to put more than two fingers through on each end, so it is not so comfortable to use. I have average-size women&#x27;s hands, and I can&#x27;t imagine thicker fingers being able to go into the handle . You could hold it differently, but not put fingers through. The bristles are a good stiffness. I have not used it long enough to know how well it holds up.</li>
            <li> These are great - we keep in various locations, kitchen sink, kids shower, master shower, etc.  Simple effective way to get the dirt out of your nails!  Great buy for the money.  Will purchase more!</li>
            <li> The handle is oddly shaped.  It doesn&#x27;t go straight across like the picture shows but dips in the middle.  I have small fingers and can&#x27;t fit them into the handle, but it&#x27;s easy to hold along the sides while using .  The bristles are soft enough to not hurt but sturdy enough to get mild dirt out from under my fingernails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for well over 2 months and it works.  The bristles are NOT too soft.  They are firm and get under the nail to get the dirt out.  I was worried after reading a couple of the negative reviews, but they are off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a buck a piece, you really can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> We purchased these brushes for our two sons (ages 8 and 6) so that they can clean playground grit out from under their nails. The brushes are stiff enough to do a fine job without peeling away their skin. One order includes four brushes, so we place one at each sink in the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are teaching young children about germs and personal hygiene I also recommend [[ASIN:0394873408 The Berenstain Bears and the Bad Habit]], which touches on why you shouldn&#x27;t chew your nails or put your fingers in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the brush is small, so my fingers don&#x27;t fit into the grip. For larger hands, I recommend the [[ASIN:B000HM5YQG Lola Nylon Hand &amp; Nail Brush]], which is three inches long and comes with a hardwood grip and stiffer bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating: Four stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these brushes for about 5 months now.  I waited this long to provide a review because the other two reviews were so different in their ratings -- I wanted to try them for a long time to make sure I had a \\&quot;valid\\&quot; opinion.  In my view these are great brushes.  I&#x27;m a home handyman and backyard mechanic and I like the way they clean grease out from under my nails.  The bristles aren&#x27;t so tough that they hurt under the nails, but they do the job -- at least for me.  I just put a little soap on the brush and go work away under the nails while in the shower and come out with sparkly clean nails.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how hard it is to find a Nail Brush that is not Wooden!  The wood Nail brushes get mildew and mold, and only last a few weeks, I have had them split in half.  These are soo much better, and when we wear out these 4 I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I wanted four different colors like the picture, but only got two colors. Therefore, they do not serve my intended purpose.</li>
            <li> These are excellent nail brushes.  The bristles are firm enough to do a good job of cleaning garden dirt from under my nails but not so hard they hurt my cuticles.  I&#x27;m very happy with these and the price is great.  Will keep these on hand at all times in every bathroom and in the kitchen.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really have a lot to say about these, other than that they&#x27;re nail brushes, for $1 each.  Good size, sturdy, does a good job getting dirt out from under my fingernails when I&#x27;ve been gardening.</li>
            <li> It is a good brush, regular as others the same type. But the reason we picked it - we thought it was metal handle and it is not.&lt;br /&gt; And on the description it did not say what material is handle made from.</li>
            <li> medium weight bristle..perfect. larger then expected but great size. cleans nails without harming skin on finger tips. great buy</li>
            <li> What can I say? It&#x27;s a nail brush. It works.</li>
            <li> Love &#x27;em!  Scrub my hands with them after working on the car and they erase all traces of grease and dirt!</li>
            <li> These are cheap and plentiful nail scrubbers that I station all over the house.  When the bristles fail I just throw them away and buy more.  I can&#x27;t stand the thought of what could be left under our fingernails with simple hand washing so we use these many times a day!</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying the nail brushes I received work fine - they are fingernail brushes, how could they not work ok, right?  But it was odd that the products I received are not the ones pictured and they did not come in any packaging, all four were loose in a large envelope.  I put them in the dishwasher to wash them because I didn&#x27;t like  that they were not packaged, and then began using them.</li>
            <li> Its a nail brush, not much to say about them.  Does what it is supposed to do.  The reason why I do not give it five stars is because I feel as if the bristles could be a bit stronger.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t really get under my nails--the bristles are too long and soft--but they are good for general hand cleaning.</li>
            <li> I give it 5 stars as this is one of the best hand nail brush I have found. The Libman hand and nail brush is a better nail brush, but It is too bulky for my hands, I consider it more a nail brush or feet. This brush is good design, but I would like the handles a little deeper for ease of finger gripping for a more relaxed scrub while cleaning nails.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money, the poorly made product, will only last a month or 2.</li>
            <li> These are WIDE nail brushes. I couldn&#x27;t tell from the pictures and description. I was expecting the cheaper, thinner nailbrushes. Better quality than I expected.</li>
            <li> why do i have to write these long stories,  they are nail brushes,  you have to be careful not to injure your skin above your nail.  use carefullly.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find in stores anywhere.  Nice handle, and good bristles.</li>
            <li> Just the right size, and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> Good price for a basic item.  Nice size--not huge, not tiny.  Good grip.  Bristles hold up as well as brushes at 3 times the price.  Bristle density and firmess are, I&#x27;d say, a &amp;#34;medium&#x27;, which I like (I don&#x27;t want to use a wire brush on my fingers!)</li>
            <li> These will last me a lifetime : )  Exactly what I was looking for.  Perfect stiff but not abrasive.  Wish that came in another color though : )</li>
            <li> Simple item that I was looking for but could not find in my local stores.  Most of the readily available nail brushes come with a pumice stone which I did not want.  The size and design of this brush is perfect.  Great price for 4 of them.  I can put one at every sink.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Very small, but adequate for cleaning under fingernails.</li>
            <li> I bout these to clean under nails and I also use them to scrub my veggies and clean a lot of other stuff.</li>
            <li> contrary to previous reviewers, i have no problems holding this brush, just don&#x27;t stick your fingers in the handles!!!!&lt;br /&gt;works exactly as a nail brush should.</li>
            <li> Cleans the grease and grime out from under fingernails from working on cars. Gentle enough that it doesn&#x27;t tear the skin off your fingers.</li>
            <li> My whole life i have owned nail scrubbers that, I thought, were just like the one pictured here. I love the handle so you can properly hold the brush for a good scrubbing. I noticed another reviewer, a man, said the brush was way too small to get your fingers in. I figured he just had big manly hands. Well, I am a woman with average-size hands and I can barely force my fingers into the handle. So unless this is for a child or someone with very petite hands, I would recommend looking elsewhere. The rest of the brush is just fine.</li>
            <li> Not recommended for men.. that&#x27;s for sure! The pic shown isn&#x27;t entirely accurate.  What you actually get is.. .well, you see there in the handle where the hand grip is?- You see the gap?  Well, imagine the center ends of that handle caved in quite a bit more into a v-shape... that&#x27;s what you actually get when it arrives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s even awkward for me- a woman w/ average sized fingers/ hands.  Your fingers actually get stuck inside there while grabbing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the brush itself just needs to be a bit larger.&lt;br /&gt;It measures 3 inches x 3/4 inch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to get these at the dollar store every few years... now can&#x27;t find them any where.  We use them at the bathrm &amp; kitchen sinks to wash up our hand with... can&#x27;t imagine washing without a brush!!  I used to get a brush like this at the dollar store, to scrub my hands, and the sink strainer, and coffee cup lid grooves &amp; such.... this one is much larger though, than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this &gt;&gt; other brush on Amazon at the same time, &amp; I really prefer it, over these that I&#x27;d also purchased. I used to get a brush like this at the dollar store, to scrub my hands, and the sink strainer, and coffee cup lid grooves &amp; such.... this one is much larger though, than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Men, especially)- I recommend this larger, more comfy brush for you:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Superior-Nail-Brush-Pack-162/dp/B002PD8F1G/ref&#x3D;pd_sbs_indust_30&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes... I&#x27;m a real customer.. not a paid advertiser... I just care that much!!  I&#x27;ve seen all the headache weary customer reviews of people trying to find something as silly and what should be as simple as a brush!!  ;-)</li>
            <li> I really like this brush... my feet never felt so clean !!  My toes look pink after using this brush on them.  I also use it on my feet and ankles in the shower.  I bought it because someone said the brush is soft...  I think brush is NOT soft but I use it anyway because it works so well.  I recommend getting them !!</li>
            <li> Good value for these brushes. Happy with the quality for the price. I use them every day &amp; they&#x27;re holding up great</li>
            <li> We bought these for the kids, and they are serving the purpose.  Upon first use our 11 year old said \\&quot;These work good.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Got the four pack.  One for the shower, the bathroom sink, the kitchen sink, and the boyfriends house.  Gets the nails and fingers nice and clean.  Brush does not fall apart.  Great price!  What is not to love?</li>
            <li> I have been looking for nail brushes for a long time but most physical stores only carry large complicated ones with pumice stones attached. These are perfect. Just the right stiffness to get under nails, and no extra gadgets you don&#x27;t need. They definitely do the job and love that you get 4 for such a cheap price. Worth buying for sure (throw them in if you need free shipping).</li>
            <li> My 5 yr old son loves to play outside and comes in with dirt caked under his finger nails. The firm brush gets the dirt right out- just what we needed. Nice to receive a 4 pack too so we have extras.</li>
            <li> The brush is easy to hold, the bristles are not too harsh but strong enough, and there&#x27;s nothing to get rusty. I like it a lot and ordered 4 of them to spread around the house.</li>
            <li> Good, solid nail brushes.  Not a bad price for 4 brushes.  Not a lot of room for large fingers, but still easy to hold.</li>
            <li> As advertised.  Fine for little kid hands.  Only big enough for two adult fingers, but still usable.  Bristles are soft enough.</li>
            <li> Beware of this product - cheapest quality, and the bristles are so stiff that your fingers will be almost skinned. Next time I&#x27;ll go with a brand name product. Zero stars!!!</li>
            <li> Great hand and nail brush! I had looked for these for a long time! Keeps my husbands nails and hands looking clean and gorgeous</li>
            <li> This brush works just fine for what I wanted it for.  I got the 4 pack so we can have one in the bathroom to clean our nails.  I use one for cleaning smaller areas that a big brush is not feasible.  I use it to clean the grout in the shower.  The other two brushes are extra for later use.</li>
            <li> My first order of these brushes included the brushes shown in the photo, green with two curved handles that do not meet in the middle. I loved them because that space between the handles allowed me to hang the brush from the edge of my utility sink, so it would stay put and not get knocked onto the dirty floor easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the brushes were used up, I reordered, only to get a completely different product. The new brushes are the same size and shape, but have a solid handle. I can only sit them on the rim of the sink, so they end up getting bumped over and I have to chase them around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am tired of buying something on Amazon, only to get an item that just vaguely resembles the product being pictured. Since I can&#x27;t be certain to get what I actually ordered, I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> The nail brushes I received are fine, but they aren&#x27;t this brush.  The handle is solid all the way across and I got 3 ivory colored brushes (which is even better than the bright green for my bathroom) and 1 turquoise blue brush.  The bristle aren&#x27;t too soft so they do a good job of scrubbing.</li>
            <li> Gentle but effective!</li>
            <li> They took a while to arrive but it was worth it. The bristles are stiff and serves their purpose well.</li>
            <li> my nails have never been cleaner</li>
            <li> Too soft. Bristles get mashed down very quickly.</li>
            <li> I use these brushes to remove dirt that collects under my nails from gardening, general yard work and working on the cars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I don&#x27;t have very long nails, the long and wide brush area makes cleaning quick and the handle makes them easy to hold with soapy hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used one of the brushes about 10 times and it seems to be holding up well.</li>
