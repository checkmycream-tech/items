            <li>and this is the perfect size.</li>
            <li>excellent product.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and in excellent condition.</li>
            <li>Wonderful,  for my sore hands</li>
            <li>Great for the arthritic hands and as a plus it softens the skin.</li>
            <li>Great product and service</li>
            <li>Otherwise, a great purchase.</li>
            <li>She says that it works just great.  </li>
            <li>But a great buy for the money</li>
            <li>for the money, it is great</li>
            <li>LOVE THE PARAFFIN!!</li>
            <li>but my friend loved it.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good , but it dose not have a keep warm seting on it , I have to cut it off after each use.</li>
            <li>I had a Dr. Scholl&#x27;s paraffin unit that worked great, but was huge and a pain to store and heat up.  </li>
            <li>I own one of these</li>
            <li>I wasnt sure about the size or how good it would work</li>
            <li>Nice unit.</li>
            <li>Smells nice.  </li>
            <li>Great for the price, does exactly what it says on the tin.  </li>
            <li>This product does a very good job as far as the wax is concerned.</li>
            <li>After she uses it her hands feel much better.</li>
            <li>While I loved it, and it worked great, it only did for about 2 years.  </li>
            <li>The thing that could be better would be faster melting of the paraffin - it took about an hour.</li>
            <li>Give more detail about size and heat control.  </li>
            <li>Nice size, easy to use, cover can easily slip into wax.</li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and is very light.  </li>
            <li>The paraffin that comes with it smells very nice, but barely fills the container.  </li>
            <li>but feet don&#x27;t fit</li>
            <li>It did fit feet, and hands, and I even took it to work for the girls to all do our hands on lunch break on winter day.  </li>
            <li>and I can just fit my fingers and palm in it.</li>
            <li>I wear a size 7 shoe and can just fit my toes in.</li>
            <li>My right hand felt a lot better after using this bath.</li>
            <li>Great little bath, heats quickly  and stays warm</li>
            <li>Decent but needs to warm up quicker</li>
            <li>It heats up super quick and has and easy on/off switch.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and the temperature of the paraffin is just right.</li>
            <li>great for dry nurse hands!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The part of our hand that we could get in there did come out soft and smelling nice.  </li>
            <li>I got the Conair True Glow Heated Paraffin Bath to help with the arthritis pain in my hands.</li>
            <li>The price is attractive compared to other brands.</li>
            <li>Item arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>Wax warms  up in quick time</li>
            <li>4 stars seems fair because I am not sensitive to heat, but the unit makes my fingernails throb from the heat, as I dip my hand again and again to create a glove of just 7 dips into the paraffin.</li>
            <li>I guess the large one I already have is the best size for my hands even though I have small hands.</li>
            <li>I have large hands and they fit.  </li>
            <li>We wish we had spent more money and gotten a better quality paraffin bath.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wax feels very good on my poor hands with arthritis.</li>
            <li>when these were all the rage, I got the Conair model (looks similar, but mine had more features) at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.  </li>
            <li>It gets a tad too hot.  </li>
            <li>However, once the wax has melted it is \\&quot;painfully\\&quot; hot.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and holds the temperature and is just the right size for hands and elbows.</li>
            <li>Another positive is the value</li>
            <li>My entire hand does not fit in the bath but what does fit comes out nice and soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I scalded my hand to the point of real pain and will not attempt to use this apparatus again.</li>
            <li>However, for $30, I guess you can&#x27;t really complain getting two years of use out of it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend using it!</li>
            <li>Very deceptive.</li>
            <li>I do like Conair products and own quite a few with no complaints.</li>
            <li>My hands were so rough, after just one treatment what a difference, was worth the price!!</li>
            <li>the price was good but it is rather shallow.  </li>
            <li>Left the review for this on the Conair True Glow Heated Wax Refill 16 Ounce in error.</li>
            <li>I have had the top fall into the wax almost every time I have used it which then makes a mess of everything else.  </li>
            <li>Bought it for a friend with rheumatoid arthritis.&lt;br /&gt;She raves about everyday on its benefits and how it has given her more freedom of movement and longer movement</li>
            <li>The only complaint is the cover does easily slide into the wax if you are not careful, but I guess you can easily use hot water to melt that off the cover.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m writing this review because I&#x27;m shopping for a new one, and feel like I need to let this be known.  </li>
            <li>takes longer to melt paraffin, then I expected, not enough paraffin comes with product, had to get more</li>
            <li>The paraffin does not get very hot and takes a very long time to become liquid.  </li>
            <li>Ok for small hand</li>
            <li>Not wide or deep enough to comfortably accommodate an adult hand.</li>
            <li>(I have no idea what happened), and now the whole thing is just a big plastic and wax paper weight.  </li>
            <li>if you want soft hands and relief from hand pain - GET A PARAFFIN BATH</li>
            <li>but my complaint if the top.  </li>
            <li>She is always surprised her pain is gone.</li>
            <li>Works good, a little small.</li>
            <li>Not sure if my (US) size 9 would fit.  </li>
            <li>Not as large as I expected.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed mine while it worked, but now it&#x27;s dying after less than two years of regular (every other day) use.</li>
            <li>Back in the early 2000&#x27;s</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s works fine but is very small.</li>
            <li>I normally have problems with dry hands</li>
            <li>- it fell into the wax the first time I used it and now is covered with clumps and dripped wax on my counter when I took it out-what a mess.</li>
            <li>but it gets a little too hot.</li>
            <li>The paraffin can get extremely hot and without a temperature gauge or thermostat, it is almost impossible to know when it is okay to dunk your hand.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been in my closet for 10 years at least, and I REALLY want a new one.  </li>
            <li>I hit the bottom heating area every time I put my hand in and that sucker is hot!</li>

            <li> Takes way too long to heat up.</li>
            <li> This was much smaller than I expected it to be.  </li>
            <li> Helps with dry skin.</li>
            <li> , he can only put half in at a time.  </li>
            <li> This product is hardly big enough for a small hand.  </li>
            <li> However, I found it was a little smaller that what I needed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an awkward fit.  </li>
            <li> My mother and I both have small bones and were not able to immerse our whole hands.  </li>
            <li> I heats evenly, and maintains the tempurature for liquifaction over long periods of time without breaking down the paraffin.</li>
            <li> other reviewers are correct - the cover sometimes slips into the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I finally figured out in order to put your hands in the wax, once it is melted you have to turn the unit off, take the lid off &amp; let it sit at least 15 min.</li>
            <li> It was about half the size of one I had before.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re on a tight budget, it&#x27;ll do the job for now.</li>
            <li> Even my two youngest kids who are 9 and 11 have trouble putting their hands in with their fingers spread at all.</li>
            <li> A little small.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s impossible for him to get his whole hand in at all</li>
            <li> Overall a little disappointed but inexpensive so not that big if a deal.</li>
            <li> If you have small feet you could also use it for them, even though this is advertised for hands.  </li>
            <li> IF you have small hands and feet.</li>
            <li> I have small hands</li>
            <li> It is fairly small</li>
            <li> It is very small, and the lid does not fit well</li>
            <li> This bath is very small.  </li>
            <li> Poor design.</li>
            <li> I found it difficult to get my elbow in.  </li>
            <li> and I purchased this one for my daughter who suffers with pain in her hands.  </li>
            <li> I am always afraid I will hit the heating element.  </li>
            <li> I disappointed that it was almost &amp;#34;disposable&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Oops, sorry!&lt;br /&gt;word requirement on these reviews is annoying, btw</li>

            <li> Nice size, easy to use, cover can easily slip into wax.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is how long it takes to heat up the wax. I wonder if you could preheated the wax I&#x27;m a microwave?</li>
            <li> Great for the arthritic hands and as a plus it softens the skin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good , but it dose not have a keep warm seting on it , I have to cut it off after each use.</li>
            <li> There is not nearly enough caution mentioned regarding the heat.  The paraffin can get extremely hot and without a temperature gauge or thermostat, it is almost impossible to know when it is okay to dunk your hand.  I scalded my hand to the point of real pain and will not attempt to use this apparatus again.</li>
            <li> This bath is very small.  My mother and I both have small bones and were not able to immerse our whole hands.  The paraffin that comes with it smells very nice, but barely fills the container.  The paraffin does not get very hot and takes a very long time to become liquid.  We wish we had spent more money and gotten a better quality paraffin bath.&lt;br /&gt;The part of our hand that we could get in there did come out soft and smelling nice.  The unit is not described as theraputic, so we should have realized it was not what we wanted.</li>
            <li> Great product and service</li>
            <li> Takes way too long to heat up.</li>
            <li> great for dry nurse hands!</li>
            <li> I had a Dr. Scholl&#x27;s paraffin unit that worked great, but was huge and a pain to store and heat up.  I wanted one smaller and this it. I normally have problems with dry hands and this is the perfect size. It heats up quickly and is very light.  If you have small feet you could also use it for them, even though this is advertised for hands.  The only complaint is the cover does easily slide into the wax if you are not careful, but I guess you can easily use hot water to melt that off the cover.  Otherwise, a great purchase.</li>
            <li> This was much smaller than I expected it to be.  It was about half the size of one I had before.</li>
            <li> Decent but needs to warm up quicker</li>
            <li> A little small. Ok for small hand but feet don&#x27;t fit well (ladies size 5)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an awkward fit.  Not wide or deep enough to comfortably accommodate an adult hand.</li>
            <li> I own one of these and I purchased this one for my daughter who suffers with pain in her hands.  She says that it works just great.  After she uses it her hands feel much better.</li>
            <li> I wasnt sure about the size or how good it would work but my friend loved it.  It heats up fast and holds the temperature and is just the right size for hands and elbows.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly.  It worked as stated.  However, I found it was a little smaller that what I needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this review because I&#x27;m shopping for a new one, and feel like I need to let this be known.  Back in the early 2000&#x27;s when these were all the rage, I got the Conair model (looks similar, but mine had more features) at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.  While I loved it, and it worked great, it only did for about 2 years.  It did fit feet, and hands, and I even took it to work for the girls to all do our hands on lunch break on winter day.  However, the electronic timer got a problem (I have no idea what happened), and now the whole thing is just a big plastic and wax paper weight.  It&#x27;s been in my closet for 10 years at least, and I REALLY want a new one.  I disappointed that it was almost &amp;#34;disposable&amp;#34;. However, for $30, I guess you can&#x27;t really complain getting two years of use out of it.  Just beware.</li>
            <li> My hands were so rough, after just one treatment what a difference, was worth the price!!</li>
            <li> I like this but it gets a little too hot. Wish I would have purchased one that I could control the heating element with. But a great buy for the money</li>
            <li> I heats evenly, and maintains the tempurature for liquifaction over long periods of time without breaking down the paraffin. excellent product.</li>
            <li> the price was good but it is rather shallow.  takes about 90 min to melt the wax.  other reviewers are correct - the cover sometimes slips into the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THE PARAFFIN!! I highly recommend using it! for the money, it is great but if you want to use it often, possibly buy  a bigger one.  I am always afraid I will hit the heating element.  I have a hand injury and this has worked WONDERS for me!  have not had to replace the blocks yet so cannot comment on that.  if you want soft hands and relief from hand pain - GET A PARAFFIN BATH</li>
            <li> Bought it for a friend with rheumatoid arthritis.&lt;br /&gt;She raves about everyday on its benefits and how it has given her more freedom of movement and longer movement time&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Acceptable item IF you have small hands and feet. I have small hands and I can just fit my fingers and palm in it. I wear a size 7 shoe and can just fit my toes in. It is very small, and the lid does not fit well - it fell into the wax the first time I used it and now is covered with clumps and dripped wax on my counter when I took it out-what a mess. It is a servicable unit but not well designed and I would go for another type of unit if possible,.</li>
            <li> I got the Conair True Glow Heated Paraffin Bath to help with the arthritis pain in my hands.It is easy to use and the temperature of the paraffin is just right. The thing that could be better would be faster melting of the paraffin - it took about an hour. My right hand felt a lot better after using this bath.</li>
            <li> takes longer to melt paraffin, then I expected, not enough paraffin comes with product, had to get more</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works fine but is very small. Even my two youngest kids who are 9 and 11 have trouble putting their hands in with their fingers spread at all. I had bought it for my husband and it&#x27;s impossible for him to get his whole hand in at all, he can only put half in at a time.  Overall a little disappointed but inexpensive so not that big if a deal.</li>
            <li> Works good, a little small.</li>
            <li> Great little bath, heats quickly  and stays warm</li>
            <li> As described.  Helps with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I hit the bottom heating area every time I put my hand in and that sucker is hot! I guess the large one I already have is the best size for my hands even though I have small hands.</li>
            <li> Great for the price, does exactly what it says on the tin.  It is fairly small I found it difficult to get my elbow in.  I have large hands and they fit.  Not sure if my (US) size 9 would fit.  Wax warms  up in quick time so no need to keep plugged in.  Arrived on time and in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> It is smaller than I had hoped for, but I will deal with it.  It gets a tad too hot.  I do like Conair products and own quite a few with no complaints. 4 stars seems fair because I am not sensitive to heat, but the unit makes my fingernails throb from the heat, as I dip my hand again and again to create a glove of just 7 dips into the paraffin.</li>
            <li> Left the review for this on the Conair True Glow Heated Wax Refill 16 Ounce in error. Oops, sorry!&lt;br /&gt;word requirement on these reviews is annoying, btw</li>
            <li> Holds just about enough wax for your hands.  It heats up super quick and has and easy on/off switch.  Another positive is the value but my complaint if the top.  I have had the top fall into the wax almost every time I have used it which then makes a mess of everything else.  Poor design.</li>
            <li> This product does a very good job as far as the wax is concerned. It heats up &amp; melts the wax in the 90 min. suggested. However, once the wax has melted it is \\&quot;painfully\\&quot; hot. I finally figured out in order to put your hands in the wax, once it is melted you have to turn the unit off, take the lid off &amp; let it sit at least 15 min. before putting your hands in.</li>
            <li> Wonderful,  for my sore hands</li>
            <li> This product is hardly big enough for a small hand.  With no heat controls, it burned me when heated.  Give more detail about size and heat control.  Very deceptive.</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly. Nice unit. Not as large as I expected. Wax feels very good on my poor hands with arthritis.</li>
            <li> My entire hand does not fit in the bath but what does fit comes out nice and soft and smooth.  Smells nice.  Does help briefly with MC pain.</li>
            <li> The price is attractive compared to other brands. If you&#x27;re on a tight budget, it&#x27;ll do the job for now. I enjoyed mine while it worked, but now it&#x27;s dying after less than two years of regular (every other day) use. It heats up enough to soften the wax, but no longer melts it, and I&#x27;m hoping to find a replacement that will last.</li>
            <li> Gift for mom&#x27;s arthritic hands so she can still knit and she loves it.  She is always surprised her pain is gone.</li>
