            <li>Feels good around the eye area.  </li>

            <li>I absolutely love this serum and this skincare line!</li>
            <li>Love Andalou products!</li>
            <li>Products has great results, but it smells so strong.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see why a gimmick is needed given how amazing the serum is and the effect it has had on my skin, but whatever.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nicely scented and brightening.</li>
            <li>But, it did have a nice smell.</li>
            <li>Feels good, applies easily.</li>
            <li>This serum is natural and perfect to blend with liquid makeup or a tinted sunscreen on fingers before application.</li>
            <li>Great product, and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>The texture is creamy and yet very light.</li>
            <li>Nice light product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered it many times over the years.  </li>
            <li>However, because of my oily skin I like my vitamin c serums to be more gelish-watery and give me a lifting effect.</li>
            <li>This serum is not greasy but it leaves a shiny finish and it&#x27;s too hydrating to wear spf or make up on top</li>
            <li>I love this serum from Andalou Naturals</li>
            <li>or more - this is the thing to get.</li>
            <li>I bought this after researching on Beautypedia, which is excellent for details on efficacy and safety of ingredients, and then on Makeupalley in which consumers rate on their actual experience with products.  </li>
            <li>I do not have any break outs any more.</li>
            <li>I already use Andalou&#x27;s 1000 roses, cleanser and day cream..and love them too.</li>
            <li>I love this serum.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Before this one I was using Vitamin C serum and found that it was able to lightening/</li>
            <li>That said, I do think my skin looks better for having used this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, love it.  </li>
            <li>Great serum with highly recommended ingredients.</li>
            <li>think this is a superb serum for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Many years ago when I was a teenager, I started with Proactiv and got accustomed to having an oil free moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and is a great moisturizer to wear under any daily make up.  </li>
            <li>It smells great and it really does brighten the skin after consistent use!</li>
            <li>My skin absorbs this serum very quickly.</li>
            <li>would definitely recommend this product - one of the best skin care items I&#x27;ve tried - and very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>The gel like consistency absorbs easily and is light throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a lah-di-dah glass bottle - it is and will feel slightly plasticky - but given its excellent formulation and price</li>
            <li>In some ways, it&#x27;s even better than SkinCeuticals CE Ferulic - because it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>This is a very high quality and effective brightening serum.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Turmeric has many skin benefits including brightening the skin and paired with an ester-c it is powerful.</li>
            <li>Also, this is in a pump container that prevents light exposure.</li>
            <li>Smooth cream</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it:)</li>
            <li>The smell is also light and doesn&#x27;t linger.  </li>
            <li>(visit Beautypedia for a detailed explanation).  </li>
            <li>It surprised and delighted me.</li>
            <li>This had a good score on both and has mainly natural ingredients, which I appreciate.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast from this seller and overall I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>and I have to say that after using this one for one week, I have noticed a significant difference on my skin.  </li>
            <li>This gives my skin a healthy glow, I use it twice a day and the bottle has lasted more than a month so far.</li>
            <li>It smells okay, not as good as the other Andalou products.</li>
            <li>Definitely better than the department store brands and a very close approximation of some of the higher-end skin care products you might find at the dermatologist&#x27;s office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It took about a full month for that to happen, and I was also still using a separate moisturizer because the C serum was a bit tacky after drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not bad for the skin or anything, they&#x27;re just hooey.  </li>
            <li>I think the tumeric is a very overpowering smell, but it&#x27;s not terrible and fades quickly.</li>
            <li>Other than that, great product</li>
            <li>Most of these have superior quality even over higher priced brands, part of this is because they do not advertise or use celebrity endorsements like high brands do so less overhead and more focus on product quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The odor is strong and unusual but in my opinion not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>For years before this cream, I used Acure oil control facial moisturizer, that I loved, but thought I&#x27;d give this a try since the reviews seemed so positive.  </li>
            <li>It smells like fresh oranges.  </li>
            <li>As good or better than the more expensive serums out there.</li>
            <li>absorbed well....</li>
            <li>I needed more vitamin C serum but seemed like my old standby C E ferulic changed their formula</li>
            <li>My skin looks distinctly brighter after a month of using this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works right away brightening and lightening.</li>
            <li>It has proven more effective than the more expensive brands I&#x27;ve purchased from Sephora.</li>
            <li>Overall it was worth the price and worked better than the Michael Todd serum I was using before.</li>
            <li>This is very important for volatile ingredients such as vitamin c.</li>
            <li>it is very light, non-greasy and sinks in quickly</li>
            <li>/&gt;After only one use I saw a difference in my skin, it seemed calmer and more even.</li>
            <li>The serum is a creamy consistency but light and sinks in quickly.  </li>
            <li>Bought this at Whole Foods the first time around, on a whim - and liked it well enough to order a second bottle from Amazon.</li>
            <li>doubt it&#x27;s very high since it&#x27;s not mentioned).&lt;br</li>
            <li>If possible, serum ingredients should always be in an air-tight and light protected bottle.</li>
            <li>It feels very moisterising going on , and yet leaves no trace of stickiness.</li>
            <li>however it goes FAST.</li>
            <li>One pump gives too much product in my opinion</li>
            <li>My skin seems to really like Andalou products, I will recommend them to friends and purchase again.</li>
            <li>I just got this 2 days ago, but its gentle and  </li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t seen a difference while using this product.  </li>
            <li>Fast forward a lot of years,</li>
            <li>product is really filling both of my desires/needs in one bottle--</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had transformative results, but I&#x27;m not trying to undo skin damage or signs of aging as much as I&#x27;m trying to prevent them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen Andalou products on the shelves forever at Whole Foods, but never got the products.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to wear as much makeup anymore.  </li>
            <li>The serum is very non-greasy even though it has some oil in it.  </li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older they fade away less on their own over the winter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it several days now and my skin is looking more clear and radiant.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have an easy way of getting a new bottle of the SkinCeuticals CE Ferulic, and happened upon Andalou Naturals brand Turmeric/C serum at a local Whole Foods store.</li>
            <li>I will plan on continuing to use this single product going forward, and we&#x27;ll see how things go in the winter and whether a separate moisturizer is required then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, fully recommended for anyone who wants a C serum lightener, or something light and not oily to put on after the shower/washing.</li>
            <li>A little strong on fragrance but at least it is a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>Better results for less money??</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for all ages.</li>
            <li>I needed brightening products and decided to try this one because Andalou came highly recommended.</li>
            <li>In general if you have any allergies, check the ingredients first before you buy any product.</li>
            <li>given how jar packaging for skincare should be one of the seven deadly sins, I love that this serum comes in an airtight and opaque pump container.  </li>
            <li>I have normal to oily, mild acne-prone skin and  was a little worried at first because this serum is not oil-free and I was battling clogged pores at the time I started using it.  </li>
            <li>This is a high-quality product at an amazing price, compared to other (more expensive) products on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>skin looking clear, brighter, and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>I will always go with organic and natural products from now on.</li>
            <li>for the record, I have fairly sensitive skin and this stuff didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Last month I switched to Andalou products from Mineral Fusion which gave me a rash, before that I used MyChelle which just didn&#x27;t seem to do much for me at all.  </li>
            <li>I am 47 years old, have combination skin, and am always concerned with breakouts.  </li>
            <li>If the breakouts still really persist, I&#x27;m going back to my Acure.</li>
            <li>Not heavy for mature skin though.  </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t give this a true rating as it&#x27;s only been a few weeks since I&#x27;ve used this item.  </li>
            <li>I have more even skin tone and dark pigmentation has decreased significantly.</li>
            <li>It has been a few weeks now and my super sensitive face.  </li>
            <li>Hard to rate effectiveness since that is more of a long term effect.</li>
            <li>Clinique, Dr. Dennis Gross, and SK-II charge upwards of $150 for nearly identical serums.  </li>
            <li>I used worse products, so I will just say that it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>and I still do like something to put on my face after the shower that keeps my face from feeling tight &amp; dry, not necessarily having to be an oil free moisturizer, but ofen that&#x27;s what I go for.</li>
            <li>but ever since I have been using this my skin appears less red and feels much calmer.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;After only one use I saw a difference in my skin, it seemed calmer and more even.</li>
            <li> The serum is a creamy consistency but light and sinks in quickly.  </li>

            <li> If possible, serum ingredients should always be in an air-tight and light protected bottle.</li>

            <li> One pump gives too much product in my opinion</li>
            <li> My skin seems to really like Andalou products, I will recommend them to friends and purchase again.</li>
            <li> I just got this 2 days ago, but its gentle and  </li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t seen a difference while using this product.  </li>
            <li> Fast forward a lot of years,</li>
            <li> product is really filling both of my desires/needs in one bottle--</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had transformative results, but I&#x27;m not trying to undo skin damage or signs of aging as much as I&#x27;m trying to prevent them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen Andalou products on the shelves forever at Whole Foods, but never got the products.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to wear as much makeup anymore.  </li>
            <li> The serum is very non-greasy even though it has some oil in it.  </li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older they fade away less on their own over the winter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it several days now and my skin is looking more clear and radiant.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have an easy way of getting a new bottle of the SkinCeuticals CE Ferulic, and happened upon Andalou Naturals brand Turmeric/C serum at a local Whole Foods store.</li>
            <li> I will plan on continuing to use this single product going forward, and we&#x27;ll see how things go in the winter and whether a separate moisturizer is required then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, fully recommended for anyone who wants a C serum lightener, or something light and not oily to put on after the shower/washing.</li>
            <li> A little strong on fragrance but at least it is a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Better results for less money??</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for all ages.</li>
            <li> I needed brightening products and decided to try this one because Andalou came highly recommended.</li>

            <li> for the record, I have fairly sensitive skin and this stuff didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Last month I switched to Andalou products from Mineral Fusion which gave me a rash, before that I used MyChelle which just didn&#x27;t seem to do much for me at all.  </li>
            <li> I am 47 years old, have combination skin, and am always concerned with breakouts.  </li>
            <li> If the breakouts still really persist, I&#x27;m going back to my Acure.</li>
            <li> Not heavy for mature skin though.  </li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t give this a true rating as it&#x27;s only been a few weeks since I&#x27;ve used this item.  </li>

            <li> I used worse products, so I will just say that it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> and I still do like something to put on my face after the shower that keeps my face from feeling tight &amp; dry, not necessarily having to be an oil free moisturizer, but ofen that&#x27;s what I go for.</li>
            <li> but ever since I have been using this my skin appears less red and feels much calmer.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My skin loves it.!!It It is a must  in my regime.</li>
            <li> My neck was starting to get a little darkness in the creases. This has erased that.</li>
            <li> Nice light product. Smooths and evens out my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a very high quality and effective brightening serum. I have tried high-end department store serums and drug store brands. I will always go with organic and natural products from now on. Most of these have superior quality even over higher priced brands, part of this is because they do not advertise or use celebrity endorsements like high brands do so less overhead and more focus on product quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turmeric has many skin benefits including brightening the skin and paired with an ester-c it is powerful. I&#x27;ve noticed a dramatic difference in my skin over the life of the first bottle. Pair it with a good sunscreen or all the work won&#x27;t pay off. Also, this is in a pump container that prevents light exposure. This is very important for volatile ingredients such as vitamin c. If possible, serum ingredients should always be in an air-tight and light protected bottle.</li>
            <li> Nicely scented and brightening. Little pricey for the size bottle, but given the health/skin benefits of turmeric (see turmeric dot com) I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Very Light!  It smells like fresh oranges.  It does not irritate skin!</li>
            <li> YES!!!  It has been a few weeks now and my super sensitive face.  I suffer from acne and rosacea and my skin is always red.  I don&#x27;t know what triggers it but ever since I have been using this my skin appears less red and feels much calmer.  I use this in addition to Clinique&#x27;s moisture surge.  Additional tip.  Look up cucumber face masks and try to put it on 2x a week.  This regimen is working for me.</li>
            <li> I am medium to dark in complexion (African American)  and this did not lighten anything on me. But, it did have a nice smell.</li>
            <li> Great product, and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Smooth cream, I bought it becase this product gets best review from Paula choice</li>
            <li> Products has great results, but it smells so strong. The turmeric smell is a little off putting. Other than that, great product</li>
            <li> Great product!.  I&#x27;ve ordered it many times over the years.  I like that it has Tumeric and vitamin C.  It&#x27;s very light and is a great moisturizer to wear under any daily make up.  Highly recommend it and it&#x27;s half the price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I so wanted this product to work.  Have not seen any difference in my skin and it is slightly irritating.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this serum and this skincare line! Definitely worth it:)</li>
            <li> Great ingredients. The texture is creamy and yet very light. A little goes a long way Feels good around the eye area.  However, because of my oily skin I like my vitamin c serums to be more gelish-watery and give me a lifting effect. This serum is not greasy but it leaves a shiny finish and it&#x27;s too hydrating to wear spf or make up on top so I use as a night mousturizer instead.   ---- UPDATE----- Product lasted a month 2 pumps once a day.</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin feel great. Not sure it will really even my skin tone though, which is why I bought it.</li>
            <li> This serum is amazing! It works right away brightening and lightening. It feels very moisterising going on , and yet leaves no trace of stickiness. I plan on adding it to my regular skincare routine.</li>
            <li> Use this for about 5 days to see results. It surprised and delighted me. It has proven more effective than the more expensive brands I&#x27;ve purchased from Sephora. This serum is natural and perfect to blend with liquid makeup or a tinted sunscreen on fingers before application. I use it everyday and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the texture and clarity of my complexion. I have combination/oily skin and have had no issues with breakout. The gel like consistency absorbs easily and is light throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything for me . My sun spots and hyperpigmentation remained as such .</li>
            <li> I like this serum however it goes FAST. One pump gives too much product in my opinion</li>
            <li> this is the best product I have ever used on my face.  I highly recommend for all ages.</li>
            <li> I love this serum from Andalou Naturals it is very light, non-greasy and sinks in quickly it also seems to reduce redness and I would definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> Bought this at Whole Foods the first time around, on a whim - and liked it well enough to order a second bottle from Amazon. This is a very *good* vitamin C serum that you can use every morning. Apply after cleansing, before moisturizer and/or sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this while I was out of town, because I&#x27;d run out of my SkinCeuticals CE Ferulic serum. I didn&#x27;t have an easy way of getting a new bottle of the SkinCeuticals CE Ferulic, and happened upon Andalou Naturals brand Turmeric/C serum at a local Whole Foods store. Grabbed it, and you know what? It is an excellent vitamin C serum. If I could rate it 4.5 stars out of 5, I would - because it&#x27;s a very good product. In some ways, it&#x27;s even better than SkinCeuticals CE Ferulic - because it absorbs quickly. This stuff brightens up your skin like nobody&#x27;s business - and it also seems to firm/tighten up skin as well. With Andalou Naturals Turmeric &amp; Vitamin C serum, I don&#x27;t need to bother with a makeup primer and over time, it seems to improve the look of my skin - fewer pores, a bit glow-y-er, a bit firmer - it&#x27;s just a good thing to have!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product - one of the best skin care items I&#x27;ve tried - and very reasonably priced. This is a high-quality product at an amazing price, compared to other (more expensive) products on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just for the record, I have fairly sensitive skin and this stuff didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are wanting to try a vitamin-C serum and don&#x27;t want to spend $100+ or more - this is the thing to get. As good or better than the more expensive serums out there. Definitely better than the department store brands and a very close approximation of some of the higher-end skin care products you might find at the dermatologist&#x27;s office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this - one of the best vitamin C serums on the market.</li>
            <li> This gives my skin a healthy glow, I use it twice a day and the bottle has lasted more than a month so far. Two pumps is enough to cover my face before I moisturize. Last month I switched to Andalou products from Mineral Fusion which gave me a rash, before that I used MyChelle which just didn&#x27;t seem to do much for me at all.  My skin seems to really like Andalou products, I will recommend them to friends and purchase again.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t give this a true rating as it&#x27;s only been a few weeks since I&#x27;ve used this item.  I ordered this along with the purple night cream and Vitamin C day cream.  I am 47 years old, have combination skin, and am always concerned with breakouts.  One of these products are making my forehead break out a bit.  I got a sample of this from my health food store and it supplied me with only a two day usage.  For years before this cream, I used Acure oil control facial moisturizer, that I loved, but thought I&#x27;d give this a try since the reviews seemed so positive.  I&#x27;ll stick with this and see how it goes and maybe in time it&#x27;ll lighten up my age spots. If the breakouts still really persist, I&#x27;m going back to my Acure.</li>
            <li> It is a creamy serum. I am liking to use it. Let&#x27;s see the results in the future.</li>
            <li> I bought this after researching on Beautypedia, which is excellent for details on efficacy and safety of ingredients, and then on Makeupalley in which consumers rate on their actual experience with products.  This had a good score on both and has mainly natural ingredients, which I appreciate.  The serum is a creamy consistency but light and sinks in quickly.  The smell is also light and doesn&#x27;t linger.  Shipping was fast from this seller and overall I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I needed brightening products and decided to try this one because Andalou came highly recommended. I used Arbonne RE9 Serum and it did not deliver brightening effect, it was also pricey. After using Tumeric Plus C serum for two weeks I already see improvement in my pigmentation. My skin absorbs this serum very quickly. I do not have any break outs any more. I will look into buying other Andalou products in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People with allergies to vitamin C should stay away from it. In general if you have any allergies, check the ingredients first before you buy any product.</li>
            <li> I just got this 2 days ago, but its gentle and  I can already see its softening lines and wrinkles! I already use Andalou&#x27;s 1000 roses, cleanser and day cream..and love them too. This is my go to brand, the price is great too!</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t seen a difference while using this product.  It smells good and leaves your skin feeling moisturized.  I used worse products, so I will just say that it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I love this serum. It is $25 typically at Sprouts and it was on sale on Amazon. It smells great and it really does brighten the skin after consistent use!</li>
            <li> Absorbs into the skin and keeps face moisturized. Can be used with sunblock without all the weight...</li>
            <li> Not greasy...absorbed well....would have given it a 5 star rating but it is overpriced.</li>
            <li> Many years ago when I was a teenager, I started with Proactiv and got accustomed to having an oil free moisturizer. Fast forward a lot of years, and I still do like something to put on my face after the shower that keeps my face from feeling tight &amp; dry, not necessarily having to be an oil free moisturizer, but ofen that&#x27;s what I go for. Sometimes I go for the Ainhoa 24 hours cream but it has also become pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before this one I was using Vitamin C serum and found that it was able to lightening/fade/remove the sun caused freckles on my face. As I&#x27;ve gotten older they fade away less on their own over the winter. It took about a full month for that to happen, and I was also still using a separate moisturizer because the C serum was a bit tacky after drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is really filling both of my desires/needs in one bottle-- C, lightening, and leaving with the texture of less dry. I know others recommend a separate moisturizer afterward, but for me that was not necessary. I will plan on continuing to use this single product going forward, and we&#x27;ll see how things go in the winter and whether a separate moisturizer is required then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, fully recommended for anyone who wants a C serum lightener, or something light and not oily to put on after the shower/washing.</li>
            <li> I was using the Obagi Vitamin C serum and I have to say that after using this one for one week, I have noticed a significant difference on my skin.  Plus the Andalou serum is $40 cheaper than the Obagi.  Better results for less money??? I&#x27;m sold!!!</li>
            <li> On my third bottle. This product delivers what it promises. I have more even skin tone and dark pigmentation has decreased significantly.</li>
            <li> Smells good, absorbs nicely, but didn&#x27;t notice any effects. I use it as a moisturizer or under one depending on how my skin feels that day. I didn&#x27;t love or hate it, but definitely won&#x27;t repurchase it.</li>
            <li> Great serum with highly recommended ingredients. I think it did a great job giving me a glow and tightness.  The odor is strong and unusual but in my opinion not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I can tell this is brightening my skin and evening out my complexion. I have really red and inflamed cheeks. The days I use this, my skin seems calmer. It smells okay, not as good as the other Andalou products. I think the tumeric is a very overpowering smell, but it&#x27;s not terrible and fades quickly. Overall it was worth the price and worked better than the Michael Todd serum I was using before.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  It keeps me moisturized (although do still use a daily moisturizer with this product).  I haven&#x27;t had transformative results, but I&#x27;m not trying to undo skin damage or signs of aging as much as I&#x27;m trying to prevent them.  That said, I do think my skin looks better for having used this product. I will buy from this brand again.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any effect after 3 weeks, but may be out works for other people.</li>
            <li> Works great. Smells good</li>
            <li> Smells great, feels great, has great ingredients!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I only now discovered this humble little serum, someone who is a  skin care fanatic and product junkie extraordinaire. I&#x27;ve seen Andalou products on the shelves forever at Whole Foods, but never got the products. I only got something for the line when I stumbled on the notion of probiotics for one&#x27;s skin (I already look after them for my gut), and their probiotic cleanser came up in a search. I needed more vitamin C serum but seemed like my old standby C E ferulic changed their formula so I thought I&#x27;d try this, even though I don&#x27;t know the C percentage, (and doubt it&#x27;s very high since it&#x27;s not mentioned).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After only one use I saw a difference in my skin, it seemed calmer and more even. I&#x27;ve been using it several days now and my skin is looking more clear and radiant. I got some for my daughter too and she also reported the same. She&#x27;s on the other side of the country but she sent me photo of herself sans makeup and looking glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m putting it on my hands too and hoping it will gradually help lighten my sunspots there. I&#x27;ll report back.</li>
            <li> Wonderful serum that is light,applies easily, and has a nice scent.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps skin looking clear, brighter, and refreshed.  Another great product from&lt;br /&gt;Andalou Naturals.  Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Feels good, applies easily. A little strong on fragrance but at least it is a pleasant smell. Hard to rate effectiveness since that is more of a long term effect. I probably will repurchase.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t see any results yet.  Could be too soon to tell, I will give it another month before I decide</li>
            <li> Love Andalou products! Nontoxic yet deliver results!</li>
            <li> I have normal to oily, mild acne-prone skin and  was a little worried at first because this serum is not oil-free and I was battling clogged pores at the time I started using it.  But I wanted to add Vitamin C to my skin regiment.  I just use 2 small drops morning and night with my oil-free moisturizer and I feel like my complexion has definitely improved.  I don&#x27;t have to wear as much makeup anymore.  The serum is very non-greasy even though it has some oil in it.  And it doesn&#x27;t seem to clog my pores since my pores have been clearing up.  I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Good Eye Moisturizer.  Not heavy for mature skin though.  You can use am or pm.  Not greasy.</li>
            <li> My skin looks distinctly brighter after a month of using this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a superb serum for dry skin.  The list of ingredients is packed to the gills with antioxidants that ward the skin against free-radical damage.  Basically, it&#x27;s an anti-ageing powerhouse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And given how jar packaging for skincare should be one of the seven deadly sins, I love that this serum comes in an airtight and opaque pump container.  It&#x27;s not a lah-di-dah glass bottle - it is and will feel slightly plasticky - but given its excellent formulation and price, I don&#x27;t care!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yes, the price.  Less than $20 for this?  Get out of here.  Clinique, Dr. Dennis Gross, and SK-II charge upwards of $150 for nearly identical serums.  It&#x27;s nuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one downside to this Turmeric+C is the fruit stem cells thing.  They&#x27;re not bad for the skin or anything, they&#x27;re just hooey.  They do nothing at all (visit Beautypedia for a detailed explanation).  Basically, they&#x27;re a gimmick.  I don&#x27;t see why a gimmick is needed given how amazing the serum is and the effect it has had on my skin, but whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, love it.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Helping with my age spots. Yea</li>
