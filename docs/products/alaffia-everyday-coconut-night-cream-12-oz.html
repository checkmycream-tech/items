            <li>I am going to have my 13 year old daughter try the skin care line to see if her complexion improves.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy this again when I run out, but that won&#x27;t be for a very long time since this stuff lasts forever, definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Minimal scent, does not leave me feeling greasy and in general I really like this product line.</li>

            <li> Purchased based on the reviews and that it was all natural and was supposed to help with dry skin but after only using it for two nights it made my face red and hasn&#x27;t helped my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I would highly advised not to use Alaffia Everyday Toner without this facial cream...</li>
            <li> and it seems that it will last a long time !</li>
            <li> I have tried everything from expensive department store brands to cheap Target brands.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s unfortunate, used this product for months, NOW suddenly, the first ingrediant is not Coconut water</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Only negative is that it did cause my pores to clog</li>
            <li> a little, not sure that it&#x27;s non-comodogenic.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed.  </li>
            <li> Product now irritates the skin and I have a bad reaction.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t seem to anger my skin.</li>
            <li> Very Disappointed~</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I like the cream a lot , just not crazy about the scent.</li>
            <li> I love the smell. I put it on my face before I go to bed at night and also use it as a primer before putting on my makeup. I can only find it at Whole Foods and don&#x27;t live near one so I&#x27;m very glad it&#x27;s offered on amazon!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough, not greasy, absorbs well! Smells great! Love it!</li>
            <li> PCC recommended this night face cream.  I absolutely love the smell and how good it makes my skin  feel.  You can actually use this nourishing cream on the skin any time of day on its own.</li>
            <li> Definitely met my expectations. Couldn&#x27;t find what I wanted in stores and this one smells great- lavender and coconut is a great smell at night. Maybe slightly oily but very nice.</li>
            <li> this works okay the smell isn&#x27;t great</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this facial lotion...it has naturally restored balance to my face.  I have tried many other facial creams and this has by far surpassed them all.  I would highly advised not to use Alaffia Everyday Toner without this facial cream...I&#x27;ve already tried without it and there is a huge difference.  These 2 products are just made for one another and this company is very unique...one of the more legit companies out there.  Thanks for developing these products for they have helped me greatly.</li>
            <li> This is a lot of face lotion like it will probably take me a year or longer to gets through it all. I like it because it&#x27;s easy to use and is all natural. I don&#x27;t see where it says it&#x27;s non pore clogging or hypoallergenic but it doesn&#x27;t seem to anger my skin. It smells like lavender so overall I like this better than the day lotion.</li>
            <li> This lotion is very nice, light and it smells really good. There is a lot of it for the price and it seems that it will last a long time !</li>
            <li> Great product!  Very reasonable price, smells lovely and really seeps into skin nicely. Will definelty purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face cream. It&#x27;s vegan and smells like coconut paradise. It&#x27;s light and non-sticky.</li>
            <li> Purchased based on the reviews and that it was all natural and was supposed to help with dry skin but after only using it for two nights it made my face red and hasn&#x27;t helped my dry skin. It is very oily and I woke up with my face feeling tight, oily and had to go back to using my current lotion. Now I&#x27;m stuck with a bottle of lotion that I can&#x27;t use. Very Disappointed~</li>
            <li> I have not used the product yet.  It is not supposed to have a smell but it smells great !!&lt;br /&gt;Waiting for a facial sponge device to arrive and then I shall use the face cream and I&#x27;ll come back with more info.</li>
            <li> Love this product love the smell ales ur skin very soft it&#x27;s not greasy it&#x27;s light enough to use during day shipped the same day orered it I would purchase this product again and price was great large size it will last forever since takes small amount it gets five stars from me</li>
            <li> This is a very moisturizing night cream. A little goes a long way. Skin Feels smooth and supple. I find myself not wanting to use anything else.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells, it&#x27;s a nice and light cream for everyday use</li>
            <li> My Mom is 89 years old and has very dry skin.  She loves how this face cream makes her skin feel.  And the price is very good compared to other creams for the quantity you get.</li>
            <li> For a night cream this is very light and I actually use it during the day time.  Minimal scent, does not leave me feeling greasy and in general I really like this product line.</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt softer or has smelled so good!  I have tried everything from expensive department store brands to cheap Target brands.  I love Everyday Coconut Face night cream, cleanser, toner, and eye cream.  I am obsessed.  And it is just an amazing company.  I am in love and a customer/advocate for life.</li>
            <li> My daughter gave me this cream initially and now I use it regularly.  I have always had dry skin and as a senior now, it is even more challenging.  This cream, using amount sparingly, absorbs thoroughly and quickly and makes my skin feel soft and supple.  Many creams do that, but I like the natural coconut oil at a sensible price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hydrating without being heavy. I love it. I would recommend this to a friend. I have purchased four bottles.</li>
            <li> I honestly tend to feel like I like this one better than the daytime face cream, its  very light, very hydrating for my skin, and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out and no allergic reactions. I will definitely buy this again when I run out, but that won&#x27;t be for a very long time since this stuff lasts forever, definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I got this for myself at a health food store and loved it so much i wanted to get another bottle for my mom. she has pretty sensitive skin, but when she tried my bottle she loved it. i love the way it makes my skin feel! i even put it on my dry elbows and they&#x27;ve never been smoother!</li>

            <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice any benefit of using this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unfortunate, used this product for months, NOW suddenly, the first ingrediant is not Coconut water it&#x27;s the 4th. Product now irritates the skin and I have a bad reaction.</li>
            <li> Feels nice on the skin and has a nice scent.  Only negative is that it did cause my pores to clog a little, not sure that it&#x27;s non-comodogenic.</li>
