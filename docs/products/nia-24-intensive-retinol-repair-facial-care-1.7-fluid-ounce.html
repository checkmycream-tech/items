            <li> I am 64 year old white female and I have used this product and other Nia24 products for more than 7 years. It was recommended by my dermatologist. I look about 7 to 10 years than I actually am. This product has healed scars and inhibits the growth of keratosis.  It works slowly but it does work. It makes the skin smoother and younger. It also helps alleviate fine lines around the eyes and above the mouth. I highly recommend this product and the entire line of products.</li>
            <li> love the nia24 products but last couple of orders from amazon provided me with products that DID NOT provide me with the high quality expect fr  this skin care line.  Amazon should make sure to work with reputable standards.  I will now go back to ordering directly from nia24 whre i have always received fresh top quality skin care products.  Note my recent order from amazon was dated 2012 this is 2015!!!!  It did not spell fresh!</li>
            <li> The product moisturizes,but I can&#x27;t find that it repairs . I guess there is retinol in the product, but this is my least favorite of all the Nia 24 line. I cannot recommend to others.</li>
            <li> It seems to be a really good product.</li>
            <li> It is slow but it gives results</li>
            <li> I love this product.  aside from erasing the brown spots it exfoliates so well leaving my skin  beautifully primed for make up or not  I love the entire line of Nia 24</li>
            <li> I use this at night and my skin feels so soft in the morning! I recommend this product to anyone who experiences dry skin.</li>
            <li> I researched lotions I should use on my face because I just moved to high altitude desert. This one was recommended several places. It really is a nice cream. It is not greasy and you don&#x27;t need very much. Worth the money. I am not crazy about the smell, it is not unpleasant but I was hoping for something more floral, this almost has no smell at all, faintly vanilla maybe.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this from my dermatologist and loved the way it moisturized my skin without feeling greasy.  It really gives my skin a nice healthy look and I won&#x27;t let it run out before I buy some more.</li>
            <li> I love these Nia24 products.  I think I really do see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> No visible results after one month of usage.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful cream.  If use as directed, it produces fantastic results.  I was skeptical and after just a few weeks, I noticed my skin was changing for the better.  A true testament was seeing a picture of myself six months ago and a picture taken last month. My skin looks much younger now and I barely have to wear makeup!</li>
            <li> Product arrived without box &amp; appeared old: smells the same, yet consistency is not like that of the same product I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> Makes skin feel a little oily</li>
            <li> My wife loves the stuff</li>
            <li> The delivery is quick and the cream is quite suitable for winter!</li>
            <li> Have used most NIA 24 products for the past four years religiously .....this is my first disappointment,</li>
            <li> I first bought this from my dermatologist and then got another bottle here because of the excellent price. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but it&#x27;s been two weeks and I definitely notice a difference in the tone of my skin, and the depth of my (44 year) wrinkles. My skin is starting to thin and since using this I feel like it&#x27;s getting more elasticity. I know it takes 28 days to really see a products effectiveness, but I am already with this one. Note that I used the more popular cream in a jar by Nia (forget the name) and I actually like this one better.</li>
            <li> Love it my face is dewy soft and well nourished</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for short time, but so far, I love it.  I have had bad reactions in past to some retinol products, but Nia 24 has not made my skin red and irritated. My skin feels really nice and smooth. I only use at night.</li>
            <li> not sure if it&#x27;s doing anything!</li>
