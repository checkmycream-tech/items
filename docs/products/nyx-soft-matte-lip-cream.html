            <li>I love the formula-</li>
            <li>I really love the color.</li>
            <li>Once mastered, it was ok.</li>
            <li>The color is more like a concealer.  </li>
            <li>I had to wear a lip gloss on top to keep it moist.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love love all the colors,i have Istanbul and Antwerp.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m sure this color will look well on a lighter skin tone)</li>
            <li>so be sure to use a balm under it.</li>
            <li>LONDON is my favorite color for the matte lip cream.</li>
            <li>I suppose it would look better on someone with darker skin.</li>
            <li>More like a light brown.  </li>
            <li>It really lasts and looks good.</li>
            <li>I like how easily it applies and the feel of it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice lip product, however, it dries my lips out very fast.</li>
            <li>color is beautiful, especially on my olive skin tone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very nude color which I liked</li>
            <li>So far so good..</li>
            <li>this is EXTREMELY Natural color on a FAIR skin with hazel eyes...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super moisturizing at the same time, which is impressive given that it does not give any shine, which is exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>my new favorite lip stick/gloss (although it&#x27;s not really a gloss because it&#x27;s perfectly matte).</li>
            <li>Still, I love the texture of this product, and the London color is so pretty.</li>
            <li>but i got this with the super saving shipping deal, so the shipping mishap fortunately was their dime not mine.</li>
            <li>but Buenos Aires gives a soft coral tint which looks lovely!</li>
            <li>Beautiful color, it works well for my medium/ dark complexion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that for this to look</li>
            <li>My lips are kind of dry most of the time.</li>
            <li>I love this matte color very natural.</li>
            <li>I love the soft matte lip cream.</li>
            <li>other than the color change, i&#x27;m in love with these and will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>This color looks so nice , doesn&#x27;t make your lips look dry or chapped once it turns matte .</li>
            <li>this lip creme is at the most 3 inches and it had a full 10 inch long box it was rolling around in!  </li>
            <li>I ordered 4 and will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>the color is exactly what i have been looking for</li>
            <li>I loveeeeeeeee this color, it is my everyday favorite!</li>
            <li>They also smell really good and last a long time on your lips!</li>
            <li>Very matte.</li>
            <li>This goes on very matt</li>
            <li>Lip balm doesn t help much.</li>
            <li>you really have to exfoliate the life out of your lips, but I think that&#x27;s the case for any matte lip color.</li>
            <li>i absolutely love this product, however it took nearly two weeks to get to me and it had an entire box to itself.  </li>
            <li>I love nyx soft matte lip cream and this color is always sold out at my local ulta or CVS</li>
            <li>it goes on very soft and smooth and doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips at all.</li>
            <li>I will try to buy a new one to improve my experience with it.</li>
            <li>Very natural tone.</li>
            <li>Very soft color</li>
            <li>Great product but exactly color of my skin :(</li>
            <li>This is by far</li>
            <li>It looks a bit different on but very close to the color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional makeup artist in video production, and use a ton of NYX products.  </li>
            <li>a little darker then i planned, not really a nude color, more of a peachy brown.</li>
            <li>So far I have only had to apply it once.</li>
            <li>Theres barely any product in it.</li>
            <li>I have always been a little &amp;#34;eh&amp;#34; about matte products in general, however NYX never fails to amaze me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just had to wear a lip balm under it to prevent it from creasing in my natural lip lines and looking excessively dry.</li>

            <li> but it is very dry.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really nude.  </li>
            <li> I have medium/ olive skin and the London Matte Lip Cream is very subtle and does&#x27;t pop as much as I would like it to.</li>
            <li> dries mine out a little, but not to the point were its peeling.</li>
            <li> They are moderately priced, and don&#x27;t hurt defenseless animals in the name of beauty.  </li>
            <li> Usually sold out everywhere</li>
            <li> but at the time I applied it, it seemed like it had been used, like the container was almost empty and it was difficult for me to get some product from the walls of the container.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product, even though I was really excited to get it.</li>

            <li> Very matte. Dries up lips. Very natural tone. I would recommend if you don&#x27;t mind the constant lip licking and a sandpaperish feeling at the tip of your tongue.</li>
            <li> I really love the color. I just had to wear a lip balm under it to prevent it from creasing in my natural lip lines and looking excessively dry. Once mastered, it was ok.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product, even though I was really excited to get it. I got it at a drugstore but at the time I applied it, it seemed like it had been used, like the container was almost empty and it was difficult for me to get some product from the walls of the container. I will try to buy a new one to improve my experience with it.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color, it works well for my medium/ dark complexion.</li>
            <li> I love the soft matte lip cream. It doesn&#x27;t dry your lips and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Wish the color lasted longer</li>
            <li> This is by far my new favorite lip stick/gloss (although it&#x27;s not really a gloss because it&#x27;s perfectly matte). It&#x27;s super moisturizing at the same time, which is impressive given that it does not give any shine, which is exactly what I was hoping for. I will definitely be purchasing again to play with some different colors options!!</li>
            <li> So far so good.. I like the matte dry look... this is EXTREMELY Natural color on a FAIR skin with hazel eyes... So far I have only had to apply it once.</li>
            <li> The color is more like a concealer.  I like how easily it applies and the feel of it.  I will probably purchase another color.</li>
            <li> apply once and it stays on all day.. the only problem some people may have is that its a matte finish so it may possibly dry out your lip as the day goes on. dries mine out a little, but not to the point were its peeling. so love this color and feel! I ordered 4 and will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> I loveeeeeeeee this color, it is my everyday favorite! It looks a bit different on but very close to the color.</li>
            <li> a little darker then i planned, not really a nude color, more of a peachy brown. other than the color change, i&#x27;m in love with these and will be ordering more. it goes on very soft and smooth and doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips at all.</li>
            <li> My lips are kind of dry most of the time. This goes on very matt but it is very dry.  I had to wear a lip gloss on top to keep it moist.  It&#x27;s a very nude color which I liked</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional makeup artist in video production, and use a ton of NYX products.  They are moderately priced, and don&#x27;t hurt defenseless animals in the name of beauty.  Every item and color I&#x27;ve used from them has been great - including this Matte Cream.</li>
            <li> Its like someone used it already or its starting to dry out.. Theres barely any product in it. I&#x27;m dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I love it. Just purchased one in Copanhagen and it&#x27;s a gorgeous color.</li>
            <li> I love love all the colors,i have Istanbul and Antwerp.The thing is,it leaves your lips SO DRY,after like 15 min i can t wait to take it off,it becomes uncomfortable.Lip balm doesn t help much.I was planning to buy and Tokyo but now i dont think so.</li>
            <li> Love these lip creams!! I own just about every color. They also smell really good and last a long time on your lips!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that for this to look it&#x27;s best you really have to exfoliate the life out of your lips, but I think that&#x27;s the case for any matte lip color. Still, I love the texture of this product, and the London color is so pretty. Understated, but quite beautiful. Also, can&#x27;t beat that price!</li>
            <li> I have always been a little &amp;#34;eh&amp;#34; about matte products in general, however NYX never fails to amaze me.&lt;br /&gt;The color is beautiful, especially on my olive skin tone. And it DOESN&#x27;T DRY OUT.&lt;br /&gt;This is my second one I&#x27;m ordering.</li>
            <li> This color looks so nice , doesn&#x27;t make your lips look dry or chapped once it turns matte . Just perfect !</li>
            <li> I have medium/ olive skin and the London Matte Lip Cream is very subtle and does&#x27;t pop as much as I would like it to. I wish it was either darker or lighter. (I&#x27;m sure this color will look well on a lighter skin tone)</li>
            <li> Great product but exactly color of my skin :(</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a nude lipstick that works with my chocolate complexion.  This dries matte so be sure to use a balm under it.</li>
            <li> It really lasts and looks good. It&#x27;s better if you use some kind of balm under it so they don&#x27;t look dry.</li>
            <li> I love this lip cream! I have an olive complexion and this color looks like a nude/brown on me. I also purchased Istanbul and Buenos Aires. Istanbul is too purply-pink on my lips but Buenos Aires gives a soft coral tint which looks lovely!</li>
            <li> I thought i would try this product and i just love it! the color is exactly what i have been looking for</li>
            <li> Very soft color I love this matte color very natural.</li>
            <li> I hate how this matte lipgloss looks I ended up buying a different type of NYX nude gloss</li>
            <li> LONDON is my favorite color for the matte lip cream. Usually sold out everywhere, that&#x27;s why I resorted to amazon for this purchase! THANK YOU! Will purchase again when I run out. Dries like a lipstick and goes on like a gloss. I pair it with a brownish lip liner and never have a problem with it staying on.  PERFECT</li>
            <li> This is the ugliest color.  It&#x27;s not really nude.  More like a light brown.  I suppose it would look better on someone with darker skin.</li>
