            <li>I have fine curly hair.</li>
            <li>I have a full head of fine hair, and this does not get built up in my hair.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>with the type of hair I have, coarse and frizzy, this is so far the best conditioner I found.</li>

            <li>nothing special for the money you pay.</li>
            <li>BUT WHEN RECEIVED THE BOTTLE WAS 3/4 FULL</li>
            <li>Use it with the macadamia shampoo for full effect.</li>
            <li>The full size is not even close.</li>
            <li>But it doesnt stay on ur hair it wears off really quick.</li>
            <li>Their products are well made, work well, smell great and don&#x27;t weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li>Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find this conditioner any special except that it smells really</li>
            <li>it is good with the other product I suggestion for people with very damage hair</li>

            <li>I am a guy with short hair and love this product.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner worked very well!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle (sulfate free) and always leaves my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>Not many stores carry this product where I live and all the salon and beauty shops I been tell me its a great product to use.</li>
            <li>This stuff leaves your hair incredibly silky, especially when you use it with the shampoo which has less detergent than regular shampoos so your hair gets clean but not stripped.</li>
            <li>I would only suggest this for someone with normal healthy hair with money to blow.</li>
            <li>Then the conditioner makes it super soft.</li>
            <li>I try not to buy certain things from just anybody online after this experience.</li>
            <li>I thought this would make my hair much smoother</li>
            <li>AS DESCRIBED REALLY DON&#x27;T KNOW HOW THEY WEIGHT THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>Comparable to a regular cheap conditioner.</li>
            <li>Played with whole bottle.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Also I really like it</li>
            <li>I have very oily hair</li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing...at all.  </li>

            <li>My hair: bleached, damaged, dry, frizzy, naturally curly at nape of neck and waves on top.</li>
            <li>left my hair very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it to anybody</li>
            <li>I use the entire line, worth every penny</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy which I love since my hair tends to hold moisture.</li>
            <li>this was a cheap imitation would not recommend the oil</li>
            <li>I have super dry, unruly hair</li>
            <li>My hair becomes light weight and less tangeled .  </li>
            <li>its way tooooo heavy for my fine medium textured hair..</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and shiny and I use it along with the shampoo and the repair conditioner and the leave in conditioner as well.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really notice that much of a difference from any other decent shampoo, other than price.</li>
            <li>Left my daughter&#x27;s hair, which has suffered from severe sun and chlorine exposure, soft and manageable!</li>
            <li>disappointing I bought in the salon and loved it</li>

            <li> disappointing I bought in the salon and loved it</li>
            <li> My hair tends to be dry especially at the ends, this product leaves my hair soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> and so usually by the end of the day my hair looks less than fabulous, but these work well to keep my hair looking shiny and still have volume.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft, but other than that, I haven&#x27;t seen any difference health-wise.</li>
            <li> Not something you want to smell just to enjoy, but it also doesn&#x27;t have that weird chemical smell so hair products have.</li>
            <li> Leave on too long</li>
            <li> Ill keep it short and sweet...</li>
            <li> It added some of the essential moisture back to my hair without weighing it down or making it feel oily.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t last as hair dried, so that didn&#x27;t matter to me.</li>
            <li> This is the only hair product I use now , I recommended to anyone that has dried, fizzy, damaged hair, as well as, to those who have had their hair treated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and for some odd reason my hair hates citrusy ingredients..and didnt make my hair manageable..and not soft..</li>
            <li> split-ends appear to be less frizzed.....</li>
            <li> Tried using a little as a leave-in.</li>
            <li> My wife is Colombian and has very dark hair.</li>
            <li> and it makes your hair heavy.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping that this product would provide moisture to help tame it, but it did no more than OTC brands.</li>
            <li> but i cannot buy this macadamia nut shampoo and conditioner no more..</li>
            <li> That is difficult for me to find, so I will definitely keep using.</li>
            <li> I have used this conditioner before, &amp; it continues to enhance my hair without leaving any residue to dull it.</li>
            <li> Which is quit hard to find...</li>
            <li> i bought the leave in at trade secret and felt soooo hurt that it didnt work for my hair..</li>
            <li> sorry i have to admit that the macadamia nut shampoo and conditioner for some reason it has citrus ingredients in it</li>
            <li> It smells weird to me</li>
            <li> Too bad I can&#x27;t find the travel size at my cvs anymore.</li>
            <li> maybe she&#x27;s allergic to some of the content or maybe the product is just bad</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> I HATED</li>
            <li> Horrible, horrible feeling hair.</li>
            <li> Awful.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I was disappointed in this product.  I thought this would make my hair much smoother and it isn&#x27;t as good as most of the cheaper conditioners I buy.  Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I HATED THIS PRODUCT WAS VERY EXCITED WHEN I ORDERED BUT WHEN RECEIVED THE BOTTLE WAS 3/4 FULL I DIDN&#x27;T GET THE 10 OZ AS DESCRIBED REALLY DON&#x27;T KNOW HOW THEY WEIGHT THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> sorry i have to admit that the macadamia nut shampoo and conditioner for some reason it has citrus ingredients in it and for some odd reason my hair hates citrusy ingredients..and didnt make my hair manageable..and not soft..i bought the leave in at trade secret and felt soooo hurt that it didnt work for my hair..i had to return it..its way tooooo heavy for my fine medium textured hair..i love your excellent customer services very very fast and very courteous excellent service..but i cannot buy this macadamia nut shampoo and conditioner no more..it didnt work for my hair..but i will continue to support the company here in amazon who i bought it from, and I love amazon.com also..very EXCELLENT Customer services thank you amazon and thank you for selling many awesome products.</li>
            <li> This is a great product I use it every time and keeps my hair nice and soft and clean.  PS I am a guy with short hair and love this product.  Use it with the macadamia shampoo for full effect.</li>
            <li> with the type of hair I have, coarse and frizzy, this is so far the best conditioner I found. The scent is more noticeable. My co-workers always make a comment how good smelling my hair is.</li>
            <li> I seached the web for this product and found that this was the best price across the board.  This will leave your hair in great shape. It makes my hair soft and shiny and I use it along with the shampoo and the repair conditioner and the leave in conditioner as well.  Well worth the investment. I would buy this product again and again.</li>
            <li> My hair: bleached, damaged, dry, frizzy, naturally curly at nape of neck and waves on top. I don&#x27;t personally care for the scent but it didn&#x27;t last as hair dried, so that didn&#x27;t matter to me. Used as directed. Results were same as a low-grade conditioner. Didn&#x27;t soften, make healthier, make split-ends appear to be less frizzed.....nothing. Comparable to a regular cheap conditioner. Played with whole bottle. Tried using generous amount. Tried to condition twice. Tried using a little as a leave-in. Nothing worked. I also have the oil/leave-in treatment, which I did like. I would only suggest this for someone with normal healthy hair with money to blow.</li>
            <li> Ill keep it short and sweet...This conditioner worked very well! left my hair very soft and smooth. I would definitely  recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have used this conditioner before, &amp; it continues to enhance my hair without leaving any residue to dull it.</li>
            <li> Since I have to do a texture treatment and the keratin treatment, I must use a hair product that has disodium laureth sulfosuccinate. Which is quit hard to find... Thankfully I found this product and it works great for my treated hair. Not many stores carry this product where I live and all the salon and beauty shops I been tell me its a great product to use. It smells great too which is a plus. This is the only hair product I use now , I recommended to anyone that has dried, fizzy, damaged hair, as well as, to those who have had their hair treated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside the bottle is only 10z so every two weeks I have to order the next set.</li>
            <li> .... but it&#x27;s not for me.  Didn&#x27;t really notice that much of a difference from any other decent shampoo, other than price.</li>
            <li> disappointing I bought in the salon and loved it the smell was different too this was a cheap imitation would not recommend the oil however was good</li>
            <li> I really love this conditioner. I have a full head of fine hair, and this does not get built up in my hair. That is difficult for me to find, so I will definitely keep using. It also has a pretty good smell. Not something you want to smell just to enjoy, but it also doesn&#x27;t have that weird chemical smell so hair products have.</li>
            <li> Left my daughter&#x27;s hair, which has suffered from severe sun and chlorine exposure, soft and manageable! I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer, keeps hair soft and smelling good.</li>
            <li> This stuff leaves your hair incredibly silky, especially when you use it with the shampoo which has less detergent than regular shampoos so your hair gets clean but not stripped. Then the conditioner makes it super soft.</li>
            <li> the item is as described and has great quality. Also I really like it and I highly recommend it to anybody</li>
            <li> I think if I could become a spokesperson for Macadamia, I probably would. Their products are well made, work well, smell great and don&#x27;t weigh down my hair. I have very oily hair and so usually by the end of the day my hair looks less than fabulous, but these work well to keep my hair looking shiny and still have volume.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It has made my wife&#x27;s hair look and feel great. It makes it look very healthy and strong. And you know its great because a bald guy is leaving the review. My wife is Colombian and has very dark hair. This makes it look clean and shiny like in the commercials on TV.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find this conditioner any special except that it smells really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the shampoo and the mask with it and the mask is really amazing. Don&#x27;t see the value in getting the shampoo and rinse though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have wavy frizzy colored fine hair and it&#x27;s not improving it in any way.</li>
            <li> Love this product! My hair tends to be dry especially at the ends, this product leaves my hair soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time and am very pleased with the outcome. Made my hair soft fresh and clean and manageable. It ha a very clean scent. I love this product and will purchase again!</li>
            <li> All I can say Its just ok...nothing special for the money you pay.Will not buy again.Does not do anything to my hair.</li>
            <li> This moisturizing Rinse is great for oily hair. It added some of the essential moisture back to my hair without weighing it down or making it feel oily. Very impressed!</li>
            <li> it is good with the other product I suggestion for people with very damage hair</li>
            <li> Love this product! I was so excited to find it on Amazon. I have fine wavy hair and I love how easy my hair is to style after I use it.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner so smooth when its washed off. My hair becomes light weight and less tangeled .  It smells weird to me but some people like this smell. But it doesnt stay on ur hair it wears off really quick.</li>
            <li> This is a great rinse...respect the 30-60 seconds it says to leave on before rinsing.  Leave on too long and it makes your hair heavy.  Love the shampoo too!</li>
            <li> This is the greatest conditioner everrrrrrr. It worked wonders on my Brazilian hair. It made it soft and shine i love it!!!</li>
            <li> I was impressed with the way the travel sized containers left my hair feeling. The full size is not even close. Won&#x27;t be repurchasing. Or if I do, will make sure to buy somewhere I can return it if I don&#x27;t like it. Horrible, horrible feeling hair. I try not to buy certain things from just anybody online after this experience. Too bad I can&#x27;t find the travel size at my cvs anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so upset with this product.  It did absolutely nothing...at all.  It wasn&#x27;t conditioning.  It didn&#x27;t do any detangling, basically made my hair more tangled.  I thought this would be amazing because the oil treatment is wonderful.  I used quite a bit to see if that would make a difference and it felt like I only used a dime size amount.  Awful.</li>
            <li> I have super dry, unruly hair and this does the trick. I use the entire line, worth every penny</li>
            <li> I have fine curly hair. I was hoping that this product would provide moisture to help tame it, but it did no more than OTC brands.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner and would buy it again. It&#x27;s gentle (sulfate free) and always leaves my hair so soft. Smells good too!</li>
            <li> I use this each time I wash my hair and really like it. It&#x27;s not too heavy which I love since my hair tends to hold moisture. I didn&#x27;t want anything that would add more to my drying time. This rinses well and gets all the tangles out. I will definitely buy more!!!</li>
            <li> My wife had rash after using this product maybe she&#x27;s allergic to some of the content or maybe the product is just bad</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft, but other than that, I haven&#x27;t seen any difference health-wise.</li>
