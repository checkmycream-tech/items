            <li>Nice size bottle, comes with a cap too.</li>
            <li>Nice bottle.  </li>
            <li>it kind of just sends a stream rather than a mist.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Mostly we use them for swim goggle spray, nice thing they don&#x27;t leak and spray a nice mist.</li>
            <li>That and the mist produced is very fine.</li>
            <li>However, as others have stated the spray is very very fine.</li>
            <li>which is very important to me.</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought them.</li>
            <li>The spray is more of an atomized mist, so it wasn&#x27;t as useful for the applications I had planned, but it works and is a good value.</li>
            <li>I use them for home perms, because my husband is no longer able to apply the chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Simple and perfect.</li>
            <li>Fabulous!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe the price on them, would&#x27;ve paid more.</li>
            <li>These are okay, but are inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Cheap, effective, and stores many of my homemade products.</li>
            <li>put lavender oil and water in one and spray my sheets and my child&#x27;s sheets for a better night sleep.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This bottle really does spray a very fine mist!  </li>
            <li>They worked fine.</li>
            <li>I use it for spraying medicene on my ankles to relive stiffness &amp; pain.&lt;br /&gt;Mixed DMSO with distilled water and got fine mist and no clogging.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>The water drops are just fine.</li>
            <li>These little bottles are wonderful for holding my anti-static sprays, dog colognes, coat conditioners, etc.</li>
            <li>They look cheap in the pictures, but these suprisingly have the feel of durability.</li>
            <li>They are cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>These are nice quality clear plastic bottles that spray well and could be used for many applications.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to carry full size bottles.  </li>
            <li>great quality, they don&#x27;t get stuck like other mist</li>
            <li>They spray a fine mist consistently every time.</li>
            <li>Great bottle to fit small liquids in.  </li>
            <li>Great little bottles for the price.</li>
            <li>These are great little spray bottles.  </li>
            <li>also good to spray on you with just water to cool you down in the heat..</li>
            <li>it identify the ingredients, and I can easily see the contents thru the clear bottle.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>These are perfect to small things like scented facial water spray or homemade electronic cleaner!  </li>
            <li>The bottles arrived in a timely manner and were exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Product exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>so I switched to an older bottle I had been previously using for something else and that older bottle worked great.  </li>
            <li>it makes such a fine mist</li>
            <li>I use these to store my homemade room deodorizers (water and essential oils mixture) and they dispense just fine.  </li>
            <li>They work very well.  </li>
            <li>Feels sturdy and sprays very evenly.</li>
            <li>is very valuable in my van.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t waste space with big bottle, and they fit my hand nicely.</li>
            <li>worked like a champ, I really didn&#x27;t need 6</li>
            <li>The plastic is much thicker and more substantial than I had expected.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps the other 5 are better.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t leak, and they are nice and small</li>
            <li>Good for travel and only had a little problem with one leaking when I sprayed it.  </li>
            <li>They seem to be well made and come with a little cap over the top of the sprayer.</li>
            <li>tiny and do exactly what they promise.</li>
            <li>They work fine with one complaint, if you place liquids in these that you do, or may want to, shake up before spraying, be aware they will leak out of the nozzle.</li>
            <li>I put labels on the hotties, then clear tape over that</li>
            <li>I bought these sprayers to create homemade air fresheners using alcohol, distilled water and natural oils (orange, rosemary, clove, etc.).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tried one bottle so far and the pump isn&#x27;t working well.  </li>
            <li>Wanted these for a fine mist spray they kind of sputter every other time, seems like they could be a&lt;br /&gt;little less expensive for the product.</li>
            <li>It is very had to press down and get  any liquid out of the bottle.  </li>

            <li> These are just a little taller than I thought at about 7&amp;#34;; but they&#x27;ll work for what I need..</li>
            <li> Had to learn to spray heavily enough to saturate, and yes, my hand got tired.</li>
            <li> I tried using one for olive oil and that was a failure...</li>
            <li> although it doesn&#x27;t appear to be broken anywhere, the sprayer refuses to spray any longer.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t spray in a &amp;#34;mist&amp;#34; at all. Tiny stream shoots out forcefully.</li>
            <li> Great bottle to fit small liquids in.  I use it for my diaper bag so I don&#x27;t have to carry full size bottles.  They are well made.</li>
            <li> I use these bottles for home made spray air fresheners and they don&#x27;t seem to clog as others have. The mist really is fine so is perfect for my use.  I haven&#x27;t had them long so don&#x27;t know about durability but will post again if I find the pump spray doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> The spray is more of an atomized mist, so it wasn&#x27;t as useful for the applications I had planned, but it works and is a good value.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t pay $3/bottle in a store when you can get this.</li>
            <li> I am using them to keep paper moist/wet when painting watercolor. They are good for that purpose. The water drops are just fine.</li>

            <li> Used them to make home made bug spray. Worked great. Nice size bottle, comes with a cap too. Good purchase</li>
            <li> Nice bottle.  The plastic is much thicker and more substantial than I had expected.  I have purchased these twice for craft projects and will purchase again.  Sprays great, too.</li>

            <li> These are perfect for anyone who likes to make their own homemade stuff.  A good find for a good price.</li>
            <li> I use these bottles to mix paint for mixed media to create spray ink.  They work wonderfully, and I have yet to have one clog.</li>
            <li> Wanted these for a fine mist spray they kind of sputter every other time, seems like they could be a&lt;br /&gt;little less expensive for the product.</li>
            <li> Simple and perfect. Great seller. I needed to make a eyeglass cleaner solution to get rid of all the gunk built up from the products I was sold at eyecare store...rubbing alcohol and water....I can see without the schmears.</li>
            <li> Fabulous!  Exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I bought these sprayers to create homemade air fresheners using alcohol, distilled water and natural oils (orange, rosemary, clove, etc.). These work great for this purpose, giving you plenty of control on the amount you use in each instance. That and the mist produced is very fine.</li>

            <li> Works great.  I use it for dispensing a homemade bug spray solution.</li>
            <li> Great little bottles for the price. I&#x27;m a mobile fog groomer and space is very valuable in my van.  These little bottles are wonderful for holding my anti-static sprays, dog colognes, coat conditioners, etc. They spray a fine mist consistently every time. They don&#x27;t leak, and they are nice and small so I don&#x27;t waste space with big bottle, and they fit my hand nicely. I put labels on the hotties, then clear tape over that it identify the ingredients, and I can easily see the contents thru the clear bottle.</li>
            <li> tiny and do exactly what they promise. I use mine for spraying tea tree oil and they work great. I tried using one for olive oil and that was a failure... it kind of just sends a stream rather than a mist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried one bottle so far and the pump isn&#x27;t working well.  It is very had to press down and get  any liquid out of the bottle.  At first I though the liquid I put in the bottle may be too thick for the narrow spray tube so I switched to an older bottle I had been previously using for something else and that older bottle worked great.  The tubes in the new bottle seem very narrow to me.  I did not  check out all 6 spray pumps as of this writing.  Perhaps the other 5 are better.</li>
            <li> worked like a champ, I really didn&#x27;t need 6 but now I only have two left empty as I&#x27;ve found a use for a few more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mostly we use them for swim goggle spray, nice thing they don&#x27;t leak and spray a nice mist.</li>
            <li> Individually wrapped in plastic sleeves and then in a bag. All worked well. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> The bottles arrived in a timely manner and were exactly what I wanted.  They are good quality and a good price.</li>
            <li> These are great little spray bottles.  They seem to be well made and come with a little cap over the top of the sprayer. They do not leak when turned upside down which is very important to me. However, as others have stated the spray is very very fine. I would have preferred a heavier spray, but I&#x27;ll make this work.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for barbers or anyone who needs to have a quality bottle with a misty spray nozzle. I can&#x27;t believe the price on them, would&#x27;ve paid more.</li>
            <li> These are okay, but are inexpensive. They work fine with one complaint, if you place liquids in these that you do, or may want to, shake up before spraying, be aware they will leak out of the nozzle. They come with a cap over the spray head so you wan&#x27;t get any on you when shaking, however, when you remove the cap, the spray head will have whatever liquid you have in there on the plunger and head.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;mist&amp;#34; is not consistent, it tends to &amp;#34;spit&amp;#34; out the product.</li>
            <li> Sprays well and misty on the intended target.</li>
            <li> Cheap, effective, and stores many of my homemade products. Great for oils, and skin sprays.</li>
            <li> This bottle really does spray a very fine mist!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I use these spray bottles for air deodorizer and for surface refresher like Febreze.  it makes such a fine mist so it is perfect.  we never get droplets of chemical on the surfaces.  nice!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a spray bottle.  It sprays correctly.</li>
            <li> These are just a little taller than I thought at about 7&amp;#34;; but they&#x27;ll work for what I need.. I&#x27;m using them for different hunting scents mixed with a little water to spray to check windage and also to spray on the bottom of my boots when going out into the filed. also good to spray on you with just water to cool you down in the heat..</li>

            <li> great quality, they don&#x27;t get stuck like other mist bottles.&lt;br /&gt;I put lavender oil and water in one and spray my sheets and my child&#x27;s sheets for a better night sleep.&lt;br /&gt;I also use them for a foot spray and a shoe spray to keep odors and fungi away.</li>
            <li> These bottles are durable and spray well.  Product exactly as described.  I use these to store my homemade room deodorizers (water and essential oils mixture) and they dispense just fine.  Recommend to anyone who needs good quality spray bottles at a fair price.</li>
            <li> Great service and product as advertised. A very good spray bottle, hasn&#x27;t clogged at all and spray is very fine.</li>
            <li> PERFECT SIZE AND MIST SPRAY!!</li>
