            <li> If I were actually able to get the lotion out of the bottle I might be able to comment on it.  The bottle is so hard that it&#x27;s impossible to squeeze the lotion out of it.  I did remove the cap and tried getting some out with a chopstick but that is very labor intensive.  Why would anyone put something in a squeeze bottle that won&#x27;t squeeze?  This may be wonderful product but I&#x27;ll never know as it&#x27;s impossible to remove it from the container.  I suppose I could try sawing the top off.</li>
            <li> I really love this unscented MSM cream,  I put it on surgery scars and it greatly helps itching and discomfort,</li>
            <li> Well, I bought this for myself and my husband has taken it for himself.  It is really good for your skin.  I can see where I&#x27;ll be buying his and hers Rich&#x27;s MSM Lotion.</li>
            <li> This pure lotion is very light and instantly absorbed to benefit the skin. It&#x27;s wonderful for the face, feet, the whole body. Refreshing with absolutely no fragrance. Applies like silk! If you like a little fragrance, add a small amount of other lotions to this one and get the lightest fragrance in a remarkably light product.</li>
            <li> This lotion is easy to use - I have been applying daily and have noticed that the MSM is definitely getting to the&lt;br /&gt;skin as described.  I like that the lotion doesn&#x27;t have a lot of artificial ingredients in it.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this product! I would compare it with a 1$ bottle of dollar store lotion! Blah!</li>
            <li> I guess I should have scrutinized the ingredients list better--this product contains paraben, which is linked to health problems such as Endocrine disruption, developmental and reproductive toxicity, allergies and immunotoxicity. I&#x27;m having a hard time finding a &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; msm lotion since the Trimedica brand doesn&#x27;t seem to be available any longer.</li>
            <li> This lotion is pretty awesome. I&#x27;ve been having a lot of lower back pain and stiffness and I hate having to pop a pill every time I&#x27;m hurting, so now (on most occurrences) I just rub this lotto on. It really helps relieve most of the pain. It feels good on and doesn&#x27;t smell. I would recommend this to anyone who is considering this purchase; definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> Quick service - very good product.  Much as I&#x27;d expected/hoped it&#x27;d be.  Thank you</li>
            <li> This lotion was made by a man who had 70% burns all over his body.  It was used to ease away the scars from the burns.  This lotion works for everything from burns, cuts, bruises to wrinkled crappie skin and everything in between.  I&#x27;ve been buying it for years and use it on my face as well as my body and when it comes to lotions, this is the only lotion I buy for all purpose uses.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of MSM - I have been taking the supplements for awhile now. I wanted to try this lotion to see if I noticed any topical benefits.  The lotions works great as a simple moisturizer and I have noticed that my skin is super soft and smooth after using it.</li>
            <li> My mom got me hooked on the Rich&#x27;s brand MSM lotion years ago....and I use this lotion religiously every morning after taking a shower.  I don&#x27;t break out from it and it actually has some healing properties.  I would suggest anyone who has any kind of skin issues to at least try the stuff.  I also use it for bug bites and cat scratches and sunburns......excellent!</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for 15 years,it calms a dry skin into a soft moisturized skin. It helps with wrinkles and sores. Seems to make a huge difference if used everyday.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday on my sensitive face and on sunburn and bug bites. Two teenagers used it and cured their acne. Even use on dog occasionally if she gets an itchy spot. Use daily as hand lotion because not at all greasy. Keep a small airplane size in my purse. I buy the pump and the gallon size.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for anyone who has dry scaley heels, and feet. It is the best and found that my feet are now soft, and clean of dryness</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream after it was recommended on a skincare site for women, and must say I have been impressed!&lt;br /&gt;Rich’s MSM Lotion keeps your skin moisturized all day. It is very light and has a pleasant scent. I used it under makeup. It absorbs super-fast, leaves no residue and is not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I have normal to combination skin, and I also noticed a reduction in acne and hyperpigmentation since using this product. It’s perfect for anyone with skin issues. It speeds up the healing process and prevents break-outs.</li>
            <li> like this lotion good for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  It works much better than any other I have tried.  It even makes black and blue marks disappear faster and helps my stiff neck.</li>
            <li> We use this regularly at night and it&#x27;s great for minor aches and pains, feels great on your skin too.</li>
            <li> Rich&#x27;s MSM Lotion Unscented 8 Fluid oz; nothing new about product except the increase in cost since the last time it was purchased.</li>
