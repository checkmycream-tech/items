            <li>I love these brushes.</li>
            <li>Just  make sure you wash them.</li>
            <li>Krazy glue or (more longer solution )</li>
            <li>all my make up brushes that I already have with room to spare, and my existing brush roll has seen much better days.  </li>
            <li>There are more brushes in here than I know what to do with.</li>
            <li>As many have said before, there was a pungent smell upon opening it.</li>
            <li>more than I know to do with.</li>
            <li>If you guys are looking for great brushes try sigma or real techniques.</li>
            <li>And I love them.</li>
            <li>All 24 but no labels which is ok</li>
            <li>Love them I have ever size I need to do my makeup the way I want</li>
            <li>I Love the makeup brushes&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good quality, minimum shedding &amp; a great set overall.</li>
            <li>alot cant wait to use them :)</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s amazing and cheap..</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>for give away, smell a bit funny, you get what you paid for and its awsome!!!</li>
            <li>I just got these today and so far so good!</li>
            <li>I love,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with my new brushes</li>
            <li>I love my brushes so much, they have an extremely good quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good product, but my concealer brush broke easily the first two days and another brush broke after a week.</li>
            <li>Other than that perfect</li>
            <li>I was worried that the hair would fall off easily but after cleaning them none came off.</li>
            <li>I honestly bought if for the big fan brush, but the rest of the brushes are good.</li>
            <li>Bag had strong odor but was tolerable.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m strongly debating ordering another one now</li>
            <li>There was a strong plastic kinda leathery smell .</li>
            <li>I also got 30 brushes, which is fine by me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>They came perfectly fine, just like the picture.</li>
            <li>Cheap falls apart too easily</li>
            <li>I bought these back in September and they are still as perfect as when i first bought them.</li>
            <li>They came labeled which is a super plus!</li>
            <li>It got here so quick !</li>
            <li>At the beginning I thought it was a little bit risky because of the price, but when they arrived I felt sooooo happy!</li>
            <li>Absolutely fabulous a definite must buy, great value for the price.</li>
            <li>I think it has been made with cheap material.</li>
            <li>They are packed well and a great buy for how low in cost they were.</li>
            <li>But on the bright side the shipment came early.</li>
            <li>I would recommend these brushes, because they&#x27;re cheap.</li>
            <li>Been looking for a good natural brush set..</li>
            <li>So far so good .</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re look to buy some professional brushes, these are the ones to get!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I am so excited to start applying my makeup.</li>
            <li>Those are my first brush set and so far I&#x27;m super happy.</li>
            <li>But I did clean them and non of the hairs came out.</li>
            <li>I clean them every week with baby shampoo to keep them nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Love these brushes very sturdy and does the work plus affordable</li>
            <li>My brushes came within a week, they are really nice soft quality brushes.</li>
            <li>such good quality for such a good price</li>
            <li>I payed for these brushes with my own money for any people who are looking for an unbiased review, and they are soooooo soft and they came wayyyyyy before the time that they were supposed to be here</li>
            <li>It comes in a easy to store pouch and they all have their own individual socket.</li>
            <li>Those could all be replaced with 1 really good tapered blending brush or a flat kabuki.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly .one</li>
            <li>brush fell apart quickly .</li>
            <li>Which is so much better, especially for me trying to learn more make-up techniques and style.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hold product super well, didn&#x27;t come with an angled eyeliner brush.</li>
            <li>These brushes came so quick that git a A in my book...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend :)</li>
            <li>Very light and soft</li>
            <li>but theirs nothing to second guess about at all its a amazing product.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hold make-up well, but very much worth the price.</li>
            <li>And came on time worth the money.</li>
            <li>Love it, so pretty and feels very professional</li>
            <li>Nothing baby wash can&#x27;t do it cane right off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to come right out and say it: I am a brush snob.  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly, some are very decent quality and worth keeping in the roll as back up brushes for when my main ones are drying from a cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li>that well, eyeshadow brushes are very good quality, no repeats came a day later than expected, and as for the smell it is NOT the brushes</li>
            <li>As far as the brushes I&#x27;m no makeup artist but the brushes are pretty good and especially for that price .</li>
            <li>thank you very much for my make up brushes 😍😍</li>
            <li>- I strongly recommend always using a brush cleaner (even on brand new brushes) and cleaning your brushes before using them on your face.rush expelled a fine, powdery substance when I initially ran them through my fingers - I strongly recommend always using a brush cleaner (even on brand new brushes) and cleaning your brushes before using them on your face.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am pleased with the quality of the brushes.  </li>
            <li>However, the &amp;#34;angled eye shadow brush&amp;#34; fell apart before first use.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed ordered a set for my daughter too.</li>
            <li>THIS IS HER FIRST SET OF BRUSHES THAT SHE HAS</li>
            <li>The brushes are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Very affordable!</li>
            <li>hot glue gun can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li>Or if you are treś satisfied, simply replace them about every 8-12 months.</li>
            <li>I pack my entire brush roll with me when I travel, and it needs to be able to protect my brushes and take a bit of abuse.  </li>
            <li>(Don&#x27;t remember exactly what brand)</li>
            <li>and pretty i like them</li>
            <li>one of my brushes is a bit crooked at the top.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m really pleased</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s wider than my last, (think small clutch purse sized) but it&#x27;s great for making sure each brush has it&#x27;s own little slot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But overall, I was pleased that they were higher quality than what I expected, and think most people will find a fairly usable selection to round out their make up brush collection</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although this seems like a negative review, I am satisfied for the most part.</li>
            <li>I wanted good eye-shadow brushes, however my set only had one eye-shadow brush and a lot of flat concealer brushes.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and full.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s so many brushes , the only thing is the had this wet chemical , but after washing them with baking soda and vinegar they were fine.</li>
            <li>I really like these brushes.</li>
            <li>These brushes are very  lightweight and affordable.</li>
            <li>Came when expected and have been highly pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>Washing them really helps.</li>
            <li>Though they are quite cheap and the brushes might separate from the stick, a simple (temporary fix)</li>
            <li>I expected atleast a bit better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really plastic like that</li>
            <li>highly recommend !</li>
            <li>thanks so much</li>
            <li>She really likes the case it comes in too.</li>
            <li>Better than expected!</li>
            <li>It came earlier than expected and there just so cute !</li>
            <li>So far, this roll is holding up pretty well</li>
            <li>I would really recommend these brushes to any new to make up or just looking for brushes.</li>
            <li>For the price these brushes are decent quality</li>
            <li>All of the bristles fell out, creating a huge mess when I first took the brush out of its slot.  </li>
            <li>The pouch smelled a little of sharpie but that was okay.</li>
            <li>because I didn&#x27;t want to spend $50, but I was pleasantly surprised!!</li>
            <li>Great alternative to expensive make up brushes.</li>
            <li>Great brushes, Smell pretty weird when you frist open them up.</li>
            <li>i experienced no shedding nor broken brushes i paid so little for so much for even better quality then expected</li>
            <li>Brushes are very VERY soft.</li>
            <li>the bristles are so soft and are like high quality brushes for the price</li>
            <li>very soft, hold makeup well.</li>
            <li>are very soft.</li>
            <li>Came way early!</li>
            <li>brushes that I wouldn&#x27;t use for my daily make up routine lend themselves well to special effect make up because they&#x27;re either very stiff (good for hard line work) or very, very soft (good for applying a dirt/grime layer or a subtle overtone color).  </li>
            <li>I will not be returning the brushes, as that particular brush isn&#x27;t of much use to me, but beware of possible defective brushes.</li>
            <li>I noticed every single brush expelled a fine, powdery substance when I initially ran them through my fingers</li>
            <li>Which I was surprised.</li>
            <li>They are soft and hold together quite well</li>
            <li>They are soft and neat.</li>
            <li>So soft and for those of you who want to know mine brushes were labeled with what type of brush it is.</li>
            <li>wow</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft and packed.</li>
            <li>Supper soft</li>
            <li>the brushes are so soft</li>
            <li>These brushes are literally so soft.</li>
            <li>But overall for the money it is a decent brush set.</li>
            <li>a high quality set especially for the price.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very soft and high quality for such a low price.</li>
            <li>There were a few that shed entirely too much the first time I ran them through my fingers, and those were immediately tossed in the bin.  </li>
            <li>They are soft and work well, but I don&#x27;t understand why I got completely different ones</li>
            <li>Like I said, I didn&#x27;t buy this for the brushes and had no expectations other than they&#x27;d be cheap and not worth using.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen some reviews on these brushes falling apart the first few days</li>
            <li>Other than that i highly recommend these makeup brushes for the price</li>
            <li>Very soft and longer then I expected.</li>
            <li>Just as I expected it would be.love them sooooo soft !</li>

            <li> I love the amount of brushes you get.</li>

            <li> Just  make sure you wash them.</li>
            <li> Krazy glue or (more longer solution )</li>
            <li> all my make up brushes that I already have with room to spare, and my existing brush roll has seen much better days.  </li>
            <li> There are more brushes in here than I know what to do with.</li>
            <li> As many have said before, there was a pungent smell upon opening it.</li>
            <li> more than I know to do with.</li>
            <li> If you guys are looking for great brushes try sigma or real techniques.</li>
            <li> And I love them.</li>
            <li> All 24 but no labels which is ok</li>
            <li> Love them I have ever size I need to do my makeup the way I want</li>
            <li> I Love the makeup brushes&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good quality, minimum shedding &amp; a great set overall.</li>
            <li> alot cant wait to use them :)</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s amazing and cheap..</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> for give away, smell a bit funny, you get what you paid for and its awsome!!!</li>
            <li> I just got these today and so far so good!</li>
            <li> I love,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with my new brushes</li>
            <li> I love my brushes so much, they have an extremely good quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good product, but my concealer brush broke easily the first two days and another brush broke after a week.</li>
            <li> Other than that perfect</li>
            <li> I was worried that the hair would fall off easily but after cleaning them none came off.</li>
            <li> I honestly bought if for the big fan brush, but the rest of the brushes are good.</li>
            <li> Bag had strong odor but was tolerable.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m strongly debating ordering another one now</li>
            <li> There was a strong plastic kinda leathery smell .</li>
            <li> I also got 30 brushes, which is fine by me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> They came perfectly fine, just like the picture.</li>
            <li> Cheap falls apart too easily</li>
            <li> I bought these back in September and they are still as perfect as when i first bought them.</li>
            <li> They came labeled which is a super plus!</li>
            <li> It got here so quick !</li>
            <li> At the beginning I thought it was a little bit risky because of the price, but when they arrived I felt sooooo happy!</li>
            <li> Absolutely fabulous a definite must buy, great value for the price.</li>
            <li> I think it has been made with cheap material.</li>
            <li> They are packed well and a great buy for how low in cost they were.</li>
            <li> But on the bright side the shipment came early.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these brushes, because they&#x27;re cheap.</li>
            <li> Been looking for a good natural brush set..</li>
            <li> So far so good .</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re look to buy some professional brushes, these are the ones to get!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am so excited to start applying my makeup.</li>
            <li> Those are my first brush set and so far I&#x27;m super happy.</li>
            <li> But I did clean them and non of the hairs came out.</li>
            <li> I clean them every week with baby shampoo to keep them nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes very sturdy and does the work plus affordable</li>
            <li> My brushes came within a week, they are really nice soft quality brushes.</li>
            <li> such good quality for such a good price</li>
            <li> I payed for these brushes with my own money for any people who are looking for an unbiased review, and they are soooooo soft and they came wayyyyyy before the time that they were supposed to be here</li>
            <li> It comes in a easy to store pouch and they all have their own individual socket.</li>
            <li> Those could all be replaced with 1 really good tapered blending brush or a flat kabuki.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly .one</li>
            <li> brush fell apart quickly .</li>
            <li> Which is so much better, especially for me trying to learn more make-up techniques and style.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold product super well, didn&#x27;t come with an angled eyeliner brush.</li>
            <li> These brushes came so quick that git a A in my book...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend :)</li>
            <li> Very light and soft</li>
            <li> but theirs nothing to second guess about at all its a amazing product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold make-up well, but very much worth the price.</li>
            <li> And came on time worth the money.</li>
            <li> Love it, so pretty and feels very professional</li>
            <li> Nothing baby wash can&#x27;t do it cane right off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to come right out and say it: I am a brush snob.  </li>
            <li> Surprisingly, some are very decent quality and worth keeping in the roll as back up brushes for when my main ones are drying from a cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> that well, eyeshadow brushes are very good quality, no repeats came a day later than expected, and as for the smell it is NOT the brushes</li>
            <li> As far as the brushes I&#x27;m no makeup artist but the brushes are pretty good and especially for that price .</li>
            <li> thank you very much for my make up brushes 😍😍</li>
            <li> - I strongly recommend always using a brush cleaner (even on brand new brushes) and cleaning your brushes before using them on your face.rush expelled a fine, powdery substance when I initially ran them through my fingers - I strongly recommend always using a brush cleaner (even on brand new brushes) and cleaning your brushes before using them on your face.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am pleased with the quality of the brushes.  </li>
            <li> However, the &amp;#34;angled eye shadow brush&amp;#34; fell apart before first use.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed ordered a set for my daughter too.</li>
            <li> THIS IS HER FIRST SET OF BRUSHES THAT SHE HAS</li>
            <li> The brushes are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Very affordable!</li>
            <li> hot glue gun can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> Or if you are treś satisfied, simply replace them about every 8-12 months.</li>
            <li> I pack my entire brush roll with me when I travel, and it needs to be able to protect my brushes and take a bit of abuse.  </li>
            <li> (Don&#x27;t remember exactly what brand)</li>
            <li> and pretty i like them</li>
            <li> one of my brushes is a bit crooked at the top.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m really pleased</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s wider than my last, (think small clutch purse sized) but it&#x27;s great for making sure each brush has it&#x27;s own little slot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But overall, I was pleased that they were higher quality than what I expected, and think most people will find a fairly usable selection to round out their make up brush collection</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although this seems like a negative review, I am satisfied for the most part.</li>
            <li> I wanted good eye-shadow brushes, however my set only had one eye-shadow brush and a lot of flat concealer brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and full.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s so many brushes , the only thing is the had this wet chemical , but after washing them with baking soda and vinegar they were fine.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very  lightweight and affordable.</li>
            <li> Came when expected and have been highly pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Washing them really helps.</li>
            <li> Though they are quite cheap and the brushes might separate from the stick, a simple (temporary fix)</li>
            <li> I expected atleast a bit better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really plastic like that</li>
            <li> highly recommend !</li>
            <li> thanks so much</li>
            <li> She really likes the case it comes in too.</li>
            <li> Better than expected!</li>
            <li> It came earlier than expected and there just so cute !</li>
            <li> So far, this roll is holding up pretty well</li>
            <li> I would really recommend these brushes to any new to make up or just looking for brushes.</li>
            <li> For the price these brushes are decent quality</li>
            <li> All of the bristles fell out, creating a huge mess when I first took the brush out of its slot.  </li>
            <li> The pouch smelled a little of sharpie but that was okay.</li>
            <li> because I didn&#x27;t want to spend $50, but I was pleasantly surprised!!</li>
            <li> Great alternative to expensive make up brushes.</li>
            <li> Great brushes, Smell pretty weird when you frist open them up.</li>
            <li> i experienced no shedding nor broken brushes i paid so little for so much for even better quality then expected</li>
            <li> Brushes are very VERY soft.</li>
            <li> the bristles are so soft and are like high quality brushes for the price</li>
            <li> very soft, hold makeup well.</li>
            <li> are very soft.</li>
            <li> Came way early!</li>
            <li> brushes that I wouldn&#x27;t use for my daily make up routine lend themselves well to special effect make up because they&#x27;re either very stiff (good for hard line work) or very, very soft (good for applying a dirt/grime layer or a subtle overtone color).  </li>
            <li> I will not be returning the brushes, as that particular brush isn&#x27;t of much use to me, but beware of possible defective brushes.</li>
            <li> I noticed every single brush expelled a fine, powdery substance when I initially ran them through my fingers</li>
            <li> Which I was surprised.</li>
            <li> They are soft and hold together quite well</li>
            <li> They are soft and neat.</li>
            <li> So soft and for those of you who want to know mine brushes were labeled with what type of brush it is.</li>
            <li> wow</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft and packed.</li>
            <li> Supper soft</li>
            <li> the brushes are so soft</li>
            <li> These brushes are literally so soft.</li>
            <li> But overall for the money it is a decent brush set.</li>
            <li> a high quality set especially for the price.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very soft and high quality for such a low price.</li>
            <li> There were a few that shed entirely too much the first time I ran them through my fingers, and those were immediately tossed in the bin.  </li>
            <li> They are soft and work well, but I don&#x27;t understand why I got completely different ones</li>
            <li> Like I said, I didn&#x27;t buy this for the brushes and had no expectations other than they&#x27;d be cheap and not worth using.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen some reviews on these brushes falling apart the first few days</li>
            <li> Other than that i highly recommend these makeup brushes for the price</li>
            <li> Very soft and longer then I expected.</li>
            <li> Just as I expected it would be.love them sooooo soft !</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s about 3/4 pointless flat eye shadow brushes, exact same design just in different sizes.</li>
            <li> The only small downside is the case they come in smells a little weird but the brushes themselves are great especially for the price.</li>
            <li> The only brush i had a minor shedding problem with</li>
            <li> , they came professionally packaged in the black leather bag</li>
            <li> You get so much for such a small price!</li>
            <li> Some of the pockets in the case are big enough so that you can stuff 2 brushes in 1, in case you have other brushes you want to put in the case as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the long handles and the brushes</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the same brushes pictured, mine have black handles and seem to be slightly different.</li>
            <li> But the big fan brush isn’t stiff enough for me to use for contouring</li>
            <li> so I have a back up as it&#x27;s REALLY hard to find a roll big enough to hold ALL my brushes.  </li>
            <li> i just wish some of the bristles werent as long because it made the product i was putting on harder to put on</li>
            <li> I like the blush brushes and the large fan brush which applies makeup nicely, but the other brushes has terrible application.</li>
            <li> Only use I see for them would be to lay down the shadow,</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> They arrived way sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> It had very little shedding compared to what I was expecting, maybe 5-6 hairs fell out total and it hasn’t shed since.</li>
            <li> I had NO smell like what other reviews stated.</li>
            <li> Other then that it</li>
            <li> no shedding, no funny smell.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t need any other brush sets after this this one has everything you should need.</li>
            <li> Every few weeks i wash them and only a few bristles have come out.</li>
            <li> Yes there may be a few loose bristles here</li>
            <li> I also accidentally dropped the big brushes on hard tile and it didn’t break/crack.</li>
            <li> Super cheap but bad quality :(</li>
            <li> They would not hold the color well and felt harsh on my eyes.  </li>
            <li> The hairs of the brushes look really fake, they are soft but also fragil.</li>
            <li> The set is missing a blending brush.</li>
            <li> And the smell goes away after a few days anyway .</li>
            <li> Lost a few strands of hair on them but not many.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied at all.</li>
            <li> was the small fan like 4 strands came out</li>
            <li> These brushes have been my life for the past 5 months.</li>
            <li> the were to hard</li>
            <li> They’re all stamped with &amp;#34;Make Up for You&amp;#34; unfortunately (would&#x27;ve rather it be unlabeled) but on the other side they&#x27;re labeled with what it is used for.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I like this brush roll a lot -</li>
            <li> The bag smelt a little weird, but it&#x27;s leather</li>
            <li> hardly any hairs fell out!</li>
            <li> After a few days the smell wasn&#x27;t so bad</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> They also had this weird leathery smell to them</li>
            <li> Three of the brushes broke, and all of the brushes were dirty and had hairs falling out.</li>
            <li> But its not to bad.</li>
            <li> Quality isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> Really bad quality.</li>
            <li> and it smell bad</li>
            <li> Also I am disappointed with the lack of eye-shadow brushes, which defeated the purpose of me buying this set.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving these brushes!!! Those are my first brush set and so far I&#x27;m super happy. They came labeled which is a super plus!</li>
            <li> Amazing products. The brushes were soft and a wide variety to choose from. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Perfect happy with them</li>
            <li> Very happy with product. Speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> all in line with expectations. I recommend</li>
            <li> Overall, I am pleased with the quality of the brushes.  However, the &amp;#34;angled eye shadow brush&amp;#34; fell apart before first use.  All of the bristles fell out, creating a huge mess when I first took the brush out of its slot.  I will not be returning the brushes, as that particular brush isn&#x27;t of much use to me, but beware of possible defective brushes.</li>
            <li> I just received my brushes and I&#x27;m quite impressed with how soft they are and how many are packaged. My shipment came in time as promised. There&#x27;s just one thing, it comes with a chemical smell that almost gives me a headache! Nothing baby wash can&#x27;t do it cane right off.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and super fast shipping</li>
            <li> LOVE THEM!!! You get so much for such a small price! Will be buying again (&#x3D;</li>
            <li> I bought this set b/c I wanted good eye-shadow brushes, however my set only had one eye-shadow brush and a lot of flat concealer brushes. I like the blush brushes and the large fan brush which applies makeup nicely, but the other brushes has terrible application. For the price these brushes are decent quality but I will never repurchase. Also I am disappointed with the lack of eye-shadow brushes, which defeated the purpose of me buying this set.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed ordered a set for my daughter too.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly .one brush fell apart quickly . Over great for beginners. Quality is what you paid for</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it, but based on the reviews they said it was not labeled. But when the product arrived each brush has its label. Which is so much better, especially for me trying to learn more make-up techniques and style. i will write another review once I started to use it.</li>
            <li> i do not regret buying these... the brush does not fall off and i just love it... i have had it for over 4 months</li>
            <li> Better than expected!</li>
            <li> Great bushes for the price. I thought it would be cheaply made but the quality is awesome!! Love it</li>
            <li> Cheap!! Went you used the hair start to feeling of I don&#x27;t liked</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold product super well, didn&#x27;t come with an angled eyeliner brush. But overall for the money it is a decent brush set.</li>
            <li> the quality is phenomenal, it compares to my expensive brushes, not to mention how cheep they were.</li>
            <li> great brushes  mine haven&#x27;t shed at all and they aren&#x27;t labeled but I don&#x27;t mind!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet. But I did clean them and non of the hairs came out. Which I was surprised. They are well made!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. Great alternative to expensive make up brushes. They are soft and hold together quite well</li>
            <li> It had a wired smell I couldn&#x27;t stand. I think it has been made with cheap material. Not satisfied at all. I returned it.</li>
            <li> I love,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with my new brushes</li>
            <li> I love it ! It came earlier than expected and there just so cute !</li>
            <li> I GOT THESE FOR MY WIFE AND SHE LOVES THEM THIS IS HER FIRST SET OF BRUSHES THAT SHE HAS AND SHE USES THEM ALL THE TIME AND COUDLNT BE HAPPIER WITH THEM AND THE CASE THE COME IN AS WELL IS GOOD TEXTURE</li>
            <li> The top of the contour brush fell off already i dont even use it that often i dont know how to contour  thought itd be a better material</li>
            <li> Another gift for sister she was so delighted!  Any possible brush you could need, all with it&#x27;s own container, and a great price!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the same brushes pictured, mine have black handles and seem to be slightly different. I also got 30 brushes, which is fine by me. They are soft and work well, but I don&#x27;t understand why I got completely different ones lol. There are also a lot of eyeshadow brushes but no stippling brush or foundation brush, which bothers me. Anyways it seems to be good for the price.</li>
            <li> Great brushes, Smell pretty weird when you frist open them up. They are packed well and a great buy for how low in cost they were. Lost a few strands of hair on them but not many. Great buy.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this!! The pics don&#x27;t do the product justice!! I had NO smell like what other reviews stated. However, many say the brushes are labeled, they ARE NOT! Brushes are very VERY soft. Doesn&#x27;t hold make-up well, but very much worth the price.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fabulous a definite must buy, great value for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a make up artist and these brush are great. I love the amount of brushes you get. They do shed a bit. But its not to bad. Quality isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> Terrible quality!  They look beautiful but you can&#x27;t beat buying sable brushes.  They would not hold the color well and felt harsh on my eyes.  Spend a bit more for quality brushes.</li>
            <li> This brush set is amazing I was second guessing it but theirs nothing to second guess about at all its a amazing product.</li>
            <li> I love it!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;ordered 3 for give away, smell a bit funny, you get what you paid for and its awsome!!!</li>
            <li> PERFECT FOR THE PRICE</li>
            <li> Nice product and good price!</li>
            <li> greate price, awesome product</li>
            <li> Came way early! I checked each brush non came defective no writing on them. Love it !!!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing :) Yes there may be a few loose bristles here and there but that&#x27;s to be expected. They&#x27;re very soft and high quality for such a low price. The bag for them is also very nice and an amazing space saver!!! I highly recommend :)</li>
            <li> All the hairs come out I dont like them</li>
            <li> I gave this product a five because this is a beginner brush set of 24. These brushes are very  lightweight and affordable. I am going to a review on them or you can check out my youtube page for the review (CherishUncut).</li>
            <li> Love these brushes very sturdy and does the work plus affordable</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft and perfect. very good for the price i paid...awesome</li>
            <li> The brushes were nice i just wish some of the bristles werent as long because it made the product i was putting on harder to put on</li>
            <li> Perfect! They came way before the estimated date.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend and she said one of the brushes came off, this is like third day of use.</li>
            <li> Wonderful brushes but one was damaged when I got them. Other than that perfect</li>
            <li> These brushes came so quick that git a A in my book...the bristles are so soft and are like high quality brushes for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY. Brushes are terrible quality.</li>
            <li> Came when expected and have been highly pleased with the product. I took some out to use for myself but the majority of them went into my face painting kit. Great variety of brushes for the money. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> the quality is iffy. It&#x27;s fine. I would rather spend the money to get more</li>
            <li> They arrived way sooner than expected. I love them. Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love it! They came perfectly fine, just like the picture. I havent use them yet, but i will. The hairs of the brushes look really fake, they are soft but also fragil. I am scare of using them and the hairs will start to fall. Good product. The brushes are label. Super cheap but bad quality :(</li>
            <li> All is ok! My wife is happy!!</li>
            <li> very good quality brushes, all my bruahes csme intact, the face brushes are alittle soft and dont hold on to product that well, eyeshadow brushes are very good quality, no repeats came a day later than expected, and as for the smell it is NOT the brushes it is the leather like material of the case, all in all a great buy for the price</li>
            <li> I love, love, love these!! They are the perfect set! The set is missing a blending brush. Other then that it a high quality set especially for the price. I would definitely buy these again.</li>
            <li> the brushes are nice but it took 4 weeks to get to my house. Other than that i highly recommend these makeup brushes for the price</li>
            <li> great for cost.  Did a wedding and felt like pro quality brushes.</li>
            <li> They came on time , I love them</li>
            <li> I honestly bought if for the big fan brush, but the rest of the brushes are good. Some of them are similar, so you may have to purchase another brush set to compliment what&#x27;s lacking with this one</li>
            <li> good quality. Love the case</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. The only small downside is the case they come in smells a little weird but the brushes themselves are great especially for the price.</li>
            <li> At the beginning I thought it was a little bit risky because of the price, but when they arrived I felt sooooo happy! I LOOOVE THEM! SUPER GREAT DEAL!</li>
            <li> Cheap falls apart too easily</li>
            <li> They are amazingly great!!</li>
            <li> Three of the brushes broke, and all of the brushes were dirty and had hairs falling out. But on the bright side the shipment came early. The bag smelt a little weird, but it&#x27;s leather so I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to smell like flowers. I would recommend these brushes, because they&#x27;re cheap. Just  make sure you wash them.</li>
            <li> My brushes came within a week, they are really nice soft quality brushes. I&#x27;ve seen some reviews on these brushes falling apart the first few days but I haven&#x27;t had a problem with them, they came professionally packaged in the black leather bag and they all had plastic on them. I would really recommend these brushes to any new to make up or just looking for brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes are exactly what I was looking for. The case comes with an odor, but the brushes do not. Washing them really helps. I have yet to use all the variant pieces, but I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Awesome set of brushes. I bought three of them cause you just can&#x27;t beat the price. Very affordable! They are good quality too. I&#x27;d definitely recommend them to those who are looking for affordable brush sets.</li>
            <li> very good, nothing to complain. Very good quality.</li>
            <li> So obviously your getting what you paid for. Though they are quite cheap and the brushes might separate from the stick, a simple (temporary fix) Krazy glue or (more longer solution ) hot glue gun can&#x27;t fix. They are soft and neat. I recommend these brushes for anyone that want a &amp;#34;just for now&amp;#34; set or to learn/play around with makeup. Or if you are treś satisfied, simply replace them about every 8-12 months.</li>
            <li> very soft, hold makeup well. no shedding, no funny smell.  All around GREAT brushes for a great price.</li>
            <li> Very soft and longer then I expected. Bag had strong odor but was tolerable. Brushes are perfect!</li>
            <li> Great brushes! So soft and for those of you who want to know mine brushes were labeled with what type of brush it is.</li>
            <li> Really bad quality. I expected atleast a bit better. It&#x27;s really plastic like that It couldn&#x27;t even hold the eyeshadow on.</li>
            <li> I love my brushes !!!!! Omg there amazing plus they came in a day ealry wow I&#x27;m impressed 😊😊 thank you very much for my make up brushes 😍😍</li>
            <li> Perfect ! Just as I expected it would be.love them sooooo soft !</li>
            <li> Good product, but my concealer brush broke easily the first two days and another brush broke after a week.</li>
            <li> So many brushes! loves these , they are soft picks up product great ! highly recommend !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie and say I ordered this brush roll for the brushes because I did not.  I ordered it because it looked big enough to hold all my make up brushes that I already have with room to spare, and my existing brush roll has seen much better days.  I pack my entire brush roll with me when I travel, and it needs to be able to protect my brushes and take a bit of abuse.  So far, this roll is holding up pretty well - it&#x27;s not going to last forever, but I&#x27;m expecting it to last me several years and I&#x27;m strongly debating ordering another one now so I have a back up as it&#x27;s REALLY hard to find a roll big enough to hold ALL my brushes.  (I have an obscene amount of brushes, it&#x27;s unnatural.)  Seriously, I like this brush roll a lot - it&#x27;s wider than my last, (think small clutch purse sized) but it&#x27;s great for making sure each brush has it&#x27;s own little slot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now onto the brushes!  Like I said, I didn&#x27;t buy this for the brushes and had no expectations other than they&#x27;d be cheap and not worth using.  I&#x27;m going to come right out and say it: I am a brush snob.  It&#x27;s not about the brand name or the cost of the brushes, but how they perform in picking up and laying on product and pigment.  Surprisingly, some are very decent quality and worth keeping in the roll as back up brushes for when my main ones are drying from a cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;Some brushes that I wouldn&#x27;t use for my daily make up routine lend themselves well to special effect make up because they&#x27;re either very stiff (good for hard line work) or very, very soft (good for applying a dirt/grime layer or a subtle overtone color).  There were a few that shed entirely too much the first time I ran them through my fingers, and those were immediately tossed in the bin.  But overall, I was pleased that they were higher quality than what I expected, and think most people will find a fairly usable selection to round out their make up brush collection with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONE word of caution - I noticed every single brush expelled a fine, powdery substance when I initially ran them through my fingers - I strongly recommend always using a brush cleaner (even on brand new brushes) and cleaning your brushes before using them on your face.rush expelled a fine, powdery substance when I initially ran them through my fingers - I strongly recommend always using a brush cleaner (even on brand new brushes) and cleaning your brushes before using them on your face.</li>
            <li> There are more brushes in here than I know what to do with. As many have said before, there was a pungent smell upon opening it. I laid out the bag and sprayed it with perfume. After a few days the smell wasn&#x27;t so bad but it didn’t go away. I also washed the brushes before using them. It had very little shedding compared to what I was expecting, maybe 5-6 hairs fell out total and it hasn’t shed since. I also accidentally dropped the big brushes on hard tile and it didn’t break/crack. They seem sturdy enough. They’re all stamped with &amp;#34;Make Up for You&amp;#34; unfortunately (would&#x27;ve rather it be unlabeled) but on the other side they&#x27;re labeled with what it is used for. The bigger brushes came with a cover to help keep its shape, but all were individually wrapped. Some of the pockets in the case are big enough so that you can stuff 2 brushes in 1, in case you have other brushes you want to put in the case as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The face brushes are pretty great. They&#x27;re soft and packed. But the big fan brush isn’t stiff enough for me to use for contouring so now I don’t know what else to do with it. The smaller fan brush I use to dust on a highlighter. All of the &amp;#34;fluffier&amp;#34; eye brushes feel scratchy and they’re too big for me to have any control over what I am doing. I wish it would&#x27;ve been tapered too. There&#x27;s about 3/4 pointless flat eye shadow brushes, exact same design just in different sizes. Only use I see for them would be to lay down the shadow, b/c I can&#x27;t blend w/ it. Overall, there are probably about 10 brushes that I don&#x27;t need. Those could all be replaced with 1 really good tapered blending brush or a flat kabuki.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this seems like a negative review, I am satisfied for the most part. It is a good beginner&#x27;s set. They get the job done and there are plenty of brushes to work with. And you can&#x27;t beat that price!</li>
            <li> i didn like it the were to hard and it smell bad</li>
            <li> Love the brushes work good ...</li>
            <li> I ordered this set to familirarize myself with all the brushes. I must say though, they have a lot of brushes... more than I know to do with. It comes in a easy to store pouch and they all have their own individual socket. When I opened it the brushes were in plastic but might aswell they didn&#x27;t because all the brushes had dust on them so WASH THEM BEFORE YOU USE THEM!! They also had this weird leathery smell to them but I guess its just the pouch. They also aren&#x27;t very strong as I was hoping but you get what you pay for. If you guys are looking for great brushes try sigma or real techniques.</li>
            <li> great price, great brushes!</li>
            <li> I received my brushes in three days. It got here so quick ! And I love them. Good buy !</li>
            <li> Been looking for a good natural brush set..these are perfect</li>
            <li> So far so good . It took about a week to come . There was a strong plastic kinda leathery smell . But don&#x27;t worry it&#x27;s coming from the case not the brushes. And the smell goes away after a few days anyway . As far as the brushes I&#x27;m no makeup artist but the brushes are pretty good and especially for that price . Thumbs up</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a set like these before. (Don&#x27;t remember exactly what brand) and I loved them! I just got these today and so far so good! Washed them with baby Aveeno hardly any hairs fell out! The only thing is the case looks cheaper then my last one and smells like sharpie. But I don&#x27;t mind. Great brushes! All 24 but no labels which is ok</li>
            <li> Some of the brushes came apart, but was still a great set.</li>
            <li> Great quality for the price. Would recommend</li>
            <li> Love them ! There&#x27;s so many brushes , the only thing is the had this wet chemical , but after washing them with baking soda and vinegar they were fine.</li>
            <li> So many brushes at a great price.  I like the long handles and the brushes are very soft.</li>
            <li> Very Awesome Make-up Brushes!! Easier to Do Your Make-Up!!</li>

            <li> Supper soft I had even bot another product just incase this didn&#x27;t feet my needs but it&#x27;s amazing and cheap..</li>
            <li> absolutely LOVE these brushes!! such good quality for such a good price</li>
            <li> i love these brushes!! They are great for the price! (One or two brushes are losing some of its hairs already but they are brushes that I won&#x27;t even need to use.) the foundation brush is my favorite! Great set!</li>
            <li> The only brush i had a minor shedding problem with was the small fan like 4 strands came out i experienced no shedding nor broken brushes i paid so little for so much for even better quality then expected</li>
            <li> These brushes are great, I like them a lot</li>
            <li> I like these brushes for the price! Very light and soft</li>
            <li> Theses brushes are amazing. I payed for these brushes with my own money for any people who are looking for an unbiased review, and they are soooooo soft and they came wayyyyyy before the time that they were supposed to be here I am so excited to start applying my makeup. You won&#x27;t need any other brush sets after this this one has everything you should need.</li>
            <li> These brushes have been my life for the past 5 months. I bought them because they were cheep but they came and they were in the best quality ever. I clean them every week with baby shampoo to keep them nice and soft. I will always recommend!!</li>
            <li> I bought these back in September and they are still as perfect as when i first bought them. When they came in the mail they were nicely packaged. The pouch smelled a little of sharpie but that was okay. The brushes are soft and full. Every few weeks i wash them and only a few bristles have come out. These brushes are wonderful!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are great! I was worried that the hair would fall off easily but after cleaning them none came off. The only badside is the smell but I didn&#x27;t mind it at all &amp; one of my brushes is a bit crooked at the top. Overall I&#x27;m really pleased</li>
            <li> Love it, so pretty and feels very professional the brushes are so soft</li>
            <li> Perfect gift for my makeup fanatical sister. She really likes the case it comes in too.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It looked like the pic. And came on time worth the money. Thank you</li>
            <li> I am so happy. These brushes are literally so soft. I figured I was going to get what I paid for because I didn&#x27;t want to spend $50, but I was pleasantly surprised!! Thank you Outop!!</li>
