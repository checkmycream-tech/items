            <li> It&#x27;s not overly perfume-y, but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s stronger than other scents I&#x27;ve tried from VS.</li>
            <li> highly scented product is it&#x27;s very irritating to people with allergies and chemical sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Waste of money for me.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m nostalgic -</li>
            <li> If you want your co-workers to hate you, then go ahead and wear this vile lotion.</li>

            <li> The thing is, when you use it, it&#x27;s like spreading strawberries and champagne all over your body. It&#x27;s delightful...</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because my mother used this lotion a lot while I was growing up and I&#x27;m nostalgic - But I love this scent. It&#x27;s not overly perfume-y, but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s stronger than other scents I&#x27;ve tried from VS. It&#x27;s a very sweet, romantic scent that lingers. I love putting it on right after I take a shower and letting the scent absorb into my skin and clothing.     It also moisturizes very well; My skin is always super soft after I put this on. Definitely a favorite lotion of mine.</li>
            <li> excelente. todo llego en mis manos en buenas condiciones, perfecto estado. recomiendo a todos comprar en amazon, un lugar seguro y facil de adquirir articulos.</li>
            <li> ...because I didn&#x27;t purchase it for me, but the one I bought it for does like it so it will get 5 stars, and it came in time for Christmas. so thanks a bunch.</li>
            <li> Looks a bit different than an original. Additional items I did buy them from the VS website directly. Arrived on time as expected.</li>
            <li> Excellent no problems</li>
            <li> When I ordered this product I had no idea of it&#x27;s smell? When it arrived and drizzled the contents,on my hands. All I can say is wow!! Not bad for $5.00..I will buy more in the future from Amazon..</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my wife and she was so pleased with it, she loves the smell and smoothness of the lotion, Thanks!</li>

            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a real strawberry scent, forget this product.  It smells flowery.  Waste of money for me.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> This lotion is better than I thought. The scent is light and very moisturizing. The shape of the bottle is cute.</li>
            <li> My co-worker insist on using this body lotion as hand lotion. She applies it liberally throughout the day. Every time she applies it I have to go outside until the strong scent dissipates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This highly scented product is it&#x27;s very irritating to people with allergies and chemical sensitivity. If you want your co-workers to hate you, then go ahead and wear this vile lotion.</li>
            <li> El aroma es super rico</li>
            <li> Excellent product and excellent supplier, original smells very cheap .... maybe not worth the cost but excellent quality.</li>
            <li> so I was reading reviews and everyone said it was great ,no way its not its smells like cinnamon and strawberry its too strong nothing romantic that you would like to smell never buying it again good luck</li>
            <li> I bought this in combination with the body mist for my girlfriend at the time.  She uses the strawberries and champagne version religiously and had ran out so I bought her two bottles to stock up on.  She absolutely loved it as she couldn&#x27;t locate any locally and having it delivered to her door was perfect.</li>
            <li> Es un Producto de calidad, he usados esta marca por varios a√±os, he comprado productos similares,el envio a sido puntual, Excelente Experiencias</li>
