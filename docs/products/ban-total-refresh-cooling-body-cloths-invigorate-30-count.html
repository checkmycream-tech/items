            <li>Perfect.</li>
            <li>Perfect.</li>
            <li>packet is resealable, but it&#x27;s recommended that the 10 cloths per packet be used within 45 days after opening for best results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is pleasant -- not like Axe Body Spray, thank heaven!  </li>
            <li>Great option for a girl on the go.</li>
            <li>great product and</li>
            <li>so he was happy to try these cloths.</li>
            <li>I tend to be a nighttime showerer and these are great for freshening up during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They have a good amount of moisture to them.  </li>
            <li>I think an unscented version would have been brilliant and most welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent is good</li>
            <li>PERFECT for women who have hot flashes.</li>
            <li>I love the idea of this product -- in effect, portable washcloths!</li>
            <li>If you have any warm weather activities where you get hot and sweaty and have no shower access immediately afterward, these cloths are perfect!</li>
            <li>This product is, of course, a brand extension from Ban, popular deodorant, a brand once owned by Bristol-Myers, well-known maker of toiletries and household goods, but  no longer.</li>
            <li>I like to keep these handy wipes in my to go bag at all times - once or twice when I arrived</li>
            <li>They do contain alcohol, but leave a light, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>The smell actually is light and pleasant, as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Remarkably the odor lasted for hours and my skin did feel cool.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like to use antiperspirants, I prefer a good shower in the morning and a quick one before bed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product for gym use or for tucking in the glove compartment of your car for quick touch ups on the road.</li>
            <li>It is safe to use all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if the scent was because the cloths were &amp;#34;cleaning&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The makers say this product is safe for use on the face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I think there are much better options out there for a skin wipe refresher.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting something more the size of a wet-nap.  </li>
            <li>but for big job,s, these are the best.  </li>
            <li>that, although Ban says it&#x27;s safe</li>
            <li>(where I sweat the most).</li>
            <li>We use the Heart Throb Heated Massagers that Tammy purchased from her niece, Theresa; Theresa is a highly successful sales consultant for Pure Romance.  </li>
            <li>It cleaned my skin and left a very pleasant odor.</li>
            <li>They come in a handy little pouch that fits inside my purse perfectly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a nice light clean scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li>The scent of alcohol is really strong and I felt like I smelled of it for some time.</li>
            <li>There was a strong smell that I did not like.</li>
            <li>Strong scents give me a headache.</li>
            <li>These wipes come in handy on trips to the bathroom or on a hot day.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how wonderful they feel when in the middle of a hot flash.</li>
            <li>Or if you just want a light wipe-down after the gym.  </li>
            <li>Great and simple to use.</li>
            <li>I did search the manufacturer&#x27;s website ... and, while I did not find that precise usage suggested, it does seem to be the case.</li>
            <li>(I usually use the face wipes I buy anyhow for things like this cloth does to get a clean feeling on the go, and those work just as well to me), but they do work great, and the cooling effect is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try these wipes.</li>
            <li>They come in handy, and I suspect they will be a new addition to my vanity.</li>
            <li>After workouts or on days I can&#x27;t shower, I often use baby wipes to clean up.</li>
            <li>originally got it because I thought that it would be a good solution for after working out - for instance, after a spin class when I&#x27;m in a hurry, before I get in my car, or to cool off after riding my bike to work or taking a short run during lunch.</li>
            <li>Great product to not only take of the grime of a hot day</li>
            <li>These sounded like an adult version of those with the promise of cooling and a nice scent.</li>
            <li>I used one after a workout, and it was good for the upper body.  </li>
            <li>You have a quick way to cool off and wipe away any smelly odors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They could be useful if you exercise before work or over lunch and don&#x27;t get a chance to take a full shower afterward.</li>
            <li>the coldness of the cloth is funny!  </li>
            <li>They are refreshing and smell nice – a little powdery.</li>
            <li>Inside is a re-sealable pouch that will help keep the cloths moist and fresh for up to forty-five days (according to the package).  </li>
            <li>They do a good job of cleaning, but I personally can&#x27;t see much use for them.  </li>
            <li>if you would like a quick and convenient cooldown after a hot workout (or sultry summer day), you might want to try these Ban Cloths.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, the cloths are nice for the occasional hot flash.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re slightly moist and leave a pleasant cooling feeling and scent after use that lasts hours.&lt;br</li>
            <li>:  They do leave a light pleasant clean scent behind.  </li>
            <li>they were somewhat dry, so I just added water and let them rehydrate - good as new!</li>
            <li>Tammy and I both have very stressful lives; massages help Tammy and I to relax and quickly fall asleep.  </li>
            <li>and I have to say, it does cool me off quickly and stop my sweating nearly instantaneously - which I consider a miracle.</li>
            <li>These wipes are handy to keep around for a quick wipe down of hands and arms.</li>
            <li>But as soon as I opened the package, I realized one of the major limitations of the product - the refreshing, cooling sensation is by and large</li>
            <li>have been trying these for a couple of days now, and while they are fine as far as they go, I have some problems with this product.  </li>
            <li>This cooling cloth did exactly what its people said it would do.</li>
            <li>They come in a packet that I cut open at the top.  </li>
            <li>More than your standard face/body/baby</li>
            <li>But really, I don&#x27;t find these to be all that useful.  </li>
            <li>The first two ingredients are, as you might expect, water and alcohol.  </li>
            <li>These cloths will now be a staple in our &amp;#34;sailing bag&amp;#34; so we can freshen up after a hot, sweaty day on the boat.</li>
            <li>While these would be good to freshen up anytime, I find them especially useful for cooling off and refreshing after an annoying hot flash.</li>
            <li>These are great to have on-hand if you live in a hot area or if you have exerted yourself excessively just before meeting your friends.</li>
            <li>I love these so much that I have selected 3 different scents.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These might be good for babies or small kids.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re cooling, yet dry easy, leaving you fresh..</li>
            <li>The remaining ingredients are mostly the sorts of unpronounceable, chemical sorts of things you might find in soaps or shampoos, many of which I don&#x27;t recognize - denat, lauryl methacrylate/sodium methacrylate, crosspolymer, dimethicone, dipropylene glycol, etc., along with something simply labeled as &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will enjoy using these after my morning workouts for the next several days, but I can&#x27;t see myself buying a new pack of them.  </li>
            <li>I am a homemaker, so I do a certain amount of grunt work in my day.</li>
            <li>To me, it was a pleasant cool sensation but one where I felt dry afterwards instead of slightly damp like one might think after using a wipe cloth.</li>
            <li>It is billed as a convenient way to cool down and freshen up anytime, anywhere; invigorating with a soft, clean scent; leaving skin feeling fresh, soft and silky with no sticky residue, while its patented Powder Silk Technology™ leaves skin with a translucent, superfine powder finish.  </li>
            <li>Furthermore, I would be most likely to use this product for a quick once-over, what they used to call a sponge bath back in the day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a great option for a quick clean on the go and comes in a small peel open pouch that can easily be stored in your purse or small</li>
            <li>Freshening up is really all that is needed, and I found the cloths worked well for that.</li>
            <li>That being said, I didn&#x27;t really notice any cooling.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t want to use it on my face</li>
            <li>so much I have them sent to me every month.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it has any real deodorant qualities.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty effective, if not totally refreshing.</li>
            <li>The cloths have a very gentle, fresh smell and do not dry my skin out, which is a plus.</li>
            <li>They really help cool you down quickly while wiping any perspiration that comes along with the hot flashes away.</li>
            <li>Plus, your hair is still gross from post-gym activites, so if you really want to be clean you&#x27;ll still need a shower.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My girlfriend, Tammy, and I love to give each other body massages in bed.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say they work any better than other brands of cloths</li>
            <li>I just used one of these little cooling cloths after a good sweaty workout on a LifeCycle, and I must say it left me feeling more refreshed and cool than usual, even though I use a necklace fan while I&#x27;m on the bike.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Similar to clean laundry.  </li>
            <li>I liked the way the cloths are in a protective closed bag so that they do not dry up.</li>
            <li>The cloths pull out easily and quickly only one at a time, and one cloth goes far in terms of use.</li>
            <li>There is a slight scent which lingers, not my favorite, but better than other gym odors.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Caveat: the cloths are small and  warm quickly to the touch, so you may find yourself using several at one go.</li>
            <li>Instead of taking a quick sponge bath, with the body cloths I can simply wipe off while changing shirts.</li>
            <li>The scent they leave behind was pleasant without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>These small, refreshing wipes are packed in a pouch of ten and conveniently fit in a purse or bag.</li>
            <li>Thus I await a more modestly priced generic equivalent from Harmon Discount or Dollar General or someone like that -- those cloths I might buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In this sense, the price and the size would make a little more sense.</li>
            <li>But aside from the size, these wipes reminded me a bit of the kind of wet-naps you get at your average rib or barbecue place to clean up your messy fingers.  </li>
            <li>Users are directed to gently wipe the soft, durable cloth on any part of your body.</li>
            <li>The cloth looks like your standard wet wipe, and I found that it really was cooling and refreshing.</li>
            <li>This one is &#x27;Invigorate&#x27;, but they are all pretty much the same - invigorating.  </li>
            <li>I suppose these might be useful for the elderly, but like I said, I didn&#x27;t find that a single cloth would clean my entire body.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These are too small to use when traveling (a little packet of Burt&#x27;s Bees clothes are perfect for such moments), but I can envision that these might provide relief to women experiencing hot-flashes.</li>
            <li>rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are good for cooling down when you&#x27;re sweaty, but I&#x27;m not sure they&#x27;re any better than any other wipe.  </li>
            <li>I keep them in my purse for a quick cool down when I&#x27;m out and about trying to run errands while trying not to have a heat stroke, even in mid winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first opened the Ban Total Refresh Cooling Body Cloths, I had my doubts.</li>
            <li>it arrived early!</li>
            <li>That involves some pretty sensitively-skinned bits of the human anatomy.  </li>
            <li>We often spend a day sailing and it gets hot out on the water, and then sweaty when we have to lug all our stuff back to the car.</li>
            <li>It left a slightly powdery, barely perceptible and overall pleasant sort of residue (&amp;#34;powder silk,&amp;#34; I guess) on my skin.</li>
            <li>There is the same cool feeling and the same rubbing alcohol scent, both of which evaporate</li>
            <li>He told me that he immediately felt cooler and refreshed and was able to wipe down well using only the one</li>
            <li>It certainly doesn&#x27;t last, really only as long as the wetness stays behind, but for that short bit, especially when you&#x27;re sweaty or grimy, it feels pretty dang awesome.</li>
            <li>I am not convinced that they cool you anymore than any other wipe.</li>
            <li>However, if you need a quick and more serious clean up or cool down or if you need to freshen up midday for a meeting or other important occurrence, you should seriously consider trying one of the three fragrances of this body cloth.</li>
            <li>Each body cloth is large enough to use on both of us.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, the cloths come in a little resealable pouch which can easily fit in a pocket, gym bag, purse, what have you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>have deducted one star just because these little guys aren&#x27;t cheap -- about thirty cents apiece, if I&#x27;m doing my math correctly.  </li>
            <li>The alcohol content in each cloth provides a cooling effect, while the superfine powder helps a little bit with the deodorizing.  </li>
            <li>So, I can see some limited use for these cloths, but there are other products better suited to my needs.</li>
            <li>I had no trouble getting them out of the package, as some reviewer mentioned.</li>
            <li>These are not gentle and while they say they&#x27;re ok to use on the face, they left me with a burning sensation and a red face.</li>
            <li>so they didn&#x27;t seem to go as far.</li>
            <li>After we use the heated massagers, we gently rub the Ban Total Refresh Cooling Body Cloths over each other&#x60;s faces and exposed limbs.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised with these wipes.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t really have much scent beyond an alcohol type one, but that&#x27;s only when you open the package - it doesn&#x27;t transfer to your skin with use.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s the only way to get really</li>
            <li>These have a distinct alcohol smell, which is where the alleged cooling effect comes from.  </li>
            <li>but they cool you down and leave no residue.</li>
            <li>However, once the package was open for a minute or two, that went away, and the package had very little smell which was MUCH better.</li>
            <li>My husband is the kind of person who perspires quite heavily when doing odd jobs around the house.</li>
            <li>I left the bag in my car overnight and pulled one out – even under normal conditions, they are a bit cold—but after freezing, they are even funnier.  </li>
            <li>I keep them on my nightstand next to my heated massagers and a plastic bottle of Pure Naked massage oil.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got dry skin, but these don&#x27;t irritate or worsen that - and I also find that they don&#x27;t seem to have any effect in terms of wiping off lotion that&#x27;s already soaked in really well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does give a cooling sensation, but there is a distinct smell that might be prohibitive for those with sensitives/allergies to fragrance or for those who are concerned about her perfume clashing with this odd scent.</li>
            <li>The fragrance was mild and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not use these cloths to merely wipe my hands clean as there are many less expensive cloths available for that.</li>
            <li>There is a bit too much alcohol to use on my face, as I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li>It drys out quickly, and is only half the size of a face wipe or baby wipe.  </li>
            <li>The packages are small enough to fit in your purse, or jacket pocket.  </li>
            <li>It is small enough to fit into the front pouch of my gym bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Second, there is no advisory given to users with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Because these ingredients are very likely to upset sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I was pretty surprised at how small the package was when I received this in the mail.  </li>
            <li>The cloth stayed moist for a while; I was able to get a few wipes before it dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Between the very small size (this is not a Handi-Wipe or a traditional cleansing cloth that you might get from Simple, Olay, or Burt&#x27;s Bees) and the strange sensation, it is more on the &amp;#34;refresh&amp;#34; side than the &amp;#34;cleansing&amp;#34; side (</li>
            <li>I am very much not sure how to feel about this</li>
            <li>The package is small enough to carry in even a smaller purse, and are easy to open and close back tight.</li>

            <li> /&gt;It has a nice light clean scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li> The scent of alcohol is really strong and I felt like I smelled of it for some time.</li>
            <li> There was a strong smell that I did not like.</li>
            <li> Strong scents give me a headache.</li>
            <li> These wipes come in handy on trips to the bathroom or on a hot day.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how wonderful they feel when in the middle of a hot flash.</li>
            <li> Or if you just want a light wipe-down after the gym.  </li>
            <li> Great and simple to use.</li>
            <li> I did search the manufacturer&#x27;s website ... and, while I did not find that precise usage suggested, it does seem to be the case.</li>
            <li> (I usually use the face wipes I buy anyhow for things like this cloth does to get a clean feeling on the go, and those work just as well to me), but they do work great, and the cooling effect is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try these wipes.</li>
            <li> They come in handy, and I suspect they will be a new addition to my vanity.</li>
            <li> After workouts or on days I can&#x27;t shower, I often use baby wipes to clean up.</li>
            <li> originally got it because I thought that it would be a good solution for after working out - for instance, after a spin class when I&#x27;m in a hurry, before I get in my car, or to cool off after riding my bike to work or taking a short run during lunch.</li>
            <li> Great product to not only take of the grime of a hot day</li>
            <li> These sounded like an adult version of those with the promise of cooling and a nice scent.</li>
            <li> I used one after a workout, and it was good for the upper body.  </li>
            <li> You have a quick way to cool off and wipe away any smelly odors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They could be useful if you exercise before work or over lunch and don&#x27;t get a chance to take a full shower afterward.</li>
            <li> the coldness of the cloth is funny!  </li>
            <li> They are refreshing and smell nice – a little powdery.</li>
            <li> Inside is a re-sealable pouch that will help keep the cloths moist and fresh for up to forty-five days (according to the package).  </li>
            <li> They do a good job of cleaning, but I personally can&#x27;t see much use for them.  </li>
            <li> if you would like a quick and convenient cooldown after a hot workout (or sultry summer day), you might want to try these Ban Cloths.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, the cloths are nice for the occasional hot flash.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re slightly moist and leave a pleasant cooling feeling and scent after use that lasts hours.&lt;br</li>
            <li> :  They do leave a light pleasant clean scent behind.  </li>
            <li> they were somewhat dry, so I just added water and let them rehydrate - good as new!</li>
            <li> Tammy and I both have very stressful lives; massages help Tammy and I to relax and quickly fall asleep.  </li>
            <li> and I have to say, it does cool me off quickly and stop my sweating nearly instantaneously - which I consider a miracle.</li>
            <li> These wipes are handy to keep around for a quick wipe down of hands and arms.</li>
            <li> But as soon as I opened the package, I realized one of the major limitations of the product - the refreshing, cooling sensation is by and large</li>
            <li> have been trying these for a couple of days now, and while they are fine as far as they go, I have some problems with this product.  </li>
            <li> This cooling cloth did exactly what its people said it would do.</li>
            <li> They come in a packet that I cut open at the top.  </li>
            <li> More than your standard face/body/baby</li>
            <li> But really, I don&#x27;t find these to be all that useful.  </li>
            <li> The first two ingredients are, as you might expect, water and alcohol.  </li>
            <li> These cloths will now be a staple in our &amp;#34;sailing bag&amp;#34; so we can freshen up after a hot, sweaty day on the boat.</li>
            <li> While these would be good to freshen up anytime, I find them especially useful for cooling off and refreshing after an annoying hot flash.</li>
            <li> These are great to have on-hand if you live in a hot area or if you have exerted yourself excessively just before meeting your friends.</li>
            <li> I love these so much that I have selected 3 different scents.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These might be good for babies or small kids.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cooling, yet dry easy, leaving you fresh..</li>
            <li> The remaining ingredients are mostly the sorts of unpronounceable, chemical sorts of things you might find in soaps or shampoos, many of which I don&#x27;t recognize - denat, lauryl methacrylate/sodium methacrylate, crosspolymer, dimethicone, dipropylene glycol, etc., along with something simply labeled as &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will enjoy using these after my morning workouts for the next several days, but I can&#x27;t see myself buying a new pack of them.  </li>
            <li> I am a homemaker, so I do a certain amount of grunt work in my day.</li>
            <li> To me, it was a pleasant cool sensation but one where I felt dry afterwards instead of slightly damp like one might think after using a wipe cloth.</li>
            <li> It is billed as a convenient way to cool down and freshen up anytime, anywhere; invigorating with a soft, clean scent; leaving skin feeling fresh, soft and silky with no sticky residue, while its patented Powder Silk Technology™ leaves skin with a translucent, superfine powder finish.  </li>
            <li> Furthermore, I would be most likely to use this product for a quick once-over, what they used to call a sponge bath back in the day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a great option for a quick clean on the go and comes in a small peel open pouch that can easily be stored in your purse or small</li>
            <li> Freshening up is really all that is needed, and I found the cloths worked well for that.</li>
            <li> That being said, I didn&#x27;t really notice any cooling.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t want to use it on my face</li>
            <li> so much I have them sent to me every month.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it has any real deodorant qualities.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty effective, if not totally refreshing.</li>
            <li> The cloths have a very gentle, fresh smell and do not dry my skin out, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> They really help cool you down quickly while wiping any perspiration that comes along with the hot flashes away.</li>
            <li> Plus, your hair is still gross from post-gym activites, so if you really want to be clean you&#x27;ll still need a shower.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My girlfriend, Tammy, and I love to give each other body massages in bed.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say they work any better than other brands of cloths</li>
            <li> I just used one of these little cooling cloths after a good sweaty workout on a LifeCycle, and I must say it left me feeling more refreshed and cool than usual, even though I use a necklace fan while I&#x27;m on the bike.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Similar to clean laundry.  </li>
            <li> I liked the way the cloths are in a protective closed bag so that they do not dry up.</li>
            <li> The cloths pull out easily and quickly only one at a time, and one cloth goes far in terms of use.</li>
            <li> There is a slight scent which lingers, not my favorite, but better than other gym odors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Caveat: the cloths are small and  warm quickly to the touch, so you may find yourself using several at one go.</li>
            <li> Instead of taking a quick sponge bath, with the body cloths I can simply wipe off while changing shirts.</li>
            <li> The scent they leave behind was pleasant without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> These small, refreshing wipes are packed in a pouch of ten and conveniently fit in a purse or bag.</li>
            <li> Thus I await a more modestly priced generic equivalent from Harmon Discount or Dollar General or someone like that -- those cloths I might buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In this sense, the price and the size would make a little more sense.</li>
            <li> But aside from the size, these wipes reminded me a bit of the kind of wet-naps you get at your average rib or barbecue place to clean up your messy fingers.  </li>
            <li> Users are directed to gently wipe the soft, durable cloth on any part of your body.</li>
            <li> The cloth looks like your standard wet wipe, and I found that it really was cooling and refreshing.</li>
            <li> This one is &#x27;Invigorate&#x27;, but they are all pretty much the same - invigorating.  </li>
            <li> I suppose these might be useful for the elderly, but like I said, I didn&#x27;t find that a single cloth would clean my entire body.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These are too small to use when traveling (a little packet of Burt&#x27;s Bees clothes are perfect for such moments), but I can envision that these might provide relief to women experiencing hot-flashes.</li>
            <li> rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are good for cooling down when you&#x27;re sweaty, but I&#x27;m not sure they&#x27;re any better than any other wipe.  </li>
            <li> I keep them in my purse for a quick cool down when I&#x27;m out and about trying to run errands while trying not to have a heat stroke, even in mid winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I first opened the Ban Total Refresh Cooling Body Cloths, I had my doubts.</li>
            <li> it arrived early!</li>
            <li> That involves some pretty sensitively-skinned bits of the human anatomy.  </li>
            <li> We often spend a day sailing and it gets hot out on the water, and then sweaty when we have to lug all our stuff back to the car.</li>
            <li> It left a slightly powdery, barely perceptible and overall pleasant sort of residue (&amp;#34;powder silk,&amp;#34; I guess) on my skin.</li>
            <li> There is the same cool feeling and the same rubbing alcohol scent, both of which evaporate</li>
            <li> He told me that he immediately felt cooler and refreshed and was able to wipe down well using only the one</li>
            <li> It certainly doesn&#x27;t last, really only as long as the wetness stays behind, but for that short bit, especially when you&#x27;re sweaty or grimy, it feels pretty dang awesome.</li>
            <li> I am not convinced that they cool you anymore than any other wipe.</li>
            <li> However, if you need a quick and more serious clean up or cool down or if you need to freshen up midday for a meeting or other important occurrence, you should seriously consider trying one of the three fragrances of this body cloth.</li>
            <li> Each body cloth is large enough to use on both of us.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, the cloths come in a little resealable pouch which can easily fit in a pocket, gym bag, purse, what have you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> have deducted one star just because these little guys aren&#x27;t cheap -- about thirty cents apiece, if I&#x27;m doing my math correctly.  </li>
            <li> The alcohol content in each cloth provides a cooling effect, while the superfine powder helps a little bit with the deodorizing.  </li>
            <li> So, I can see some limited use for these cloths, but there are other products better suited to my needs.</li>
            <li> I had no trouble getting them out of the package, as some reviewer mentioned.</li>
            <li> These are not gentle and while they say they&#x27;re ok to use on the face, they left me with a burning sensation and a red face.</li>
            <li> so they didn&#x27;t seem to go as far.</li>
            <li> After we use the heated massagers, we gently rub the Ban Total Refresh Cooling Body Cloths over each other&#x60;s faces and exposed limbs.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised with these wipes.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t really have much scent beyond an alcohol type one, but that&#x27;s only when you open the package - it doesn&#x27;t transfer to your skin with use.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s the only way to get really</li>
            <li> These have a distinct alcohol smell, which is where the alleged cooling effect comes from.  </li>
            <li> but they cool you down and leave no residue.</li>
            <li> However, once the package was open for a minute or two, that went away, and the package had very little smell which was MUCH better.</li>
            <li> My husband is the kind of person who perspires quite heavily when doing odd jobs around the house.</li>
            <li> I left the bag in my car overnight and pulled one out – even under normal conditions, they are a bit cold—but after freezing, they are even funnier.  </li>
            <li> I keep them on my nightstand next to my heated massagers and a plastic bottle of Pure Naked massage oil.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got dry skin, but these don&#x27;t irritate or worsen that - and I also find that they don&#x27;t seem to have any effect in terms of wiping off lotion that&#x27;s already soaked in really well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does give a cooling sensation, but there is a distinct smell that might be prohibitive for those with sensitives/allergies to fragrance or for those who are concerned about her perfume clashing with this odd scent.</li>
            <li> The fragrance was mild and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not use these cloths to merely wipe my hands clean as there are many less expensive cloths available for that.</li>
            <li> There is a bit too much alcohol to use on my face, as I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> It drys out quickly, and is only half the size of a face wipe or baby wipe.  </li>
            <li> The packages are small enough to fit in your purse, or jacket pocket.  </li>
            <li> It is small enough to fit into the front pouch of my gym bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Second, there is no advisory given to users with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Because these ingredients are very likely to upset sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was pretty surprised at how small the package was when I received this in the mail.  </li>
            <li> The cloth stayed moist for a while; I was able to get a few wipes before it dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Between the very small size (this is not a Handi-Wipe or a traditional cleansing cloth that you might get from Simple, Olay, or Burt&#x27;s Bees) and the strange sensation, it is more on the &amp;#34;refresh&amp;#34; side than the &amp;#34;cleansing&amp;#34; side (</li>
            <li> I am very much not sure how to feel about this</li>
            <li> The package is small enough to carry in even a smaller purse, and are easy to open and close back tight.</li>
            <li> For the gentle, soothing massaging of tired, aching limbs, I recommend rubbing them down with the Ban Total Fresh Cooling Body Cloths.  </li>
            <li> They give you a bit of a clean feeling after use, obviously not as great as a shower but still freshens you up.</li>
            <li> I received for reviewing purposes a single sample pack containing 10 of these Ban Total Refresh Cooling Body Cloths.</li>
            <li> These small cloths are really useful for cleaning up a little when I am in a rush or even when I don’t want to take a shower.  </li>
            <li> Long hike in the woods?</li>
            <li> They barely cleaned half of my body before drying out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;People with dry skin beware, these are drying and are probably not for you.</li>
            <li> The package is re-sealable so the wipes don&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li> Thick cloth with ample moisture to wipe down large area.</li>
            <li> They are similar to a wet-wipe - they are dry, yet cooling, and stay moist for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> First, the cloths are quite small; I would prefer that they were at least washcloth size.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s enough for use on one part of the body but with a baby wipe I can usually do my face, neck and arms.</li>
            <li> Very invigorating, and try not to wipe too hard at your delicate parts.  </li>
            <li> But I fear possible trouble in using these cloths for an updated sponge bath, and I don’t go looking for trouble.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a quick and not so dirty solution.</li>
            <li> It did the job, after running around doing errands: I wiped down and no sticky residual.</li>
            <li> What I found out these are instead were alcohol wipes with some slight fragrance.</li>
            <li> It will leave you feeling slightly refreshed.  </li>
            <li> Upon opening the pack (and the pack inside the pack which is the actual dispenser with a reusable seal), I discovered that the package is small because the wipes are small.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to shower twice, as it is hard on dry skin.</li>
            <li> But they are small, about 1/3 rd</li>
            <li> Has a perfume smell, but it is not potent or linkers on your skin.  </li>
            <li> They are thick.  </li>
            <li> Not much more than that!</li>
            <li> Wow, I was really disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> They are very small, too.  </li>
            <li> think I&#x27;ll stick with the larger,stronger and less expensive baby wipes.</li>
            <li> They are not great for delicate skin areas, either.  </li>
            <li> And they are very expensive at .90 each.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Wow, I was really disappointed in this product. I don&#x27;t like to use antiperspirants, I prefer a good shower in the morning and a quick one before bed. I carry baby wipes to freshen up during the day. I was excited to try these wipes. I had no trouble getting them out of the package, as some reviewer mentioned. But they are small, about 1/3 rd the size of the baby wipes I use. The scent of alcohol is really strong and I felt like I smelled of it for some time. The wipes fell apart as I was using them. And they are very expensive at .90 each.&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll stick with the larger,stronger and less expensive baby wipes.</li>
            <li> I am not convinced that they cool you anymore than any other wipe. However they do the job buy disinfecting parts of your body because it has enough alcohol in it.</li>
            <li> This cooling cloth did exactly what its people said it would do. It cleaned my skin and left a very pleasant odor. Remarkably the odor lasted for hours and my skin did feel cool. I liked the way the cloths are in a protective closed bag so that they do not dry up.</li>
            <li> After workouts or on days I can&#x27;t shower, I often use baby wipes to clean up. These sounded like an adult version of those with the promise of cooling and a nice scent. What I found out these are instead were alcohol wipes with some slight fragrance. These are not gentle and while they say they&#x27;re ok to use on the face, they left me with a burning sensation and a red face. The cloths themselves are smaller than a baby wipe so they didn&#x27;t seem to go as far. There&#x27;s enough for use on one part of the body but with a baby wipe I can usually do my face, neck and arms. I don&#x27;t think I will be using the rest of these.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend, Tammy, and I love to give each other body massages in bed.  We use the Heart Throb Heated Massagers that Tammy purchased from her niece, Theresa; Theresa is a highly successful sales consultant for Pure Romance.  After we use the heated massagers, we gently rub the Ban Total Refresh Cooling Body Cloths over each other&#x60;s faces and exposed limbs.  The scent, Invigorating, is truly invigorating.  Each cloth refreshes our skin.  It doesn&#x27;t burn our faces.  It is safe to use all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  For the gentle, soothing massaging of tired, aching limbs, I recommend rubbing them down with the Ban Total Fresh Cooling Body Cloths.  They come in a packet that I cut open at the top.  Inside is a re-sealable pouch that will help keep the cloths moist and fresh for up to forty-five days (according to the package).  I keep them on my nightstand next to my heated massagers and a plastic bottle of Pure Naked massage oil.  (This was a Christmas gift to me from Theresa.)  Tammy and I both have very stressful lives; massages help Tammy and I to relax and quickly fall asleep.  Each body cloth is large enough to use on both of us.</li>
            <li> This item was given to me for my review.&lt;br /&gt;When I first opened the Ban Total Refresh Cooling Body Cloths, I had my doubts. There was a strong smell that I did not like. However, once the package was open for a minute or two, that went away, and the package had very little smell which was MUCH better. Strong scents give me a headache. The cloth looks like your standard wet wipe, and I found that it really was cooling and refreshing. I am a homemaker, so I do a certain amount of grunt work in my day.

The scent they leave behind was pleasant without being overpowering. Additionally, the cloths are nice for the occasional hot flash. They come in handy, and I suspect they will be a new addition to my vanity.</li>
            <li> These small, refreshing wipes are packed in a pouch of ten and conveniently fit in a purse or bag. They are similar to a wet-wipe - they are dry, yet cooling, and stay moist for a few minutes. They do contain alcohol, but leave a light, pleasant scent. While these would be good to freshen up anytime, I find them especially useful for cooling off and refreshing after an annoying hot flash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised with these wipes.

            <li> I work out a lot.  And if I have to head out afterwards, I&#x27;ll take a shower.  It&#x27;s time consuming but it&#x27;s the only way to get really clean.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used these after a workout, and I am not that impressed.&lt;br /&gt;SIZE: These cloths aren&#x27;t all that big.  Maybe a bit bigger than your hand.  They are thick.  They have a good amount of moisture to them.  More than your standard face/body/baby wipe.&lt;br /&gt;SCENT:  They do leave a light pleasant clean scent behind.  Similar to clean laundry.  It may annoy some.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if the scent was because the cloths were &amp;#34;cleaning&amp;#34; me or if it was just some fragrance they added to give the impression of being cleaned...&lt;br /&gt;FUNCTION:  These are not full-body cleaning cloths.  They barely cleaned half of my body before drying out.  I used one after a workout, and it was good for the upper body.  Neck, underarms, etc.  It will leave you feeling slightly refreshed.  But these are by no means full-body washcloths.  They just don&#x27;t have the power.  Plus, your hair is still gross from post-gym activites, so if you really want to be clean you&#x27;ll still need a shower.&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;These might be good for babies or small kids.  Or if you just want a light wipe-down after the gym.  But really, I don&#x27;t find these to be all that useful.  Maybe in a pinch if I need to run out the door after having been to the gym, I&#x27;ll use them again.  I suppose these might be useful for the elderly, but like I said, I didn&#x27;t find that a single cloth would clean my entire body.  These are enhanced face wipes.  Not much more than that!</li>
            <li> Thick cloth with ample moisture to wipe down large area. Has a perfume smell, but it is not potent or linkers on your skin.  It did the job, after running around doing errands: I wiped down and no sticky residual.</li>
            <li> Ban Total Refresh Cooling Body Cloths are Cooling textured body wash cloths. They&#x27;re for External use only. They&#x27;re slightly moist and leave a pleasant cooling feeling and scent after use that lasts hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great option for a quick clean on the go and comes in a small peel open pouch that can easily be stored in your purse or small clutch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Great option for a girl on the go.</li>
            <li> great product and it arrived early!</li>
            <li> Why have I not heard of these things? These cooling cloths are perfect. PERFECT for women who have hot flashes. They really help cool you down quickly while wiping any perspiration that comes along with the hot flashes away. They come in a handy little pouch that fits inside my purse perfectly. I keep them in my purse for a quick cool down when I&#x27;m out and about trying to run errands while trying not to have a heat stroke, even in mid winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice light clean scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering. I will definitely be keeping a supply of these with me at all times. I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how wonderful they feel when in the middle of a hot flash.</li>
            <li> Ban Total Refresh Cooling Body Cloths, Invigorate, 30 Count.  This product is, of course, a brand extension from Ban, popular deodorant, a brand once owned by Bristol-Myers, well-known maker of toiletries and household goods, but  no longer. It is billed as a convenient way to cool down and freshen up anytime, anywhere; invigorating with a soft, clean scent; leaving skin feeling fresh, soft and silky with no sticky residue, while its patented Powder Silk Technology™ leaves skin with a translucent, superfine powder finish.  Users are directed to gently wipe the soft, durable cloth on any part of your body. Furthermore, after use, users are directed to dispose of cloth in the trash (do not flush).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been trying these for a couple of days now, and while they are fine as far as they go, I have some problems with this product.  First, the cloths are quite small; I would prefer that they were at least washcloth size.  Second, there is no advisory given to users with sensitive skin.  But with fragrance, deodorant, and alcohol as ingredients, there should be.  Because these ingredients are very likely to upset sensitive skin. The makers say this product is safe for use on the face.  Uh oh, not on this face.  Not with these ingredients.  Furthermore, I would be most likely to use this product for a quick once-over, what they used to call a sponge bath back in the day. That involves some pretty sensitively-skinned bits of the human anatomy.  But I fear possible trouble in using these cloths for an updated sponge bath, and I don’t go looking for trouble.  So, I can see some limited use for these cloths, but there are other products better suited to my needs.</li>
            <li> These are great to have on-hand if you live in a hot area or if you have exerted yourself excessively just before meeting your friends. You have a quick way to cool off and wipe away any smelly odors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People with dry skin beware, these are drying and are probably not for you.</li>
            <li> I like to commute on my bicycle. The trip requires me to climb a couple of hills, which leaves me sweaty. Instead of taking a quick sponge bath, with the body cloths I can simply wipe off while changing shirts. It&#x27;s pretty effective, if not totally refreshing. The product does leave a residue that took some getting used to. It&#x27;s a quick and not so dirty solution. I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Great and simple to use. These wipes come in handy on trips to the bathroom or on a hot day. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I thought that these wipes were way too alcohol burn-y.  They are not great for delicate skin areas, either.  They are very small, too.  All in all I think there are much better options out there for a skin wipe refresher.  They also do not deodorize, in case you thought the Ban deodorant thing was a wipe on deodorant and cleansing wipe.</li>
            <li> These have a distinct alcohol smell, which is where the alleged cooling effect comes from.  As the alcohol evaporates, it cools your skin.  That being said, I didn&#x27;t really notice any cooling.  They do a good job of cleaning, but I personally can&#x27;t see much use for them.  If for some reason you often get sweaty during the day and need something like this, these cloths would fill your needs.</li>
            <li> One reviewer noted that this product is best used by menopausal women. I did search the manufacturer&#x27;s website ... and, while I did not find that precise usage suggested, it does seem to be the case. Between the very small size (this is not a Handi-Wipe or a traditional cleansing cloth that you might get from Simple, Olay, or Burt&#x27;s Bees) and the strange sensation, it is more on the &amp;#34;refresh&amp;#34; side than the &amp;#34;cleansing&amp;#34; side (so, in that sense, the product name is spot-on).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does give a cooling sensation, but there is a distinct smell that might be prohibitive for those with sensitives/allergies to fragrance or for those who are concerned about her perfume clashing with this odd scent. I have also tried the &amp;#34;Restore&amp;#34; scent ... I found it equally as off-putting. I think an unscented version would have been brilliant and most welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are too small to use when traveling (a little packet of Burt&#x27;s Bees clothes are perfect for such moments), but I can envision that these might provide relief to women experiencing hot-flashes. In this sense, the price and the size would make a little more sense.</li>
            <li> I was pretty surprised at how small the package was when I received this in the mail.  My review pack contains only 10 wipes rather than the 30 you&#x27;ll get if you buy these, but even still.  Upon opening the pack (and the pack inside the pack which is the actual dispenser with a reusable seal), I discovered that the package is small because the wipes are small.  They are rectangular, perhaps 3 inches by 6 inches.  I was expecting something more the size of a wet-nap.  But aside from the size, these wipes reminded me a bit of the kind of wet-naps you get at your average rib or barbecue place to clean up your messy fingers.  There is the same cool feeling and the same rubbing alcohol scent, both of which evaporate rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are good for cooling down when you&#x27;re sweaty, but I&#x27;m not sure they&#x27;re any better than any other wipe.  They&#x27;re definitely not greasy.  In fact, they leave a sort of powdery feel on your skin.  The first two ingredients are, as you might expect, water and alcohol.  The remaining ingredients are mostly the sorts of unpronounceable, chemical sorts of things you might find in soaps or shampoos, many of which I don&#x27;t recognize - denat, lauryl methacrylate/sodium methacrylate, crosspolymer, dimethicone, dipropylene glycol, etc., along with something simply labeled as &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will enjoy using these after my morning workouts for the next several days, but I can&#x27;t see myself buying a new pack of them.  They could be useful if you exercise before work or over lunch and don&#x27;t get a chance to take a full shower afterward.</li>
            <li> I love these so much that I have selected 3 different scents.  Pick the one that appeals to you.  This one is &#x27;Invigorate&#x27;, but they are all pretty much the same - invigorating.  There is alcohol in these; however, you&#x27;ll need it if you have accidents or if you are traveling - and even if you cannot shower.  They do an excellent job of taking care of odors.  The packages are small enough to fit in your purse, or jacket pocket.  Very invigorating, and try not to wipe too hard at your delicate parts.  They&#x27;re cooling, yet dry easy, leaving you fresh.. I have been using baby wipes, and you can, but for big job,s, these are the best.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I love the idea of this product -- in effect, portable washcloths! If you have any warm weather activities where you get hot and sweaty and have no shower access immediately afterward, these cloths are perfect! We often spend a day sailing and it gets hot out on the water, and then sweaty when we have to lug all our stuff back to the car. These cloths will now be a staple in our &amp;#34;sailing bag&amp;#34; so we can freshen up after a hot, sweaty day on the boat. Summer afternoon of kids on the playground? Perfect. Long hike in the woods? Perfect. The cloths have a very gentle, fresh smell and do not dry my skin out, which is a plus. These will be a staple in our trunk from now on.</li>
            <li> In our kung fu school there is a lot of hands on contact. These wipes are handy to keep around for a quick wipe down of hands and arms. There is a bit too much alcohol to use on my face, as I have very dry skin. The package is re-sealable so the wipes don&#x27;t dry out. There is a slight scent which lingers, not my favorite, but better than other gym odors. It&#x27;s a good product for gym use or for tucking in the glove compartment of your car for quick touch ups on the road.</li>
            <li> My husband is the kind of person who perspires quite heavily when doing odd jobs around the house. Sometimes it isn&#x27;t convenient to take a second shower during the course of the day so he was happy to try these cloths. He told me that he immediately felt cooler and refreshed and was able to wipe down well using only the one cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried one but I was not feeling heated at the time. To me, it was a pleasant cool sensation but one where I felt dry afterwards instead of slightly damp like one might think after using a wipe cloth. The fragrance was mild and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not use these cloths to merely wipe my hands clean as there are many less expensive cloths available for that. However, if you need a quick and more serious clean up or cool down or if you need to freshen up midday for a meeting or other important occurrence, you should seriously consider trying one of the three fragrances of this body cloth.</li>
            <li> These small cloths are really useful for cleaning up a little when I am in a rush or even when I don’t want to take a shower.  They are refreshing and smell nice – a little powdery. I tend to be a nighttime showerer and these are great for freshening up during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the size of the package too.  It is small enough to fit into the front pouch of my gym bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even the coldness of the cloth is funny!  I left the bag in my car overnight and pulled one out – even under normal conditions, they are a bit cold—but after freezing, they are even funnier.  Total refresh.</li>
            <li> I am very much not sure how to feel about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally got it because I thought that it would be a good solution for after working out - for instance, after a spin class when I&#x27;m in a hurry, before I get in my car, or to cool off after riding my bike to work or taking a short run during lunch. But as soon as I opened the package, I realized one of the major limitations of the product - the refreshing, cooling sensation is by and large alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given that, although Ban says it&#x27;s safe I really didn&#x27;t want to use it on my face (where I sweat the most). That said, I&#x27;ve used it on my arms, chest, and back (anywhere I could reach!) and I have to say, it does cool me off quickly and stop my sweating nearly instantaneously - which I consider a miracle. It left a slightly powdery, barely perceptible and overall pleasant sort of residue (&amp;#34;powder silk,&amp;#34; I guess) on my skin. The smell actually is light and pleasant, as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caveat: the cloths are small and  warm quickly to the touch, so you may find yourself using several at one go.</li>
            <li> I saw them reviewed on the TODAY Show and since I am outside in the Florida heat, I thought I would give them a try.  They work!  I like them so much I have them sent to me every month.  Great product to not only take of the grime of a hot day but they cool you down and leave no residue.</li>
            <li> I just used one of these little cooling cloths after a good sweaty workout on a LifeCycle, and I must say it left me feeling more refreshed and cool than usual, even though I use a necklace fan while I&#x27;m on the bike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is pleasant -- not like Axe Body Spray, thank heaven!  No female was repelled by the odor, nor did the NYC Department of Sanitation think they had lost a case of disinfectant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wiped my face, chrome dome, neck, and arms with the towelette (each one measures probably about four inches by four inches).  The cloth stayed moist for a while; I was able to get a few wipes before it dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the cloths come in a little resealable pouch which can easily fit in a pocket, gym bag, purse, what have you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have deducted one star just because these little guys aren&#x27;t cheap -- about thirty cents apiece, if I&#x27;m doing my math correctly.  Thus I await a more modestly priced generic equivalent from Harmon Discount or Dollar General or someone like that -- those cloths I might buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you would like a quick and convenient cooldown after a hot workout (or sultry summer day), you might want to try these Ban Cloths.  The only downside is the upscale price.</li>
            <li> I like to keep these handy wipes in my to go bag at all times - once or twice when I arrived they were somewhat dry, so I just added water and let them rehydrate - good as new!</li>
            <li> I received for reviewing purposes a single sample pack containing 10 of these Ban Total Refresh Cooling Body Cloths. The alcohol content in each cloth provides a cooling effect, while the superfine powder helps a little bit with the deodorizing.  Each cloth refreshens without leaving any sticky residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packet is resealable, but it&#x27;s recommended that the 10 cloths per packet be used within 45 days after opening for best results.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of having something like this in my bag to use when needed, but this product falls short.  It drys out quickly, and is only half the size of a face wipe or baby wipe.  The scent is good but I prefer to use a facial towelette, or even a baby wipe over these.  I don&#x27;t think it has any real deodorant qualities.</li>
