            <li>One of the best toothpastes I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>and I think it is very good for my mouth.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is very good for gum health.  </li>
            <li>This toothpaste is great with a sonic electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>it has a great taste as well.</li>
            <li>Great toothpaste.</li>
            <li>and I trust this stuff to keep them there for another 60,  LOL</li>
            <li>The foam is great.</li>
            <li>but it foams up nicely and works great!</li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s a great combination.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>Great toothpaste without all the sweetness of the majority of others out on the market.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found a great mouthwash to pair with this toothpaste is [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Great tasting toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I will be buying Verve Ultra since the reviews say it has a great flavor and also comes in a gel.</li>
            <li>It has a very nice flavor, and seeing as how I was raised with fluoride in my toothpaste</li>
            <li>After just two days of using this product, I can see and feel a remarkable difference in my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>but I wouldn’t describe it as pleasant tasting.</li>
            <li>good texture and can feel fluoride protecting teeth</li>
            <li>cannot rate its effectiveness as to cavity prevention or whiteness, but it is a good choice to avoid canker sores.</li>
            <li>Good lord</li>
            <li>This toothpaste may be made from good ingredients, but the taste is not to my liking.  </li>
            <li>This toothpaste is a good alternative to the toothpastes that are out on the market.</li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>I use it when I have a canker sore and for that it’s good because it doesn’t agitate the sore.</li>
            <li>Does a good job cleaning.  </li>
            <li>The taste is good &amp;</li>
            <li>Surprisingly good - was uncertain</li>
            <li>good tayste and effect.</li>
            <li>Did not control my tarter...taste good</li>
            <li>Jason makes good products.  </li>
            <li>I had been looking for a good gel toothpaste for a while that I could recommend my patients.</li>
            <li>thinking I was doing good for my body.</li>
            <li>I kept it though because it does a good job of removing plaque, like all of the Jason toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Really good product.</li>
            <li>It has already be scientifically proven that good dental hygiene affects your health.</li>
            <li>CoQ10 is one of the supplements you can use to insure good health.</li>
            <li>It tastes good too.</li>
            <li>Good foam and cleansing too.  </li>
            <li>I was leary of the comments on flavor, but this is outstanding!</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste!  </li>
            <li>yet I love this toothpaste!</li>
            <li>turned to Amazon, I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste!  </li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste!</li>
            <li>I like Jason&#x27;s quality and naturalness so much more!</li>
            <li>The gel has a great tea tree, cinnamon and clove flavor - strong and you feel it killing halitosis in its tracks.</li>
            <li>this toothpaste is amazing.</li>
            <li>Do your own research people.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t stand mint of any kind so looking for something else.  </li>
            <li>Nice alternative to mints.&lt;br /&gt;kills</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>the taste is good (I like cinnamon a lot) and it lathers a bit too :)</li>
            <li>The Jason Healthy Mouth toothpaste does a good job cleaning, yet doesn&#x27;t sting at all.  </li>
            <li>This kind of tastes like the inside of a bowl of potpourri.</li>
            <li>The clove mouthwash is really nice too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now been using it for over a year and loving it.</li>
            <li>It also works great to spray on toothbrushes to refresh and clean the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great clean chemical-free feeling when using this product.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant taste that is not overpowering and it cleans well, leaving our mouth fresh and with a good aftertaste.</li>
            <li>Not too much cinnamon and the tea tree oil gives it a wonderful, refreshing taste.</li>
            <li>Tastes perfectly fine to me, but I didn&#x27;t buy it to taste good.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent natural toothpaste gel, with a tea tree and cinnamon flavor.</li>
            <li>Teeth feel great after brushing and mouth feels fresh.</li>
            <li>The flavor is amazing, lasts longer than others I have tried and the best part is, it&#x27;s probably the most natural toothpaste you can find in market these days</li>
            <li>This is by far the best toothpaste I have ever used, and I have tried a lot of these brand name alternatives.</li>
            <li>This has a very mild cinnamon/aloe flavor that won&#x27;t foul up your dinner if you are brushing up before heading out for a nice meal.  </li>
            <li>it has a nice strong after taste of cinammon or something.</li>
            <li>Very fresh taste, freshens breath better than mouthwash along with some whitening!  </li>
            <li>I love this product and use it every day.  </li>
            <li>and I am glad you carry this.</li>
            <li>My favorite toothpaste and</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>It is healthy and does not burn your gums.</li>
            <li>I have purchased and used this product for many years.</li>
            <li>I will buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve been purchased by a megacorporation, I sure can&#x27;t tell.</li>
            <li>I love this brand and bought this flavor on a whim...</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>After brushing with the toothpaste, my mouth feel cleaner and more healthy.</li>
            <li>wished I could feel a bit more grittiness thought.</li>
            <li>Love the flavor.</li>
            <li>But you may need to use many times to cure gum bleeding and infection.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more.</li>
            <li>well many reasons.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for more cinnamon.</li>
            <li>However, you do get used to the taste the more you use it.</li>
            <li>Or, I have to add on more during the brushing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love that there isn&#x27;t fluoride since fluoride has been working for me all these years.</li>
            <li>Great taste, non-minty and very cinnamony.  </li>
            <li>I like the Jason brand toothpastes and this is the one I&#x27;ve bought most often.</li>
            <li>The gel really foams up, a bit more than I prefer, but all in all I am happy with the product and will probably purchase it again.</li>
            <li>I still make sure and rinse 2-3 times to rid myself of any toothpaste residue.</li>
            <li>We like the cinnamon better.</li>
            <li>I recently realized how many chemicals are in all of my household and self care products, so I was really happy to find one with ingredients I recognize that works so well!  </li>
            <li>Plus it tastes good and leaves my breath fresh.  </li>
            <li>Love this because it is not abrasive like most all toothpastes are now (since they want to have a whitening effect).</li>
            <li>I also love that this paste has fluoride which is a necessity for the anti- cavity affect.</li>
            <li>I find the tooth &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; form works way better.</li>
            <li>This is my family&#x27;s favorite brand of toothpaste.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You&#x27;ll be surpirsed how many organic companies have been bought and tainted.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Sodium Fluoride is used in most toothpastes, mouthwashes, dental varnish, dental preparations and nutritional supplements.</li>
            <li>Added to molten metal, sodium fluoride creates a more uniform metal.</li>
            <li>The CoQ10 is supposed to help maintain healthy gums, and the fluoride is supposed to help with tartar, etc.</li>
            <li>It was my mistake ordering this type of product as there are so many choices</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many of the Jason mouth products and recommend this toothpaste, too.</li>
            <li>Makes all the difference that it has not being tested on animals and has no animal ingredients, which is always GREAT and makes it environmentally responsible...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even better than Tom&#x27;s ever was.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste makes me love brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Not gonna lie, there are better tasting toothpastes out there</li>
            <li>but the reason I love it is because of the CoQ10.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love the taste and feel of it.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s ok with me.</li>
            <li>Feels so refreshing after brushing;</li>
            <li>The Desert Essence brands of Tea Tree oil toothpaste are much better than this one.</li>
            <li>clean, smooth &amp; whiter teeth!!</li>
            <li>Leaves your mouth clean, and it rinses away nicely.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;subtle.\\&quot; NOT!I think it has a very strong flavor, but that&#x27;s not that important to</li>
            <li>I gagged every time I used it... and because my boyfriend refused to use it as well, I ended up not being able to get rid of as quickly as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>Cleans well and has a pretty good ingredient deck though.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect because I couldn&#x27;t imagine precisely what cinnamon + tea tree would taste like, but my best description would be a cinnamon/clove-like flavor with a little eucalyptus/menthol on top of it (if that helps!).  </li>
            <li>The nice and natural clean feeling it leaves me with is great.</li>
            <li>I found the best price was on the single tube with subscribe and save.</li>
            <li>Makes your mouth feel SOOOOO clean!</li>
            <li>It leaves my teeth feeling really clean!  </li>
            <li>Great all natural tooth paste.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice the tea tree, which is probably a good thing.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about having to order toothpaste online, but it was absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li>the toothpaste is superb and leaves my mouth feeling cleaner than any other.</li>
            <li>The taste is very mild too.</li>
            <li>Love all their products, toothpaste is clean and painless.</li>
            <li>But I am also cavity prone, so I needed to find one with fluoride, which was not an easy task.  </li>
            <li>My teeth and gums feel so clean and healthy after using this.</li>
            <li>I like that it does not have a strong odor or taste</li>
            <li>Strong taste of cinnamon, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>No harsh chemicals just good healthy ingredients.</li>
            <li>Had to get used to the taste first, but I find it effective.</li>
            <li>Good oral health care without all the chemicals in many major brands of toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Tastes fine</li>
            <li>but I do fine that the cap will not stay away from the toothpaste flow.</li>
            <li>Good and natural paste!</li>
            <li>This contains fluoride which has health hazards all its own - may want to rethink this brand if you are looking for truly healthy and natural toothpaste....skip the fluoride.</li>
            <li>I realized it was a huge mistake.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I enjoy it.  </li>
            <li>It is promoted as a tarter control, anti-cavity toothpaste get with CoQ10 in it, which is important to me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s SLS free, while still having fluoride.</li>
            <li>Shown to make people docile, obedient, lethargic, apathetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Guilt -free</li>
            <li>This stuff is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>Advertised as Fluoride free, is not..</li>
            <li>Why can&#x27;t toothpaste manufacturers make adult tothpaste in good flavors without the SLS?  </li>
            <li>Thanks for making it so I can eat spicy foods again!!!</li>
            <li>I love the tea tree oil, it leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean, without the mint burn.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Positives:  is anti-cavity, no sodium lauryl sulfate, no preservatives, no artificial coloring, no artificial sweeteners, no propylene glycol (!!).  </li>
            <li>I find this toothpaste tastes great and leaves my mouth feeling very clean without all of the sugar in other toothpastes.</li>
            <li>Fortunately Jason&#x27;s Healthy Mouth still tastes fresh, but mildly so.  </li>
            <li>I have found my new favorite toothpaste!  </li>
            <li>All you really want from a toothpaste is a mild abrasive, a bit of fluoride and a nice taste, anyway.</li>
            <li>It does the trick, keeps your mouth fresh!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like it at first, but I&#x27;ve grown to be OK with it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s unique taste; it basically tastes the way tea tree smells.</li>
            <li>&quot; I&#x27;m surprised at how many people love the flavor and consider it \\&quot;mellow,\\</li>
            <li>My teeth feel as clean as ever</li>
            <li>Mouth feels really clean after using.</li>
            <li>fresh&amp;#34; feeling at the end, but it is a clean feeling</li>
            <li>Mouth feels clean and I like that it doesn&#x27;t have sulfates or parabens in it.</li>
            <li>It does what it&#x27;s supposed to, clean your teeth.</li>
            <li>It does make my mouth feel clean</li>
            <li>so it makes my mouth feel really clean</li>
            <li>If you do a google search and read about &#x27;SLS Allergy&#x27;, you will be surprised to find out how many people have issues with this chemical and still most of the toothpaste companies use it to make their toothpaste frothier.</li>
            <li>Leaves my teeth squeaky clean without causing sensitivity,</li>
            <li>Definitely the best I have used so far.</li>
            <li>Teeth come out clean and my breath smells like Christmas.</li>
            <li>But seems to get your teeth clean</li>
            <li>Nice mild cinnamon taste and smooth texture for a natural gel toothpaste.</li>
            <li>and I love it , my dentist loves it,  A tube lasts for ever it seems,  you use very little as it foams great ,  I go to the dentist every 3 months,  </li>
            <li>It tastes great without being very sweet and even though it&#x27;s more expensive than most toothpaste  </li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of the Sea Fresh Jason toothpaste, and decided to give this one a try.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s nice to find a natural brand that still has fluoride.    </li>
            <li>I have searched all over for a good cinnamon toothpaste as Crest or Colgate has fallen short in this.  </li>
            <li>Its so cool.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is a big tube and fair price.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a natural toothpaste that provides effective cleaning, in addition to freshening my breath.</li>
            <li>If this toothpaste did NOT contain Fluoride it would be a full 5 Stars.</li>
            <li>Not bad per se, but not a repeat product.</li>
            <li>Finally as an adult and able to choose my own products, I found that the \\&quot;hippie brands\\&quot; were much milder in flavor while still tasting fresh.  </li>
            <li>It leaves a clean, fresh feeling in your mouth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it because I have to, but it doesn&#x27;t make your teeth feel clean and fresh</li>
            <li>It leaves my mouth feeling so clean, it stays fresh for hours..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read that it&#x27;s an unstable compound and deteriorates rather quickly, and I wonder whether it would stay stable in a toothpaste like this.</li>
            <li>The taste is mild.  </li>
            <li>So, after all these years of choosing my own natural toothpastes, this one is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for a NON-FLUORIDE, MORE NATURAL toothpaste, and this one is, but my teeth don&#x27;t feel as clean as they should after brushing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that it is more natural without some of the chemical additives that most commercial toothpastes contain.  </li>
            <li>Jason products seem to be pure and free from harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>This tooth paste will show up on a search for Fluoride Free toothpaste on Amazon, it isn&#x27;t fluoride free, it&#x27;s SLS free only.  </li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite toothpaste.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not crazy about the taste and would NOT say it \\&quot;doesn&#x27;t overload my taste</li>
            <li>This variety, with tea tree oil and cinnamon, is my favorite so far.  </li>
            <li>but many of these natural companies are eliminating it</li>
            <li>I had had some sensitive gums, but with the use of Jason&#x27;s toothpaste my gums are healthy and the sensitivity has disappeared.</li>
            <li>I am trying to use more natural products</li>
            <li>If you are prone to frequent canker sores, then SLS can aggravate the problem, but most SLS-free pastes on the market are chalky and some lack the protection of fluoride (</li>
            <li>Definitely better than anything in the market by far.</li>
            <li>or what, but Jason Healthy Mouth almost completely got rid of the problem.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried various gentle and organic toothpastes but they don&#x27;t seem to do as good a job cleaning.  </li>
            <li>We love that it is all natural and the company shares the beliefs that we stand for.</li>
            <li>It is a CLEAR GEL - no artificial colors!!!</li>
            <li>B004GW0WJM Desert Essence Natural Refreshing Tea Tree Oil Mouthwash -- 16 fl oz]].</li>
            <li>The results are fresh breath that lasts.  </li>
            <li>worth it.</li>
            <li>It gives your teeth a very smoth clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Makes your whole mouth taste clean and cuts through morning breath.  </li>
            <li>I have been experimenting with multiple different brands to find my perfect SLS free natural toothpaste and have been hooked on to Toms of Maine for past couple of years, which is quite good</li>
            <li>It supposedly more or less organic than most products</li>
            <li>This is probably about as natural as one can get to natural, unless you make your own.</li>
            <li>Never did I think it would leave such a clean feeling unlike most toothpastes,it really makes me feel</li>
            <li>years ago, I used to brush with Melaleuca cinnamon toothpaste (which is not really cinnamon flavored, more neutral), and when I went to the dentist for my semi-annual cleanings, he used to gush about how clean my teeth were.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s refreshing, makes my mouth clean, doesnt make my breakfast taste gross, can be used on acne, a little goes a long way and smells good too!</li>
            <li>something that I don&#x27;t mind tasting first thing in the morning.  </li>
            <li>and I love that it doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals like traditional toothpastes.</li>
            <li>Is there such a thing as healthy fluoride....</li>
            <li>and I feel better on the inside knowing its healthier to use than regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>I seem to be allergic to most tootpastes, either paste or gel, which leave my mouth stinging even after several rinses.  </li>
            <li>Be advised, I do not work for this company or have any stake in their success, but really wish I could run their marketing department.</li>
            <li>It definitely leaves teeth and gums feeling super clean and smelling fresh, plus it doesn&#x27;t contain any of the chemical junk found in mainstream toothpaste brands.</li>
            <li>The tea tree oil flavor is pretty yucky...</li>
            <li>I used to have problems with my gums, I read about this toothpaste and bought it, and i was surprise with the result, only a couple of day of using it I can feel my gums getting better..</li>
            <li>AND, I just checked some more info about it and recent research has shown no benefit from CoQ10 for periodontal disease.</li>
            <li>Tastes like listerine and Vicks Rub at first, but you get used to it.  </li>
            <li>After more than 3 months of continuous use, I noticed that my teeth weren&#x27;t as white as they used to be and that my gums were inflamed, swollen.</li>
            <li>/&gt;that actually makes my mouth feel better.  </li>
            <li>Like most of the other customers, I wanted to replace my toothpaste with a healthier and more natural one.  </li>
            <li>Good change from the normal mint and looking forward to trying the other flavors as well.</li>
            <li>As a periodontist, I see that people brush extremely hard with all of these abrasive toothpastes and with electric brushes and are getting more and more recession.</li>
            <li>Occasionally if I do get a sore because of too much acidic food, Jason Healthy Mouth gets rid of it in a day or two.</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t used to it the taste is different from traditional toothpaste, but it does a good job and seems to help with inflammation.</li>
            <li>I normally live cinnamon, but this tastes like some kind of strange medicine.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like this toothpaste, simply because I don&#x27;t feel that my mouth is very clean after using it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the flavor and I have to use a lot of this to get a long brushing session going.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to natural toothpastes that aren&#x27;t sweet and I like them.</li>
            <li>I tried it to see if it was better than others but unless paired with a mouthwash it doesnt give a fresh breath feeling (because of the odd flavor)</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied after reading the ingredients label when I was expecting something more natural, but those are hard to find these days.</li>
            <li>Going SLS-free will really help keep cankers sores away.</li>
            <li>I am very meticulous about oral hygiene.  </li>
            <li>I got this toothpaste initially because Jason is a cruelty free company</li>
            <li>The cinnamon is much milder than you&#x27;d think it would be, but you can still taste it in there.  </li>
            <li>This really suprised me.</li>
            <li>It doesn’t foam up much and it has an oily texture which takes some getting used to..</li>
            <li>Tom&#x27;s foams a bit much for my taste, though.  </li>
            <li>I really like it -</li>
            <li>Much cleaner than Crest Prohealth did.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I am a smoker, who is also really obsessive about my teeth</li>
            <li>I started using a baking soda and coconut oil mix, and my teeth and mouth look and feel so much</li>
            <li>Fluorosilicate (Na2SiF6) is primarily added to public drinking water as a fluoridation agent.</li>
            <li>It is a classified hazardous waste by-product of phosphate fertilizer manufacture which, if not put into our drinking water, must be disposed of at hazardous waste facilities.</li>
            <li>The flavor is pleasing and there are no unhealthy ingredients or food color.  </li>
            <li>(I really don&#x27;t taste the cinnamon...)  </li>
            <li>I doubt anyone trying it would really like it.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really use toothpaste for the taste.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use popular products because they are so harsh</li>
            <li>Many of these natural brands have been purchased by much larger corporations and products have changed.  </li>
            <li>Amazon was kind enough to take it back.</li>
            <li>I used to be a Tom&#x27;s of Maine user, but when the company got bought out they apparently changed the recipe and it became way too sweet for me.</li>
            <li>but honestly it reminds me of Listerine, without feeling so harsh.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soooooo much better than the Abe&#x27;s &#x27;natural&#x27; toothpastes which seem so unnatural when reading their extensive chemical ingredients (then, the say they are &amp;#34;naturally processed&amp;#34; chemicals).  </li>
            <li>Yes, I will get many dislikes from this review, but I completely blame myself for buying this product without proper examining at the label which state it contains fluoride.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste does not contain harmful ingredients, all natural !!!</li>
            <li>Make sure you buy this one and not the other one Jason makes without fluoride though.</li>
            <li>Seems to be a better price online that other brands in person.</li>
            <li>I was glad to find a cruelty-free product with fluoride, in addition to Tom&#x27;s, which other family members also use and like.  </li>
            <li>Last week I went back to my good old Crest 3d white luxe (I&#x27;m glad I did despite the ingredients because my teeth are back in shape again).</li>
            <li>it does not feel as clean as a regular toothpaste, but it is not tested on animals.</li>
            <li>I hate super minty toothpaste so this is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>Tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic and is antimicrobial; both real pluses in a toothpaste!</li>
            <li>B001T8MTWO Jason Healthy Mouth Plus CoQ10 Fluoride Gel Toothpaste, Tea Tree, Cinnamon, 6 Ounce]] has a slight minty flavor, not overpowering at all.  </li>
            <li>Does a decent job for toothpaste.</li>
            <li>For this particular toothpaste, the flavor is an acquired taste.</li>
            <li>In the future I might try a different flavor of Jason toothpaste to see if that’s any better.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this brand of toothpaste without sls as it definitely helps reduce the number of canker sores I would frequently get.  </li>
            <li>This is decent toothpaste</li>
            <li>I bought a tube of Jason cinnamon tea tree in my continuing quest to find a decent replacement and I was amazed.</li>
            <li>So far this has been the first natural toothpaste that&#x27;s managed to get (and keep) my teeth as clean as my regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this stuff.</li>
            <li>I like many people have a very strong sensitivity to artificial sweeteners.</li>
            <li>I really like it for my sensitive teeth, so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to lie, I don&#x27;t always really care if my toothpaste is all natural.</li>
            <li>This defeats the whole purpose of natural toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I normally don&#x27;t use a lot anyway.</li>
            <li>I love the short, natural ingredient list, especially being SLS-free.</li>
            <li>After a few uses, it became more tolerable.</li>
            <li>Love that it doesn&#x27;t use harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>Added to toothpaste, it has a remarkable effect on sensitive gums which is a common complaint of many people.</li>
            <li>After using this for a few weeks, I was all better.</li>
            <li>On the positive side, at least the menthol doesn&#x27;t linger really long like conventional toothpaste mint does, and being SLS free, eating and drinking after using this remains a pleasant experience.</li>
            <li>THIS TOOTH PASTE CONTAINS FLUORIDE but is free of many other harsh chemicals</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my husband who hates trying anything new, but will do it for me.</li>
            <li>Going back to old Sea Fresh, throwing this one away.</li>
            <li>No need to use \\&quot;globs\\&quot; of toothpaste with this to clean your teeth, and unlike the previous reviewer, I really like the flavors.</li>
            <li>Another plus, the price on Amazon is much cheaper than that of Whole Foods a big bonus for me.</li>
            <li>I have been using Jason toothpaste for several years - this new formula is a first for me, but I do like it.</li>
            <li>As with most every product, there is a bit of marketing puffery here - the purported benefits of tea tree oil in oral care products are unsubstantiated, and I suspect the claims for other ingredients are similarly overreaching.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;In point of fact, fluoride causes more human cancer death, and causes it faster than any other chemical.&amp;#34;--Dean Burk -- Congressional Record 21 July 1976.</li>
            <li>Since I have been pleased with Jason products, in the past, I decided to give this a whirl.</li>
            <li>Man, this stuff tastes so weird, but it defiantly is more clean feeling throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I like the other Jason tooth paste but not this one plus my teeth do not feel clean after brushing them thoroughly.</li>
            <li>It does get a little overly foamy for my tastes and leaves my mouth feeling slightly dry, but otherwise, it&#x27;s a nice toothpaste that cleans well.  </li>
            <li>During my last dental cleaning, my dentist commented on how healthy my gums looked, and I attribute it to the active ingredients in this paste!</li>
            <li>It was bought by Hain Celestial Group - one of the large corporations in food and personal care.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical about the taste compared to &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; toothpaste, but we were pleasantly surprised that it was actually quite refreshing and an easy transition.</li>
            <li>Tastes great and never feels artificial</li>
            <li>One natural brand of toothpaste changed into just another mint explosion, enough so that I had to brush my teeth with just water when I had a migraine because it tasted too much.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this toothpaste for a couple of days, but I really like it so far.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, it was quite upsetting to me when my teeth developed stains.  </li>
            <li>but I found that if I brush 2, 3 , or even 4 times a day with this product they seem to stay away or not be as frequent.</li>
            <li>Tea tree oil has a very distinctive fragrance &amp; flavor, but they&#x27;ve used just enough in this toothpaste that you have to think about it to notice it in there.  </li>
            <li>I had been looking for a non-peppermint toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t contain SLS (I have sensitive mucosa and am prone to ulcers) but that does contain fluoride (I don&#x27;t want decay).  </li>
            <li>Searched Amazon and Natural Food Stores online and decided on this because of its reviews.  </li>
            <li>And being &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; is no guarantee of complete safety, but there&#x27;s still probably nothing here that will kill you.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s back to fluoride for me, thanks.  </li>
            <li>i like that it is a natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I ordered this toothpaste because I like all -natural, and organic.</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive teeth and this has not bothered my teeth at all.  </li>
            <li>and I really like that it has tea tree essential oil in it because it has both anti-viral and anti-bacterial properties.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a natural toothpaste that contained fluoride and found this.</li>
            <li>I bought this toothpaste because I seem to have developed problems with the ingrediant Sodium Larel Sulfate, which is in all toothpaste.</li>
            <li>He has sensitive teeth and gums and saw improvement with this product.</li>
            <li>This toothpase is a soft gel</li>
            <li>I bought this because my dentist recommended I try a SLS free toothpaste due to gum irritation from regular pastes.  </li>
            <li>(So important to those of us who suffer extreme GI duress when FD&amp;C Blue 1 is used</li>
            <li>Though, I have heard some negative comments about fluoride, my sense is that everything in moderation (no extreme amounts of anything in your system) is actually safe.</li>
            <li>I would use it more often if it tasted better and it was less expensive.</li>
            <li>I developed SLS allergy a few years ago and get soles all over my mouth if I use any regular toothpaste available these days.</li>
            <li>whatever the dentists call it where my tongue was constantly in pain from using normal tooth paste.</li>
            <li>My entire family agrees that this is now our new toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Its definitely all natural.</li>
            <li>Natural Toothpaste&lt;br /&gt;It cleans your mouth entirely.</li>
            <li>You have to call the Poison Control Center if your child has ingested too much, labeled on toothpaste tubes.  </li>
            <li>with thin,  sensitive gums need is strong stinging peppermint.  </li>
            <li>I really like the gel-like consistency; it doesn&#x27;t get clumpy like some other SLS-free pastes.  </li>
            <li>In my constant efforts to find and buy natural toothpaste, I think I have finally found a winner.</li>
            <li>If you are not careful, the cap keeps closing back onto the paste as you put it on your brush.</li>
            <li>Amazon sells it for much cheaper price compared to regular stores and its much harder to find it at your regular store.</li>
            <li>I brushed with fluoride-free paste for a few years, and then got the first fillings I&#x27;ve ever had, so</li>
            <li>Not only do I not have to worry about getting sick from their product, it tastes amazing!</li>
            <li>it is not your typical white or blue color, but knowing it is all natural and has no colorants or artificial fragrances, makes me feel so good.  </li>
            <li>On top of all of that I&#x27;m not worried about breaking down my enamul with harsh whitening chemicals from other drug store brand names.</li>
            <li>The taste isn&#x27;t bad, the function is good...</li>

            <li> Great tasting toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I will be buying Verve Ultra since the reviews say it has a great flavor and also comes in a gel.</li>
            <li> It has a very nice flavor, and seeing as how I was raised with fluoride in my toothpaste</li>
            <li> After just two days of using this product, I can see and feel a remarkable difference in my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> but I wouldn’t describe it as pleasant tasting.</li>
            <li> good texture and can feel fluoride protecting teeth</li>
            <li> cannot rate its effectiveness as to cavity prevention or whiteness, but it is a good choice to avoid canker sores.</li>
            <li> Good lord</li>
            <li> This toothpaste may be made from good ingredients, but the taste is not to my liking.  </li>
            <li> This toothpaste is a good alternative to the toothpastes that are out on the market.</li>
            <li> Smells good.</li>
            <li> I use it when I have a canker sore and for that it’s good because it doesn’t agitate the sore.</li>

            <li> thinking I was doing good for my body.</li>
            <li> I kept it though because it does a good job of removing plaque, like all of the Jason toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Really good product.</li>
            <li> It has already be scientifically proven that good dental hygiene affects your health.</li>
            <li> CoQ10 is one of the supplements you can use to insure good health.</li>

            <li> I like Jason&#x27;s quality and naturalness so much more!</li>
            <li> The gel has a great tea tree, cinnamon and clove flavor - strong and you feel it killing halitosis in its tracks.</li>
            <li> this toothpaste is amazing.</li>
            <li> Do your own research people.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t stand mint of any kind so looking for something else.  </li>
            <li> Nice alternative to mints.&lt;br /&gt;kills</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> the taste is good (I like cinnamon a lot) and it lathers a bit too :)</li>
            <li> The Jason Healthy Mouth toothpaste does a good job cleaning, yet doesn&#x27;t sting at all.  </li>
            <li> This kind of tastes like the inside of a bowl of potpourri.</li>
            <li> The clove mouthwash is really nice too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now been using it for over a year and loving it.</li>
            <li> It also works great to spray on toothbrushes to refresh and clean the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great clean chemical-free feeling when using this product.  </li>
            <li> It has a pleasant taste that is not overpowering and it cleans well, leaving our mouth fresh and with a good aftertaste.</li>
            <li> Not too much cinnamon and the tea tree oil gives it a wonderful, refreshing taste.</li>
            <li> Tastes perfectly fine to me, but I didn&#x27;t buy it to taste good.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent natural toothpaste gel, with a tea tree and cinnamon flavor.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel great after brushing and mouth feels fresh.</li>
            <li> The flavor is amazing, lasts longer than others I have tried and the best part is, it&#x27;s probably the most natural toothpaste you can find in market these days</li>
            <li> This is by far the best toothpaste I have ever used, and I have tried a lot of these brand name alternatives.</li>
            <li> This has a very mild cinnamon/aloe flavor that won&#x27;t foul up your dinner if you are brushing up before heading out for a nice meal.  </li>
            <li> it has a nice strong after taste of cinammon or something.</li>
            <li> Very fresh taste, freshens breath better than mouthwash along with some whitening!  </li>
            <li> I love this product and use it every day.  </li>
            <li> and I am glad you carry this.</li>
            <li> My favorite toothpaste and</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It is healthy and does not burn your gums.</li>
            <li> I have purchased and used this product for many years.</li>
            <li> I will buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve been purchased by a megacorporation, I sure can&#x27;t tell.</li>
            <li> I love this brand and bought this flavor on a whim...</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> After brushing with the toothpaste, my mouth feel cleaner and more healthy.</li>
            <li> wished I could feel a bit more grittiness thought.</li>
            <li> Love the flavor.</li>
            <li> But you may need to use many times to cure gum bleeding and infection.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> well many reasons.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for more cinnamon.</li>
            <li> However, you do get used to the taste the more you use it.</li>
            <li> Or, I have to add on more during the brushing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love that there isn&#x27;t fluoride since fluoride has been working for me all these years.</li>
            <li> Great taste, non-minty and very cinnamony.  </li>
            <li> I like the Jason brand toothpastes and this is the one I&#x27;ve bought most often.</li>
            <li> The gel really foams up, a bit more than I prefer, but all in all I am happy with the product and will probably purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I still make sure and rinse 2-3 times to rid myself of any toothpaste residue.</li>
            <li> We like the cinnamon better.</li>
            <li> I recently realized how many chemicals are in all of my household and self care products, so I was really happy to find one with ingredients I recognize that works so well!  </li>
            <li> Plus it tastes good and leaves my breath fresh.  </li>
            <li> Love this because it is not abrasive like most all toothpastes are now (since they want to have a whitening effect).</li>
            <li> I also love that this paste has fluoride which is a necessity for the anti- cavity affect.</li>
            <li> I find the tooth &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; form works way better.</li>
            <li> This is my family&#x27;s favorite brand of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You&#x27;ll be surpirsed how many organic companies have been bought and tainted.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Sodium Fluoride is used in most toothpastes, mouthwashes, dental varnish, dental preparations and nutritional supplements.</li>
            <li> Added to molten metal, sodium fluoride creates a more uniform metal.</li>
            <li> The CoQ10 is supposed to help maintain healthy gums, and the fluoride is supposed to help with tartar, etc.</li>
            <li> It was my mistake ordering this type of product as there are so many choices</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many of the Jason mouth products and recommend this toothpaste, too.</li>
            <li> Makes all the difference that it has not being tested on animals and has no animal ingredients, which is always GREAT and makes it environmentally responsible...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even better than Tom&#x27;s ever was.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste makes me love brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Not gonna lie, there are better tasting toothpastes out there</li>
            <li> but the reason I love it is because of the CoQ10.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love the taste and feel of it.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s ok with me.</li>
            <li> Feels so refreshing after brushing;</li>
            <li> The Desert Essence brands of Tea Tree oil toothpaste are much better than this one.</li>
            <li> clean, smooth &amp; whiter teeth!!</li>
            <li> Leaves your mouth clean, and it rinses away nicely.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;subtle.\\&quot; NOT!I think it has a very strong flavor, but that&#x27;s not that important to</li>
            <li> I gagged every time I used it... and because my boyfriend refused to use it as well, I ended up not being able to get rid of as quickly as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> Cleans well and has a pretty good ingredient deck though.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect because I couldn&#x27;t imagine precisely what cinnamon + tea tree would taste like, but my best description would be a cinnamon/clove-like flavor with a little eucalyptus/menthol on top of it (if that helps!).  </li>
            <li> The nice and natural clean feeling it leaves me with is great.</li>
            <li> I found the best price was on the single tube with subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> Makes your mouth feel SOOOOO clean!</li>
            <li> It leaves my teeth feeling really clean!  </li>
            <li> Great all natural tooth paste.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice the tea tree, which is probably a good thing.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about having to order toothpaste online, but it was absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li> the toothpaste is superb and leaves my mouth feeling cleaner than any other.</li>
            <li> The taste is very mild too.</li>
            <li> Love all their products, toothpaste is clean and painless.</li>
            <li> But I am also cavity prone, so I needed to find one with fluoride, which was not an easy task.  </li>
            <li> My teeth and gums feel so clean and healthy after using this.</li>
            <li> I like that it does not have a strong odor or taste</li>
            <li> Strong taste of cinnamon, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> No harsh chemicals just good healthy ingredients.</li>
            <li> Had to get used to the taste first, but I find it effective.</li>
            <li> Good oral health care without all the chemicals in many major brands of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Tastes fine</li>
            <li> but I do fine that the cap will not stay away from the toothpaste flow.</li>
            <li> Good and natural paste!</li>
            <li> This contains fluoride which has health hazards all its own - may want to rethink this brand if you are looking for truly healthy and natural toothpaste....skip the fluoride.</li>
            <li> I realized it was a huge mistake.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I enjoy it.  </li>
            <li> It is promoted as a tarter control, anti-cavity toothpaste get with CoQ10 in it, which is important to me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s SLS free, while still having fluoride.</li>
            <li> Shown to make people docile, obedient, lethargic, apathetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Guilt -free</li>
            <li> This stuff is fabulous.  </li>
            <li> Advertised as Fluoride free, is not..</li>
            <li> Why can&#x27;t toothpaste manufacturers make adult tothpaste in good flavors without the SLS?  </li>
            <li> Thanks for making it so I can eat spicy foods again!!!</li>
            <li> I love the tea tree oil, it leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean, without the mint burn.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Positives:  is anti-cavity, no sodium lauryl sulfate, no preservatives, no artificial coloring, no artificial sweeteners, no propylene glycol (!!).  </li>
            <li> I find this toothpaste tastes great and leaves my mouth feeling very clean without all of the sugar in other toothpastes.</li>
            <li> Fortunately Jason&#x27;s Healthy Mouth still tastes fresh, but mildly so.  </li>
            <li> I have found my new favorite toothpaste!  </li>
            <li> All you really want from a toothpaste is a mild abrasive, a bit of fluoride and a nice taste, anyway.</li>
            <li> It does the trick, keeps your mouth fresh!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it at first, but I&#x27;ve grown to be OK with it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s unique taste; it basically tastes the way tea tree smells.</li>
            <li> &quot; I&#x27;m surprised at how many people love the flavor and consider it \\&quot;mellow,\\</li>
            <li> My teeth feel as clean as ever</li>
            <li> Mouth feels really clean after using.</li>
            <li> fresh&amp;#34; feeling at the end, but it is a clean feeling</li>
            <li> Mouth feels clean and I like that it doesn&#x27;t have sulfates or parabens in it.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to, clean your teeth.</li>
            <li> It does make my mouth feel clean</li>
            <li> so it makes my mouth feel really clean</li>
            <li> If you do a google search and read about &#x27;SLS Allergy&#x27;, you will be surprised to find out how many people have issues with this chemical and still most of the toothpaste companies use it to make their toothpaste frothier.</li>
            <li> Leaves my teeth squeaky clean without causing sensitivity,</li>
            <li> Definitely the best I have used so far.</li>
            <li> Teeth come out clean and my breath smells like Christmas.</li>
            <li> But seems to get your teeth clean</li>
            <li> Nice mild cinnamon taste and smooth texture for a natural gel toothpaste.</li>
            <li> and I love it , my dentist loves it,  A tube lasts for ever it seems,  you use very little as it foams great ,  I go to the dentist every 3 months,  </li>
            <li> It tastes great without being very sweet and even though it&#x27;s more expensive than most toothpaste  </li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of the Sea Fresh Jason toothpaste, and decided to give this one a try.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s nice to find a natural brand that still has fluoride.    </li>
            <li> I have searched all over for a good cinnamon toothpaste as Crest or Colgate has fallen short in this.  </li>
            <li> Its so cool.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is a big tube and fair price.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural toothpaste that provides effective cleaning, in addition to freshening my breath.</li>
            <li> If this toothpaste did NOT contain Fluoride it would be a full 5 Stars.</li>
            <li> Not bad per se, but not a repeat product.</li>
            <li> Finally as an adult and able to choose my own products, I found that the \\&quot;hippie brands\\&quot; were much milder in flavor while still tasting fresh.  </li>
            <li> It leaves a clean, fresh feeling in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it because I have to, but it doesn&#x27;t make your teeth feel clean and fresh</li>
            <li> It leaves my mouth feeling so clean, it stays fresh for hours..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that it&#x27;s an unstable compound and deteriorates rather quickly, and I wonder whether it would stay stable in a toothpaste like this.</li>
            <li> The taste is mild.  </li>
            <li> So, after all these years of choosing my own natural toothpastes, this one is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for a NON-FLUORIDE, MORE NATURAL toothpaste, and this one is, but my teeth don&#x27;t feel as clean as they should after brushing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that it is more natural without some of the chemical additives that most commercial toothpastes contain.  </li>
            <li> Jason products seem to be pure and free from harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> This tooth paste will show up on a search for Fluoride Free toothpaste on Amazon, it isn&#x27;t fluoride free, it&#x27;s SLS free only.  </li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite toothpaste.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not crazy about the taste and would NOT say it \\&quot;doesn&#x27;t overload my taste</li>
            <li> This variety, with tea tree oil and cinnamon, is my favorite so far.  </li>
            <li> but many of these natural companies are eliminating it</li>
            <li> I had had some sensitive gums, but with the use of Jason&#x27;s toothpaste my gums are healthy and the sensitivity has disappeared.</li>
            <li> I am trying to use more natural products</li>
            <li> If you are prone to frequent canker sores, then SLS can aggravate the problem, but most SLS-free pastes on the market are chalky and some lack the protection of fluoride (</li>
            <li> Definitely better than anything in the market by far.</li>
            <li> or what, but Jason Healthy Mouth almost completely got rid of the problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried various gentle and organic toothpastes but they don&#x27;t seem to do as good a job cleaning.  </li>
            <li> We love that it is all natural and the company shares the beliefs that we stand for.</li>
            <li> It is a CLEAR GEL - no artificial colors!!!</li>
            <li> B004GW0WJM Desert Essence Natural Refreshing Tea Tree Oil Mouthwash -- 16 fl oz]].</li>
            <li> The results are fresh breath that lasts.  </li>
            <li> worth it.</li>
            <li> It gives your teeth a very smoth clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Makes your whole mouth taste clean and cuts through morning breath.  </li>
            <li> I have been experimenting with multiple different brands to find my perfect SLS free natural toothpaste and have been hooked on to Toms of Maine for past couple of years, which is quite good</li>
            <li> It supposedly more or less organic than most products</li>
            <li> This is probably about as natural as one can get to natural, unless you make your own.</li>
            <li> Never did I think it would leave such a clean feeling unlike most toothpastes,it really makes me feel</li>
            <li> years ago, I used to brush with Melaleuca cinnamon toothpaste (which is not really cinnamon flavored, more neutral), and when I went to the dentist for my semi-annual cleanings, he used to gush about how clean my teeth were.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s refreshing, makes my mouth clean, doesnt make my breakfast taste gross, can be used on acne, a little goes a long way and smells good too!</li>
            <li> something that I don&#x27;t mind tasting first thing in the morning.  </li>
            <li> and I love that it doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals like traditional toothpastes.</li>
            <li> Is there such a thing as healthy fluoride....</li>
            <li> and I feel better on the inside knowing its healthier to use than regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> I seem to be allergic to most tootpastes, either paste or gel, which leave my mouth stinging even after several rinses.  </li>
            <li> Be advised, I do not work for this company or have any stake in their success, but really wish I could run their marketing department.</li>
            <li> It definitely leaves teeth and gums feeling super clean and smelling fresh, plus it doesn&#x27;t contain any of the chemical junk found in mainstream toothpaste brands.</li>
            <li> The tea tree oil flavor is pretty yucky...</li>
            <li> I used to have problems with my gums, I read about this toothpaste and bought it, and i was surprise with the result, only a couple of day of using it I can feel my gums getting better..</li>
            <li> AND, I just checked some more info about it and recent research has shown no benefit from CoQ10 for periodontal disease.</li>
            <li> Tastes like listerine and Vicks Rub at first, but you get used to it.  </li>
            <li> After more than 3 months of continuous use, I noticed that my teeth weren&#x27;t as white as they used to be and that my gums were inflamed, swollen.</li>
            <li> /&gt;that actually makes my mouth feel better.  </li>
            <li> Like most of the other customers, I wanted to replace my toothpaste with a healthier and more natural one.  </li>
            <li> Good change from the normal mint and looking forward to trying the other flavors as well.</li>
            <li> As a periodontist, I see that people brush extremely hard with all of these abrasive toothpastes and with electric brushes and are getting more and more recession.</li>
            <li> Occasionally if I do get a sore because of too much acidic food, Jason Healthy Mouth gets rid of it in a day or two.</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t used to it the taste is different from traditional toothpaste, but it does a good job and seems to help with inflammation.</li>
            <li> I normally live cinnamon, but this tastes like some kind of strange medicine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like this toothpaste, simply because I don&#x27;t feel that my mouth is very clean after using it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love the flavor and I have to use a lot of this to get a long brushing session going.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to natural toothpastes that aren&#x27;t sweet and I like them.</li>
            <li> I tried it to see if it was better than others but unless paired with a mouthwash it doesnt give a fresh breath feeling (because of the odd flavor)</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied after reading the ingredients label when I was expecting something more natural, but those are hard to find these days.</li>
            <li> Going SLS-free will really help keep cankers sores away.</li>
            <li> I am very meticulous about oral hygiene.  </li>
            <li> I got this toothpaste initially because Jason is a cruelty free company</li>
            <li> The cinnamon is much milder than you&#x27;d think it would be, but you can still taste it in there.  </li>
            <li> This really suprised me.</li>
            <li> It doesn’t foam up much and it has an oily texture which takes some getting used to..</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s foams a bit much for my taste, though.  </li>
            <li> I really like it -</li>
            <li> Much cleaner than Crest Prohealth did.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I am a smoker, who is also really obsessive about my teeth</li>
            <li> I started using a baking soda and coconut oil mix, and my teeth and mouth look and feel so much</li>
            <li> Fluorosilicate (Na2SiF6) is primarily added to public drinking water as a fluoridation agent.</li>
            <li> It is a classified hazardous waste by-product of phosphate fertilizer manufacture which, if not put into our drinking water, must be disposed of at hazardous waste facilities.</li>
            <li> The flavor is pleasing and there are no unhealthy ingredients or food color.  </li>
            <li> (I really don&#x27;t taste the cinnamon...)  </li>
            <li> I doubt anyone trying it would really like it.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really use toothpaste for the taste.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use popular products because they are so harsh</li>
            <li> Many of these natural brands have been purchased by much larger corporations and products have changed.  </li>
            <li> Amazon was kind enough to take it back.</li>
            <li> I used to be a Tom&#x27;s of Maine user, but when the company got bought out they apparently changed the recipe and it became way too sweet for me.</li>
            <li> but honestly it reminds me of Listerine, without feeling so harsh.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soooooo much better than the Abe&#x27;s &#x27;natural&#x27; toothpastes which seem so unnatural when reading their extensive chemical ingredients (then, the say they are &amp;#34;naturally processed&amp;#34; chemicals).  </li>
            <li> Yes, I will get many dislikes from this review, but I completely blame myself for buying this product without proper examining at the label which state it contains fluoride.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste does not contain harmful ingredients, all natural !!!</li>
            <li> Make sure you buy this one and not the other one Jason makes without fluoride though.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a better price online that other brands in person.</li>
            <li> I was glad to find a cruelty-free product with fluoride, in addition to Tom&#x27;s, which other family members also use and like.  </li>
            <li> Last week I went back to my good old Crest 3d white luxe (I&#x27;m glad I did despite the ingredients because my teeth are back in shape again).</li>
            <li> it does not feel as clean as a regular toothpaste, but it is not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> I hate super minty toothpaste so this is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic and is antimicrobial; both real pluses in a toothpaste!</li>
            <li> B001T8MTWO Jason Healthy Mouth Plus CoQ10 Fluoride Gel Toothpaste, Tea Tree, Cinnamon, 6 Ounce]] has a slight minty flavor, not overpowering at all.  </li>
            <li> Does a decent job for toothpaste.</li>
            <li> For this particular toothpaste, the flavor is an acquired taste.</li>
            <li> In the future I might try a different flavor of Jason toothpaste to see if that’s any better.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this brand of toothpaste without sls as it definitely helps reduce the number of canker sores I would frequently get.  </li>
            <li> This is decent toothpaste</li>
            <li> I bought a tube of Jason cinnamon tea tree in my continuing quest to find a decent replacement and I was amazed.</li>
            <li> So far this has been the first natural toothpaste that&#x27;s managed to get (and keep) my teeth as clean as my regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this stuff.</li>
            <li> I like many people have a very strong sensitivity to artificial sweeteners.</li>
            <li> I really like it for my sensitive teeth, so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie, I don&#x27;t always really care if my toothpaste is all natural.</li>
            <li> This defeats the whole purpose of natural toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I normally don&#x27;t use a lot anyway.</li>
            <li> I love the short, natural ingredient list, especially being SLS-free.</li>
            <li> After a few uses, it became more tolerable.</li>
            <li> Love that it doesn&#x27;t use harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> Added to toothpaste, it has a remarkable effect on sensitive gums which is a common complaint of many people.</li>
            <li> After using this for a few weeks, I was all better.</li>
            <li> On the positive side, at least the menthol doesn&#x27;t linger really long like conventional toothpaste mint does, and being SLS free, eating and drinking after using this remains a pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> THIS TOOTH PASTE CONTAINS FLUORIDE but is free of many other harsh chemicals</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband who hates trying anything new, but will do it for me.</li>
            <li> Going back to old Sea Fresh, throwing this one away.</li>
            <li> No need to use \\&quot;globs\\&quot; of toothpaste with this to clean your teeth, and unlike the previous reviewer, I really like the flavors.</li>
            <li> Another plus, the price on Amazon is much cheaper than that of Whole Foods a big bonus for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using Jason toothpaste for several years - this new formula is a first for me, but I do like it.</li>
            <li> As with most every product, there is a bit of marketing puffery here - the purported benefits of tea tree oil in oral care products are unsubstantiated, and I suspect the claims for other ingredients are similarly overreaching.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;In point of fact, fluoride causes more human cancer death, and causes it faster than any other chemical.&amp;#34;--Dean Burk -- Congressional Record 21 July 1976.</li>
            <li> Since I have been pleased with Jason products, in the past, I decided to give this a whirl.</li>
            <li> Man, this stuff tastes so weird, but it defiantly is more clean feeling throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I like the other Jason tooth paste but not this one plus my teeth do not feel clean after brushing them thoroughly.</li>
            <li> It does get a little overly foamy for my tastes and leaves my mouth feeling slightly dry, but otherwise, it&#x27;s a nice toothpaste that cleans well.  </li>
            <li> During my last dental cleaning, my dentist commented on how healthy my gums looked, and I attribute it to the active ingredients in this paste!</li>
            <li> It was bought by Hain Celestial Group - one of the large corporations in food and personal care.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the taste compared to &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; toothpaste, but we were pleasantly surprised that it was actually quite refreshing and an easy transition.</li>
            <li> Tastes great and never feels artificial</li>
            <li> One natural brand of toothpaste changed into just another mint explosion, enough so that I had to brush my teeth with just water when I had a migraine because it tasted too much.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this toothpaste for a couple of days, but I really like it so far.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, it was quite upsetting to me when my teeth developed stains.  </li>
            <li> but I found that if I brush 2, 3 , or even 4 times a day with this product they seem to stay away or not be as frequent.</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil has a very distinctive fragrance &amp; flavor, but they&#x27;ve used just enough in this toothpaste that you have to think about it to notice it in there.  </li>
            <li> I had been looking for a non-peppermint toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t contain SLS (I have sensitive mucosa and am prone to ulcers) but that does contain fluoride (I don&#x27;t want decay).  </li>
            <li> Searched Amazon and Natural Food Stores online and decided on this because of its reviews.  </li>
            <li> And being &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; is no guarantee of complete safety, but there&#x27;s still probably nothing here that will kill you.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s back to fluoride for me, thanks.  </li>
            <li> i like that it is a natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I ordered this toothpaste because I like all -natural, and organic.</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive teeth and this has not bothered my teeth at all.  </li>
            <li> and I really like that it has tea tree essential oil in it because it has both anti-viral and anti-bacterial properties.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural toothpaste that contained fluoride and found this.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothpaste because I seem to have developed problems with the ingrediant Sodium Larel Sulfate, which is in all toothpaste.</li>
            <li> He has sensitive teeth and gums and saw improvement with this product.</li>
            <li> This toothpase is a soft gel</li>
            <li> I bought this because my dentist recommended I try a SLS free toothpaste due to gum irritation from regular pastes.  </li>
            <li> (So important to those of us who suffer extreme GI duress when FD&amp;C Blue 1 is used</li>
            <li> Though, I have heard some negative comments about fluoride, my sense is that everything in moderation (no extreme amounts of anything in your system) is actually safe.</li>
            <li> I would use it more often if it tasted better and it was less expensive.</li>
            <li> I developed SLS allergy a few years ago and get soles all over my mouth if I use any regular toothpaste available these days.</li>
            <li> whatever the dentists call it where my tongue was constantly in pain from using normal tooth paste.</li>
            <li> My entire family agrees that this is now our new toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Its definitely all natural.</li>
            <li> Natural Toothpaste&lt;br /&gt;It cleans your mouth entirely.</li>
            <li> You have to call the Poison Control Center if your child has ingested too much, labeled on toothpaste tubes.  </li>
            <li> with thin,  sensitive gums need is strong stinging peppermint.  </li>
            <li> I really like the gel-like consistency; it doesn&#x27;t get clumpy like some other SLS-free pastes.  </li>
            <li> In my constant efforts to find and buy natural toothpaste, I think I have finally found a winner.</li>
            <li> If you are not careful, the cap keeps closing back onto the paste as you put it on your brush.</li>
            <li> Amazon sells it for much cheaper price compared to regular stores and its much harder to find it at your regular store.</li>
            <li> I brushed with fluoride-free paste for a few years, and then got the first fillings I&#x27;ve ever had, so</li>
            <li> Not only do I not have to worry about getting sick from their product, it tastes amazing!</li>
            <li> it is not your typical white or blue color, but knowing it is all natural and has no colorants or artificial fragrances, makes me feel so good.  </li>
            <li> On top of all of that I&#x27;m not worried about breaking down my enamul with harsh whitening chemicals from other drug store brand names.</li>
            <li> The taste isn&#x27;t bad, the function is good...</li>
            <li> IT DID NOT GET SHORT HAIRS,  JUST LONG ONES.</li>
            <li> so I am going to assume that this product will last a long time</li>
            <li> trust me, it will last just as long!</li>
            <li> My tooth sensitivity seemed to disappear after starting this toothpaste, but I have to deduct a star for the dry mouth</li>
            <li> I will continue to do so for as long as it is manufactured.</li>
            <li> this stuff foams up different then other Jason tooth paistes,a very small amount creates alot of lather,which i like...saves on how much you need to use!</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t care as long as it cleans my teeth.</li>
            <li> I have problems with dry mouth, and my Ear, Nose, and Throat doctor suggested I try a toothpaste without SLS.  </li>
            <li> flavor is very subtle but it leaves your mouth fresh for quite a while afterwards.</li>
            <li> This tooth-gel (not paste) tastes like some kind of crap a traditional healer might smear on you to treat a burn.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste has a weird color, consistency, and flavor, but I kept myself to trying it for at least two weeks to see how my mouth liked it.  </li>
            <li> This is very confusing when you first look for the product.  </li>
            <li> and I only need to use a little bit on my toothbrush, about a pea size, so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The flavor combination is really gross, and it leaves a really odd taste in my mouth, as if I had just chewed up and spit out a clove cigarette...</li>
            <li> I usually bought either Jason&#x27;s Healthy Mouth or Tom&#x27;s of Maine, sometimes a random brand that intrigued me.    </li>
            <li> I put the mouthwash in a small sprayer pump to make it last a long long time.  </li>
            <li> and you only need a little bit on the tooth brush</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have dry mouth in the morning due</li>
            <li> bad breath with mint over the top ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for at least 6 months now, and 3 of my front teeth have developed stains, which has never happened to me before.  </li>
            <li> I can buy crest or any other toxic mess at the local market .</li>
            <li> Finally a toothpaste without SLS that is not strong peppermint flavor.  </li>
            <li> Other than that hassle</li>
            <li> I have tried and like other varieties of JASON toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Will buy this and other Jason products again.</li>
            <li> but it takes a bit of getting used to due to</li>
            <li> Other industrial uses for sodium fluoride include glass frosting and wood preservatives.</li>
            <li> Other names for it are hexafluorosilicic, hexafluosilicic, hydrofluosilicic, and silicofluoric acid.  </li>
            <li> Other names for it are Sodium Fluosilicate and Sodium Silica</li>
            <li> In other words, it&#x27;s gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Toothpaste products with this ingredient are few, so the choices are limited, but this one is time tested.</li>
            <li> I drink orange juice religiously every morning and hate the way it tastes after you brush your teeth, but this product has a mellow minty tatse and leaves your mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Not worth</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t awful, but it isn&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be good, but tastes horrible.  </li>
            <li> , I like the taste of the tea tree component and its not sweet, like that too.</li>
            <li> It is not sweet, but soothing.</li>
            <li> The taste of this toothpaste is a little bit like cinnamon</li>
            <li> Been using for a few months</li>
            <li> What a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Although the package describes the flavor as cinnamon and tea tree oil, it&#x27;s quite heavy on the clove.</li>
            <li> There are a few million people who need to know about this stuff.</li>
            <li> It turns into a crazy almost old school shaving cream foam that seems to leave my teeth feeling cleaner than other toothpastes</li>
            <li> Purchased by mistake; I am leaving a negative feedback, due to the Fluoride.</li>
            <li> There is nothing minty about it (despite the box conveying that flavor), it seriously tastes like pumpkin pie uncooked.</li>
            <li> It is consistent and a bad design.</li>
            <li> The foaming makes me wonder what they put in there because usually stuff doesn&#x27;t foam a lot naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Jason doesn&#x27;t foam up excessively.</li>
            <li> I was not sure if I would like the taste of tea tree</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s free from all the harmful preservatives, artificial colors, artificial sweeteners, and is gluten-free.</li>
            <li> IT WAS HARD TO USE AS DIRECTED.  </li>
            <li> I got to the dentist semi-annually and brush twice a day and floss at least once a day.  </li>
            <li> However, this toothpaste is not effective at keeping stains away and I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fluorosilicic acid (H2SiF6) is commonly used for water fluoridation.  </li>
            <li> I looked around in stores only to find that their &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; option still has artificial</li>
            <li> I was worried the taste would be very unpleasant, but it was actually very bearable.</li>
            <li> Since I brush my teeth at least twice a day, I had a hard time understanding why I had to suffer from gum disease which is linked to poor oral hygiene.  </li>
            <li> My mother suffers from dry mouth</li>
            <li> It is also a very thick gel and is hard to get out of the tube.</li>
            <li> I was actually considering buying this toothpaste till I saw it contains fluoride. :(</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, the taste of it was terrible.</li>
            <li> I used to get sores in my mouth all the time, which were painful and took a long time to heal.&lt;br /&gt;Doctors and dentists said they were caused by a virus, not by what I was eating.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Tired of the flavor.</li>
            <li> Nobody could get behind it.  </li>
            <li> Poor quality taste, foaming, and effectiveness all around.</li>
            <li> I like the ingredient list but as far as taste OMG is this one horrible.</li>
            <li> Maybe my taste buds aren&#x27;t cooperating, but I don&#x27;t get any of the non-menthol flavor and am a little disappointed in that.</li>
            <li> The clove and cinnamon taste is not overpowering and merely compliments the mint.</li>
            <li> Has weird taste.  </li>
            <li> Not a wonderful taste but not offensive.  </li>
            <li> This stuff foams up like crazy</li>
            <li> artificial flavors</li>
            <li> artificial sweeteners&lt;</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve hated, hated, hated a mint explosion in my mouth when I brushed my teeth.  </li>
            <li> In a bad way.</li>
            <li> Disappointed, will not buy again.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is the worst, it has a horrible taste and hardly foams up.</li>
            <li> I had used Desert Essence before and should have gotten that again, this one is a real disappointment.</li>
            <li> Tastes terrible.  </li>
            <li> the taste is terrible.</li>
            <li> NASTY!</li>
            <li> /&gt;NO ARTIFICIAL COLORS!!!</li>
            <li> This is the worst tasting toothpaste I have ever tried.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good and natural paste!</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it every day.  I have periodontal disease and Jason products seem to be pure and free from harmful chemicals. I can&#x27;t use popular products because they are so harsh so I use non whitening tooth paste and I am glad you carry this.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is great with a sonic electric toothbrush. It turns into a crazy almost old school shaving cream foam that seems to leave my teeth feeling cleaner than other toothpastes and I don&#x27;t have dry mouth in the morning due I think to the aloe in the product. My favorite toothpaste and it has a great taste as well. Make sure you buy this one and not the other one Jason makes without fluoride though.</li>
            <li> good texture and can feel fluoride protecting teeth</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste. It leaves a clean, fresh feeling in your mouth. It is healthy and does not burn your gums. I have purchased and used this product for many years. I will continue to do so for as long as it is manufactured.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s spendy but a tube lasts me about a year.  I really like it for my sensitive teeth, so I will buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite toothpaste. I drink orange juice religiously every morning and hate the way it tastes after you brush your teeth, but this product has a mellow minty tatse and leaves your mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> I have been using Jason toothpaste for several years - this new formula is a first for me, but I do like it.</li>
            <li> You have to get used to the flavor. Its definitely all natural. It does the trick, keeps your mouth fresh!</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of the Sea Fresh Jason toothpaste, and decided to give this one a try. The flavor combination is really gross, and it leaves a really odd taste in my mouth, as if I had just chewed up and spit out a clove cigarette...&lt;br /&gt;I used it for three days, and had to give up because I could not bear it, and I felt that my teeth health was in jeopardy...disappointed. Going back to old Sea Fresh, throwing this one away.</li>
            <li> Fluoride is know  to cause brain damage and it is a known toxin. It is poisonous. It is used in rat poison and in pesticides. It accumulates in the body.  I was actually considering buying this toothpaste till I saw it contains fluoride. :( Do your own research people. Hopefully this company makes also a  \\&quot;healthy\\&quot; toothpaste, one that does not have any known toxins for ingredients.</li>
            <li> Tastes terrible.  Yuck.  Does a decent job for toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Going SLS-free will really help keep cankers sores away. I have been using a different SLS-free brand but since this one was cheaper at the store, I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not crazy about the taste and would NOT say it \\&quot;doesn&#x27;t overload my taste buds.\\&quot; I&#x27;m surprised at how many people love the flavor and consider it \\&quot;mellow,\\&quot; \\&quot;mild,\\&quot; and \\&quot;subtle.\\&quot; NOT!I think it has a very strong flavor, but that&#x27;s not that important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It foams A LOT! I definitely had to cut back on the amount I put on my toothbrush and I normally don&#x27;t use a lot anyway. The foaming makes me wonder what they put in there because usually stuff doesn&#x27;t foam a lot naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot rate its effectiveness as to cavity prevention or whiteness, but it is a good choice to avoid canker sores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all I brush with.</li>
            <li> refeshing to not have to pick between cinnamon and mint!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for at least 6 months now, and 3 of my front teeth have developed stains, which has never happened to me before.  I got to the dentist semi-annually and brush twice a day and floss at least once a day.  I am very meticulous about oral hygiene.  Therefore, it was quite upsetting to me when my teeth developed stains.  I got this toothpaste initially because Jason is a cruelty free company and I like to support companies that don&#x27;t test on animals.  However, this toothpaste is not effective at keeping stains away and I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> In my constant efforts to find and buy natural toothpaste, I think I have finally found a winner. I was a big user of the Kiss My Face brand, until I discovered this one. No need to use \\&quot;globs\\&quot; of toothpaste with this to clean your teeth, and unlike the previous reviewer, I really like the flavors. This is probably about as natural as one can get to natural, unless you make your own. Another plus, the price on Amazon is much cheaper than that of Whole Foods a big bonus for me. My entire family agrees that this is now our new toothpaste. Try it for your self and see!</li>
            <li> I have a problem with canker sores. I am not saying this will get rid of them but I found that if I brush 2, 3 , or even 4 times a day with this product they seem to stay away or not be as frequent. Tastes fine and I think it is very good for my mouth.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve hated, hated, hated a mint explosion in my mouth when I brushed my teeth.  Finally as an adult and able to choose my own products, I found that the \\&quot;hippie brands\\&quot; were much milder in flavor while still tasting fresh.  I usually bought either Jason&#x27;s Healthy Mouth or Tom&#x27;s of Maine, sometimes a random brand that intrigued me.    Fast-forward about 20 years.  Many of these natural brands have been purchased by much larger corporations and products have changed.  One natural brand of toothpaste changed into just another mint explosion, enough so that I had to brush my teeth with just water when I had a migraine because it tasted too much.  Ack!  It got added to the \\&quot;do not buy\\&quot; list and I threw it out as soon as I got an acceptable tube again.    Fortunately Jason&#x27;s Healthy Mouth still tastes fresh, but mildly so.  This variety, with tea tree oil and cinnamon, is my favorite so far.  The cinnamon is much milder than you&#x27;d think it would be, but you can still taste it in there.  Tea tree oil has a very distinctive fragrance &amp; flavor, but they&#x27;ve used just enough in this toothpaste that you have to think about it to notice it in there.  It has a very nice flavor, and seeing as how I was raised with fluoride in my toothpaste but many of these natural companies are eliminating it, it&#x27;s nice to find a natural brand that still has fluoride.    So, after all these years of choosing my own natural toothpastes, this one is by far my favorite.  If anyone from Jason&#x27;s every reads this, thank you for keeping your formulas!  If you&#x27;ve been purchased by a megacorporation, I sure can&#x27;t tell.</li>
            <li> I love this brand and bought this flavor on a whim... Good lord the taste is terrible. I gagged every time I used it... and because my boyfriend refused to use it as well, I ended up not being able to get rid of as quickly as I would have liked. I will never get this flavor again... I&#x27;ll stick with mint.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this toothpaste for a couple of days, but I really like it so far.  I had been looking for a non-peppermint toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t contain SLS (I have sensitive mucosa and am prone to ulcers) but that does contain fluoride (I don&#x27;t want decay).  This fits the bill.  I really like the gel-like consistency; it doesn&#x27;t get clumpy like some other SLS-free pastes.  I also like the flavor.  I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect because I couldn&#x27;t imagine precisely what cinnamon + tea tree would taste like, but my best description would be a cinnamon/clove-like flavor with a little eucalyptus/menthol on top of it (if that helps!).  Definitely not overpowering, and something that I don&#x27;t mind tasting first thing in the morning.  In fact, I enjoy it.  It does get a little overly foamy for my tastes and leaves my mouth feeling slightly dry, but otherwise, it&#x27;s a nice toothpaste that cleans well.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste may be made from good ingredients, but the taste is not to my liking.  I also have to avoid pepermint, and SLS.  Why can&#x27;t toothpaste manufacturers make adult tothpaste in good flavors without the SLS?  Disappointed, will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I use Jason&#x27;s and only it but I do fine that the cap will not stay away from the toothpaste flow. If you are not careful, the cap keeps closing back onto the paste as you put it on your brush. This happens starting about halfway through the tube&#x27;s use. It is consistent and a bad design. Other than that hassle the toothpaste is superb and leaves my mouth feeling cleaner than any other.</li>
            <li> Purchased by mistake; I am leaving a negative feedback, due to the Fluoride. Fluoride is a biological weapon being used to enslave the masses.</li>
            <li> this stuff foams up different then other Jason tooth paistes,a very small amount creates alot of lather,which i like...saves on how much you need to use!</li>
            <li> I like that it does not have a strong odor or taste</li>
            <li> Yummy flavor. So far this has been the first natural toothpaste that&#x27;s managed to get (and keep) my teeth as clean as my regular toothpaste. This might actually become my regular!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flavor is very subtle but it leaves your mouth fresh for quite a while afterwards. The clove and cinnamon taste is not overpowering and merely compliments the mint.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste. My teeth feel as clean as ever and I love that it doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals like traditional toothpastes. The taste is very mild too.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.  I had had some sensitive gums, but with the use of Jason&#x27;s toothpaste my gums are healthy and the sensitivity has disappeared.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the taste compared to &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; toothpaste, but we were pleasantly surprised that it was actually quite refreshing and an easy transition.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is a good alternative to the toothpastes that are out on the market. After brushing with the toothpaste, my mouth feel cleaner and more healthy.</li>
            <li> Whatever else it did at the microbial level for my teeth, I dread every morning having to put this stuff in my mouth. There is nothing minty about it (despite the box conveying that flavor), it seriously tastes like pumpkin pie uncooked.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not mint so I can use it while using homeopathics. Mouth feels really clean after using. Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have tried and like other varieties of JASON toothpaste. I love the short, natural ingredient list, especially being SLS-free. For this particular toothpaste, the flavor is an acquired taste. I didn&#x27;t like it at first, but I&#x27;ve grown to be OK with it. It doesn&#x27;t leave that &amp;#34;minty fresh&amp;#34; feeling at the end, but it is a clean feeling and I do think it actually lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> I have searched all over for a good cinnamon toothpaste as Crest or Colgate has fallen short in this.  Searched Amazon and Natural Food Stores online and decided on this because of its reviews.  I was leary of the comments on flavor, but this is outstanding! Not too much cinnamon and the tea tree oil gives it a wonderful, refreshing taste. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use anything else!</li>
            <li> Been using for a few months and I love it , my dentist loves it,  A tube lasts for ever it seems,  you use very little as it foams great ,  I go to the dentist every 3 months,  I&#x27;m almost 60 and still have all my teeth,  never have had anything pulled, I even have all my wisdom molars,  and I trust this stuff to keep them there for another 60,  LOL</li>
            <li> This really suprised me. I get my toothpaste and its organic and in lighter and smaller print it has fluoride. What a waste of time and money. I can buy crest or any other toxic mess at the local market . Is there such a thing as healthy fluoride....NO!&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my dentist recommended I try a SLS free toothpaste due to gum irritation from regular pastes.  I&#x27;ve been using it because I have to, but it doesn&#x27;t make your teeth feel clean and fresh and it has a medicinal taste.</li>
            <li> The taste isn&#x27;t bad, the function is good... wished I could feel a bit more grittiness thought. It does seem to work well.</li>
            <li> Not listed this was fluoride toothpaste conspicuously enough, ended up giving away, Be specific, customers should not have to guess.</li>
            <li> Love all their products, toothpaste is clean and painless.</li>
            <li> Love the flavor. Mouth feels clean and I like that it doesn&#x27;t have sulfates or parabens in it. We will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Natural Toothpaste&lt;br /&gt;It cleans your mouth entirely. But you may need to use many times to cure gum bleeding and infection. Over all, recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like it. The foam is great. Its so cool. And I like the taste. I will buy for next one.</li>
            <li> We like this one and one of its JASON cinnamon-clove cousins. Good oral health care without all the chemicals in many major brands of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I like the ingredient list but as far as taste OMG is this one horrible. I emailed the company and no response. What a customer service joke.</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste ever!! It leaves my mouth feeling so clean, it stays fresh for hours.. Also no morning breath when I use this. My mother suffers from dry mouth and she&#x27;s noticed that improved after one use of this toothpaste. I will be buying more. I hope they never stop making it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve subscribed to this stuff for a reason!.. well many reasons. It&#x27;s refreshing, makes my mouth clean, doesnt make my breakfast taste gross, can be used on acne, a little goes a long way and smells good too! On top of all of that I&#x27;m not worried about breaking down my enamul with harsh whitening chemicals from other drug store brand names. But even without the whitening factor, people think I&#x27;ve whitened my teeth and all O&#x27;ve done is use this toothpaste!</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s organic. Smells good. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to, clean your teeth. Seems to be a better price online that other brands in person.</li>
            <li> I am trying to use more natural products so I thought I would give this toothpaste a try. The first time I used it, the taste of it was terrible. After a few uses, it became more tolerable. It does make my mouth feel clean and I feel better on the inside knowing its healthier to use than regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I will probably buy this again as it&#x27;s the combination of no SLS but still having fluoride that I was looking for. I didn&#x27;t expect it to taste quite as minty as it does, though, having missed the menthol in the ingredients list while shopping online. I was hoping for more cinnamon. Maybe my taste buds aren&#x27;t cooperating, but I don&#x27;t get any of the non-menthol flavor and am a little disappointed in that. On the positive side, at least the menthol doesn&#x27;t linger really long like conventional toothpaste mint does, and being SLS free, eating and drinking after using this remains a pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> I was worried the taste would be very unpleasant, but it was actually very bearable. I wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied after reading the ingredients label when I was expecting something more natural, but those are hard to find these days. In any case, it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I am a dental hygienist, and this is what I use at home. If you are prone to frequent canker sores, then SLS can aggravate the problem, but most SLS-free pastes on the market are chalky and some lack the protection of fluoride (i.e. some Tom&#x27;s of Maine products). As with most every product, there is a bit of marketing puffery here - the purported benefits of tea tree oil in oral care products are unsubstantiated, and I suspect the claims for other ingredients are similarly overreaching. And being &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; is no guarantee of complete safety, but there&#x27;s still probably nothing here that will kill you. All you really want from a toothpaste is a mild abrasive, a bit of fluoride and a nice taste, anyway. This has a very mild cinnamon/aloe flavor that won&#x27;t foul up your dinner if you are brushing up before heading out for a nice meal.  It&#x27;s simple and it works.</li>
            <li> This contains fluoride which has health hazards all its own - may want to rethink this brand if you are looking for truly healthy and natural toothpaste....skip the fluoride.</li>
            <li> The taste of this toothpaste is a little bit like cinnamon but I wouldn’t describe it as pleasant tasting. However, you do get used to the taste the more you use it. It doesn’t foam up much and it has an oily texture which takes some getting used to.. I use it when I have a canker sore and for that it’s good because it doesn’t agitate the sore. The rest of the time I use regular toothpaste. I would use it more often if it tasted better and it was less expensive. In the future I might try a different flavor of Jason toothpaste to see if that’s any better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love the flavor and I have to use a lot of this to get a long brushing session going. Or, I have to add on more during the brushing. I don&#x27;t love that there isn&#x27;t fluoride since fluoride has been working for me all these years.</li>
            <li> Great taste, non-minty and very cinnamony.  I brushed with fluoride-free paste for a few years, and then got the first fillings I&#x27;ve ever had, so it&#x27;s back to fluoride for me, thanks.  I was glad to find a cruelty-free product with fluoride, in addition to Tom&#x27;s, which other family members also use and like.  Tom&#x27;s foams a bit much for my taste, though.  Jason doesn&#x27;t foam up excessively.</li>
            <li> I love that it is more natural without some of the chemical additives that most commercial toothpastes contain.  I like the Tea Tree and Cinnamon taste in your mouth.  I would recommend this to others.  Does a good job cleaning.  Remember to Floss only those teeth that you wish to keep.</li>
            <li> Man, this stuff tastes so weird, but it defiantly is more clean feeling throughout the day. It supposedly more or less organic than most products but I don&#x27;t care as long as it cleans my teeth. I tried it to see if it was better than others but unless paired with a mouthwash it doesnt give a fresh breath feeling (because of the odd flavor)</li>
            <li> I thought it would make a difference at my check up and it didn&#x27;t, I like the taste of the tea tree component and its not sweet, like that too.</li>
            <li> Even my husband likes this toothpaste, &amp; he&#x27;s picky about toothpaste. It gives your teeth a very smoth clean feeling. The taste is good &amp; i like that it is a natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent natural toothpaste gel, with a tea tree and cinnamon flavor. I like the Jason brand toothpastes and this is the one I&#x27;ve bought most often. It is a gel, not a paste. I like the consistency and I only need to use a little bit on my toothbrush, about a pea size, so it lasts a long time. It is promoted as a tarter control, anti-cavity toothpaste get with CoQ10 in it, which is important to me. Tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic and is antimicrobial; both real pluses in a toothpaste! It&#x27;s free from all the harmful preservatives, artificial colors, artificial sweeteners, and is gluten-free. I highly recommend this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly good - was uncertain abut using a gel but it foams up nicely and works great!</li>
            <li> I hate super minty toothpaste so this is perfect for me. Makes your mouth feel SOOOOO clean! Buy it!! .</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t stand mint of any kind so looking for something else.  Nice alternative to mints.&lt;br /&gt;kills the morning breath with no cover up scent....bad breath with mint over the top ... NASTY!</li>
            <li> Tastes perfectly fine to me, but I didn&#x27;t buy it to taste good. It&#x27;s SLS free, while still having fluoride. I think that&#x27;s a great combination.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel great after brushing and mouth feels fresh. Got auto-ship. This is definitely my toothpaste. It is not sweet, but soothing.</li>
            <li> I have problems with dry mouth, and my Ear, Nose, and Throat doctor suggested I try a toothpaste without SLS.  But I am also cavity prone, so I needed to find one with fluoride, which was not an easy task.  This one fits the bill.  I think it tastes like clove, rather than cinnamon, but I like the taste of clove, so that was no problem.  In fact, I wouldn&#x27;t have minded if it had an even stronger clove flavor to it!  The gel really foams up, a bit more than I prefer, but all in all I am happy with the product and will probably purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Great all natural tooth paste. Love that it doesn&#x27;t use harsh chemicals. I use in combination with the same brand mouthwash so it makes my mouth feel really clean</li>
            <li> I enjoy this brand of toothpaste without sls as it definitely helps reduce the number of canker sores I would frequently get.  This is the gel and I prefer paste.  I do recommend it if you get canker sores.  I still make sure and rinse 2-3 times to rid myself of any toothpaste residue.</li>
            <li> good tayste and effect. thanks!</li>
            <li> I developed SLS allergy a few years ago and get soles all over my mouth if I use any regular toothpaste available these days. If you do a google search and read about &#x27;SLS Allergy&#x27;, you will be surprised to find out how many people have issues with this chemical and still most of the toothpaste companies use it to make their toothpaste frothier. I have been experimenting with multiple different brands to find my perfect SLS free natural toothpaste and have been hooked on to Toms of Maine for past couple of years, which is quite good but I think I have finally found a winner. The flavor is amazing, lasts longer than others I have tried and the best part is, it&#x27;s probably the most natural toothpaste you can find in market these days (Atleast from my experience) .  Amazon sells it for much cheaper price compared to regular stores and its much harder to find it at your regular store. Try it once, I can assure you, it won&#x27;t disappoint you!</li>
            <li> Very fresh taste, freshens breath better than mouthwash along with some whitening!  I would recommend this toothpaste.  I have been buying this toothpaste for years.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I have practically stopped my gum disease.  Amazon has the best price on this product.</li>
            <li> Did not control my tarter...taste good</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste without all the sweetness of the majority of others out on the market. Leaves my teeth squeaky clean without causing sensitivity,</li>
            <li> Jason makes good products.  This toothpaste is a big tube and fair price.  Will buy this and other Jason products again.</li>
            <li> Makes your whole mouth taste clean and cuts through morning breath.  Definitely better than anything in the market by far.</li>
            <li> We like the cinnamon better.</li>
            <li> What a gross flavor! I like the other Jason tooth paste but not this one plus my teeth do not feel clean after brushing them thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Nice product. Although the package describes the flavor as cinnamon and tea tree oil, it&#x27;s quite heavy on the clove.</li>
            <li> excellent taste and price. I really like it - the taste is good (I like cinnamon a lot) and it lathers a bit too :)</li>
            <li> Wow! I ordered this toothpaste because I like all -natural, and organic. Never did I think it would leave such a clean feeling unlike most toothpastes,it really makes me feel like I &#x27;ve just had a cleaning at the dentist! After just two days of using this product, I can see and feel a remarkable difference in my teeth and gums. Give this a try and you won &#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> I used to get sores in my mouth all the time, which were painful and took a long time to heal.&lt;br /&gt;Doctors and dentists said they were caused by a virus, not by what I was eating.&lt;br /&gt;I was given a sample of this toothpaste about a decade ago. I don&#x27;t know if it is the tea tree&lt;br /&gt;oil or what, but Jason Healthy Mouth almost completely got rid of the problem. Occasionally if I do get a sore because of too much acidic food, Jason Healthy Mouth gets rid of it in a day or two. An EXCELLENT&lt;br /&gt;PRODUCT!!! I use nothing else and if there were 100 stars, it would get them all. Mary</li>
            <li> It soooo doesn&#x27;t taste like baking soda.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste!  It leaves my teeth feeling really clean!  Much cleaner than Crest Prohealth did.  I also have sensitive teeth and this has not bothered my teeth at all.  I recently realized how many chemicals are in all of my household and self care products, so I was really happy to find one with ingredients I recognize that works so well!  Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I seem to be allergic to most tootpastes, either paste or gel, which leave my mouth stinging even after several rinses.  I&#x27;ve tried various gentle and organic toothpastes but they don&#x27;t seem to do as good a job cleaning.  The Jason Healthy Mouth toothpaste does a good job cleaning, yet doesn&#x27;t sting at all.  Plus it tastes good and leaves my breath fresh.  Five stars.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best toothpaste I have ever used, and I have tried a lot of these brand name alternatives. This one contains cinannamon, tea tree oil and coq10, one of the best formulations on the market. After just one tube, I know I will never use another big name brand toothpaste ever again. I am a smoker, who is also really obsessive about my teeth (oh, the irony) and this toothpaste is amazing.</li>
            <li> I like this toothpaste but it takes a bit of getting used to due to it&#x27;s unique taste; it basically tastes the way tea tree smells. Not minty at all. Cleans well and has a pretty good ingredient deck though. After using the toothpaste I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again. Tired of the flavor.</li>
            <li> Love this because it is not abrasive like most all toothpastes are now (since they want to have a whitening effect). I had been looking for a good gel toothpaste for a while that I could recommend my patients. As a periodontist, I see that people brush extremely hard with all of these abrasive toothpastes and with electric brushes and are getting more and more recession. I also love that this paste has fluoride which is a necessity for the anti- cavity affect.</li>
            <li> IT WAS HARD TO USE AS DIRECTED.  IT DID NOT GET SHORT HAIRS,  JUST LONG ONES. THE ONES IT DID GET, IT HURT.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;In point of fact, fluoride causes more human cancer death, and causes it faster than any other chemical.&amp;#34;--Dean Burk -- Congressional Record 21 July 1976.</li>
            <li> Note this is the gel form and not the paste.  I find the tooth &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; form works way better.</li>
            <li> Nice mild cinnamon taste and smooth texture for a natural gel toothpaste. Will order again.</li>
            <li> This is decent toothpaste and I really like that it has tea tree essential oil in it because it has both anti-viral and anti-bacterial properties.</li>
            <li> It feels diluted to my taste, almost no aroma, brown gel. I am using it but I would like to have fresher aftertaste.</li>
            <li> This is my family&#x27;s favorite brand of toothpaste. We love that it is all natural and the company shares the beliefs that we stand for. I was looking for a natural toothpaste that contained fluoride and found this. It has a pleasant taste that is not overpowering and it cleans well, leaving our mouth fresh and with a good aftertaste. It is the only type of toothpaste that we buy, and we will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> I bought a bunch of Jason products for hair, skin, and teeth.. thinking I was doing good for my body. This company is a fraud.  It was bought by Hain Celestial Group - one of the large corporations in food and personal care.  The toothpaste contains fluoride, and not until recently did I learn the dangers of fluoride.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll be surpirsed how many organic companies have been bought and tainted.  Look up &#x27;Who owns organic&#x27;.  I started using a baking soda and coconut oil mix, and my teeth and mouth look and feel so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word about FLUORIDE - there are various forms.  The naturally-occuring is calcium fluoride:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Fluoride is used in most toothpastes, mouthwashes, dental varnish, dental preparations and nutritional supplements. This same form of fluoride is used as an insecticide and pesticide, as a preservative in glues, as a growth inhibitor for bacteria, fungi and mold. Sodium fluoride is also used in making steel and aluminum products. Added to molten metal, sodium fluoride creates a more uniform metal. Other industrial uses for sodium fluoride include glass frosting and wood preservatives. Sodium Fluoride is also used in the manufacture of chemical and biological weapons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fluorosilicic acid (H2SiF6) is commonly used for water fluoridation.  This form of fluoride is a toxic liquid by-product, acquired by scrubbing the chimney stacks of phosphate fertilizer manufacture. Other names for it are hexafluorosilicic, hexafluosilicic, hydrofluosilicic, and silicofluoric acid.  The CDC approximates that 95% of our water is fluoridated with fluorosilicic acid. ([...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Fluorosilicate (Na2SiF6) is primarily added to public drinking water as a fluoridation agent. This same compound is also used as an insecticide and a wood preservative.  It is a classified hazardous waste by-product of phosphate fertilizer manufacture which, if not put into our drinking water, must be disposed of at hazardous waste facilities.Other names for it are Sodium Fluosilicate and Sodium Silica Fluoride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Industrial forms of fluoride, used in our water supply and toothpaste, are shown to cause dental and skeletal fluorosis... to lower childrens&#x27; IQ. You have to call the Poison Control Center if your child has ingested too much, labeled on toothpaste tubes.  Has been linked to problems with the thyroid and hypothalmus.  Shown to make people docile, obedient, lethargic, apathetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fluoride was used in Nazi concentration camps to sterilize the prisoners and make them docile.</li>
            <li> Like the taste of this toothpaste. Good change from the normal mint and looking forward to trying the other flavors as well.</li>
            <li> This tooth paste will show up on a search for Fluoride Free toothpaste on Amazon, it isn&#x27;t fluoride free, it&#x27;s SLS free only.  This is very confusing when you first look for the product.  Sadly, the JAS-1515 product costs alot more and weights 4.2 ounces (not 6 ounces) like the Fluoride version.  Don&#x27;t buy if you accidentally think this is Fluoride-Free.  Amazon was kind enough to take it back.</li>
            <li> If you spend a lot of money for periodontics, get this toothpaste.  Not the greatest taste, but it&#x27;s a must have for people with oral health issues. I buy it in bulk.  Be advised, I do not work for this company or have any stake in their success, but really wish I could run their marketing department. There are a few million people who need to know about this stuff.</li>
            <li> This tooth-gel (not paste) tastes like some kind of crap a traditional healer might smear on you to treat a burn. In other words, it&#x27;s gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, please put the word &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; in the title so it&#x27;s obvious! Lots of people don&#x27;t like gel.</li>
            <li> The flavor is pleasing and there are no unhealthy ingredients or food color.  Definitely the best I have used so far.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like this toothpaste, simply because I don&#x27;t feel that my mouth is very clean after using it. Not bad per se, but not a repeat product.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste has a weird color, consistency, and flavor, but I kept myself to trying it for at least two weeks to see how my mouth liked it.  It definitely leaves teeth and gums feeling super clean and smelling fresh, plus it doesn&#x27;t contain any of the chemical junk found in mainstream toothpaste brands.</li>
            <li> Strong taste of cinnamon, but not overpowering. I don&#x27;t really notice the tea tree, which is probably a good thing. Teeth come out clean and my breath smells like Christmas.</li>
            <li> The tea tree oil flavor is pretty yucky... I kept it though because it does a good job of removing plaque, like all of the Jason toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a NON-FLUORIDE, MORE NATURAL toothpaste, and this one is, but my teeth don&#x27;t feel as clean as they should after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several years ago, I used to brush with Melaleuca cinnamon toothpaste (which is not really cinnamon flavored, more neutral), and when I went to the dentist for my semi-annual cleanings, he used to gush about how clean my teeth were.  I stopped using Melaleuca products, and could not find it until recently on Amazon - just began using again, and will review shortly!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural toothpaste that provides effective cleaning, in addition to freshening my breath. Since I have been pleased with Jason products, in the past, I decided to give this a whirl. The gel has a great tea tree, cinnamon and clove flavor - strong and you feel it killing halitosis in its tracks. The CoQ10 is supposed to help maintain healthy gums, and the fluoride is supposed to help with tartar, etc. Though, I have heard some negative comments about fluoride, my sense is that everything in moderation (no extreme amounts of anything in your system) is actually safe. My teeth and gums feel so clean and healthy after using this.</li>
            <li> Wanted no fluoried got this instead why do they put poison in toothpaste anyway?? It was my mistake ordering this type of product as there are so many choices</li>
            <li> obtained the product because I was looking for a tooth paste that contained coq10 and this is the only one I could find.  Has weird taste.  But seems to get your teeth clean and you only need a little bit on the tooth brush so I am going to assume that this product will last a long time</li>
            <li> Tastes great and never feels artificial</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many of the Jason mouth products and recommend this toothpaste, too. No harsh chemicals just good healthy ingredients.</li>
            <li> Really good product. Makes all the difference that it has not being tested on animals and has no animal ingredients, which is always GREAT and makes it environmentally responsible...Guilt -free</li>
            <li> I used to have problems with my gums, I read about this toothpaste and bought it, and i was surprise with the result, only a couple of day of using it I can feel my gums getting better..must have if you have gum problem..Recommended</li>
            <li> This is the best toothpaste I have ever used. I used to be a Tom&#x27;s of Maine user, but when the company got bought out they apparently changed the recipe and it became way too sweet for me. I bought a tube of Jason cinnamon tea tree in my continuing quest to find a decent replacement and I was amazed. It&#x27;s even better than Tom&#x27;s ever was. It tastes great without being very sweet and even though it&#x27;s more expensive than most toothpaste  trust me, it will last just as long! This stuff foams up like crazy so you only need a tiny amount on your brush. This toothpaste makes me love brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothpaste because I seem to have developed problems with the ingrediant Sodium Larel Sulfate, which is in all toothpaste. Sodium laurel Sulfate is Floor Wax, that&#x27;s why it foams in your mouth. This toothpaste does not contain harmful ingredients, all natural !!!</li>
            <li> * * * THIS TOOTH PASTE CONTAINS FLUORIDE but is free of many other harsh chemicals * * *&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow!!  I have found my new favorite toothpaste!  [[ASIN:B001T8MTWO Jason Healthy Mouth Plus CoQ10 Fluoride Gel Toothpaste, Tea Tree, Cinnamon, 6 Ounce]] has a slight minty flavor, not overpowering at all.  I am NOT into cinnamon candies as I do not like the taste - yet I love this toothpaste! (I really don&#x27;t taste the cinnamon...)  It is a CLEAR GEL - no artificial colors!!! THANK YOU JASON!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Per the packaging:&lt;br /&gt;No sodium lauryl/laureth sulfates&lt;br /&gt;No preservatives&lt;br /&gt;No artificial flavors&lt;br /&gt;NO ARTIFICIAL COLORS!!! (So important to those of us who suffer extreme GI duress when FD&amp;C Blue 1 is used.. read the info on FDA.GOV as well)&lt;br /&gt;No artificial sweeteners&lt;br /&gt;No saccharin&lt;br /&gt;No propylene glycol&lt;br /&gt;No gluten&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found a great mouthwash to pair with this toothpaste is [[ASIN:B004GW0WJM Desert Essence Natural Refreshing Tea Tree Oil Mouthwash -- 16 fl oz]]. I put the mouthwash in a small sprayer pump to make it last a long long time.  It also works great to spray on toothbrushes to refresh and clean the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW I found the best price was on the single tube with subscribe and save. Amazon also sells a 3-pack.  Price compare and consider using Subscribe and Save to find the best price, don&#x27;t forget to check into Amazon Mom, as well.  Jason&#x27;s customer service can be reached at 1-877-JASON-01 weekdays 7am-5pm MST.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stoopidly tried [[ASIN:B001ET7HQG SmartMouth Toothpaste, Mint, 6-Ounce Tubes  (Pack of 3)]] but as soon as I opened it and discovered the FD&amp;C Blue 1 staring back at me I realized it was a huge mistake.  I tried it anyway... it would be TMI to say what happened :-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have deducted ONE STAR for the FLUORIDE.  If this toothpaste did NOT contain Fluoride it would be a full 5 Stars.</li>
            <li> I got this because of the CoQ10. The flavor leaves a LOT to be desired. I&#x27;m used to natural toothpastes that aren&#x27;t sweet and I like them. This kind of tastes like the inside of a bowl of potpourri. In a bad way. Like what I imagine the potpourri would actually taste like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I wonder about the CoQ10 too. I&#x27;ve read that it&#x27;s an unstable compound and deteriorates rather quickly, and I wonder whether it would stay stable in a toothpaste like this. AND, I just checked some more info about it and recent research has shown no benefit from CoQ10 for periodontal disease.</li>
            <li> This is my second Jason toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried.  I love it.  Tastes like listerine and Vicks Rub at first, but you get used to it.  The results are fresh breath that lasts.  Opens your sinuses too,</li>
            <li> This stuff is fabulous.  If you aren&#x27;t used to it the taste is different from traditional toothpaste, but it does a good job and seems to help with inflammation.</li>
            <li> worked for me; bought it for gingivitis and I also cut off coffee I used to drink 5 cups until I read that coffee causes excess build up of tartar also use the rinse Perio MEd and Listerine</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is very good for gum health.  However, it does not contain flouride (this is my fault for not noticing) so if you want flouride in your toothpaste, look elsewhere!  During my last dental cleaning, my dentist commented on how healthy my gums looked, and I attribute it to the active ingredients in this paste!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie, I don&#x27;t always really care if my toothpaste is all natural. But it is a bonus! Not gonna lie, there are better tasting toothpastes out there but the reason I love it is because of the CoQ10.&lt;br /&gt;I am a smoker (I know) and because of it, have gum problems. I have totally noticed a difference with this!&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I was not sure if I would like the taste of tea tree but honestly it reminds me of Listerine, without feeling so harsh. My tooth sensitivity seemed to disappear after starting this toothpaste, but I have to deduct a star for the dry mouth feeling it leaves me with.</li>
            <li> I like many people have a very strong sensitivity to artificial sweeteners. I cannot go into a grocery store or pharmacy without reading labels, if I don&#x27;t I get sick.&lt;br /&gt;I had been using Burt Bees tarter control tooth paste, but they no longer make it so the search had to start again. I looked around in stores only to find that their &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; option still has artificial sweetener.&lt;br /&gt;I turned to Amazon, I&#x27;m glad I did! I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about having to order toothpaste online, but it was absolutely worth it. Not only do I not have to worry about getting sick from their product, it tastes amazing! I love the tea tree oil, it leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean, without the mint burn.&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this product again and again.</li>
            <li> Love the taste and feel of it.  it is not your typical white or blue color, but knowing it is all natural and has no colorants or artificial fragrances, makes me feel so good.  I am a monthly subscriber - you should be too!</li>
            <li> Positives:  is anti-cavity, no sodium lauryl sulfate, no preservatives, no artificial coloring, no artificial sweeteners, no propylene glycol (!!).  I like using it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t aggravate the tissue in my mouth.  The taste is mild.  It&#x27;s non-abrasive.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste has fluoride in it which is shown to cause cancer and lowers IQ. This defeats the whole purpose of natural toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you Google \\&quot;fluoride causes cancer and lowers IQ\\&quot; you can find studies.</li>
            <li> Great tasting toothpaste. Leaves your mouth clean, and it rinses away nicely. The clove mouthwash is really nice too.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price of this adD on</li>
            <li> It has already be scientifically proven that good dental hygiene affects your health. CoQ10 is one of the supplements you can use to insure good health. Added to toothpaste, it has a remarkable effect on sensitive gums which is a common complaint of many people. Toothpaste products with this ingredient are few, so the choices are limited, but this one is time tested. I purchased this for my husband who hates trying anything new, but will do it for me. He has sensitive teeth and gums and saw improvement with this product.</li>
            <li> I love it! It tastes good too.</li>
            <li> This is the worst tasting toothpaste I have ever tried. I could not use it since the taste made me gag. It is also a very thick gel and is hard to get out of the tube. I will be buying Verve Ultra since the reviews say it has a great flavor and also comes in a gel.</li>
            <li> One of the best toothpastes I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I had fire mouth or whatever the dentists call it where my tongue was constantly in pain from using normal tooth paste. After using this for a few weeks, I was all better. I&#x27;ve now been using it for over a year and loving it. Thanks for making it so I can eat spicy foods again!!! I highly recommend this stuff.</li>
            <li> I normally live cinnamon, but this tastes like some kind of strange medicine.</li>
            <li> The family revolted over the taste of this one.  Nobody could get behind it.  It isn&#x27;t awful, but it isn&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li> it does not feel as clean as a regular toothpaste, but it is not tested on animals. so it&#x27;s ok with me. it has a nice strong after taste of cinammon or something.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste!  I do not like using mint toothpaste.  So I had been using anything non-minty, which was Tom&#x27;s of Maine.  Did a search on Amazon and found the Jason toothpaste.  I now prefer Jason&#x27;s over Tom&#x27;s of Maine.  Feels so refreshing after brushing; clean, smooth &amp; whiter teeth!!</li>
            <li> I find this toothpaste tastes great and leaves my mouth feeling very clean without all of the sugar in other toothpastes.</li>
            <li> Advertised as Fluoride free, is not..</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste! The nice and natural clean feeling it leaves me with is great.</li>
            <li> Great clean chemical-free feeling when using this product.  It&#x27;s soooooo much better than the Abe&#x27;s &#x27;natural&#x27; toothpastes which seem so unnatural when reading their extensive chemical ingredients (then, the say they are &amp;#34;naturally processed&amp;#34; chemicals).  I like Jason&#x27;s quality and naturalness so much more!</li>
            <li> Like most of the other customers, I wanted to replace my toothpaste with a healthier and more natural one.  This toothpaste just doesn&#x27;t work.  After more than 3 months of continuous use, I noticed that my teeth weren&#x27;t as white as they used to be and that my gums were inflamed, swollen. and bleeding.  Since I brush my teeth at least twice a day, I had a hard time understanding why I had to suffer from gum disease which is linked to poor oral hygiene.  Last week I went back to my good old Crest 3d white luxe (I&#x27;m glad I did despite the ingredients because my teeth are back in shape again).</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is the worst, it has a horrible taste and hardly foams up. Not worth the money had to send it back.  The Desert Essence brands of Tea Tree oil toothpaste are much better than this one. I thought it would be good, but tastes horrible.  Poor quality taste, foaming, and effectiveness all around. I doubt anyone trying it would really like it.  I had used Desert Essence before and should have gotten that again, this one is a real disappointment.</li>
            <li> Finally a toothpaste without SLS that is not strong peppermint flavor.  IMHO, the last thing&lt;br /&gt;folks with thin,  sensitive gums need is strong stinging peppermint.  This toothpase is a soft gel&lt;br /&gt;that actually makes my mouth feel better.  Not a wonderful taste but not offensive.  Don&#x27;t really use toothpaste for the taste.  Good foam and cleansing too.  I intend to order another tube.</li>
            <li> Yes, I will get many dislikes from this review, but I completely blame myself for buying this product without proper examining at the label which state it contains fluoride.</li>
            <li> Had to get used to the taste first, but I find it effective.</li>
