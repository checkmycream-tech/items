            <li>Cool bottle, too!</li>
            <li>There are so many aftershaves on the market today that are to sweet and to feminine,this is not one of them.  </li>
            <li>she likes the smell and that what count right guys lol fast shipping and was in my hands before i even noticed the charge on our account  so far so good</li>
            <li>WHY ITS MYSTICAL PINE TREE SMELL HAS GONE AND CAME A CHEAP SMELLING THING</li>
            <li>REAL GOOD.I HIGHTLY RECOMMENDED.YOUR GIRLFRIEND WILL LOVE YOU EVEN MORE.</li>
            <li>It is very useful and practical.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected and more, these days are very warm and this perfume is just so refreshing.</li>
            <li>, here&#x27;s my more more detailed, informative and highly scientific study of this product:&lt;br /&gt;Initially I&#x27;d say the first spritz starts of with a lovely hint of Southern Yellow Pine, which is great because I am in Florida, and now I don&#x27;t have to walk to my backyard to sniff the tree when I need that Southern-Yellow-Pine-smell fix!</li>
            <li>This product came quickly and I was truly enjoy this fragrance.</li>
            <li>CLASSIC - fresh manly smell - many compliments on this!</li>
            <li>I always use them for special occiasins and get compliments.</li>
            <li>Thanks you for keeping this great fresh fragrance alive.</li>
            <li>This is cool.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is best worn during late fall to winter seasons imo.</li>
            <li>A dazzling citrus accord, backed up by a quiet, suede-y leather and the mellow aroma of a pine board right from the sawmill.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great scent, but as noted by other reviewers, it wears off after a couple hours.</li>
            <li>Came quick  and welll packaged.</li>
            <li>Sorry about this one, but I will still be a good customer when it comes to your great deals on fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>I purchased several bottles in April of 2014 and was very pleased.</li>
            <li>No an exact match but a very good substitute for Vesa ce Green Jeans</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap for a large bottle of fragrance, so I don&#x27;t mind using it all the time.</li>
            <li>Smells like a walk in a fresh pine forest.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about it,</li>
            <li>Good delivered as expected.</li>
            <li>Unique, pine inspired fragrance, clean, very masculine, not too &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; or overpowering.</li>
            <li>As that wonderful first wafting begins to evanesce, the odor is gradually replaced with a more woodsy yet subtle scent of the eastern white pine, or as I like to call it,,, \\&quot;Pinus strobus\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Not something that I, a 23-year old, would commonly wear, but it is a great addition to my collection!</li>
            <li>Some things are better left unquestioned.</li>
            <li>First was turned on to this in Italy in the 1970s.&lt;br /&gt;Buy</li>
            <li>I was first made aware of this product while visiting one of my cousins in Italy.  </li>
            <li>I have never returned anything to amazon, So, this will be a first for me,  I always have trusted your opinion and</li>
            <li>The original scent never gets old.</li>
            <li>I remember the old original lasted for over 24 hours.</li>
            <li>So if you live in the USA and are seeking a somewhat unique and manly cologne, this should work really well for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To me smell very very very mild, Like it has been mixed with a lots of water.</li>
            <li>WHICH -THANKS</li>
            <li>but it really like this.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t really complain about a $15 cologne from the 1950&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it simple,clean,fresh and above all masculine.  </li>
            <li>Very different than the original 70s&#x27; scent.</li>
            <li>Even though this product is original and not an imitation the smell doesn&#x27;t last for more than two hours.</li>
            <li>This has a really unique smell to it--definitely makes me think of a classic Italian fragrance.</li>
            <li>My husband has worn this since he first found it in Italy in the early 70&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Mild smell, but solid.</li>
            <li>Timeless classic I&#x27;ve read.</li>
            <li>By the virtue of being an older cologne</li>
            <li>It amazes me that this has never become a drugstore classic like Polo.</li>
            <li>My companion loves this scent in particular and I&#x27;m very fond of outdoorsy overtones in general.  </li>
            <li>Not only do I REALLY like the smell ( pine, woodlands, very MANLY )</li>
            <li>Initial application smells funny on my skin.</li>
            <li>No pine - pure synthetic generic &amp;#34;masculine&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li>many people of my age (mid 20&#x27;s) are not familiar with it.</li>
            <li>Dry down is okay, but kind of weak.</li>
            <li>think it&#x27;s either my skin or an old batch.</li>
            <li>Its not very pine scented in my view, but it is a fresh pleasing scent.</li>
            <li>I have use this for 30 years along with other, i use this one to work since it doesn&#x27;t bother anyone on the contrary, they all say i smell fresh.</li>
            <li>A classic \\&quot;citrus chypre\\&quot; in the tradition of Chanel and Hermes, but it costs one fifth as much and lasts ten times as long.</li>
            <li>A \\&quot;safe scent\\&quot; with so much pizzazz that I&#x27;ve never gotten bored with it.</li>
            <li>I get no other types of smells</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very ordinary an not different than many others.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll generally have to reapply in the evening if I&#x27;m going</li>
            <li>Fellas remember to only give a slight application directly to the skin; keep in mind that this scent might attract cougars ;)</li>
            <li>Genuine article of a hard to find Italian scent.</li>

            <li> but I can&#x27;t really complain about a $15 cologne from the 1950&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it simple,clean,fresh and above all masculine.  </li>
            <li> Very different than the original 70s&#x27; scent.</li>
            <li> Even though this product is original and not an imitation the smell doesn&#x27;t last for more than two hours.</li>
            <li> This has a really unique smell to it--definitely makes me think of a classic Italian fragrance.</li>
            <li> My husband has worn this since he first found it in Italy in the early 70&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Mild smell, but solid.</li>
            <li> Timeless classic I&#x27;ve read.</li>
            <li> By the virtue of being an older cologne</li>
            <li> It amazes me that this has never become a drugstore classic like Polo.</li>
            <li> My companion loves this scent in particular and I&#x27;m very fond of outdoorsy overtones in general.  </li>
            <li> Not only do I REALLY like the smell ( pine, woodlands, very MANLY )</li>
            <li> Initial application smells funny on my skin.</li>
            <li> No pine - pure synthetic generic &amp;#34;masculine&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li> many people of my age (mid 20&#x27;s) are not familiar with it.</li>
            <li> Dry down is okay, but kind of weak.</li>
            <li> think it&#x27;s either my skin or an old batch.</li>
            <li> Its not very pine scented in my view, but it is a fresh pleasing scent.</li>
            <li> I have use this for 30 years along with other, i use this one to work since it doesn&#x27;t bother anyone on the contrary, they all say i smell fresh.</li>
            <li> A classic \\&quot;citrus chypre\\&quot; in the tradition of Chanel and Hermes, but it costs one fifth as much and lasts ten times as long.</li>
            <li> A \\&quot;safe scent\\&quot; with so much pizzazz that I&#x27;ve never gotten bored with it.</li>
            <li> I get no other types of smells</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very ordinary an not different than many others.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll generally have to reapply in the evening if I&#x27;m going</li>
            <li> Fellas remember to only give a slight application directly to the skin; keep in mind that this scent might attract cougars ;)</li>
            <li> Genuine article of a hard to find Italian scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not BAD, just not great.</li>
            <li> all sarcastic internet typing aside,, after giving this cologne a few chances, it now sits on the shelf in my bathroom staring at me with</li>
            <li> later divorced (she left him), but I&#x27;ll bet that whatever their other problems; if he had agreed to wear this - she&#x27;d follow him anywhere!</li>
            <li> After an hour or so, you can only reminisce in sorrow when you realize the initial two pines have long since left, and all you are left with is a final hint of the Japanese Red Pine,, (or \\&quot;Pinus densiflora\\&quot;), perhaps you can also detect a slight overtone of the Stone Pine (Common in Italy by gosh!!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of those subtle classic scents.</li>
            <li> Ecxellent as expected.</li>
            <li> However, I can state with the authority that comes from experience that whatever it is that they put in this formula does make other women follow you and get up close</li>
            <li> a lot of other items.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heady or fake smelling and it certainly hangs around.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s weak, I&#x27;ll generally start with two sprays to the lower neck, and one spray on a wrist (then wrists pressed together).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s beady little pine-cone eye, begging for me to pick it up and spray myself with it, but alas, I have developed a distaste for this cologne and no longer care to partake in the pineyness (Yep, pineyness is a word, I just created it).</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it does not last long after application.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s on of the few places where I can buy it.</li>
            <li> I find my self buying this item a few times a year..</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money if you&#x27;re looking for a pine scent.</li>
            <li> I just received an order (01-10-2015)  and sadly, the scent is not the same.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t take me wrong</li>
            <li> the fake one or company has changed its formula(I</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m sorry to say</li>
            <li> , something is wrong here and my review is based on what i received and not what it might have been.  </li>
            <li> Its not that expensive, give it a shot.</li>
            <li> I am sorry to say but this fragrance, smells like a room spray, or pine-sol cleaner, it is terrible.  </li>

            <li> Good perfum and cheap.</li>
            <li> WHAT HAPPENED TO PINO SILVESTRE. WHY ITS MYSTICAL PINE TREE SMELL HAS GONE AND CAME A CHEAP SMELLING THING WHICH -THANKS GOD- DISSAPEARS IN NO TIME WHEN APPLIED,,,, SHAME SHAME</li>
            <li> excellent product I recommend it widely.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t take me wrong i love the smell of Pino Silvestre but i think either i received the fake one or company has changed its formula(I bought it from Amazon). When i use mine, The smell disappear within 30 minutes??!!! I&#x27;m not kidding. To me smell very very very mild, Like it has been mixed with a lots of water. I&#x27;m a fan of this cologne but i&#x27;m sorry to say, something is wrong here and my review is based on what i received and not what it might have been.  I&#x27;m going to buy one more from another vender to see how the smell like and i&#x27;ll update my rating and review accordingly.</li>
            <li> This has been one of my favorites for three decades. I was almost out and on a whim looked it up on Amazon. There it was! Thanks you for keeping this great fresh fragrance alive. The pine and citrus go together great.</li>
            <li> REAL GOOD COLOGNE I LOVE IT AND SMELL REAL GOOD.I HIGHTLY RECOMMENDED.YOUR GIRLFRIEND WILL LOVE YOU EVEN MORE.</li>
            <li> This is cool. Stays on your body all day. Mild smell, but solid.</li>
            <li> Genuine article of a hard to find Italian scent. It&#x27;s been around for decades and quite popular in Europe. Unique, pine inspired fragrance, clean, very masculine, not too &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; or overpowering. It&#x27;s one of those subtle classic scents. Loved this cologne since I was a kid.</li>
            <li> Timeless classic I&#x27;ve read. Enjoyable scent and will wear it often.</li>
            <li> I had not worn this aftershave in 20yrs so I decided to try it again.  Well guess what it still smells great I love it simple,clean,fresh and above all masculine.  There are so many aftershaves on the market today that are to sweet and to feminine,this is not one of them.  I always get compliments when wearing Pino.  The best thing about this aftershave is that its not expensive at all.  Try it you will not regret it.</li>
            <li> CLASSIC - fresh manly smell - many compliments on this!</li>
            <li> MY FRIENDS LET ME BUY IT FOR HER&lt;br /&gt;AND WHEN I GOT IT, I LIKE IT TOO.&lt;br /&gt;ITS NATURURAL MORE</li>
            <li> Great experience, It was a gift for classic guy,</li>
            <li> Great old school cologne at a great price. My wife loves it.  Smells like a walk in a fresh pine forest.</li>
            <li> reminds me of my teenage years when this was popular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so glad it is still in production ~</li>
            <li> Nice scent of pine and spice. In my opinion the scent reminds me of Christmas.</li>
            <li> No an exact match but a very good substitute for Vesa ce Green Jeans I bought 10 bottles</li>
            <li> My husband has worn this since he first found it in Italy in the early 70&#x27;s.  It&#x27;s still my favorite of his colognes, I love it.</li>
            <li> After 30 years considered using this perfume again. Exactly what I expected and more, these days are very warm and this perfume is just so refreshing.</li>
            <li> This fresh pine out of the forest scent is perfect for that final touch after a shower and I get many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Love it 100%. This product came quickly and I was truly enjoy this fragrance. It&#x27;s on of the few places where I can buy it.</li>
            <li> After many years found it...nice fragrance that reminds me of Italy....good price!!</li>
            <li> Ecxellent as expected.</li>
            <li> My dad&#x27;s favorite cologne, great price prompt delivery very happy with purchase</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years. The original scent never gets old. It&#x27;s like a family tradition in our home to have a Pino Silvestre.</li>
            <li> Great product I&#x27;ve been using it for years!!</li>
            <li> The smell is ok.  I gave this as a gift to someone.  It came exactly as described and I received it in good time.</li>
            <li> My wife introduced me to this many years ago when she was just one of my gf&#x27;s, a wife wannabe as it were. After all these years, I have never asked how and where SHE discovered this cologne. Some things are better left unquestioned. However, I can state with the authority that comes from experience that whatever it is that they put in this formula does make other women follow you and get up close so they can sniff you.</li>
            <li> When I spray this and smells like lemon and pine trees. I get no other types of smells but it really like this. I recommend wearing this in the summer or spring.</li>
            <li> is of the best perfumes I&#x27;ve had, I&#x27;m very pleased with the perfume. I hope to buy the coming year</li>
            <li> Smells great. And great shipping</li>
            <li> Initial application smells funny on my skin. Dry down is okay, but kind of weak. Because it&#x27;s weak, I&#x27;ll generally start with two sprays to the lower neck, and one spray on a wrist (then wrists pressed together). This works well, but as I said, it initially smells funky then fades. I&#x27;ll generally have to reapply in the evening if I&#x27;m going out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s either my skin or an old batch. I know some people have had similar issues with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still would recommend trying it. It&#x27;s not BAD, just not great. I think it works best, contrary to all the Christmas references, in slightly warm and damp spring weather.</li>
            <li> Fast service - great product ... just as advertised.</li>
            <li> I have use this for 30 years along with other, i use this one to work since it doesn&#x27;t bother anyone on the contrary, they all say i smell fresh.</li>
            <li> I kind of like the scent...it smells like something grandpa would have worn back in the 70s... It&#x27;s similar to aspen. Get aspen. It smells better, its cheaper,  and available at any Walmart</li>
            <li> A favorite of my husband for yearsâ€¦.his scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great scent, but as noted by other reviewers, it wears off after a couple hours. I&#x27;m using it liberally before work, then again afterwards before headed out for the evening. It&#x27;s cheap for a large bottle of fragrance, so I don&#x27;t mind using it all the time.</li>
            <li> My companion loves this scent in particular and I&#x27;m very fond of outdoorsy overtones in general.  Unfortunately, it does not last long after application.</li>
            <li> I HAD THIS SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE , AS FOR HE SCENT  REMINDS ME OF FALL. sO I BOUGHT ANOTHER DOSE , ALL IS  WELL</li>
            <li> First was turned on to this in Italy in the 1970s.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it and wear it here. Not only do I REALLY like the smell ( pine, woodlands, very MANLY ), I&#x27;ve had women Follow me because of it!&lt;br /&gt;One co-worker loved it so much, she bought some as a gift for her husband (because she said just the smell turns her on). He doesn&#x27;t like to wear &amp;#34;scents&amp;#34; and refused to put it on. So, she told me that before they made love, she&#x27;d douse the pillow so she could smell it while they were doing &amp;#34;it&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;They later divorced (she left him), but I&#x27;ll bet that whatever their other problems; if he had agreed to wear this - she&#x27;d follow him anywhere!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and used to find it in the store.  I am happy to see that it&#x27;s available on-line and very reasonable.</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling men&#x27;s aftershave ever. The men in my life have happily used it for many decades. Essence of manliness for me.</li>
            <li> I find my self buying this item a few times a year.. I give it to my boss for his birthday and he isn not from the time period of the pino era,, yet he loves it. I always use them for special occiasins and get compliments. Great smell.  Great product. Came quick  and welll packaged. I  am so happy they still have them.</li>
            <li> Meh,, Smells like pinecones, looks like pinecones, Haven&#x27;t tasted yet but I bet it tastes like pinecones. Something makes me think it&#x27;s made from pinecones. Not crazy about it, but I can&#x27;t really complain about a $15 cologne from the 1950&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;So after user D. Sekerak spoke so highly of my initial review above, I decided to update it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SOOO, here&#x27;s my more more detailed, informative and highly scientific study of this product:&lt;br /&gt;Initially I&#x27;d say the first spritz starts of with a lovely hint of Southern Yellow Pine, which is great because I am in Florida, and now I don&#x27;t have to walk to my backyard to sniff the tree when I need that Southern-Yellow-Pine-smell fix! As that wonderful first wafting begins to evanesce, the odor is gradually replaced with a more woodsy yet subtle scent of the eastern white pine, or as I like to call it,,, \\&quot;Pinus strobus\\&quot;. After an hour or so, you can only reminisce in sorrow when you realize the initial two pines have long since left, and all you are left with is a final hint of the Japanese Red Pine,, (or \\&quot;Pinus densiflora\\&quot;), perhaps you can also detect a slight overtone of the Stone Pine (Common in Italy by gosh!!) .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all sarcastic internet typing aside,, after giving this cologne a few chances, it now sits on the shelf in my bathroom staring at me with it&#x27;s beady little pine-cone eye, begging for me to pick it up and spray myself with it, but alas, I have developed a distaste for this cologne and no longer care to partake in the pineyness (Yep, pineyness is a word, I just created it).</li>
            <li> This has a really unique smell to it--definitely makes me think of a classic Italian fragrance. Not something that I, a 23-year old, would commonly wear, but it is a great addition to my collection! Cool bottle, too!</li>
            <li> is a product of very good quality, brand and price. I recommend it to all people who are in search of something. Besides, it is very nice, I loved it.</li>
            <li> I love Pino Silvestre. My father introduced me to it. By the virtue of being an older cologne many people of my age (mid 20&#x27;s) are not familiar with it. So if you live in the USA and are seeking a somewhat unique and manly cologne, this should work really well for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is best worn during late fall to winter seasons imo. Fellas remember to only give a slight application directly to the skin; keep in mind that this scent might attract cougars ;)</li>
            <li> Very different than the original 70s&#x27; scent. Almost like Oregano oil !!</li>
            <li> I purchased several bottles in April of 2014 and was very pleased. I just received an order (01-10-2015)  and sadly, the scent is not the same.</li>
            <li> Good delivered as expected.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my husband and he and I both loved this. It&#x27;s not too heady or fake smelling and it certainly hangs around.</li>
            <li> this was from my wife to me she likes the smell and that what count right guys lol fast shipping and was in my hands before i even noticed the charge on our account  so far so good</li>
            <li> This product bears no resemblance to pine or wood scent.  It&#x27;s very ordinary an not different than many others.  It smells like perfume.</li>
            <li> not as woodsy as I would like, but I bet most people wouldn&#x27;t like it if it was. Its not that expensive, give it a shot. Its not very pine scented in my view, but it is a fresh pleasing scent.</li>
            <li> Garbage. Smells NOTHING like it used to. No pine - pure synthetic generic &amp;#34;masculine&amp;#34; scent. Don&#x27;t waste your money if you&#x27;re looking for a pine scent.</li>
            <li> Good seller, good product, very fair price and delivery was right on time as they said.</li>
            <li> Its a great gift for an older person that uses it for many years&lt;br /&gt;Price was great&lt;br /&gt;Very nice product</li>
            <li> A dazzling citrus accord, backed up by a quiet, suede-y leather and the mellow aroma of a pine board right from the sawmill. A classic \\&quot;citrus chypre\\&quot; in the tradition of Chanel and Hermes, but it costs one fifth as much and lasts ten times as long. A \\&quot;safe scent\\&quot; with so much pizzazz that I&#x27;ve never gotten bored with it. It amazes me that this has never become a drugstore classic like Polo.</li>
            <li> I bought the pino silvestre eau de toilette for my dad&#x27;s birthday because he love it , now he is using it every day</li>
            <li> Brings back wonderful memories of my youth.</li>
            <li> I was first made aware of this product while visiting one of my cousins in Italy.  After shaving one morning, I had run out of after shave lotion and asked him if I could use some of his.  It had a nice clean, invigorating, and refreshing scent and seemed to reflect the atmosphere of the Tuscan hills which is where I was.  I have been using it ever since, 30+ years!  Great scent for during the day.</li>
            <li> Good morning all these objects came Congratulations perfect and they were very nice thank you send your best deals to remain a loyal customer dede Caracas Venezuela</li>
            <li> Great value, arrived when promised.</li>
            <li> I am sorry to say but this fragrance, smells like a room spray, or pine-sol cleaner, it is terrible.  I have ordered a lot of&lt;br /&gt;men&#x27;s fragrance&#x27;s from amazon (because you have great prices on fragrances) and have always liked everything I have&lt;br /&gt;received.  I have never returned anything to amazon, So, this will be a first for me,  I always have trusted your opinion and&lt;br /&gt;review of the smells.  Sorry about this one, but I will still be a good customer when it comes to your great deals on fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;And a lot of other items.</li>
            <li> Even though this product is original and not an imitation the smell doesn&#x27;t last for more than two hours. I remember the old original lasted for over 24 hours. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
    </ol>
