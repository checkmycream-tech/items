            <li>I love this stuff though I bought it somewhere else</li>

            <li>I use it twice a day and love that it doesn&#x27;t have a scent.  </li>
            <li>The mousse is lightweight and easy to apply and Footlogix makes a convincing pitch on HSN, but I would not buy it again</li>
            <li>Became familiar with this product from a salon where I get my pedicures, however, the price of this product on Amazon is much more cost competitive.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t as easy spreading it &amp; rubbing it into my feet.</li>
            <li>It worked best for me when I filed down the excess skin on my heels before applying.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly without being greasy so there is no need to wait for it to soak in before putting on your soaks or stockings.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend ordering this product if your feet/toenails are in an advanced fungal stage.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new too Footlogix products but absolutely love them &amp; will stick with them form now on!</li>
            <li>I frankly think that a good callus tool, or lava stone, is the only thing to get calluses off your heels.</li>
            <li>really helps keep my feet healthy considering my diabetes.  </li>
            <li>I find my feet feel good but hasn&#x27;t gotten rid of fungus I have after a full year of daily use.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery on these tubes of Revlon lipstick purchased for my mom.  </li>
            <li>It goes on quickly and immediately soaks in</li>
            <li>By the way, dear wife, you were right...</li>
            <li>I think the product is great but am not satisfied with what happened maybe through shipping.</li>
            <li>This is a product I can&#x27;t live without!!!</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>With Footlogix I apply this stuff after I get out of the shower and my feet has stayed soft and smooth for weeks.</li>
            <li>I have my first bottle in months now</li>
            <li>I first had this product used on my feet at the salon during a pedicure.</li>
            <li>I would much rather have a lotion than mousse</li>
            <li>My feet stay much softer now.</li>
            <li>I used it on my skin where some areas were flaky, worked very well.</li>
            <li>After searching for an effective product for years, I finally found one that actually works.  </li>
            <li>Its better than any other foot lotion I have used before.</li>
            <li>I use it about every other day now, and I love it.</li>
            <li>I had a different mousse by the same company that was way better...</li>
            <li>The #7 Extra Dry mousse felt good on my feet making them feel really soft &amp; smooth but it being a mousse took a little getting used too.</li>
            <li>It is a nice thick consistency after shaking the bottle and spraying the quarter size amount needed.</li>
            <li>but I can live with it.</li>
            <li>Using it on a nightly basis ensures that my feet stay soft and cracks in heels are gone!</li>
            <li>I bought this because I have cracked calluses on my heels and the fungicide in it is supposed to clear up, according to Footlogix, fungus caused calluses.</li>
            <li>I have to switch to a  prescription in order to clear up my feet and toenails.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the gift, though I felt out-of-place as the only guy there amongst all the primping gals!</li>
            <li>Plus within 2 days it fixed my foot issues.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I dont like about it, is how it dispenses the mousse I had to get used to simply press down lightly so it wont come out too much.</li>
            <li>I used to have very dry skin under my big toes and heels, that I used to buff away with the ped egg and have used different foot lotions to keep it smooth and moisturized</li>
            <li>unfortunately it costs more!  </li>

            <li> so it last very long time</li>
            <li> It got rid of rough cracked heels I had within a week using twice daily, after about a month</li>
            <li> Lasts a really long time!</li>
            <li> and I do not recommend it for either stated purpose: dry feet and/or calluses.</li>
            <li> You can get a tube of the same antifunal 1% Clotrimazole at Walmart for a lot less, altho</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my very dry and cracked feet for about a year.</li>
            <li> The roughness always comes back after a few days.</li>
            <li> BUT my feet are in rough shape.</li>
            <li> Nothing else worked on my dry cracked feet except this !!  </li>
            <li> I will try some of the other products in this line.</li>
            <li> I started using it every other day to maintain.</li>
            <li> Plus the can has lasted a long time, making it less expensive than I had anticipated.</li>
            <li> my feet look and feel softer.&lt;br /&gt;Comes out like thick mousse</li>
            <li> It is a little expensive.</li>
            <li> And the mousse was ozzing out, don&#x27;t know what was wrong</li>
            <li> No burny itch after wearing my shoes or painful cracked heels.</li>
            <li> No change for my horribly cracked feet.</li>

            <li> Keeps the itch away- my feet look and feel softer.&lt;br /&gt;Comes out like thick mousse so it stays in place. Odorless.</li>
            <li> I find my feet feel good but hasn&#x27;t gotten rid of fungus I have after a full year of daily use.</li>
            <li> A replacement for something I have used for a while. Seems to work OK.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new too Footlogix products but absolutely love them &amp; will stick with them form now on! The #7 Extra Dry mousse felt good on my feet making them feel really soft &amp; smooth but it being a mousse took a little getting used too. It wasn&#x27;t as easy spreading it &amp; rubbing it into my feet. I would much rather have a lotion than mousse but I can live with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have cracked calluses on my heels and the fungicide in it is supposed to clear up, according to Footlogix, fungus caused calluses. The mousse is lightweight and easy to apply and Footlogix makes a convincing pitch on HSN, but I would not buy it again and I do not recommend it for either stated purpose: dry feet and/or calluses. It effected neither condition. You can get a tube of the same antifunal 1% Clotrimazole at Walmart for a lot less, altho I frankly think that a good callus tool, or lava stone, is the only thing to get calluses off your heels.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to help with issues I was having with the toes on my feet. I began to notice that they were not improving with the products I was using. I started applying the Footlogix Mousse as soon as I got it. It does not require a lot to apply. It recommends to apply a quarter size of mousse. It is a nice thick consistency after shaking the bottle and spraying the quarter size amount needed. It goes on smoothly without being greasy so there is no need to wait for it to soak in before putting on your soaks or stockings. It really works great! I started seeing an improvement within a couple of days. This is an excellent product that will help with any anti-fungal issues you may have. I will try some of the other products in this line.</li>
            <li> Great product, works very well. Its better than any other foot lotion I have used before. Will buy again !</li>
            <li> This is magic. Love that it has no fragrance and is not greasy. Lasts a really long time! Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff though I bought it somewhere else I thought I&#x27;d give my input. It really works! I used to have very dry skin under my big toes and heels, that I used to buff away with the ped egg and have used different foot lotions to keep it smooth and moisturized but it never last very long. The roughness always comes back after a few days. With Footlogix I apply this stuff after I get out of the shower and my feet has stayed soft and smooth for weeks. The only thing I dont like about it, is how it dispenses the mousse I had to get used to simply press down lightly so it wont come out too much. And the mousse was ozzing out, don&#x27;t know what was wrong but somehow it stopped.  I wish they have this in cream form so the amount that comes out can be controlled better. I have my first bottle in months now so it last very long time, I better buy some more dont want to run out.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery on these tubes of Revlon lipstick purchased for my mom.  The color has been discontinued so she was thrilled to be able to be able to get them here.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my very dry and cracked feet for about a year. I use it about every other day now, and I love it. My feet stay much softer now. Lotion was just not enough.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product twice and have had the same thing happen.  The bottle malfunctions and product leaks out.  2 have been defective.  I think the product is great but am not satisfied with what happened maybe through shipping.</li>
            <li> This foot mouse is the best!  I like the fact that it is not greasy, and you can immediately put on shoes after applying. Became familiar with this product from a salon where I get my pedicures, however, the price of this product on Amazon is much more cost competitive.  Gave this as a stocking stuffer to my daughters and they are now hooked as well!</li>
            <li> This stuff actually works and I have tried a ton of products. It got rid of rough cracked heels I had within a week using twice daily, after about a month I started using it every other day to maintain. No burny itch after wearing my shoes or painful cracked heels. Plus the can has lasted a long time, making it less expensive than I had anticipated.</li>
            <li> GLEES: Product helped my husband with his turtle feet. Have gone through 3/4 bottle. I used it on my skin where some areas were flaky, worked very well. I am happy with the product and I will no doubt purchase more. DOWNSIDE: It is a little expensive.</li>
            <li> I had a different mousse by the same company that was way better... unfortunately it costs more!  You get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> This product had been recommended to me during a pedicure as a way to maintain the work being done to my feet and it is performing as recommended... I would buy it again. By the way, dear wife, you were right... my feet do feel better. Thanks for the gift, though I felt out-of-place as the only guy there amongst all the primping gals!</li>
            <li> Nothing else worked on my dry cracked feet except this !!  I would recommend this product to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> I was told that they just changed the look of the bottle and the name of the level. However, it does not even come close to what I bought before. I don&#x27;t know what to order now.  I plan to contact the company to have them explained.</li>
            <li> After searching for an effective product for years, I finally found one that actually works.  It worked best for me when I filed down the excess skin on my heels before applying.  It softens the skin and prevents cracking, but it doesn&#x27;t remove it; you have to do that yourself.  It keeps my feet beautiful so I can wear sandals without worry.</li>
            <li> Works great on athlete foot flair ups</li>
            <li> No change for my horribly cracked feet. Used religiously and saw no difference BUT my feet are in rough shape. Cracked heels, and 3 toenails with fungal damage. I have to switch to a  prescription in order to clear up my feet and toenails. I would not recommend ordering this product if your feet/toenails are in an advanced fungal stage.</li>
            <li> I first had this product used on my feet at the salon during a pedicure. My feet felt like velvet afterwards. Using it on a nightly basis ensures that my feet stay soft and cracks in heels are gone!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product. really helps keep my feet healthy considering my diabetes.  I will be ordering more.  thank you</li>
            <li> great foot treatment.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!  It goes on quickly and immediately soaks in so I don&#x27;t have slippery feet.  Plus within 2 days it fixed my foot issues.  I use it twice a day and love that it doesn&#x27;t have a scent.  This is a product I can&#x27;t live without!!!</li>
