            <li>Best buy for hearing aid batteries.</li>
            <li>Totally great in all respects: Quality, price (of course!)</li>
            <li>Everything would be perfect except for the fact that I just lost my  $5,000 hearing aids...</li>
            <li>EXCELLENT MAIL SERVICE.</li>

            <li>great batteries for the price</li>

            <li>Good  deal and great service</li>
            <li>Good price and</li>
            <li>In fact, they are probably as good as any you buy.  </li>
            <li>FAVORABLE cost and good product.</li>
            <li>Good price.&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li>batteries work good and are cheaper.</li>
            <li>However, the cost is extremely good.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I bought these because of the price.</li>
            <li>They were priced inexpensively, but work just fine!  </li>
            <li>However just as the hearing-aid provider&#x27;s &amp;#34;OEM&amp;#34; batteries, these work best if you pull the tabs off overnight before installing the next morning.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.</li>
            <li>Satisfied with the purchase,</li>
            <li>I have been buying their batteries for many years on the internet.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use until something better comes along.</li>
            <li>Work ok.  </li>
            <li>What more could I want?&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>These batteries are good quality and the expiration date is very good on the past 2 orders.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, product came in good Nick.</li>
            <li>Excellent product which I have bought previously</li>
            <li>Fantastic Deal.</li>
            <li>Batteries were received quickly and appear to work fine.</li>
            <li>So far I have been very satisfied.</li>
            <li>That is the kind of order that will make me coming back for more</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t at all happy about that, as I had no real way of knowing what I was getting.  </li>
            <li>But this seems like a bait and switch tactic they are using, showing the image of ZeniPower batteries, knowing full well they won&#x27;t be sending that to you.</li>
            <li>Quick service by Amazon.</li>
            <li>They were also shipped quickly</li>
            <li>Are as good as any other samples I have had.  </li>
            <li>I have tried various brands and am satisfied with the Zenipower.</li>
            <li>come back for more.</li>
            <li>They seem to be consistent in capacity and performance.</li>
            <li>I really did not have to do this at first, but after software upgrade to my hearing-aids, by my service-provider, the batteries sometimes have to &amp;#34;warm</li>
            <li>Product comes in traditional, easy access, packaging, and have lasted longer than the long-life batteries provided by my hearing provider.</li>
            <li>Ah, but art least I still have two almost completely unused boxes of your great Zenipower batteries to remind me of all that time</li>
            <li>So I can absolutely recommend these to anyone needing replacement batteries for hearing aids.</li>
            <li>Much much cheaper than buying them in the stores.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave much to the imagination.  </li>
            <li>Allserviceand the baterys haveben very satisfactory.</li>
            <li>No matter how much I pay for the batteries for my Mom&#x27;s  hearing aides they die in 3 days.</li>
            <li>Hearing Aid Club, was very agreeable in letting me return them if I wished to.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve reversed the pair to make sure one device doesn&#x27;t drain faster than the other.</li>
            <li>I hope they keep this friendly price in the future, I will buy again these bulk batteries.</li>
            <li>; when first powered-up of a morning, however I got the same performance from my provider&#x27;s batteries, so I am pretty certain it is the software upgrade.</li>
            <li>The batteries last a full week.</li>
            <li>I have used Zenipower for several years and I have been very pleased with them, they last as long as the high priced brands.  </li>
            <li>Low failure rate, most last four days and more.</li>
            <li>But from my experience with these batteries - which appear to cost less than some of the more popular ones like Rayovac and Duracell, etc - they seem to last as long or longer than the average of 3 days..</li>
            <li>This is the second time I ordered from them and the product came quickly and entirely satisfactory in every aspect.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping item exactly as expected thanks.</li>
            <li>No, not misplaced this time.</li>
            <li>Pretty dumb system that requires you to elaborate on something so obvious.</li>
            <li>The expiration dates are far enough in the future that I ordered a full year supply this time and when I checked them out I will use them long before they expire.</li>
            <li>So far this is the first week of using them and they seem to last as long as Zenipower without any glitches.  </li>
            <li>In the past, these were much cheaper, but they are now much closer in price to name brands.</li>

            <li> They were delivered on time and last as long as the brand name batteries.</li>
            <li> Battery power does not last long</li>
            <li> Batteries don&#x27;t last as long as others</li>
            <li> After a number of different tests, the only conclusion I can come to is these batteries (actually they are cells) last as long as Ray-O-Vac, Eveready and Duracell but cost less.</li>
            <li> Stick to a known quality brand and in the long run save money.</li>
            <li> These are the first batteries I have purchased after exhausting my initial 12-month supply of batteries provided by Tru-hearing.</li>
            <li> They last as long and cost a fraction of other batteries.</li>
            <li> Other batteries I&#x27;ve purchased were 1.45v &amp; they definitely lasted longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for about four months now and find that they last every bit as long as any other brand I&#x27;ve tried - and for considerably less money.</li>
            <li> The only difference is that these batteries go dead within a few minutes of the first warning that they are getting weak.</li>
            <li> if you have arthritic hands you might find the other brands easier to use.</li>
            <li> You cannot beat the price, expiration date years ahead, gives my Dad 5 days of hearing- aid use (comparable to other brands).  </li>
            <li> Zenipowers are not worth the money.</li>
            <li> There is no reason to assign anything less than a 5 to their performance.</li>
            <li> These last just as long as the expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Waste of my money and time.  </li>
            <li> American brands contract with nameless manufacturers in foreign countries to have their batteries made.  </li>
            <li> I let the batteries stand at least 5 minutes after taking the protector off.</li>
            <li> Very poor.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These are the first batteries I have purchased after exhausting my initial 12-month supply of batteries provided by Tru-hearing. I have been using them about one month. I find their lifespan to be equal to the Tru-hearing batteries. The only difference is that these batteries go dead within a few minutes of the first warning that they are getting weak. I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used various brands. I&#x27;ve tested the life of the batteries by putting one in each device. I&#x27;ve reversed the pair to make sure one device doesn&#x27;t drain faster than the other. After a number of different tests, the only conclusion I can come to is these batteries (actually they are cells) last as long as Ray-O-Vac, Eveready and Duracell but cost less. The only disadvantage there could possibly be is the tabs are shorter, so if you have arthritic hands you might find the other brands easier to use. But if you can deal with the shorter tabs (no problem for me) you can save money and expect the same service.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I ordered from them and the product came quickly and entirely satisfactory in every aspect.  Plan to order from them again when these run out.  They last as long as any others that I have used or heard about.</li>
            <li> I do not wear my hearing aids every day and Zenipower is the only batteries I have used.  But from my experience with these batteries - which appear to cost less than some of the more popular ones like Rayovac and Duracell, etc - they seem to last as long or longer than the average of 3 days..</li>
            <li> Great price and no problem with the batteries.  However just as the hearing-aid provider&#x27;s &amp;#34;OEM&amp;#34; batteries, these work best if you pull the tabs off overnight before installing the next morning.  I really did not have to do this at first, but after software upgrade to my hearing-aids, by my service-provider, the batteries sometimes have to &amp;#34;warm up&amp;#34; when first powered-up of a morning, however I got the same performance from my provider&#x27;s batteries, so I am pretty certain it is the software upgrade.</li>
            <li> They were delivered on time and last as long as the brand name batteries.</li>
            <li> Good  deal and great service</li>
            <li> Good price and so far they seem to be lasting as long as other brands that are more expensive. So I can absolutely recommend these to anyone needing replacement batteries for hearing aids.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for about four months now and find that they last every bit as long as any other brand I&#x27;ve tried - and for considerably less money. I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied. I just ordered 60 of the size 13 for my mother.</li>
            <li> Batteries were received quickly and appear to work fine.</li>
            <li> These batteries do their job, consistently lasting 3 to 4 days in hearing aids. There is no reason to assign anything less than a 5 to their performance.</li>
            <li> Compared to my orginal batteries they have a short life.  Sometimes a very short life.  Waste of my money and time.  Stick to a known quality brand and in the long run save money.</li>
            <li> Satisfied with the purchase,</li>
            <li> I have used Zenipower for several years and I have been very pleased with them, they last as long as the high priced brands.  The price is great, a good product and a great price.</li>
            <li> Second time I have ordered these batteries for my Father.  You cannot beat the price, expiration date years ahead, gives my Dad 5 days of hearing- aid use (comparable to other brands).  Will continue to order this item as needed.</li>
            <li> I hope they keep this friendly price in the future, I will buy again these bulk batteries. They last about a week in the hearing aid.</li>
            <li> I have been buying these for years and they are wonderful. A battery lasts me all week!!  Much much cheaper than buying them in the stores.</li>
            <li> Have been using the ZeniPower batteries for about 7 years.  Are as good as any other samples I have had.  They last as long and cost a fraction of other batteries.</li>
            <li> This brand of batteries are made in China but with a difference.  American brands contract with nameless manufacturers in foreign countries to have their batteries made.  They then charge a premium price based on the reputation they established when they actually made their products in the USA.  ZeniPower is the brand name of Zhuhai Zhi Li Battery Co. Ltd. they actually make the batteries.  They appear to care about the quality of their product. I have been buying their batteries for many years on the internet.  The quality has been consistently excellent.  The size 312 batteries have been consistently lasting for 8 days of 16 hour use in my hearing aids.</li>
            <li> great batteries for the price-they last over a week in hearing aids</li>
            <li> These are the best hearing aid batteries on the market for the price.  In fact, they are probably as good as any you buy.  They typically last 6 - 7 days.</li>
            <li> Product comes in traditional, easy access, packaging, and have lasted longer than the long-life batteries provided by my hearing provider.</li>
            <li> Zenipower batteries performed well. So far I have been very satisfied. The price make them very attractive.  w w w</li>
            <li> Very good hearing aid batteries. Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Great and works like a charm. Much cheaper</li>
            <li> Satisfactory delivery and item was as advertised.</li>
            <li> I have used these for over a year with no problems.  The batteries last a full week. The expiration dates are far enough in the future that I ordered a full year supply this time and when I checked them out I will use them long before they expire.</li>
            <li> Battery power does not last long</li>
            <li> These batteries are good quality and the expiration date is very good on the past 2 orders. I will continue to use until something better comes along. I have tried various brands and am satisfied with the Zenipower.</li>
            <li> This item was for my husband&#x27;s hearing aids.  They were priced inexpensively, but work just fine!  Best deal we could find.</li>
            <li> Best buy for hearing aid batteries.</li>
            <li> Work ok.  Doesn&#x27;t leave much to the imagination.  Pretty dumb system that requires you to elaborate on something so obvious.</li>
            <li> Zenipower Size 312 Zinc Air Hearing Aid Batteries 120 Pack Zenipower&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Met my expectations. What more could I want?&lt;br /&gt;Will come back for more.</li>
            <li> Second time I&#x27;ve ordered them! Totally great in all respects: Quality, price (of course!) promptness in delivery...Everything would be perfect except for the fact that I just lost my  $5,000 hearing aids...No, not misplaced this time. Gone. Lost. Ah, but art least I still have two almost completely unused boxes of your great Zenipower batteries to remind me of all that time I didn&#x27;t ask my wife &amp;#34;What did he say?!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Fast shipping item exactly as expected thanks.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT MAIL SERVICE. FAVORABLE cost and good product. I have been using this source and product for the last 5 years. Allserviceand the baterys haveben very satisfactory.</li>
            <li> Quick service by Amazon. Low failure rate, most last four days and more. Good price.&lt;br /&gt;Keep it up and I will keep coming back..</li>
            <li> Fantastic Deal. No problems whatsoever with these off market batteries.</li>
            <li> These batteries last as long as the ones my sister-in-law gives me which are more expensive. I will continue to use these! They were also shipped quickly so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about running out.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I bought these because of the price. No matter how much I pay for the batteries for my Mom&#x27;s  hearing aides they die in 3 days. These last just as long as the expensive ones. Great buy!</li>
            <li> batteries work good and are cheaper.</li>
            <li> In the past, these were much cheaper, but they are now much closer in price to name brands. Nonetheless, they are still a cost-effective solution to the weekly replacement problem. They seem to be consistent in capacity and performance.</li>
            <li> That is the kind of order that will make me coming back for more</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, product came in good Nick.</li>
            <li> Excellent buy. Expiration date on the batteries is October 2017!</li>
            <li> I was hoping for them to last longer, but they are still only about 2 days.  However, the cost is extremely good.</li>
            <li> Batteries were received.</li>
            <li> Other batteries I&#x27;ve purchased were 1.45v &amp; they definitely lasted longer.</li>
            <li> I have been using Zenipower batteries for a couple of years now and truly trust them.  But recently I purchased what I thought were Zenipower batteries from The Hearing Aid Club, and what I received did not say anything about Zenipower on them whatsoever !  When I questioned this, I was told by The Hearing Aid Club that Zenipower has allowed them to put their (the Hearing Aid Club) name on the packages, but they were supposedly ZeniPower batteries.  I wasn&#x27;t at all happy about that, as I had no real way of knowing what I was getting.  Hearing Aid Club, was very agreeable in letting me return them if I wished to.  However, I decided to keep them for a trial run and see how they do.  So far this is the first week of using them and they seem to last as long as Zenipower without any glitches.  But this seems like a bait and switch tactic they are using, showing the image of ZeniPower batteries, knowing full well they won&#x27;t be sending that to you.</li>
            <li> These batteries appear to work well in my earring aid. You can&#x27;t beat the cost.</li>
            <li> Excellent product which I have bought previously</li>
            <li> Very poor. Some batteries lasted 4 hours, some a day, some 2 days. I let the batteries stand at least 5 minutes after taking the protector off. Rayovacs last 4 to 6 days. Zenipowers are not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Batteries don&#x27;t last as long as others</li>
