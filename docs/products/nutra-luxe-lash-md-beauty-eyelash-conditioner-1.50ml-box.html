            <li>but I cannot give a fair eyelash growth review</li>
            <li>I thought that it would be just a good product for conditioning lashes while they grew out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good stuff.  </li>
            <li>All good.</li>
            <li>My Daughter was using this with great results, so I bought my own.  </li>

            <li>You&#x27;re gonna love this stuff!</li>
            <li>This product is absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li>Amazing....</li>
            <li>This retailer has amazing service.</li>
            <li>Trully amazing.</li>
            <li>A friend turned me on to LuxLash because she was thrilled with it.</li>
            <li>I have used nutra lash before and really liked it</li>
            <li>Here is the answer from my own experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I looked like God had blessed me with the most gorgeous eye lashes you&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li>Then, my own.</li>
            <li>nice lash lengthening but does not work over night.</li>
            <li>Pros:   - VERY easy to apply   </li>
            <li>I am not even putting mascara anymore, and when I do on special occasions, they are just amazing!</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the great price !  </li>
            <li>People notice how nice my eyebrows are more than my eyelashes...can you believe it?</li>
            <li>Easy to use!</li>
            <li>It seems too good to be true, but it is.  </li>
            <li>What more can I say.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 6 months now, and I love it.</li>
            <li>And at the price offered at Amazon, it&#x27;s more than a bargain.....</li>
            <li>Will buy more.</li>
            <li>BUT the shipping was prompt and issue free!</li>
            <li>just looks better.</li>
            <li>Best product ever for eyelashes and especially eyebrows!</li>
            <li>I love my lashes</li>
            <li>and I just love it.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any more growth.</li>
            <li>But I still love it.</li>
            <li>Just make sure it dries before going to bed.</li>
            <li>I withdrew the brush and “lined” both top and bottom of eyes without redipping on nightly applications as suggested.  </li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this product and appreciate all the input that enticed me to try this.  </li>
            <li>So if you are going to try it, make sure you stick with it for 2 months before you make your decision.</li>
            <li>and this is taking care of the problem plus more eyelashes</li>
            <li>I have the occasssional fallout that pre-menopausal women do, but overall, I am very happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>Ok, so here is a question that no one seems to have an answer to: what happens when you stop using it?</li>
            <li>Ladies - 9 months later, I have the most beautiful eye lashes ever!</li>
            <li>I never had lashes most of my life.  </li>
            <li>I am satisfied &amp; will continue to use.</li>
            <li>I see my lashes are longer and more of them.</li>
            <li>or if I was feeling okay.</li>
            <li>I love my lashes.</li>
            <li>This product really works great.</li>
            <li>Tried this and love it.</li>
            <li>I will continue using it to see better results.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>My brows have filled in somewhat and my lashes are longer and fuller!</li>
            <li>Wish they made this stuff for hair on top of your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that it helps strengthen and lengthen my lashes and everyone</li>
            <li>At the time I saw this it was rated #1 of two top products for eyelash growth.  </li>
            <li>.product is good price is all right.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try this based on reviews...</li>
            <li>It is easily applied, and can be used on both top and bottom lashes.  </li>
            <li>I paid more than twice as much for this at a state fair booth.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin but experienced no irritation with this product.</li>
            <li>my eye sight is more important.</li>
            <li>My waxer noticed that my brows have gotten much thicker and longer (which is good).</li>
            <li>I love it so much!!!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice it at first, but maybe after 4 weeks, it seemed they just magically were longer and fuller!</li>
            <li>but I am totally excited and pleased with this product</li>
            <li>So easy to put it on every day.  </li>
            <li>I just purchased my 5th bottle, and this is easy to purchase on Amazon or Ebay.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I still needed eyelashes because mine are fine.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone who wants thicker, beautiful eye lashes.</li>
            <li>I know a lot of women experienced irritation, but I figured it was cheap enough to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>The length is fantastic and continues to improve.  </li>
            <li>so I restarted and now they are fabulous again.</li>
            <li>This product really works and your lashes will look amazing in about 8 to 10 weeks.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and relatively inexpensive.</li>
            <li>By the way, I&#x27;ve used it daily for 4 years now, and it&#x27;s still great.</li>
            <li>I used the product only at night and my eyes were irritated and bloodshot both mornings after that lasted a good 24 hours before feeling better.</li>
            <li>But if what happened to me happens to you, I just wanted you to know that there is a cure - good old Castor Oil!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really DID work!!!</li>
            <li>I use this on my brows mostly since they seem to disappear more each year as I get older.</li>
            <li>I have used it for more than a year now - no side effects - just gorgeous long eyelashes and brows.  </li>
            <li>I saw a significant difference after about 3 months.</li>
            <li>I originally purcashed Nutra Luxe Lash MD in February.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is worth any price; buy it here and save lots!</li>
            <li>had* come off, and what I was seeing was a significantly darker lash line.  </li>
            <li>many people are commenting on how pretty they are.  </li>
            <li>I am thrilled beyond words to see this at the ripe age of 58 years young!</li>
            <li>it did not appear to be full.  </li>
            <li>so I thick this product is SUPERB and no side affects</li>
            <li>Keep in mind, I didn&#x27;t really grow more lashes, just my already existing lashes are now to the point that I can feel the ends curl up to my eyelid after I curl them and add mascara.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased that this product is so much more affordable and gives me the same results as Latisse.</li>
            <li>was hoping I&#x27;d be one of those that this worked quickly for</li>
            <li>but my eyesight is very important, more so than long eyelashes.    </li>
            <li>This product has helped to keep most of my brows and grow new brows in the sparse areas.</li>
            <li>I m pretty sure they are not selling the real stuff.</li>
            <li>I was scared at first and stopped using for about a week, then some one told me about using an eye cream, to lessen the effect, and I&#x27;m hooked again!</li>
            <li>and my eyes get very light sensitive and watery.</li>
            <li>Overall, this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>all promising fantastic results that yielded zip.  </li>
            <li>The amazing part is that it actually works.  </li>
            <li>It is worth trying...</li>
            <li>took about 2mos., but definately worth the wait.  </li>
            <li>My 52 year old daughter had even better results.</li>
            <li>I got about 2 weeks worth of product out of it.  </li>
            <li>Worth buying, I&#x27;d recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li>I do not feel that this product is worth the money</li>
            <li>I will forewarn, your eyelid and under eye area may turn a bit dark, but I&#x27;ve found by using a good eye cream in the area, preferably one with Hydroquinone, will take away the darkness quickly.</li>
            <li>just right.  </li>
            <li>So I researched eyelash enhancers at [...], and although this product was rated #4 out of (7) highly rated contenders, it ranked high in many areas aside from just price, and I could easily find it on the net.    </li>
            <li>but it really helps lashes to GROW!</li>
            <li>The first one lasted a year for me.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this, but do keep in mind they might itch a bit at first.  </li>
            <li>Within about five to six weeks, the results were evident......</li>
            <li>I saw results the first week.  </li>
            <li>The first lasted around 4 months.</li>
            <li>Second time ordering it and have recommended it to friends who also love it.</li>
            <li>I paid $24 for my first purchase of this product, and $154 for my Latisse.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>used it first on the brows to minimize it on my eyelids.</li>
            <li>Almost immediately after the first use of this product, I noticed that my eyelashes stopped falling out.  </li>
            <li>My aunt gifted me a bottle of this from a day spa for over DOUBLE the price I was able to find my second tube on Amazon for.</li>
            <li>I did experience a lot of redness the morning after my first application - but had read reviews stating this was a possibility.</li>
            <li>so I cannot put an exact result on this product.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product consistently for a month and my lashes are longer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had short, stubby eyelashes all my life, and no matter how much or what kind of mascara I purchased, nothing made them look even halfway decent.  </li>
            <li>The product lasts a long time...very happy with me long lushes eye lashes!</li>
            <li>I started using this when I saw my cousin with those long, curly eye lashes when she woke up in the morning, I sincerely though she had extensions.</li>
            <li>love the long lashed but</li>
            <li>After a couple of months of using Nutra lash conditioner my lashes were long and really healthy looking.</li>
            <li>My lashes have stayed very long and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I have been a long-term Latisse user, but my lashes would reach a certain length and then stop.  </li>
            <li>(I think I grew a few more!)   </li>
            <li>it actually worked and quickly!</li>
            <li>Cons:   - Try not to get it in your eye, it stings a little (but it&#x27;s not harmful)   - Not so effective on eyebrows  </li>
            <li>It worked very well.  </li>
            <li>My lashes really are longer and darker after a couple of months.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li>This product really works.  </li>
            <li>It really works...</li>
            <li>My lashes are much longer &amp; thicker than they were.</li>
            <li>This absolutely works.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get really nothing out of it</li>
            <li>Tip: when applying oil do not put too much on, it will get in your eyes and you&#x27;ll be</li>
            <li>very uncomfortable).&lt;br</li>
            <li>am giving them for starts because the product really does do what it says</li>
            <li>Stick with it it works really well but takes about a month to really see results</li>
            <li>After using this product for 3 months, I really see a noticeable difference in my lashes.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much Nutra lash MD, Lyn C Austin TX</li>
            <li>wish there was some way to tell how much is in the container.</li>
            <li>This is not a scam--- this stuff really works.</li>
            <li>but why pay so much when u can get it for cheaper</li>
            <li>My eyebrows are much fuller and darker.  </li>
            <li>My eyelashes have lengthened and are straight now.</li>
            <li>you can tell recommend this product highly!</li>
            <li>This really works.  </li>
            <li>This has really helped my self esteem.  </li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>I am glad that I read some of the other reviews and gave it a chance.</li>
            <li>Have seen better results on other people.</li>
            <li>So obviously this is not the original Product but has some impacts on your eyes and lashes.</li>
            <li>I have always had issues with my short, straight, sparse, blond eyelashes and after reading so many positive reviews I finally gave in to try this.  </li>
            <li>My daughter used this product with amazing results and gave me the small container to use.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised and highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>It prevents the lashes from falling out before they reach their full growth potential...</li>
            <li>I want it to promote new hair growth!</li>
            <li>- See results in a couple of days or weeks   - Quick, simple   </li>
            <li>My lashes were thinning as I got older.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been able to test adequately, because there was only enough to last 2 weeks-using it once a day as directed.</li>
            <li>eyelids became super red and looked like I had allergies.</li>
            <li>I have used the more expensive brand of Lilash, but am just as satisfied with the Nutra Luxe.  </li>
            <li>The older we get, the lighter and fewer our lashes and eyebrows get.</li>
            <li>this product was highly recommended but it did nothing for my lashes at all.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend  that you try this product .</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>That is why I give the product the high rating because I know I have issues.</li>
            <li>Of course the first few days my eyes got irritated but after a week my eyes were fine</li>
            <li>the lashes themselves, you can see a good result after a few weeks, and if you&#x27;re persistent, they will become so long that they will start curling.</li>
            <li>They are not as long as they were with Nutra Luxe but they are long, thick and beautiful!</li>
            <li>And, most importantly, no discoloration whatsoever.</li>
            <li>My lashes are past my eyebrows,it&#x27;s cheap on amazon.$80 in stores, $80 would be worth it</li>
            <li>I have tried Latisse with good results but stopped using it because it was too irritating -</li>
            <li>I was not very careful the first week and everyone thought I&#x27;ve been crying!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did it the same way I applied the Nutra Luxe product (along the growth line), and then applied some oil right on my lashes.</li>
            <li>It says on the package: Disclaimer: Conditioner is not intended to treat, prevent, cure, relieve, resolve stop or reduce hair loss or to promote new hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;Umm</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather put that money towards something that does claim to promote new hair growth.</li>
            <li>Ironically, when I started using a non-BeautyLash growth product, within a couple of weeks there was new growth.  </li>
            <li>Product arrived promptly and was new and sealed packaging.  </li>
            <li>People have commented that they like the new mascara and eye liner I am using</li>
            <li>Pretty nice item, haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to say if the results are real but I do see a little amelioration</li>
            <li>and I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still on my first 1.5 ml tube, and there&#x27;s quite some left in there.</li>
            <li>I am not sure this is authentic product.</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>My lashes are so long right now from using this product.</li>
            <li>, initally the area of my eyelid close to lash were mildly tender and the whites of my eyes were pink.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 16 years old, and I&#x27;m VERY sensitive to mascara.</li>
            <li>First, the newly acquired long ones.</li>
            <li>My brows are filled out, my lashes grew very long, and moderately thicker.  </li>
            <li>The application is easy and there is no strong fragrance or irritation.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive eyes or anything</li>
            <li>- Not messy at all   </li>
            <li>Maybe it is old and not working like it</li>
            <li>so maybe I&#x27;m not as sensitive as some.</li>
            <li>Lashes are not as lush as I thought they should be.  </li>
            <li>purchased smallest volume and it has lasted two months so far, still counting.</li>
            <li>I am 78 years old.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d read that it sometimes takes this stuff weeks to work, so that&#x27;s what I was prepared for:  to wait weeks before seeing anything really noticeably different about my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>have red hair (not Weasley red, more like Isla Fisher red), so my eyelashes aren&#x27;t very obvious without mascara.  </li>
            <li>It was encouraging, but it wasn&#x27;t exactly unexpected.</li>
            <li>can* say that now, without the aid of mascara or eyeliner, my eyes look like I&#x27;ve got a natural cat&#x27;s eye lash line.  </li>
            <li>mother suggested an old remedy - Castor Oil.</li>
            <li>I have had problems with being sensitive to some make-up products</li>
            <li>And some people (like my mother, who wears a thick eye liner top and bottom) don&#x27;t mind the discoloration.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older, my brows were starting to disappear.  </li>
            <li>strongly suggest it to people who want long lashes but do not necessarily like putting makeup on every single morning.</li>
            <li>Even after losing some of lashes when my xtreme lashes were growing out, it did not take long for my real lashes to grow.</li>
            <li>I can not believe how long my real lashes are when I wash off the mascara.</li>
            <li>and my eyelashes are about one and a half times their original (quite short) length.</li>
            <li>now, I just take a few more seconds each morning and I am careful and there&#x27;s no problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Friends have said it can take 3+ months to show major results.</li>
            <li>They were not as full or long after a few months,  but I jumped back on and they were back to being long and full.</li>
            <li>I have been applying at least 5 days out of 7 every week for 2 months, and this week is when I noticed a huge difference in the length of my lashes.</li>
            <li>I wish the container were clear so that I could tell easier when the product is getting low.</li>
            <li>I noticed the brush applicator was barely damp when I applied it to my lash line and had to keep dipping it to get anything.  </li>
            <li>I was just wearing eye liner to conceal this disaster and thought that my pretty little eye lashes were gone forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It DID burn for the first few uses, but not at all after about a week.</li>
            <li>they are very long and lush</li>
            <li>After chemo when everything grew back, my eyebrows were much sparser and my eyelashes were thinner and growing in at odd angles.</li>
            <li>And you shouldn&#x27;t either, they talk about some warranty and then later claim there isn&#x27;t - whoever deals with this account should be fired for being so rude, luckily for them</li>
            <li>The first two days I had pink circles around eyes, After that my eyelids were darker and deeper than other days.</li>
            <li>I was using it regularly and found that my lashes were actually getting a little longer and darker, so I kept it going to see if it really worked.</li>

            <li> but I cannot give a fair eyelash growth review</li>
            <li> I thought that it would be just a good product for conditioning lashes while they grew out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good stuff.  </li>
            <li> All good.</li>
            <li> My Daughter was using this with great results, so I bought my own.  </li>

            <li> You&#x27;re gonna love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li> Amazing....</li>
            <li> This retailer has amazing service.</li>
            <li> Trully amazing.</li>
            <li> A friend turned me on to LuxLash because she was thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> I have used nutra lash before and really liked it</li>
            <li> Here is the answer from my own experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I looked like God had blessed me with the most gorgeous eye lashes you&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> Then, my own.</li>
            <li> nice lash lengthening but does not work over night.</li>
            <li> Pros:   - VERY easy to apply   </li>
            <li> I am not even putting mascara anymore, and when I do on special occasions, they are just amazing!</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the great price !  </li>
            <li> People notice how nice my eyebrows are more than my eyelashes...can you believe it?</li>
            <li> Easy to use!</li>
            <li> It seems too good to be true, but it is.  </li>
            <li> What more can I say.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 6 months now, and I love it.</li>
            <li> And at the price offered at Amazon, it&#x27;s more than a bargain.....</li>
            <li> Will buy more.</li>
            <li> BUT the shipping was prompt and issue free!</li>
            <li> just looks better.</li>
            <li> Best product ever for eyelashes and especially eyebrows!</li>
            <li> I love my lashes</li>
            <li> and I just love it.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any more growth.</li>
            <li> But I still love it.</li>
            <li> Just make sure it dries before going to bed.</li>
            <li> I withdrew the brush and “lined” both top and bottom of eyes without redipping on nightly applications as suggested.  </li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this product and appreciate all the input that enticed me to try this.  </li>
            <li> So if you are going to try it, make sure you stick with it for 2 months before you make your decision.</li>
            <li> and this is taking care of the problem plus more eyelashes</li>
            <li> I have the occasssional fallout that pre-menopausal women do, but overall, I am very happy with this product.  </li>
            <li> Ok, so here is a question that no one seems to have an answer to: what happens when you stop using it?</li>
            <li> Ladies - 9 months later, I have the most beautiful eye lashes ever!</li>
            <li> I never had lashes most of my life.  </li>
            <li> I am satisfied &amp; will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I see my lashes are longer and more of them.</li>
            <li> or if I was feeling okay.</li>
            <li> I love my lashes.</li>
            <li> This product really works great.</li>
            <li> Tried this and love it.</li>
            <li> I will continue using it to see better results.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> My brows have filled in somewhat and my lashes are longer and fuller!</li>
            <li> Wish they made this stuff for hair on top of your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that it helps strengthen and lengthen my lashes and everyone</li>
            <li> At the time I saw this it was rated #1 of two top products for eyelash growth.  </li>
            <li> .product is good price is all right.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this based on reviews...</li>
            <li> It is easily applied, and can be used on both top and bottom lashes.  </li>
            <li> I paid more than twice as much for this at a state fair booth.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin but experienced no irritation with this product.</li>
            <li> my eye sight is more important.</li>
            <li> My waxer noticed that my brows have gotten much thicker and longer (which is good).</li>
            <li> I love it so much!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice it at first, but maybe after 4 weeks, it seemed they just magically were longer and fuller!</li>
            <li> but I am totally excited and pleased with this product</li>
            <li> So easy to put it on every day.  </li>
            <li> I just purchased my 5th bottle, and this is easy to purchase on Amazon or Ebay.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I still needed eyelashes because mine are fine.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone who wants thicker, beautiful eye lashes.</li>
            <li> I know a lot of women experienced irritation, but I figured it was cheap enough to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> The length is fantastic and continues to improve.  </li>
            <li> so I restarted and now they are fabulous again.</li>
            <li> This product really works and your lashes will look amazing in about 8 to 10 weeks.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and relatively inexpensive.</li>
            <li> By the way, I&#x27;ve used it daily for 4 years now, and it&#x27;s still great.</li>
            <li> I used the product only at night and my eyes were irritated and bloodshot both mornings after that lasted a good 24 hours before feeling better.</li>
            <li> But if what happened to me happens to you, I just wanted you to know that there is a cure - good old Castor Oil!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really DID work!!!</li>
            <li> I use this on my brows mostly since they seem to disappear more each year as I get older.</li>
            <li> I have used it for more than a year now - no side effects - just gorgeous long eyelashes and brows.  </li>
            <li> I saw a significant difference after about 3 months.</li>
            <li> I originally purcashed Nutra Luxe Lash MD in February.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is worth any price; buy it here and save lots!</li>
            <li> had* come off, and what I was seeing was a significantly darker lash line.  </li>
            <li> many people are commenting on how pretty they are.  </li>
            <li> I am thrilled beyond words to see this at the ripe age of 58 years young!</li>
            <li> it did not appear to be full.  </li>
            <li> so I thick this product is SUPERB and no side affects</li>
            <li> Keep in mind, I didn&#x27;t really grow more lashes, just my already existing lashes are now to the point that I can feel the ends curl up to my eyelid after I curl them and add mascara.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased that this product is so much more affordable and gives me the same results as Latisse.</li>
            <li> was hoping I&#x27;d be one of those that this worked quickly for</li>
            <li> but my eyesight is very important, more so than long eyelashes.    </li>
            <li> This product has helped to keep most of my brows and grow new brows in the sparse areas.</li>
            <li> I m pretty sure they are not selling the real stuff.</li>
            <li> I was scared at first and stopped using for about a week, then some one told me about using an eye cream, to lessen the effect, and I&#x27;m hooked again!</li>
            <li> and my eyes get very light sensitive and watery.</li>
            <li> Overall, this product is amazing.</li>
            <li> all promising fantastic results that yielded zip.  </li>
            <li> The amazing part is that it actually works.  </li>
            <li> It is worth trying...</li>
            <li> took about 2mos., but definately worth the wait.  </li>
            <li> My 52 year old daughter had even better results.</li>
            <li> I got about 2 weeks worth of product out of it.  </li>
            <li> Worth buying, I&#x27;d recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> I do not feel that this product is worth the money</li>
            <li> I will forewarn, your eyelid and under eye area may turn a bit dark, but I&#x27;ve found by using a good eye cream in the area, preferably one with Hydroquinone, will take away the darkness quickly.</li>
            <li> just right.  </li>
            <li> So I researched eyelash enhancers at [...], and although this product was rated #4 out of (7) highly rated contenders, it ranked high in many areas aside from just price, and I could easily find it on the net.    </li>
            <li> but it really helps lashes to GROW!</li>
            <li> The first one lasted a year for me.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this, but do keep in mind they might itch a bit at first.  </li>
            <li> Within about five to six weeks, the results were evident......</li>
            <li> I saw results the first week.  </li>
            <li> The first lasted around 4 months.</li>
            <li> Second time ordering it and have recommended it to friends who also love it.</li>
            <li> I paid $24 for my first purchase of this product, and $154 for my Latisse.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> used it first on the brows to minimize it on my eyelids.</li>
            <li> Almost immediately after the first use of this product, I noticed that my eyelashes stopped falling out.  </li>
            <li> My aunt gifted me a bottle of this from a day spa for over DOUBLE the price I was able to find my second tube on Amazon for.</li>
            <li> I did experience a lot of redness the morning after my first application - but had read reviews stating this was a possibility.</li>
            <li> so I cannot put an exact result on this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product consistently for a month and my lashes are longer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had short, stubby eyelashes all my life, and no matter how much or what kind of mascara I purchased, nothing made them look even halfway decent.  </li>
            <li> The product lasts a long time...very happy with me long lushes eye lashes!</li>
            <li> I started using this when I saw my cousin with those long, curly eye lashes when she woke up in the morning, I sincerely though she had extensions.</li>
            <li> love the long lashed but</li>
            <li> After a couple of months of using Nutra lash conditioner my lashes were long and really healthy looking.</li>
            <li> My lashes have stayed very long and healthy.  </li>
            <li> I have been a long-term Latisse user, but my lashes would reach a certain length and then stop.  </li>
            <li> (I think I grew a few more!)   </li>
            <li> it actually worked and quickly!</li>
            <li> Cons:   - Try not to get it in your eye, it stings a little (but it&#x27;s not harmful)   - Not so effective on eyebrows  </li>
            <li> It worked very well.  </li>
            <li> My lashes really are longer and darker after a couple of months.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> This product really works.  </li>
            <li> It really works...</li>
            <li> My lashes are much longer &amp; thicker than they were.</li>
            <li> This absolutely works.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get really nothing out of it</li>
            <li> Tip: when applying oil do not put too much on, it will get in your eyes and you&#x27;ll be</li>
            <li> very uncomfortable).&lt;br</li>
            <li> am giving them for starts because the product really does do what it says</li>
            <li> Stick with it it works really well but takes about a month to really see results</li>
            <li> After using this product for 3 months, I really see a noticeable difference in my lashes.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much Nutra lash MD, Lyn C Austin TX</li>
            <li> wish there was some way to tell how much is in the container.</li>
            <li> This is not a scam--- this stuff really works.</li>
            <li> but why pay so much when u can get it for cheaper</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are much fuller and darker.  </li>
            <li> My eyelashes have lengthened and are straight now.</li>
            <li> you can tell recommend this product highly!</li>
            <li> This really works.  </li>
            <li> This has really helped my self esteem.  </li>
            <li> WOW!!!</li>
            <li> I am glad that I read some of the other reviews and gave it a chance.</li>
            <li> Have seen better results on other people.</li>
            <li> So obviously this is not the original Product but has some impacts on your eyes and lashes.</li>
            <li> I have always had issues with my short, straight, sparse, blond eyelashes and after reading so many positive reviews I finally gave in to try this.  </li>
            <li> My daughter used this product with amazing results and gave me the small container to use.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised and highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> It prevents the lashes from falling out before they reach their full growth potential...</li>
            <li> I want it to promote new hair growth!</li>
            <li> - See results in a couple of days or weeks   - Quick, simple   </li>
            <li> My lashes were thinning as I got older.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been able to test adequately, because there was only enough to last 2 weeks-using it once a day as directed.</li>
            <li> eyelids became super red and looked like I had allergies.</li>
            <li> I have used the more expensive brand of Lilash, but am just as satisfied with the Nutra Luxe.  </li>
            <li> The older we get, the lighter and fewer our lashes and eyebrows get.</li>
            <li> this product was highly recommended but it did nothing for my lashes at all.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend  that you try this product .</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> That is why I give the product the high rating because I know I have issues.</li>
            <li> Of course the first few days my eyes got irritated but after a week my eyes were fine</li>
            <li> the lashes themselves, you can see a good result after a few weeks, and if you&#x27;re persistent, they will become so long that they will start curling.</li>
            <li> They are not as long as they were with Nutra Luxe but they are long, thick and beautiful!</li>
            <li> And, most importantly, no discoloration whatsoever.</li>
            <li> My lashes are past my eyebrows,it&#x27;s cheap on amazon.$80 in stores, $80 would be worth it</li>
            <li> I have tried Latisse with good results but stopped using it because it was too irritating -</li>
            <li> I was not very careful the first week and everyone thought I&#x27;ve been crying!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did it the same way I applied the Nutra Luxe product (along the growth line), and then applied some oil right on my lashes.</li>
            <li> It says on the package: Disclaimer: Conditioner is not intended to treat, prevent, cure, relieve, resolve stop or reduce hair loss or to promote new hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;Umm</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather put that money towards something that does claim to promote new hair growth.</li>
            <li> Ironically, when I started using a non-BeautyLash growth product, within a couple of weeks there was new growth.  </li>
            <li> Product arrived promptly and was new and sealed packaging.  </li>
            <li> People have commented that they like the new mascara and eye liner I am using</li>
            <li> Pretty nice item, haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to say if the results are real but I do see a little amelioration</li>
            <li> and I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still on my first 1.5 ml tube, and there&#x27;s quite some left in there.</li>
            <li> I am not sure this is authentic product.</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> My lashes are so long right now from using this product.</li>
            <li> , initally the area of my eyelid close to lash were mildly tender and the whites of my eyes were pink.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 16 years old, and I&#x27;m VERY sensitive to mascara.</li>
            <li> First, the newly acquired long ones.</li>
            <li> My brows are filled out, my lashes grew very long, and moderately thicker.  </li>
            <li> The application is easy and there is no strong fragrance or irritation.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive eyes or anything</li>
            <li> - Not messy at all   </li>
            <li> Maybe it is old and not working like it</li>
            <li> so maybe I&#x27;m not as sensitive as some.</li>
            <li> Lashes are not as lush as I thought they should be.  </li>
            <li> purchased smallest volume and it has lasted two months so far, still counting.</li>
            <li> I am 78 years old.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d read that it sometimes takes this stuff weeks to work, so that&#x27;s what I was prepared for:  to wait weeks before seeing anything really noticeably different about my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> have red hair (not Weasley red, more like Isla Fisher red), so my eyelashes aren&#x27;t very obvious without mascara.  </li>
            <li> It was encouraging, but it wasn&#x27;t exactly unexpected.</li>
            <li> can* say that now, without the aid of mascara or eyeliner, my eyes look like I&#x27;ve got a natural cat&#x27;s eye lash line.  </li>
            <li> mother suggested an old remedy - Castor Oil.</li>
            <li> I have had problems with being sensitive to some make-up products</li>
            <li> And some people (like my mother, who wears a thick eye liner top and bottom) don&#x27;t mind the discoloration.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older, my brows were starting to disappear.  </li>
            <li> strongly suggest it to people who want long lashes but do not necessarily like putting makeup on every single morning.</li>
            <li> Even after losing some of lashes when my xtreme lashes were growing out, it did not take long for my real lashes to grow.</li>
            <li> I can not believe how long my real lashes are when I wash off the mascara.</li>
            <li> and my eyelashes are about one and a half times their original (quite short) length.</li>
            <li> now, I just take a few more seconds each morning and I am careful and there&#x27;s no problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Friends have said it can take 3+ months to show major results.</li>
            <li> They were not as full or long after a few months,  but I jumped back on and they were back to being long and full.</li>
            <li> I have been applying at least 5 days out of 7 every week for 2 months, and this week is when I noticed a huge difference in the length of my lashes.</li>
            <li> I wish the container were clear so that I could tell easier when the product is getting low.</li>
            <li> I noticed the brush applicator was barely damp when I applied it to my lash line and had to keep dipping it to get anything.  </li>
            <li> I was just wearing eye liner to conceal this disaster and thought that my pretty little eye lashes were gone forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It DID burn for the first few uses, but not at all after about a week.</li>
            <li> they are very long and lush</li>
            <li> After chemo when everything grew back, my eyebrows were much sparser and my eyelashes were thinner and growing in at odd angles.</li>
            <li> And you shouldn&#x27;t either, they talk about some warranty and then later claim there isn&#x27;t - whoever deals with this account should be fired for being so rude, luckily for them</li>
            <li> The first two days I had pink circles around eyes, After that my eyelids were darker and deeper than other days.</li>
            <li> I was using it regularly and found that my lashes were actually getting a little longer and darker, so I kept it going to see if it really worked.</li>
            <li> Unlike other products that serve the same purpose, it has had no side effects on me (and I have sensitive eyes).  </li>
            <li> Longer lashes in 3-4 weeks (not sure how long really, because the results snuck up on me!).</li>
            <li> I carefully noted tips from reviewers as I have a sensitive eye area that has forced me to throw away many eye liners because of negative reaction similar to pre- conjunctivitis.  </li>
            <li> People have commented because my lashes are so long, and I&#x27;m Asian.</li>
            <li> my lower lashes got so long I had to stop using it, but they got short again</li>
            <li> I have my long lashes coming back!</li>
            <li> The skepticism didn&#x27;t last long!  </li>
            <li> Keep using daily, and you won&#x27;t even remember NOT having long lashes!</li>
            <li> Then I tried &amp;#34;lash enhancements&amp;#34; and found them to be expensive and to fall off too easily.</li>
            <li> I am a cancer survivor and have continually loose my lashes, using this product the lashes are back in a couple of weeks, longer and thicker.</li>
            <li> when that happens don,t stop  completely, just use it a few times a week,,, which is doable.</li>
            <li> between the two, my lashes are really long.</li>
            <li> this point, I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s making my lashes longer, but I haven&#x27;t been using it for long.  </li>
            <li> - gives you ridiculously long lashes (and they do warn you about the discoloration).</li>
            <li> My eyelashes have never been this long.</li>
            <li> I bought in the past other &amp;#34; growing lashes&amp;#34; products with 0 results but this really works.</li>
            <li> I have used three other products for eyelash growth and this is the only one that irritated my eyes each time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a month now and the first couple of weeks my eyes did itch a little, but my lashes are longer and no more itching.</li>
            <li> You have to be very careful to not put some in your eyes, or else they will become red.</li>
            <li> And I just now purchased it again, so it lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li> The product is dry</li>
            <li> Eyes also feel dry.</li>
            <li> Some times, my eyes would be bloodshot the next day if I was careless and got some on my eye, but honestly worth it.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t make the eyes as irritated as some of the more expensive, heavily advertised ones.  </li>
            <li> I used it for over a month on the eyebrows, there was no new growth.  </li>
            <li> my lids got so dark (blue/black/brown/eggplant color), that I started to look like either a sick or, perhaps, an abused individual (I  only applied the product on top lashes, otherwise my eye all around would look bruised up).</li>
            <li> It take a while to see results, but will continue to use it to see if it helps my lashes.it burns a little, but doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> I have terrible lashes normally and now they look amazing.</li>
            <li> When I purchased a bottle from this specific (Nutra Luxe) account, MY BOTTLE HAD LITTLE TO NOTHING INSIDE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a little over a month</li>
            <li> My lashes grew a lot in the short few weeks</li>
            <li> Regardless, I spent the money and wanted to try it out.  </li>
            <li> It made my lashes grow long, thick, dark and still made them look natural.</li>
            <li> Waited a few days and tried it again, just in case, with same result.&lt;br</li>
            <li> * Only a few lashes grew longer....</li>
            <li> I know someone that uses Latisse and her lashes are long, but not full at all.</li>
            <li> I had lost some lashes in areas  due to some unknown reason and a friend told me about this products.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that my lashes are so long that they touch the lenses on some of my sunglasses, so I just don&#x27;t wear those anymore.  </li>
            <li> Tonight though (literally ten minutes ago), after I washed my face, I was in front of the mirror getting really annoyed because my eyeliner wasn&#x27;t coming off, and the directions say to put this stuff on bare skin.  </li>
            <li> A little it does go a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably just me, as I have other friends who have used it for months without a problem.</li>
            <li> so this product i&#x27;m not saying it won&#x27;t work for eyelash growth, i just can&#x27;t continue to use it due to irritation.</li>
            <li> I have not had any problems with other lash growth products, but there is something in this one that cause irritation.</li>
            <li> My lashes have been thinning for the past several years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other lash enhancers and they did not even come close to the results I get using Nutra Luxe Lash.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was astounded when after my usual mascara application, I used an eyelash curler and could really actually see eyelashes!  </li>
            <li> I have followed other suggestions to not &#x27;dip the applicator&#x27; after applying to one eye.</li>
            <li> I was applying it in the evening about every other day.  </li>
            <li> Use daily and in a few weeks, you&#x27;ll have longer and darker lashes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Latisse and had great results despite it being a little irritating, this however is just irritating with uneven, poor results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not super smokey and sultry, like I&#x27;ve spent minutes getting it</li>
            <li> I looked like I had perpetual pinkeye - plus my eyelids got quite dark from it.</li>
            <li> I have dark hair</li>
            <li> After a month there were a few long lashes, completely uneven.</li>
            <li> Definetly not worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too busy to complain to someone of higher rank...</li>
            <li> Her lashes are much longer - they look like false lashes!</li>
            <li> And that is not how it went down for me at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried other lash growing products with NO success!</li>
            <li> This product did not irritate either, just a slight redness, which I could cover with eye liner.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for two and a half months</li>
            <li> In a month, I had lashes that were long, thick and dark.  </li>
            <li> I am a previous Lattise user, yet the price became prohibitive.  </li>
            <li> I started to notice the skin around my eyes were looking a little dark.</li>
            <li> Some of the others were difficult to find, and when I did, the priced in as high as Latisse.    </li>
            <li> I also let the liquid dry well (at least an hour) before going to sleep.  </li>
            <li> You will see results in a little as three weeks.  </li>
            <li> but I decided to buy it on Amazon for a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> I just get a little redness.</li>
            <li> This product lasted me a little over a month.</li>
            <li> I have used this for two months now and my lashes are thicker and a little longer.  </li>
            <li> I now have used the product for 4 months, no tenderness and little redness..........</li>
            <li> , my lashes seem a little bit longer.</li>
            <li> A little foundation hides the redness.</li>
            <li> Stopped using this for a few months and my lashes did not fall out.</li>
            <li> have been using it for a few years now and get compliments All of the time.  </li>
            <li> I tried &amp;#34;Latisse&amp;#34; but it dried and irritated my eyes.</li>
            <li> You can see a change in a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Really disliked this product.</li>
            <li> It floored me; I hadn&#x27;t expected to see results for at least a</li>
            <li> In a few months, my lashes were all sparse, broken, and ridiculously short</li>
            <li> I have a thyroid disorder that unfortunately has left me with very few tiny eyelashes and hardly any brows</li>
            <li> However, they are not darker or fuller - just thin and long.  </li>
            <li> Takes approximately 5 weeks to see results, but then your lashes are popping out so long and fuller!</li>
            <li> unfortunately I noticed last few times I bought it from this seller it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> it makes my eyes red and painful next morning after each use&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was EXTREMELY SKEPTICAL, but the results are SO OBVIOUS!</li>
            <li> I usually bring is a gift when visiting my family in Europe.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I thought my environmental allergies were acting up, it took five days for me to connect it to the BeautyLash.  </li>
            <li> Usually 2-3 times a week.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past</li>
            <li> I also apply it to my brow area where I had over plucked in the past</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works because of the reaction to the product after 1 day.</li>
            <li> I paid 1/2 the price through Amazon that I usually paid to my aesthetician.</li>
            <li> Not sure on the growth yet</li>
            <li> (they were thin due to thyroid disease)</li>
            <li> It is a lot less expensive than some of the other products out there.  </li>
            <li> Had an bad allergic reaction eyes became extremely red and swollen from using it Only Once not happy with product</li>
            <li> Needless to say this bottle is dry.  </li>
            <li> I do have a bit of darkening on my eyelids but it isn&#x27;t hardly noticable.</li>
            <li> and I have a hard time with my scalp hair as well as my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product on the recommendation of a lash professional when my lashes broke off after some bad lash extensions.</li>
            <li> I will not buy this again, at least not from here.</li>
            <li> At least, they should have warned us about that too.</li>
            <li> my upper eyelashes are so  VERY THICK !!</li>
            <li> I did not look like I had ridiculous extensions put on or anything like that.</li>
            <li> I bought this and it irritated my eyes so bad that they stayed red all the time.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use some commercial eye makeup because I have a bad reaction to it.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy received product to barely had any in it</li>
            <li> I stopped:&lt;br /&gt;Slowly (very slowly, about 8-10 weeks)</li>
            <li> but the seal was broken on my bottle and  </li>
            <li> Plus, I had a bit of irritation and itching with Latisse which was frustrating</li>
            <li> should not be a secret.  </li>
            <li> but I said I have a secret from using this product.</li>
            <li> My lashes had taken a bashing from having false individuals put on for some time.</li>
            <li> When I read the directions I was a little bit disappointed by it</li>
            <li> and I am sorry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted!</li>
            <li> My salon stylist told me about NutraLuxe Lash MD, and I was intrigued, but skeptical.  </li>
            <li> Just apply it every evening before bed, and without fail, it will work.  </li>
            <li> I am a terrible skeptic having disposed of numerous items through the years</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong -</li>
            <li> So, needless to say, I had to stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> if my eyelashes are fake, some people don&#x27;t believe me that they are my lashes.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews with a skeptical view but decided to take a chance and try this stuff.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference until I had been using it for about 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> :  Expensive and does not fulfill promises of fuller thicker and darker</li>
            <li> I mean, I was standing there with lotion and q-tips, completely frustrated, when I looked in the mirror and realized my eyeliner</li>
            <li> but this time I think I got a bad tube of it.</li>
            <li> Disappointed</li>
            <li> Me and my friend had allergy reaction:(</li>
            <li> I have health issues and I&#x27;m thinking the lack of any response has a physiological base or there&#x27;s a medication interference somewhere.</li>
            <li> Timely delivery, but very disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed because I did notice length to my lashes however, for the price I dropped on this product it would not trust to buy it again.</li>
            <li> Made my eyes burn terribly!</li>
            <li> Horrible customer service</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I receved rather promptly but the seal was broken on my bottle and  it did not appear to be full.  Didn&#x27;t even get a chance to use it. Had to return! I may reorder this item.</li>
            <li> It take a while to see results, but will continue to use it to see if it helps my lashes.it burns a little, but doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> It worked very well.  My lashes grew a lot in the short few weeks I used it.  However, it did cause a pinkish hue and dryness on my upper lids and below my eyes.  It&#x27;s probably just me, as I have other friends who have used it for months without a problem.</li>
            <li> this product was highly recommended but it did nothing for my lashes at all. Disappointed</li>
            <li> This stuff works.  What more can I say.</li>
            <li> I have used numerous products for eyelash growth but I have never had any issues with them.  I applied the MD Lash at night only before bed.  The rest of the next day my eyes are burning.  I am now only using this on my eyebrows, don&#x27;t know if this will work and I am sorry but I cannot give a fair eyelash growth review but my eyesight is very important, more so than long eyelashes.    Update, it works great on my eyebrows so yes it does grow hair but if it bothers your eyes, don&#x27;t use it there, we cannot compromise our vision and comfort for longer eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I have used three other products for eyelash growth and this is the only one that irritated my eyes each time. I used the product only at night and my eyes were irritated and bloodshot both mornings after that lasted a good 24 hours before feeling better. As I type this they are red and irritated. I don&#x27;t have sensitive eyes or anything so this product i&#x27;m not saying it won&#x27;t work for eyelash growth, i just can&#x27;t continue to use it due to irritation.</li>
            <li> Works just as advertised!  Couldn&#x27;t believe it...but it really helps lashes to GROW!</li>
            <li> Made my eyes red and encrusted in the morning.  Stopped using it after 4 days.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on the recommendation of a lash professional when my lashes broke off after some bad lash extensions. I thought that it would be just a good product for conditioning lashes while they grew out. I was using it regularly and found that my lashes were actually getting a little longer and darker, so I kept it going to see if it really worked. My lashes really are longer and darker after a couple of months. You just have to be diligent about using it.&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m addicted!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this.  Her lashes are much longer - they look like false lashes!</li>
            <li> I used this product for ONLY 2 days and noticed a BIG difference in my lashes! It is amazing and YES it DOES WORK!!!</li>
            <li> So...I had been getting lash extensions for over 6 months and they started thinning my lashes SEVERELY. Decided to take a break. The \\&quot;lash-tician\\&quot; suggested this product. It DID burn for the first few uses, but not at all after about a week. I was EXTREMELY SKEPTICAL, but the results are SO OBVIOUS! I didn&#x27;t notice it at first, but maybe after 4 weeks, it seemed they just magically were longer and fuller! I was pleasantly surprised and highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> This is the second tube i purchase.  The first one lasted a year for me.  Everyone compliments me on my eyelashes, they even think i have falsies!  Totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been a long-term Latisse user, but my lashes would reach a certain length and then stop.  Plus, I had a bit of irritation and itching with Latisse which was frustrating - my eyes always looked as though I&#x27;d recently been in tears.  My salon stylist told me about NutraLuxe Lash MD, and I was intrigued, but skeptical.  The skepticism didn&#x27;t last long!  I could see a noticeable difference in eyelash length and thickness after only three weeks, and had NONE of the irritation I&#x27;d had with Latisse.  It is easily applied, and can be used on both top and bottom lashes.  The length is fantastic and continues to improve.  I absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I too had problems with this making my eyes bloodshot and irritated. I have not had any problems with other lash growth products, but there is something in this one that cause irritation.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this based on reviews... but I&#x27;m going to send it back. It says on the package: Disclaimer: Conditioner is not intended to treat, prevent, cure, relieve, resolve stop or reduce hair loss or to promote new hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;Umm, then why did I buy this? I want it to promote new hair growth! I&#x27;d rather put that money towards something that does claim to promote new hair growth.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I usually bring is a gift when visiting my family in Europe. unfortunately I noticed last few times I bought it from this seller it didn&#x27;t work. I m pretty sure they are not selling the real stuff. the price is great, but the stuff doesn&#x27;t work. get it somewhere else!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a month now and the first couple of weeks my eyes did itch a little, but my lashes are longer and no more itching. I would recommend this, but do keep in mind they might itch a bit at first.  Great product and a great price!</li>
            <li> My lashes have been thinning for the past several years.  In an effort to save money, I took a chance on BeautyLash.  What a mistake that was!  For days, I had itchy, swollen eyes.  Sadly, I thought my environmental allergies were acting up, it took five days for me to connect it to the BeautyLash.  Within a day of stopping, my swelling, redness, and itching were gone.  Since then, I started using a slightly more expensive lash growth product with no side effects.   Since I couldn&#x27;t use BeautyLash on my eyelashes, I started using it on my thinning eyebrows.  I used it for over a month on the eyebrows, there was no new growth.  Ironically, when I started using a non-BeautyLash growth product, within a couple of weeks there was new growth.  BeautyLash was a bust for me but maybe it would work for someone else. If you have any sort of allergies, I recommend avoiding this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 16 years old, and I&#x27;m VERY sensitive to mascara. I didn&#x27;t want to spend 100+ dollars on an eyelash enhancer, and Nutra Luxe MD seemed the best. When I read the directions I was a little bit disappointed by it saying that it is not to be used under the age of 18. Regardless, I spent the money and wanted to try it out.  Pros:   - VERY easy to apply   - Not messy at all   - See results in a couple of days or weeks   - Quick, simple   - Longer/thicker eyelashes (I think I grew a few more!)   - If you skip a night or two, it won&#x27;t diminish the results  Cons:   - Try not to get it in your eye, it stings a little (but it&#x27;s not harmful)   - Not so effective on eyebrows  Overall, this product is amazing. I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars just simply because of the eyebrow part. This might be because sometimes the area gets waxed.</li>
            <li> Love this product. This is my second time ordering. Highly recommend this. My lashes are a lot longer. Noticeably longer. People have commented because my lashes are so long, and I&#x27;m Asian. Everyone thinks I have extensions. I saw a significant difference after about 3 months. I would use it almost every night before bed. Some times, my eyes would be bloodshot the next day if I was careless and got some on my eye, but honestly worth it. Stopped using this for a few months and my lashes did not fall out. They were not as full or long after a few months,  but I jumped back on and they were back to being long and full. I know someone that uses Latisse and her lashes are long, but not full at all. Almost stringy.</li>
            <li> Great product, if you want to look like a junkie, that is. My lashes looked fantastic, but after several people commenting on my red, tired eyes on a daily basis, I finally got the hint and threw this one out. I used Rapid Lash before with no problems, so I guess experimenting with a different (and cheaper)product came back to bite me in the rear.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the irritation seemed to linger and the discoloration on the edges of my eyelids are just starting to fade after three months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Approach this one with caution.</li>
            <li> it,s awesome... it actually worked and quickly! my lower lashes got so long I had to stop using it, but they got short again so I restarted and now they are fabulous again. I read in the directions when that happens don,t stop  completely, just use it a few times a week,,, which is doable. my upper eyelashes are so  VERY THICK !! never have been like that, ever, so I thick this product is SUPERB and no side affects</li>
            <li> I started using this when I saw my cousin with those long, curly eye lashes when she woke up in the morning, I sincerely though she had extensions. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 6 months now, and I love it. You have to be very careful to not put some in your eyes, or else they will become red. I was not very careful the first week and everyone thought I&#x27;ve been crying!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now, I just take a few more seconds each morning and I am careful and there&#x27;s no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the lashes themselves, you can see a good result after a few weeks, and if you&#x27;re persistent, they will become so long that they will start curling. I am not even putting mascara anymore, and when I do on special occasions, they are just amazing! I now put the product about once per 2-3 days since my lashes reached the length I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly suggest it to people who want long lashes but do not necessarily like putting makeup on every single morning.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing.  If it worked for me, then it will definitely work for anyone.  I&#x27;ve had short, stubby eyelashes all my life, and no matter how much or what kind of mascara I purchased, nothing made them look even halfway decent.  I originally purcashed Nutra Luxe Lash MD in February.  Within about five to six weeks, the results were evident......couldn&#x27;t believe it.  And I just now purchased it again, so it lasts a very long time.  Just apply it every evening before bed, and without fail, it will work.  And at the price offered at Amazon, it&#x27;s more than a bargain.....trust me, I&#x27;ve checked.  Go for it and you&#x27;ll be thrilled with the results!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a BIG fan of this product and have been a customer for years. When I purchased a bottle from this specific (Nutra Luxe) account, MY BOTTLE HAD LITTLE TO NOTHING INSIDE. AND IT WASNT EVEN SEALED WHEN I received it in the mail. Don&#x27;t take any chances like I did!</li>
            <li> A friend turned me on to LuxLash because she was thrilled with it. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants thicker, beautiful eye lashes.</li>
            <li> i alternate between this product which seems to moisturize my lashes and helps with length, and latisse.  between the two, my lashes are really long.</li>
            <li> I love it! It does what it says it will! I highly recommend this product to anyone! Just try and see</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this product, which is the only reason I bought it.  I saw results the first week.  My lashes were thinning as I got older.  They now are darker, longer and fuller then ever.  I do. Not use the product every night, as it states is  necessary to maintain the results.  Usually 2-3 times a week.  This product did not irritate either, just a slight redness, which I could cover with eye liner.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t grow my lashes at all. it makes my eyes red and painful next morning after each use&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this anyone.</li>
            <li> Product arrived promptly and was new and sealed packaging.  Definitely have noticeably longer eyelashes.  Will buy more.</li>
            <li> I got this product on the recommendation of a friend.  It did take 3-4 weeks to notice a difference in the length of my lashes but I am totally excited and pleased with this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other lash enhancers and they did not even come close to the results I get using Nutra Luxe Lash.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for a few years now and get compliments All of the time.  People ask what I use and I tell them.&lt;br /&gt;This should not be a secret.  It&#x27;s good stuff.  You will see results in a little as three weeks.  Just have to use it once a day&lt;br /&gt;and that&#x27;s it.... Simple as pie</li>
            <li> All good. .product is good price is all right. Great stuff!!!:)&lt;br /&gt;My friend totally likes it as well. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have tried Latisse with good results but stopped using it because it was too irritating - I looked like I had perpetual pinkeye - plus my eyelids got quite dark from it. I don&#x27;t have those problems with this product. I have been using it for two and a half months and my eyelashes are about one and a half times their original (quite short) length. I am so pleased that this product is so much more affordable and gives me the same results as Latisse. I apply it nightly and I&#x27;m still on my first 1.5 ml tube, and there&#x27;s quite some left in there. I am attaching a photo where I compare my Latisse results with the growth I had from Nutra Luxe Lash MD.</li>
            <li> Have not seen any results yet. I use it every night. Maybe it is old and not working like it should. Costly for something that doesn&#x27;t do what it says it will.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a couple weeks so I cant speak for how it works yet BUT the shipping was prompt and issue free!</li>
            <li> Takes approximately 5 weeks to see results, but then your lashes are popping out so long and fuller!</li>
            <li> This product really works.  It took about six weeks and my lashes grew!  I had lost some lashes in areas  due to some unknown reason and a friend told me about this products.  It is a lot less expensive than some of the other products out there.  You have to be consistant and use it every night.</li>
            <li> Been wearing eyelash extensions forever and just did not want to continue. So, my lashes were sparse from the extensions so bought Nutra luxe and now am so happy! I have my long lashes coming back! I have tried other lash growing products with NO success! This is awesome!</li>
            <li> It actually works. I had my doubts but my lashes grew longer. They did not reach the end if my eye lash curler and now they go beyond it. I wouldn&#x27;t say they are tons thicker but it is definaty noticeable. People have commented that they like the new mascara and eye liner I am using but it is the same as before, just looks better. I bought a second bottle. The first lasted around 4 months. It never irritated my eyelids or burned my eyes. I have dark hair so maybe I&#x27;m not as sensitive as some.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!! Best product ever for eyelashes and especially eyebrows! WOW!!! If you want results, and no side effects...GET THIS NOW!!!</li>
            <li> It really works... My eyelashes have grown and have gotten fuller!  Amazing! It is worth trying... I love it so much!!!</li>
            <li> My Daughter was using this with great results, so I bought my own.  I love my lashes they are very long and lush took about 2mos., but definately worth the wait.  I will continue to buy this prodct.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and I just love it.  The biggest difference with buying it from Amazon is getting a great price!  This product really works and your lashes will look amazing in about 8 to 10 weeks.</li>
            <li> My lashes definitely grew, but after three months.. I didn&#x27;t see any more growth. But I still love it. I apply on my lashes every night.</li>
            <li> It delivered what it advertised!  This was my second tube.  My lashes are much longer &amp; thicker than they were.</li>
            <li> Not only did my eyes turned red and itchy after using it for 6 week, I did not see any difference in the length of my lashes.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working! My lashes appeared to be thicker in just three weeks. Easy to use! Just make sure it dries before going to bed.</li>
            <li> I am a terrible skeptic having disposed of numerous items through the years all promising fantastic results that yielded zip.  I have always had issues with my short, straight, sparse, blond eyelashes and after reading so many positive reviews I finally gave in to try this.  I carefully noted tips from reviewers as I have a sensitive eye area that has forced me to throw away many eye liners because of negative reaction similar to pre- conjunctivitis.  Nightly I withdrew the brush and “lined” both top and bottom of eyes without redipping on nightly applications as suggested.  I also let the liquid dry well (at least an hour) before going to sleep.  I have been doing this for almost four weeks now and only recently noticed a change in my eyelash length.  I was astounded when after my usual mascara application, I used an eyelash curler and could really actually see eyelashes!  I am thrilled beyond words to see this at the ripe age of 58 years young! I am so pleased with this product and appreciate all the input that enticed me to try this.  I will use this forever if possible!</li>
            <li> I am a cancer survivor and have continually loose my lashes, using this product the lashes are back in a couple of weeks, longer and thicker.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Longer lashes</li>
            <li> It really DID work!!! Amazing....&lt;br /&gt;Just be patient, took me 4 months to see the result! The best product ever.</li>
            <li> Have noticed no difference and have been using for a month.</li>
            <li> So I have to admit, I thought it wasn&#x27;t doing anything at all for the longest time. The salon where I got my xtreme lash extensions sold it but I decided to buy it on Amazon for a little cheaper. I am glad that I read some of the other reviews and gave it a chance. Even after losing some of lashes when my xtreme lashes were growing out, it did not take long for my real lashes to grow. I have been applying at least 5 days out of 7 every week for 2 months, and this week is when I noticed a huge difference in the length of my lashes. Keep in mind, I didn&#x27;t really grow more lashes, just my already existing lashes are now to the point that I can feel the ends curl up to my eyelid after I curl them and add mascara. So if you are going to try it, make sure you stick with it for 2 months before you make your decision.</li>
            <li> I tried &amp;#34;Latisse&amp;#34; but it dried and irritated my eyes. Then I tried &amp;#34;lash enhancements&amp;#34; and found them to be expensive and to fall off too easily. I still needed eyelashes because mine are fine. After using this product for two weeks I noticed my lashes were starting to grow. In a month, I had lashes that were long, thick and dark.  I have since given a tube to my sister ho is seeing the same results. This is a great product and relatively inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the great price !  I paid more than twice as much for this at a state fair booth.  The amazing part is that it actually works.  You can see a change in a few weeks.  My lashes are longer, thicker, and actually curl by themselves !  So easy to put it on every day.  This stuff is worth any price; buy it here and save lots!</li>
            <li> I bought this and it irritated my eyes so bad that they stayed red all the time. Didn&#x27;t see any growth what so ever. If I could send it back I would!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> Third time I have bought it.  It works.  The reason I bought it was cause one of the girls I worked with has the longest eyelashes.  Asked her and this is what she uses.  It works is all I can say.</li>
            <li> I use this on my brows mostly since they seem to disappear more each year as I get older. This product has helped to keep most of my brows and grow new brows in the sparse areas.</li>
            <li> This absolutely works. I was concerned about one of my eyebrows thinning and this is taking care of the problem plus more eyelashes</li>
            <li> My lashes are definitely longer and a bit fuller. It seems to be working well. I also apply it to my brow area where I had over plucked in the past and I have noticed some hair growth. I wish the container were clear so that I could tell easier when the product is getting low.</li>
            <li> Really disliked this product. Made my eyes burn terribly! Do not recommend purchasing this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a little over a month and I am very pleased with the results!</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  Works well.  Second time ordering it and have recommended it to friends who also love it.</li>
            <li> Had an bad allergic reaction eyes became extremely red and swollen from using it Only Once not happy with product</li>
            <li> Very unhappy received product to barely had any in it</li>
            <li> Give it time....I started to see results after about 3 months....still using it 5 months later and they&#x27;re still growing.  The product lasts a long time...very happy with me long lushes eye lashes!</li>
            <li> I entered this purchase not expecting the best results.  I am a previous Lattise user, yet the price became prohibitive.  So I researched eyelash enhancers at [...], and although this product was rated #4 out of (7) highly rated contenders, it ranked high in many areas aside from just price, and I could easily find it on the net.    So I made an initial purchase in 9/2012, and began seeing results in about 6 weeks, much earlier than I did with Latisse.  I paid $24 for my first purchase of this product, and $154 for my Latisse.  It&#x27;s a no-brainer for me.    I have been using this product for 5 months and my lashes are looking great.  I have the occasssional fallout that pre-menopausal women do, but overall, I am very happy with this product.  I just purchased my 5th bottle, and this is easy to purchase on Amazon or Ebay.  Some of the others were difficult to find, and when I did, the priced in as high as Latisse.    Hope this helped someone.</li>
            <li> Timely delivery, but very disappointed in the product. Haven&#x27;t been able to test adequately, because there was only enough to last 2 weeks-using it once a day as directed.</li>
            <li> Lashes are not as lush as I thought they should be.  Have seen better results on other people.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. purchased smallest volume and it has lasted two months so far, still counting. No side effects when used as directed. Would purchase again. This retailer has amazing service.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! Wanted longer lashes but didn&#x27;t want to pay the price for Latisse. Will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> It does what it says.  My brows are filled out, my lashes grew very long, and moderately thicker.  I am 78 years old.  My 52 year old daughter had even better results.</li>
            <li> This product made my eye watery with red discoloration. My pupils looked dialated. Not sure if it works because of the reaction to the product after 1 day.</li>
            <li> I have used nutra lash before and really liked it but this time I think I got a bad tube of it. The product is dry I can&#x27;t get really nothing out of it have to dip the brush several times to even get anything out. My last one I dipped once and it was perfect. I will not buy this product again. This time around has not worked at all for me.</li>
            <li> I used this product for two weeks and my lashes are longer and fuller now by %20-30,they also look silkier.&lt;br /&gt;It burns my eyes the day after I use it and my eyes get very light sensitive and watery. The first two days I had pink circles around eyes, After that my eyelids were darker and deeper than other days. Eyes also feel dry. I have use only one stroke to cover both eyes and brows. used it first on the brows to minimize it on my eyelids. But still it has side effects. It is not mentioned here that the it contains Prostaglandin but in the actual insert in its box it is in one of the ingredients. I have emailed the Nutraluxe Manufacture and they said that they don&#x27;t have any rep. or seller here on Amazon and they don&#x27;t know where this product is coming from. So obviously this is not the original Product but has some impacts on your eyes and lashes. I will not buy this again, at least not from here. love the long lashed but my eye sight is more important.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d read that it sometimes takes this stuff weeks to work, so that&#x27;s what I was prepared for:  to wait weeks before seeing anything really noticeably different about my eyelashes.  And that is not how it went down for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have red hair (not Weasley red, more like Isla Fisher red), so my eyelashes aren&#x27;t very obvious without mascara.  Almost immediately after the first use of this product, I noticed that my eyelashes stopped falling out.  It was encouraging, but it wasn&#x27;t exactly unexpected. Tonight though (literally ten minutes ago), after I washed my face, I was in front of the mirror getting really annoyed because my eyeliner wasn&#x27;t coming off, and the directions say to put this stuff on bare skin.  I mean, I was standing there with lotion and q-tips, completely frustrated, when I looked in the mirror and realized my eyeliner *had* come off, and what I was seeing was a significantly darker lash line.  It floored me; I hadn&#x27;t expected to see results for at least a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point, I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s making my lashes longer, but I haven&#x27;t been using it for long.  I *can* say that now, without the aid of mascara or eyeliner, my eyes look like I&#x27;ve got a natural cat&#x27;s eye lash line.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong - it&#x27;s not super smokey and sultry, like I&#x27;ve spent minutes getting it just right.  But it is there, it is noticeable, and it does make a difference.  All of that, and I&#x27;ve been using it for maybe two weeks.</li>
            <li> Ok, so here is a question that no one seems to have an answer to: what happens when you stop using it? Here is the answer from my own experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While using it:&lt;br /&gt;The best product ever! It made my lashes grow long, thick, dark and still made them look natural. I did not look like I had ridiculous extensions put on or anything like that. I looked like God had blessed me with the most gorgeous eye lashes you&#x27;ve ever seen. I was happy. Very happy. Until....my lids got so dark (blue/black/brown/eggplant color), that I started to look like either a sick or, perhaps, an abused individual (I  only applied the product on top lashes, otherwise my eye all around would look bruised up). So, needless to say, I had to stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I stopped:&lt;br /&gt;Slowly (very slowly, about 8-10 weeks) the discoloration went away. The lashes were falling out, kept falling. First, the newly acquired long ones. Then, my own. In a few months, my lashes were all sparse, broken, and ridiculously short (it looked like I took a pair of scissors to them and gave them a trim). There was no mascara on the market that would &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; the problem. It was unfixable. Six months later - still no lashes. I was just wearing eye liner to conceal this disaster and thought that my pretty little eye lashes were gone forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I got my lashes back:&lt;br /&gt;My mother suggested an old remedy - Castor Oil. So, I took the stick from the Nutra Luxe, washed it off and used it to apply castor oil on my lashes. I did it the same way I applied the Nutra Luxe product (along the growth line), and then applied some oil right on my lashes. Ladies - 9 months later, I have the most beautiful eye lashes ever! They are not as long as they were with Nutra Luxe but they are long, thick and beautiful! And, most importantly, no discoloration whatsoever. Tip: when applying oil do not put too much on, it will get in your eyes and you&#x27;ll be very uncomfortable).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nutra Luxe does not cause the discoloration on everyone. It varies from person to person. And some people (like my mother, who wears a thick eye liner top and bottom) don&#x27;t mind the discoloration. But if what happened to me happens to you, I just wanted you to know that there is a cure - good old Castor Oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving them for starts because the product really does do what it says - gives you ridiculously long lashes (and they do warn you about the discoloration). However, after you stop using the product, you shouldn&#x27;t have to deal with a disaster. At least, they should have warned us about that too.</li>
            <li> This lash conditioner does make your lashes thicker and longer.  It also doesn&#x27;t make the eyes as irritated as some of the more expensive, heavily advertised ones.  The price is also great.  I paid 1/2 the price through Amazon that I usually paid to my aesthetician. I am adding to this review after purchasing the item several times.  It is still great.  I actually have longer, thicker lashes.  I never had lashes most of my life.  This is a great invention.  I just get a little redness.</li>
            <li> Hoped this would be comparable to GRANDE LASH MD, even looks like package, but I could not use it.  Waking up the next morning with red eyes that felt like I was getting conjunctivitis.  Waited a few days and tried it again, just in case, with same result.&lt;br /&gt;Received return label from seller.</li>
            <li> Stick with it it works really well but takes about a month to really see results</li>
            <li> This product lasted me a little over a month. I started to notice the skin around my eyes were looking a little dark. I discontinued use. *** Only a few lashes grew longer....***</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Latisse and had great results despite it being a little irritating, this however is just irritating with uneven, poor results.&lt;br /&gt;My eyelids became super red and looked like I had allergies. After a month there were a few long lashes, completely uneven. I returned the product.</li>
            <li> It is really good for the lashes!  I have purchased this twice now and will do so again.  Thank you</li>
            <li> After using this product for 3 months, I really see a noticeable difference in my lashes.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this for two months now and my lashes are thicker and a little longer.  You have to give this product time to work as hair grows in 3 month cycles.  Three months is the time you would want to give a product like this to see if it is working for you.  I admit I was suprised.  I had irritated eyes initially but it went away. I like he product....it does what it says but don&#x27;t use it for two weeks and think it does not work.  It will work but remember the growth cycle.  It prevents the lashes from falling out before they reach their full growth potential...that is how it works.</li>
            <li> My lashes had taken a bashing from having false individuals put on for some time. After a couple of months of using Nutra lash conditioner my lashes were long and really healthy looking. Thank you so much Nutra lash MD, Lyn C Austin TX</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!! Grows my lashes so awesome! My aunt gifted me a bottle of this from a day spa for over DOUBLE the price I was able to find my second tube on Amazon for. I ordered several of these and gave them as Christmas gifts because all my friends and family were asking what I was using. Everyone had similar results as I am! Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Not sure on the growth yet but I am keeping optimistic. I need to remember to apply every day. Thank you</li>
            <li> After a month of use, I&#x27;ve noticed my lashes are a bit thicker and have &#x27;expanded&#x27; across my lash line and my lashes are longer.  I did experience a lot of redness the morning after my first application - but had read reviews stating this was a possibility. The redness did go away throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish there was some way to tell how much is in the container. I have followed other suggestions to not &#x27;dip the applicator&#x27; after applying to one eye. A little it does go a long way so I figure there is plenty left in the tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product did meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> I think this is working. Friends have said it can take 3+ months to show major results. I am using for 1 month. My lashes seem fuller &amp; I don&#x27;t have to curl them!!  I am satisfied &amp; will continue to use. No side effects. Doesn&#x27;t burn or itch at all and I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was worried that this product would irritate my eyes and it has not. I have definitely seen results from it after about 3-4 weeks!</li>
            <li> Maybe prodact work well . Me and my friend had allergy reaction:(</li>
            <li> Pretty nice item, haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to say if the results are real but I do see a little amelioration</li>
            <li> I can not believe how long my real lashes are when I wash off the mascara. This is not a scam--- this stuff really works. Highly recommend. Much better than fake eyelashes that inevitability damage your regular eyelashes. I see my lashes are longer and more of them. Love this product!</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews before using this product.  I know a lot of women experienced irritation, but I figured it was cheap enough to give it a try.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 9 months now and haven&#x27;t had any irritation and have had my dream eyelashes since about week 6 of using it.  It seems too good to be true, but it is.  I would definitely recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> Best product ever! My lashes are past my eyebrows,it&#x27;s cheap on amazon.$80 in stores, $80 would be worth it but why pay so much when u can get it for cheaper....I get asked all the time if my eyelashes are fake, some people don&#x27;t believe me that they are my lashes. Of course the first few days my eyes got irritated but after a week my eyes were fine</li>
            <li> This product made my eyes red almost immediately after applying it. I would wake up the next morning and I&#x27;d constantly have people asking me if I was under the influence of something or if I was feeling okay. Definetly not worth it.</li>
            <li> I am not sure this is authentic product.</li>
            <li> My daughter used this product with amazing results and gave me the small container to use.  I used it a.m. and p.m., initally the area of my eyelid close to lash were mildly tender and the whites of my eyes were pink.  I now have used the product for 4 months, no tenderness and little redness..........I can handle that as my lashes are longer than they have ever been....many people are commenting on how pretty they are.  My only complaint is that my lashes are so long that they touch the lenses on some of my sunglasses, so I just don&#x27;t wear those anymore.  I love my lashes. I&#x27;ve recommended the product to everyone who comments on my lashes.</li>
            <li> This product really works great. I have terrible lashes normally and now they look amazing. I would highly recommend  that you try this product .</li>
            <li> I got about 2 weeks worth of product out of it.  I was applying it in the evening about every other day.  I noticed the brush applicator was barely damp when I applied it to my lash line and had to keep dipping it to get anything.  Needless to say this bottle is dry.  Very disappointed because I did notice length to my lashes however, for the price I dropped on this product it would not trust to buy it again.</li>
            <li> Since, I have gotten this product I have not seen any results. This must be like those products where you need several applications overtime and you will see results.  However, I am still using the product so I cannot put an exact result on this product.</li>
            <li> No kidding, you use it and they will grow and grow. I bought in the past other &amp;#34; growing lashes&amp;#34; products with 0 results but this really works. Worth buying, I&#x27;d recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> Went through chemo and lost my hair, including eyebrows and eyelashes. After chemo when everything grew back, my eyebrows were much sparser and my eyelashes were thinner and growing in at odd angles. Tried this and love it. Took about 2 weeks before seeing results. My eyebrows are much fuller and darker.  My eyelashes have lengthened and are straight now. I never ran into any eye stinging issues reported by others but I also did follow the directions and applied the recommended amount.</li>
            <li> This product made my eyes so red i haven&#x27;t been inspired to use it at all. I was told you must use it always for it to keep working.</li>
            <li> Horrible customer service I will never purchase this item again.... And you shouldn&#x27;t either, they talk about some warranty and then later claim there isn&#x27;t - whoever deals with this account should be fired for being so rude, luckily for them I&#x27;m too busy to complain to someone of higher rank...</li>
            <li> Well I have been using this product since month and 8 days and it has been working well, my lashes seem a little bit longer. I will continue using it to see better results.</li>
            <li> My lashes are so long right now from using this product. I will forewarn, your eyelid and under eye area may turn a bit dark, but I&#x27;ve found by using a good eye cream in the area, preferably one with Hydroquinone, will take away the darkness quickly. Also, don&#x27;t worry - once you stop using the product the dark area will go back to its normal color. I was scared at first and stopped using for about a week, then some one told me about using an eye cream, to lessen the effect, and I&#x27;m hooked again!</li>
            <li> It made my eyes red and swollen</li>
            <li> This is the third time I&#x27;ve purchased this product. I love it. My eyelashes have never been this long. I also use it on my eyebrows (they were thin due to thyroid disease) it made them grow in thicker.  I have had problems with being sensitive to some make-up products but I&#x27;ve had no sensitivity to Nutra Luxe. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Dont work. My eye lash es are the same size</li>
            <li> nice lash lengthening but does not work over night. gotta use it daily.</li>
            <li> Great product! Will buy again</li>
            <li> My lashes grow and grow when I quit using it you can tell recommend this product highly!</li>
            <li> This really works.  My eye lashes are longer and thicker than they have ever been.  I definately recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!!!  My lashes are longer and thicker , you will ser the results in a week!!!</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews with a skeptical view but decided to take a chance and try this stuff. I have a thyroid disorder that unfortunately has left me with very few tiny eyelashes and hardly any brows either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping I&#x27;d be one of those that this worked quickly for but unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference until I had been using it for about 6 weeks. But I can definitely see a big difference now. My brows have filled in somewhat and my lashes are longer and fuller! Wish they made this stuff for hair on top of your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also was worried that I would have an allergic reaction like some others have. I can&#x27;t use some commercial eye makeup because I have a bad reaction to it. But I never had any reaction at all.</li>
            <li> I have used the more expensive brand of Lilash, but am just as satisfied with the Nutra Luxe.  I have used it for more than a year now - no side effects - just gorgeous long eyelashes and brows.  As I&#x27;ve gotten older, my brows were starting to disappear.  My waxer noticed that my brows have gotten much thicker and longer (which is good).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for three years.  Unlike other products that serve the same purpose, it has had no side effects on me (and I have sensitive eyes).  My lashes have stayed very long and healthy.  It took about 1 month for me to notice a difference.  In the beginning I used it daily, now I use it once a week for the same results.</li>
            <li> wow! Longer lashes in 3-4 weeks (not sure how long really, because the results snuck up on me!). Trully amazing. I have very sensitive skin but experienced no irritation with this product.</li>
            <li> This product was for my wife but we got the product in time and I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li> I have been using this product consistently for a month and my lashes are longer.  However, they are not darker or fuller - just thin and long.  Since my lashes are not darker the difference is unnoticeable without mascara.  I do not feel that this product is worth the money and I hope to try something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  The application is easy and there is no strong fragrance or irritation.  A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Expensive and does not fulfill promises of fuller thicker and darker lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over 2 years and I always get compliments on my lashes. My eyes are blue and I haven&#x27;t had problems with my eye color changing. I do have a bit of darkening on my eyelids but it isn&#x27;t hardly noticable. I love that it helps strengthen and lengthen my lashes and everyone thinks I have extensions!</li>
            <li> Great product!  This is my third time to order!</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are thicker and longer than before.  So, my aunt asked me &amp;#34;do I do eyelashes extention? &amp;#34;...she thought I do...but I said I have a secret from using this product.</li>
            <li> At the time I saw this it was rated #1 of two top products for eyelash growth.  I didn&#x27;t get it at the time, because I was using another one.  The one I was using didn&#x27;t do anything and&lt;br /&gt;neither has this. HOWEVER, I don&#x27;t believe this is a fault of the product.  I have health issues and I&#x27;m thinking the lack of any response has a physiological base or there&#x27;s a medication interference somewhere. When I see my doctor later this month I will discuss the issue with him.  That is why I give the product the high rating because I know I have issues.</li>
            <li> I have to stay on an oral form of chemo and I have a hard time with my scalp hair as well as my eyelashes.  This has really helped my self esteem.  I started using 2x a day but now I only use at bedtime.  These are the longest my eyelashes have ever been.  A little foundation hides the redness.</li>
            <li> You see the eyelashes growing by the 3rd to 4th week of using the product nightly.  The eyelashes are fuller and longer.  Then you should use it once a week</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re gonna love this stuff! Use daily and in a few weeks, you&#x27;ll have longer and darker lashes! Keep using daily, and you won&#x27;t even remember NOT having long lashes! Use on your eyebrows too! People notice how nice my eyebrows are more than my eyelashes...can you believe it? The older we get, the lighter and fewer our lashes and eyebrows get. This gel changes all that, so don&#x27;t worry! By the way, I&#x27;ve used it daily for 4 years now, and it&#x27;s still great.</li>
