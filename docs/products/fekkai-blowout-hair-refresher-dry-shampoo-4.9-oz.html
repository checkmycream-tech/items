            <li>, it&#x27;s great.  </li>

            <li>The merchant is great, but the product is garbage.</li>
            <li>It is working great for me.  </li>

            <li>I started using this product today and love it!  </li>
            <li>This product was great and took the grease right out.</li>
            <li>Love the product but the pump on</li>
            <li>This does not but has a great fresh fragrance and is light with no powder.</li>
            <li>If it weren&#x27;t for the packaging, I would love this product.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s light and refreshing, not overburdening like a lot of products out there.</li>

            <li>Received this product free from influenster.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Smell delicious unbelievable.</li>
            <li>I cannot seem to clean the spout.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a pain to clean it.  </li>
            <li>I want to love this product, I really do.</li>
            <li>Spray doesn&#x27;t work, so product does not come out, and you&#x27;re stuck with a brand-new can full of product in it, and no way to get it out.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells and feels in my hair, I love how easy it is to use, and it does exactly what a dry shampoo should.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light that I couldn&#x27;t even feel it in my hair, but it really does its job.  </li>
            <li>I was given a complimentary bottle of this product to test and review.  </li>
            <li>I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.  </li>
            <li>I did receive these products for complimentary testing purposes in all review materials.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair too soft or too stiff - its perfect!</li>
            <li>Fekkai&#x27;s dry shampoo has the best scent I&#x27;ve come across in the dry shampoo realm thus far, and I&#x27;m a sucker for great fragrances!</li>
            <li>I had to scrub it with a toothbrush under hot water to get it to work everytime I tried to use it.  </li>
            <li>But men the smell is just amazing that u would probably buy their other products like shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>My husband thinks it smells light and fresh, but I thought it was too strong and gave me a little headache two out of the three days</li>
            <li>This is a great dey shampoo, it leaves hair feeling clean and refreshed without weighing it down like some dry shampoos can.</li>
            <li>Seriously, it smells great, it doesn&#x27;t feel like hairspray in my hair, it adds volume</li>
            <li>I love using it to add extra volume to my long but fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;I was gifted both the texturizer gel and the dry shampoo spray.</li>
            <li>Love the scent and works better than other dry shampoos I have tried.</li>
            <li>I must admit I used it a whole weekend without needing to wash my hair even once.</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t oily and is also not frizzy from too much washing.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Definitely my favorite dry shampoo!!!</li>
            <li>Dry shampoo offers me a good alternative to daily washing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of dry shampoos and so far, this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>The smell is divine--better than any other dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used--and it&#x27;s so light and absorbs oils magically.</li>
            <li>This dry shampoo is just as good as any other I&#x27;ve tried but goes on invisible, which I</li>
            <li>I had to buy a whole new bottle.</li>
            <li>I love washing my hair but have been trying to improve the quality of my hair by washing it less.</li>
            <li>I love the texture it gives my hair, especially in these cooler temps.&lt;br /&gt;The dry shampoo doesn&#x27;t leave even the slightest hint of residue and smells glorious!</li>
            <li>I have used this specific product for years and this is the first that this has happened.</li>
            <li>That I paid more for than I usually spend on hair care.</li>
            <li>Not really a big deal, but something to be aware of</li>
            <li>Great after a lunch run when you don&#x27;t have time to wash and dry thick hair!</li>
            <li>became clogged with more than half the product left.</li>
            <li>The spray itself goes on clear</li>
            <li>I used it--however, I am definitely prone to headaches and migraines triggered by smells, so my opinion on the smell may not be very helpful.</li>
            <li>I got the small size in the Target Beauty Box and after using it a couple times, came straight to Amazon to buy a full size one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first dry shampoo I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t make my darker hair appear lighter.</li>
            <li>Now it didn&#x27;t make my hair look clean, it actually weight it down and felt dirtier.</li>
            <li>It sprays clear, but it dries to a white powder.  </li>
            <li>I try not to wash and blow out my hair every single day because as I get older, my aging hair is getting drier and frizzier.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several brands and found them effective enough but they always left behind a white residue that made it look like I had gray roots showing!</li>
            <li>On my &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; days, I sprayed this dry shampoo in my hair, and it looked like my hair was freshly washed and blow dried.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried five other brands that say they go on clear but don&#x27;t---from ULTA and the drug store (all different price points).  </li>
            <li> I have used dry shampoo before, but none worked as well as this one.  </li>
            <li> Previous dry shampoos have always left a white powdery residue on my scalp (long dark hair).</li>
            <li> I have dark hair and this is the only product that I&#x27;ve tried that does NOT leave a powdery residue.</li>

            <li> it definitely looks a little greasy.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used dry shampoos before, and it always left a powdery, thick feel to my hair.</li>
            <li> so I have started washing my hair in the shower every other day to try and tame the frizz.</li>
            <li> The texturizer gel has helped define and tame my dark layers once styled.</li>
            <li> After just a few uses, the aerosol runs out.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money until Fekkai decides to correct this problem.</li>
            <li> The product is stuck inside and it was a wasted 20 bucks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchase this three times now, from different merchants, and each time, the aerosol mechanism fails after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I love the product itself but the packaging is terrible.</li>
            <li> I had a broken nozzle as well and wasted my money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, this product is ultimately a disappointment.</li>
            <li> So disappointing.</li>
            <li> Tragic.</li>

            <li> Just received this in my complementary Influenster voxbox, and I love it! Definitely my favorite dry shampoo!!!</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried out!</li>
            <li> This is a great dey shampoo, it leaves hair feeling clean and refreshed without weighing it down like some dry shampoos can. It adds volume and texture to hair and desk tell refreshes hair from day before blow outs. It&#x27;s quick and easy to use. I received these products for testing purposes from influenster.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and after only a couple uses the nozzle got clogged and I couldn&#x27;t use anymore. I had to buy a whole new bottle. I have used this specific product for years and this is the first that this has happened. I am upset that I spent the money and bought this from amazon. ugh!</li>
            <li> I had a broken nozzle as well and wasted my money. I wish they would fix this as I loved the product for the 2 times I used it.</li>
            <li> I want to love this product, I really do. For the 4-5 times I used it, it worked great. I love the way it smells and feels in my hair, I love how easy it is to use, and it does exactly what a dry shampoo should.&lt;br /&gt;However, this product is ultimately a disappointment. After just a few uses, the aerosol runs out. I&#x27;ve had 2 different cans of this (1 purchased from Target, and 1 purchased from Amazon), and both of them did the same thing. This leaves you with lots of product left in the can, and no way to use it. So disappointing. Don&#x27;t waste your money until Fekkai decides to correct this problem.</li>
            <li> A great product &amp; the smell is wonderful.  Holds &amp; thickens the hair while it dissolves the oils.</li>
            <li> Love the product but the pump on the can broke/became clogged with more than half the product left. I&#x27;ve soaked it to unclog the nozzle with no luck. So, I have a can of product that I can&#x27;t use. That I paid more for than I usually spend on hair care. Tragic.</li>
            <li> I was given a complimentary bottle of this product to test and review.  I&#x27;ve used dry shampoos before, and it always left a powdery, thick feel to my hair. This product is completely different.  It&#x27;s so light that I couldn&#x27;t even feel it in my hair, but it really does its job.  I try not to wash and blow out my hair every single day because as I get older, my aging hair is getting drier and frizzier.  On my &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; days, I sprayed this dry shampoo in my hair, and it looked like my hair was freshly washed and blow dried.  My only issue with the product is the smell.  My husband thinks it smells light and fresh, but I thought it was too strong and gave me a little headache two out of the three days I used it--however, I am definitely prone to headaches and migraines triggered by smells, so my opinion on the smell may not be very helpful.</li>
            <li> I was given this as a sample to try. Previous dry shampoos have always left a white powdery residue on my scalp (long dark hair). This does not but has a great fresh fragrance and is light with no powder. Great after a lunch run when you don&#x27;t have time to wash and dry thick hair!</li>
            <li> Fekkai&#x27;s dry shampoo has the best scent I&#x27;ve come across in the dry shampoo realm thus far, and I&#x27;m a sucker for great fragrances! It&#x27;s light and refreshing, not overburdening like a lot of products out there. The spray itself goes on clear so no worries about chalky residue. I love using it to add extra volume to my long but fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product in a Influenster voxbox.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and works better than other dry shampoos I have tried.</li>
            <li> I have used dry shampoo before, but none worked as well as this one.  It does not leave a powder feel within your hair.  Your hair is light and bouncy after use.</li>
            <li> Smell delicious unbelievable. Now it didn&#x27;t make my hair look clean, it actually weight it down and felt dirtier. But men the smell is just amazing that u would probably buy their other products like shampoo and conditioner. Received this product free from influenster.</li>
            <li> Smells good.  Gets rid of oily hair and gives volume.  No white residue.  Not sticky.</li>
            <li> I started using this product today and love it!  I have dark hair and this is the only product that I&#x27;ve tried that does NOT leave a powdery residue. I&#x27;ve tried five other brands that say they go on clear but don&#x27;t---from ULTA and the drug store (all different price points).  Please, Fekkai, I hope you don&#x27;t stop making this product--thank you! (When I read a review from a man who liked it--I knew it must be a winner!)</li>
            <li> I love washing my hair but have been trying to improve the quality of my hair by washing it less. Dry shampoo offers me a good alternative to daily washing. I&#x27;ve tried several brands and found them effective enough but they always left behind a white residue that made it look like I had gray roots showing! This dry shampoo is just as good as any other I&#x27;ve tried but goes on invisible, which I appreciate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product in a Influenster voxbox.</li>
            <li> I love the product itself but the packaging is terrible. I knew when I bought this that I would need to be careful about the spout, seeing that others had issues with the product hardening and not coming out. Well lo and behold, that happened. No matter what I do I cannot seem to clean the spout. The product is stuck inside and it was a wasted 20 bucks.</li>
            <li> I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.  If it weren&#x27;t for the packaging, I would love this product.  Seriously, it smells great, it doesn&#x27;t feel like hairspray in my hair, it adds volume, it&#x27;s great.  If I could actually use it that is.  The nozzle clogs so easily and it&#x27;s a pain to clean it.  I had to scrub it with a toothbrush under hot water to get it to work everytime I tried to use it.  Such a pain!  It sprays clear, but it dries to a white powder.  Not really a big deal, but something to be aware of so you don&#x27;t get it on your clothes.  I did a video review on YouTube you can watch here:  http://youtu.be/XZ8fQGSpzkM</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I was gifted both the texturizer gel and the dry shampoo spray. The texturizer gel has helped define and tame my dark layers once styled. I love the texture it gives my hair, especially in these cooler temps.&lt;br /&gt;The dry shampoo doesn&#x27;t leave even the slightest hint of residue and smells glorious! It&#x27;s the first dry shampoo I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t make my darker hair appear lighter. I must admit I used it a whole weekend without needing to wash my hair even once. Best dry shampoo ever!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of dry shampoos and so far, this is my favorite. I got the small size in the Target Beauty Box and after using it a couple times, came straight to Amazon to buy a full size one. Cringing at the price but it&#x27;s so good! The smell is divine--better than any other dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used--and it&#x27;s so light and absorbs oils magically.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wash my hair daily, usually every 2-3 days so by the 3rd day it definitely looks a little greasy. This product was great and took the grease right out. And it smells really good too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** I did receive these products for complimentary testing purposes in all review materials.</li>
            <li> THIS REVIEW IS NOT FOR THE MERCHANT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is for the product. Works great on hair and smells great but breaks after one or two uses so that product doesn&#x27;t come out and aerosol doesn&#x27;t work. Ridic!</li>
            <li> Best hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used. Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair too soft or too stiff - its perfect!</li>
            <li> The merchant is great, but the product is garbage. I&#x27;ve purchase this three times now, from different merchants, and each time, the aerosol mechanism fails after a few uses. Spray doesn&#x27;t work, so product does not come out, and you&#x27;re stuck with a brand-new can full of product in it, and no way to get it out. Every single time!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this shampoo.  It is working great for me.  I usually have pretty frizzy hair so I have started washing my hair in the shower every other day to try and tame the frizz. Using this dry shampoo on my &amp;#34;non-washing&amp;#34; days is working out great! My hair isn&#x27;t oily and is also not frizzy from too much washing.  I really like it.</li>
