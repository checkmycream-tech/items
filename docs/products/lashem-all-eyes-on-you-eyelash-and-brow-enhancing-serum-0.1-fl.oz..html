            <li>Product arrived on time, nice packaging, but doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know how effective it will turn out to be.  </li>
            <li>The Lash gel is by far the best Ive tried out of 5.</li>
            <li>Great product worth the bucks and</li>
            <li>This product is amazing and if you want long and beautiful lashes, go with Lashem!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE PRODUCT.....</li>
            <li>Maybe for someone else this product will produce better results.  </li>
            <li>This is simply the best eye lash I ever tried....!!</li>
            <li>I love anything that deals with beauty.</li>
            <li>Love the pumping to.</li>
            <li>I sure can see a difference as well.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many lash growth brands</li>
            <li>These 2 products are easy to use and easy to come off.</li>
            <li>My lashes do tend to get brittle an fall out easily, so I was excited to see if LashEm lived up to it&#x27;s claims.  </li>
            <li>I found a great deal on multiple tubes of lash&#x27;em</li>
            <li>I have continued to use this stuff a few times per week and it still works great!</li>
            <li>I had originally gotten this product in one of my birchbox kits, and for the longest time had no clue</li>
            <li>I am so excited</li>
            <li>The only good point is that I was still using one tube after 6 weeks</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after the full 6 weeks.  </li>
            <li>My mom will back this us after losing her brows/lashes 3 times from chemotherapy, her top eyelashes almost touch her top eyelid NO JOKE…</li>
            <li>The effect appeared in two days, and my eyelashes have been strong and much thicker ever since.</li>
            <li>Have used it or about three weeks now, without success.  </li>
            <li>I also use 28 day mascara (lash tint) and rarely wear mascara now</li>
            <li>and they are full and much longer.</li>
            <li>Nothing major, not sure its making a great difference, wore some individuals and lost eyelashes so this may be the issue!</li>
            <li>Dries fast, can put on and then mascara, or at night time!</li>
            <li>I should&#x27;ve looked on Amazon first.  </li>
            <li>I only applied it to the top.  </li>
            <li>it is amazing, highly recommend , I have use it for weeks and never get back to the old \\&quot;system\\&quot; ;o)</li>
            <li>I feel that the conditioning benefit of this lash gel really stands out.</li>
            <li>I can really see the difference.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much result with this product.</li>
            <li>my eyelashes stop falling and the skin around my eyes feels hydrated, soft and with a fresh youthful look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>have to admit, that  after reading  the reviews  for similar products I was concern about the irritation, eye- darkening etc side effects, specially  because my eyes are very sensitive even to eyeshadows or some mascaras.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am highly recommended for u to try it and get one to save ur eyelashes~~~ ^____^</li>
            <li>I definitely don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>After 5 weeks, the inner lashes on my right eye fell out.  </li>
            <li>I cannot live without her every night.   </li>
            <li>I live in NJ  </li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are short and easily to lose for a long time..</li>
            <li>but this stuff does absolutely nothing, after daily application for 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li>had no irritation, or any side effect so far.</li>
            <li>I will come back after few more weeks to confirm about the  growth ...</li>
            <li>Shortly thereafter, the middle lashes on my right eye fell out.  </li>
            <li>Then the middle lashes on my right eye fell out, as did the middle lashes on my left eye.  </li>
            <li>My top lashes became very thick and lush.  </li>
            <li>Thus, I have used different kinds of brand of eyelash serum to heal my eyelash and get my real eyelash back...  </li>
            <li>eyelashes started to fall and my eyes area right above and beneath my eyelashes  would feel very dry.</li>
            <li>I barely even need mascara!  </li>
            <li>But  with no side effects for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say I see a difference on the volume, but that might be due to the huge improvement on the health of my lashes due to Lashem.  </li>
            <li>I finally gave up on having the lush lashes and quit using this product.  </li>
            <li>there was not much left of my natural lashes.</li>
            <li>my natural lashes had grown back thicker and longer.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments and have even been asked if I&#x27;m wearing false lashes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how long it is supposed to take to work, but so far no luck</li>
            <li>I have had my brows actually grow back and my lashes full and thick again.</li>
            <li>But feels good on eyes, like an eye moisturizer so it cannot be that bad.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> But feels good on eyes, like an eye moisturizer so it cannot be that bad.</li>
            <li> I have noticed very little improvement, I suppose I may need to use it much longer than the prescriptive six weeks.</li>
            <li> so it last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I thought of trying this product since it had good reviews and was a little less expensive.  </li>
            <li> I had used another product prior to this one, which was a little more expensive, and it produced longer, fuller, darker lashes within two weeks of use (1 time/day).  </li>
            <li> I recently started wearing contacts and after 13 years hiding behind glasses my eyes were no longer blinged out with pretty frames.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the only lash treatment that has strengthened my existing lashes while encouraging the growth of my lashes, without the itchiness and irritation I often experience with other lash treatments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other products like lash food and revitalash without yielding any results.  </li>
            <li> I was totally a skeptic but now a firm believer…noticed a bigger fan shape in my lashes in about 2 weeks of continuous use I apply twice a day though morning and night…</li>
            <li> I applied it every single night before I went to bed, just as the directions say.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t afraid of losing my eyelash easily anymore.   </li>
            <li> so in Fall and Winter my eyelashes suffer due to dry</li>
            <li> The 3 in 1 use a little bit goes a long way and rub in under your eye</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lashem religiously for the past week</li>
            <li> Also checked the ingredients and there are no parabens, unlike some of the other lash growth products on the market.  </li>
            <li> I continued using it for two months and my lashes were very thick and slightly longer than they normally are.</li>
            <li> Using this product, my eyelashes grew so long that I had to take a hiatus for a few weeks because my eyelashes were in my eyes!</li>
            <li> But wait... an average review below 4?</li>
            <li> But as far as length, I have yet to see any dramatic results.</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference in the length and density of my lashes in less than two weeks.</li>
            <li> I have noticed thickness, fullness, and length in my lashes, in less then 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> It doesnt hurt when you mess up.</li>
            <li> LashEm Measurable Difference Lash Gel claims to be a conditioning, lash boosting formula that&#x27;s geared towards short, weak and brittle lashes.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for quite a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> what so ever, don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I had eye lash extensions for a few months and couldn&#x27;t afford to keep them, after they all fell off</li>
            <li> You do start to see a difference after a few days.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if 8 weeks is enough time to notice a dramatic length difference.</li>
            <li> Overall, there is a dramatic improvement to the softness, strength and condition of my lashes.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they only appear to have slightly increased in length.</li>
            <li> I have small lashes compared to the rest of the people in the house.</li>
            <li> plus they are small</li>
            <li> I hardly get any sleep these days.</li>
            <li> I am also the one too lazy to put fake eyelashes on my eyes everyday cuz it usually spend me a lot of time to do it...</li>
            <li> Ah, well - at least it was comparatively inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lashem for at least a month now</li>
            <li> This product works well, but it&#x27;s a slow process.</li>
            <li> I have some new growth growing at the base of my lash line, but whether that&#x27;s from the lash gel or not, I&#x27;m unsure.  </li>
            <li> this is a rip-off.</li>
            <li> I have thin lashes and have tried a number of products in the hopes that they would grow.</li>
            <li> My friends thought that I had false lashes...</li>
            <li> It was expensive and it darkened by eyelids.  </li>
            <li> It was expensive also.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been disappointed.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> My eyelashes are short and easily to lose for a long time..I was so jealous why boys&#x27; eyelashes are longer than me..T.T....I am also the one too lazy to put fake eyelashes on my eyes everyday cuz it usually spend me a lot of time to do it...Thus, I have used different kinds of brand of eyelash serum to heal my eyelash and get my real eyelash back...  Finally, thank God.... I found out \\&quot;Lashem Growth Serum\\&quot; really can solve my problem and give me beautiful eyelashes in a month!  I don&#x27;t afraid of losing my eyelash easily anymore.   Moreover, \\&quot;Lashem Growth Serum\\&quot; is an easy-to-use and easy-to-go product.  I cannot live without her every night.   I am highly recommended for u to try it and get one to save ur eyelashes~~~ ^____^</li>
            <li> Waste of money. Doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve used it for quite a few weeks now. Gave it a fair chance. Just doesn&#x27;t work. End of story.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lashem religiously for the past week and it&#x27;s the only lash treatment that has strengthened my existing lashes while encouraging the growth of my lashes, without the itchiness and irritation I often experience with other lash treatments.</li>
            <li> Wanted to Take a chance on lash serum and chose this. Used a month with no Measurable difference. Save your money and keep looking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month and I do not see any results! What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This product does not work.  I used it dailey for two months, there was no difference what so ever, don&#x27;t waste your money this is a rip-off.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time, nice packaging, but doesn&#x27;t work.  I&#x27;ve used both Latisse (excellent) and RapidLash (very good) but this stuff does absolutely nothing, after daily application for 4 weeks.  Ah, well - at least it was comparatively inexpensive.</li>
            <li> LashEm Measurable Difference Lash Gel claims to be a conditioning, lash boosting formula that&#x27;s geared towards short, weak and brittle lashes. I don&#x27;t have the most unfortunate lashes around, but of course there is always room for improvement. My lashes do tend to get brittle an fall out easily, so I was excited to see if LashEm lived up to it&#x27;s claims.  I started applying the LashEm gel on October 25, 2011. I applied it every single night before I went to bed, just as the directions say.  My lashes definitely feel stronger and softer to the touch than they ever have before. I can actually rub my eyes without any lashes falling out. I feel that the conditioning benefit of this lash gel really stands out. Unfortunately, they only appear to have slightly increased in length. I don&#x27;t know if 8 weeks is enough time to notice a dramatic length difference. I have some new growth growing at the base of my lash line, but whether that&#x27;s from the lash gel or not, I&#x27;m unsure.  Overall, there is a dramatic improvement to the softness, strength and condition of my lashes. I also have very sensitive eyes and this lash gel doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation whatsoever. But as far as length, I have yet to see any dramatic results. I will update this review at a later date if I start to notice any difference.</li>
            <li> I had originally gotten this product in one of my birchbox kits, and for the longest time had no clue what it was, then I looked it up and read the description on birchbox and said, what the hell, I mind as well try it! So, I did, and omg! Using this product, my eyelashes grew so long that I had to take a hiatus for a few weeks because my eyelashes were in my eyes! This product is amazing and if you want long and beautiful lashes, go with Lashem!</li>
            <li> Nothing major, not sure its making a great difference, wore some individuals and lost eyelashes so this may be the issue!</li>
            <li> FOR THE COST OF THIS LASH GEL IT IS TOATLLY A GREAT PRICE, I LOVE MY EYE LASHES &amp;#34;NOW&amp;#34; MUST HAVE IF YOU WANT LONGER LASHES</li>
            <li> Have used it or about three weeks now, without success.  I don&#x27;t know how long it is supposed to take to work, but so far no luck</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE PRODUCT.....After 3-4 weeks, my lashes were longer and ticker...I&#x27;ll defenitly buy another one soon.  My friends thought that I had false lashes...lol...I was happy to hear that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> There was no difference after applying it diligently daily. Maybe it works for others but it didn&#x27;t work on me.</li>
            <li> I used this item for 1 month 1 time/day.  I did not see any difference in my lashes.  I had used another product prior to this one, which was a little more expensive, and it produced longer, fuller, darker lashes within two weeks of use (1 time/day).  I thought of trying this product since it had good reviews and was a little less expensive.  Wish I had put my money back into the one that worked for me.</li>
            <li> At 59&#x27;the lashes were beginning to disappear, noticed a big difference in 2 weeks and still use 4 times a week or so. Lashes look thicker and longer and there are more of them! I also use 28 day mascara (lash tint) and rarely wear mascara now</li>
            <li> My lashes were very short after my lash extension came off.  I&#x27;ve been using Lashem for at least a month now and they are full and much longer. It does not sting my eyes. When I put on a coat of primer then my mascara I can really see the difference.</li>
            <li> after 1 month I see no difference  tho i do know it takes 8 weeks  thought i would see a hint of a difference by now</li>
            <li> After two months of continuous use, my lashes never grew longer, a wee-tadbit thicker perhaps but not enough to say I will purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> I found a great deal on multiple tubes of lash&#x27;em so I went on line to read reviews.  Many of them said how great this lash&#x27;em product was.  So I got 5 tubes.  After 5 weeks, the inner lashes on my right eye fell out.  Shortly thereafter, the middle lashes on my right eye fell out.  I still had 4 untouched tubes and hoped that this was a fluke so I kept using it.  Then the middle lashes on my right eye fell out, as did the middle lashes on my left eye.  I finally gave up on having the lush lashes and quit using this product.  I lost almost all my lashes using this lash&#x27;em product.  Maybe for someone else this product will produce better results.  For me, it left me almost bald eyed.  The only good point is that I was still using one tube after 6 weeks so it last a long time.  Would never recommend Lash&#x27;em to anyone.  I had to click a star to submit this review. So, it has one star but should have a -10 stars.</li>
            <li> I have noticed very little improvement, I suppose I may need to use it much longer than the prescriptive six weeks.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much result with this product. I use the product for two months. I tried another product and saw faster results in 6 weeks. This product did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased it two years ago. The effect appeared in two days, and my eyelashes have been strong and much thicker ever since. Two years have passed the effect didn&#x27;t wear off, so I found this link again and wanted to share it with my friend. But wait... an average review below 4? Come on, this thing is magic!</li>
            <li> Does not produce results.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I had eye lash extensions for a few months and couldn&#x27;t afford to keep them, after they all fell off there was not much left of my natural lashes. I used this stuff faithfully and somewhere around 4-6 weeks BOOM! my natural lashes had grown back thicker and longer. I have continued to use this stuff a few times per week and it still works great!</li>
            <li> This is simply the best eye lash I ever tried....!! it is amazing, highly recommend , I have use it for weeks and never get back to the old \\&quot;system\\&quot; ;o)</li>
            <li> Nope, not working. But feels good on eyes, like an eye moisturizer so it cannot be that bad. Didn&#x27;t do a harm either.&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> I got these 2 products to review. I love anything that deals with beauty. These 2 products are easy to use and easy to come off. The 3 in 1 use a little bit goes a long way and rub in under your eye tell your skin soaks it in.. You do start to see a difference after a few days. I hardly get any sleep these days. This product helps make that go away and helps make my eyes look prettier! Love the pumping to. The Lash gel is by far the best Ive tried out of 5. It doesnt hurt when you mess up. Dries fast, can put on and then mascara, or at night time! I have small lashes compared to the rest of the people in the house. I sure can see a difference as well. I perfer doing it at night, so that way im not tempted to bug it! Great product worth the bucks and plus they are small so they are easier to carry around!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> I have thin lashes and have tried a number of products in the hopes that they would grow. Well, I&#x27;ve found it!! Lashem Lash Gel made my lashes fuller, longer and noticeably thicker. I get so many compliments and have even been asked if I&#x27;m wearing false lashes. LOVE LASHEM!</li>
            <li> I bought lashem for 2 reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyelashes started to fall and my eyes area right above and beneath my eyelashes  would feel very dry. I live in NJ  so in Fall and Winter my eyelashes suffer due to dry conditions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using lashem for about two 1/2  weeks my eyelashes stop falling and the skin around my eyes feels hydrated, soft and with a fresh youthful look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit, that  after reading  the reviews  for similar products I was concern about the irritation, eye- darkening etc side effects, specially  because my eyes are very sensitive even to eyeshadows or some mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no irritation, or any side effect so far. I am glad i took a chance with Lashem! it works! But  with no side effects for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say I see a difference on the volume, but that might be due to the huge improvement on the health of my lashes due to Lashem.  I will come back after few more weeks to confirm about the  growth ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with this product and glad i gave it a try!</li>
            <li> This product works well, but it&#x27;s a slow process. I definitely don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I purchased Lashem from a different website.  I should&#x27;ve looked on Amazon first.  I saw visible results in 3 weeks.  My top lashes became very thick and lush.  I noticed that my bottom lashes were lengthening too.  I only applied it to the top.  I continued using it for two months and my lashes were very thick and slightly longer than they normally are. Prior to using Lashem I tryed a well advertised perscription product.  It was expensive and it darkened by eyelids.  I also tried Revitalash and saw no results.  It was expensive also.  Lashem&#x27;s price is on point. It works.  It doesnt irratate the eye area or darken the skin around your eyes.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work for me but....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other products like lash food and revitalash without yielding any results.  Only 3 weeks after using Lashem&#x27;s lash gel, the thickness of my lashes has doubled, I can&#x27;t even believe it.  I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after the full 6 weeks.  I barely even need mascara!  Also checked the ingredients and there are no parabens, unlike some of the other lash growth products on the market.  Definitely keeping a stock of these in my home from now on...</li>
            <li> This was beyond my expectations. I am more than impressed. I have had my brows actually grow back and my lashes full and thick again. It took years off of my appearance. I am impressed. I have never had a product work like this before.</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference in the length and density of my lashes in less than two weeks. I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
            <li> I was totally a skeptic but now a firm believer…noticed a bigger fan shape in my lashes in about 2 weeks of continuous use I apply twice a day though morning and night…now about 6 continuous weeks out they are definitely longer and fuller, I have also been using on my eyebrows and they have totally grown thicker which is what I wanted for my skimpy brows. My mom will back this us after losing her brows/lashes 3 times from chemotherapy, her top eyelashes almost touch her top eyelid NO JOKE…mine haven&#x27;t responded quite like that but they are finally getting flirty. She uses Lashem and still has some Lilash she alternates in, I have only used Lashem.</li>
            <li> Delivery of product came as promised.  Have just started using it so I don&#x27;t know how effective it will turn out to be.  Hope springs eternal!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many lash growth brands and I&#x27;ve been disappointed.  Either my eyes were bothered; or, the colors of the inside of my eyes changed.  I gave it my last shot.....I bought LASHEM and have learned that this brand truly works.  I have noticed thickness, fullness, and length in my lashes, in less then 3 weeks.  I am so excited and I hope to get the rest of the viewers too!</li>
            <li> I recently started wearing contacts and after 13 years hiding behind glasses my eyes were no longer blinged out with pretty frames.  My eyes were now the focal point.  I got a sample of lashem in either my Birchbox or Ipsy glam bag and noticed results almost immediately!!!  Good stuff!</li>
