            <li>Also, it did not have the overwhelming fragrance I&#x27;ve come to associate with Fantasia products.</li>

            <li>I liked this product very much.</li>

            <li>It leaves it silky smooth.</li>
            <li>great product especially for when using the instlyer.</li>

            <li>The shipping was really fast to.!!!</li>
            <li>i seriuosly love love love this serum when i get out of the shower and apply it to my hair, my hair is so super soft.</li>
            <li>It actually has a light, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>My hair is smooth, straight, silky, and more importantly protected from heat and the sun.</li>
            <li>Great product that lasts a long time!</li>
            <li>it left my hair so shiny, smooth, and smelling good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest the first time I used it, it didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>and it provides such a gorgeous shine when you are finished styling....</li>
            <li>Recently, I have used this while using the Andis MultiCeremic flat iron and got great results!</li>
            <li>I can wear my shades on my head with out a greasy mess, lol.  </li>
            <li>My hair is natural no relaxer and with the straightening serum I was able to combat Virginia&#x27;s  humidity.</li>
            <li>good for black hair.</li>
            <li>i probably didn&#x27;t need to apply more before straightening, but a little more wouldn&#x27;t hurt, and i wanted extra protection from more heat.</li>
            <li>I put this product on my hair and now is straight and silky!</li>
            <li>This is the first heat protecting product I have tried on my hair and I plan to stick with it.  </li>
            <li>In addition to heat protecting, it makes your hair soft and light.</li>
            <li>once i tried it, i instantly fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>she told me to thoroughly wash my hair (sulfate free products of course) and then apply a dime size amount of the heat protectant to my hair, as it can be oily if you use more (a tact I unfortunately found out on my own).</li>
            <li>This product is really nice and inexpensive compared to some of the other ones out there.</li>
            <li>I just love this serum for protecting my hair against the heat of curling and flat irons.</li>
            <li>I love how soft it makes my hair specially my natural</li>
            <li>I had given up silicone-filled polishers and serums in favor of natural oils like jojoba, sweet almond, emu, avocado and/or argan to add sheen to my hair strands.</li>
            <li>My curls were soft and full of body.</li>
            <li>This works very well when straightening my hair.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t use a whole lot, as this product can be oily if you use too much in one spot.</li>
            <li>I really like this heat protector.</li>
            <li>Highly reccommend!</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really understand that.</li>
            <li>I think this is much too much.</li>
            <li>shipping was fast</li>
            <li>and it is SILKY STRAIGHT with no frizz or</li>
            <li>I love this product it leaves my hair so smooth, and Shiny but doesnt over do the shine ive tried other products where my hair looks greasy and gross</li>
            <li>The next day, I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>i love the fact that although it&#x27;s a semi-heavy liquid, it does not weigh down my hair.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>His hair is natural and unprocessed, it is super, super curly.</li>
            <li>His hair is left soft, shiny, and smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i see a lot of reviews about putting it on before blow drying, but i put it on before blow drying and a little more before straightening each section.</li>
            <li>i really don&#x27;t straighten my hair anymore since i went natural but every so often i will.</li>
            <li>i have always been natural, but since everyone is coming out with natural products and protective styles/</li>
            <li>i have been looking for products recently to help get my hair pin straight</li>
            <li>It makes my hair really soft and the iron just glides through it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural haired chica</li>
            <li>just cause it makes my hair so soft and silky</li>
            <li>this is far from that it does not do that at all.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>Leaves the hair looking like it was treated with something, whereas the Chi just makes the hair look soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>this makes my hair so so soft and shiny</li>
            <li>My hair was soft, not extremely greasy, oily or tacky.</li>
            <li>After a deep condition, clarifying shampoo and blow-dry on high heat using this serum on each section of hair, I rolled my hair with wire rollers.</li>
            <li>or I would seriously never try to flat iron my hair again.</li>
            <li>I should of had this with me last summer when I went to New Orleans.  </li>
            <li>Keeps hair very soft after flat ironing.</li>
            <li>I go back to the natural looks</li>
            <li>I only used it once so far, but it surpassed my expectations.</li>
            <li>After his hair is dry, I use the flat iron thoroughly until every strand of hair is straight.</li>
            <li>This is a good product for heat products but unfortunately the instructions say to put it on while hair is still wet</li>
            <li>Before I&#x27;d get out and my hair would be so dry and brittle that I&#x27;d be scared to comb it before wetting in fear of completely snapping it off.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t flat iron my hair much and never had my hair break due to heat</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t like the smell very much, and I&#x27;m not sure It protects hair from heat.</li>
            <li>but this one works just fine.. the same job for less bucks!!!!</li>

            <li> but this one works just fine.. the same job for less bucks!!!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to flat iron my hair without it puffing up within a few hours after all that hard work of deep conditioning, blow drying and then pressing with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I noticed that if you do not wait for the hair to dry completely, the hair will tend to frizz, so I noted that waiting until the hair is all the way dry is key.</li>
            <li> I am doing weekly washes and I flat iron my hair quite a bit.  </li>
            <li> I flat iron and then use the curling irons</li>
            <li> i ordered the fantasia protector straightening serum because i left my other hair protector back in GA, while i was visiting.</li>
            <li> All I used in my hair was some Infusium leave in conditioner and this serum to blow dry and flat iron</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take a lot and it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t wet my hair prior to straightening</li>
            <li> and I apply when wet only on hair</li>
            <li> it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> (only when I want a style that is not straight).</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling soft, not sticky or heavy.</li>
            <li> After all the tangles are gone, I wait until his hair is completely dry.</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair and part in 4 sections.  </li>
            <li> I also have the spray that I use when my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> Normally my hair would straighten but the ends would be dry and stiff and I&#x27;d end up with a frizzy mess after straightening.  </li>
            <li> you only need a little with this product</li>
            <li> and it may sound crazy</li>
            <li> But I did not get the results that I expected.</li>
            <li> I aproved, I still do not tryed it with my wet hair.</li>
            <li> I have been completely natural for over 2 years now - I have kinky/curly frizzy hair which requires heavy products and mousse to keep it tame.</li>

            <li> Today I bought this flat ironing serum at Kmart because I remembered using it once before when my hair was still permed a few years ago.</li>
            <li> I would say like with any heat protectant or heat serum a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My hair was extremely frizzing and just out of control...</li>
            <li> so as other have said, a little goes a long ways!  </li>

            <li> i usually don&#x27;t review products, but i had to with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s suppose to prevent frizz</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I liked this product very much. I&#x27;ll be honest the first time I used it, it didn&#x27;t work very well. Recently, I have used this while using the Andis MultiCeremic flat iron and got great results! I would say like with any heat protectant or heat serum a little bit goes a long way. No need to get heavy-handed with this because it does the job.  For sure, it gets my stamp of approval.</li>
            <li> This product definitely does the trick.  My hair was extremely frizzing and just out of control...period!!! I was curling my hair with the curly iron everyday and it just became frizzy.  I put this product on my hair and now is straight and silky! It stopped the shedding as well!  I was like, yes!!!  I should of had this with me last summer when I went to New Orleans.  It doesn&#x27;t leave that sticky feeling on your hands.  It gives you hair just enough shine without over doing it!</li>
            <li> all ic products does the job</li>
            <li> Good product and fast delivery...&lt;br /&gt;I was using the CHI products.. but this one works just fine.. the same job for less bucks!!!!</li>
            <li> So you only need a drop in your palm and then just work it throughout your hair and it smells beautifully while protecting your hair and it provides such a gorgeous shine when you are finished styling....I recommend.</li>
            <li> This works very well when straightening my hair. It leaves it silky smooth. It protects from heat. It&#x27;s a very good product.</li>
            <li> Smells great!!! It gave my hair such a beautiful health look!</li>
            <li> The only heat protector serum that works for me leaving a hint of sheen and smoothness in my hair. I use it prior to straightening and blow drying with heat. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try out on my boyfriend&#x27;s hair. His hair is natural and unprocessed, it is super, super curly. He has tight spiral curls and extremely thick hair. I used this product after he washes his hair, when it is somewhat damp. I massage it through but I don&#x27;t use a whole lot, as this product can be oily if you use too much in one spot. Then I brush it out all the way, until there are no more tangles. After all the tangles are gone, I wait until his hair is completely dry. After his hair is dry, I use the flat iron thoroughly until every strand of hair is straight. This product is really nice and inexpensive compared to some of the other ones out there. His hair is left soft, shiny, and smooth. I used to use biosilk oil on his hair, but that was really expensive. This product is a nice alternative and I got better results from it than with the biosilk. I noticed that if you do not wait for the hair to dry completely, the hair will tend to frizz, so I noted that waiting until the hair is all the way dry is key.</li>
            <li> i usually don&#x27;t review products, but i had to with this stuff. i gave it four stars because i just used it tonight, and i wrapped my hair after so i&#x27;ll see how it comes out tomorrow. i&#x27;m biracial with long THICK CURLY hair. i have always been natural, but since everyone is coming out with natural products and protective styles/styling products, i&#x27;m still experimenting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. i love the fact that although it&#x27;s a semi-heavy liquid, it does not weigh down my hair.&lt;br /&gt;2. it cuts down on blow dry time.&lt;br /&gt;3. leaves a great shiny finish&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i see a lot of reviews about putting it on before blow drying, but i put it on before blow drying and a little more before straightening each section. i probably didn&#x27;t need to apply more before straightening, but a little more wouldn&#x27;t hurt, and i wanted extra protection from more heat. i have been looking for products recently to help get my hair pin straight and i think i found it.</li>
            <li> I really like this heat protector. It is definitely cheaper to buy in store as opposed to online, but it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m african american (texturized/semi-relaxed hair) and I get my hair straightened in a salon about every 12 weeks.  Once I wash my hair I go back to the natural looks because straightening my hair on my own has never turned out right...not nearly as nice as when I leave the salon.  Well, with this product I was TRULY amazed!!  Normally my hair would straighten but the ends would be dry and stiff and I&#x27;d end up with a frizzy mess after straightening.  With this product it is silky smooth, light-weight and bouncy and NO greasy film!  I can wear my shades on my head with out a greasy mess, lol.  I blow dry my hair and part in 4 sections.  I then apply a dime-sized amount to each section...so as other have said, a little goes a long ways!  I&#x27;ve gotten SO many compliments on my hair after using this.  Highly reccommend!</li>
            <li> I uses every time I ironed my hair and it works perfectly fine and my daughter to we love it</li>
            <li> I had given up silicone-filled polishers and serums in favor of natural oils like jojoba, sweet almond, emu, avocado and/or argan to add sheen to my hair strands. I gave away two almost-full bottles of hair polishing serums (Cantu and Citre Shine). Unfortunately, that did not last longer than a few months as I found I needed a heat protectant to help straighten my strands as well as tame frizzies.  I discovered this gem at Walmart. Iâ€™ve used Fantasia products many times over the years. This one appealed to my budget and was also bonus-sized. After a deep condition, clarifying shampoo and blow-dry on high heat using this serum on each section of hair, I rolled my hair with wire rollers. The next day, I was not disappointed.  My hair was soft, not extremely greasy, oily or tacky. My curls were soft and full of body. The shine wore off after 3 days, but I still recommend the product. Also, it did not have the overwhelming fragrance I&#x27;ve come to associate with Fantasia products. It actually has a light, pleasant scent. I only used it once so far, but it surpassed my expectations.</li>
            <li> great product especially for when using the instlyer.</li>
            <li> i pair this with my baby pro bliss straighten iron and my hair comes soft,straight, and shiny. good for black hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t straightened my hair a lot but I do use the product when I do. It makes my hair really soft and the iron just glides through it. I also have the spray that I use when my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> I am trying to get away from perming my hair so for the time being I am doing weekly washes and I flat iron my hair quite a bit.  This is the first heat protecting product I have tried on my hair and I plan to stick with it.  It works great; doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling heavy, smells good, leaves my hair shiny and it may sound crazy but my hair feels \\&quot;stronger\\&quot; and I have noticed that it breaks off a lot less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually put it on my hair before getting in the sauna as well.  Before I&#x27;d get out and my hair would be so dry and brittle that I&#x27;d be scared to comb it before wetting in fear of completely snapping it off.  This is no longer a concern using this product.  I will purchse this again</li>
            <li> i seriuosly love love love this serum when i get out of the shower and apply it to my hair, my hair is so super soft.</li>
            <li> This stuff is nice. In addition to heat protecting, it makes your hair soft and light.</li>
            <li> Made my hair somewhat greasy when I used it before drying and ironing. It was better to use instead before washing hair off. But I did not get the results that I expected.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product. I&#x27;m a natural haired chica and I wanted to straighten my hair. I thought this prodcut was great. It doesn&#x27;t take a lot and it goes a long way. My hair wasn&#x27;t greasy or anything. It has a great smell to it.</li>
            <li> Keeps hair very soft after flat ironing. Does not leave build-up. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> This is a good product for heat products but unfortunately the instructions say to put it on while hair is still wet and I can&#x27;t wet my hair prior to straightening so I don&#x27;t really understand that.</li>
            <li> it is oily so I wear very little but it works great and I apply when wet only on hair ends to protect when styling but I also wear it even when I don&#x27;t style just cause it makes my hair so soft and silky I recommend it .</li>
            <li> i love fantasia products</li>
            <li> I ordered heat protection I got a serum shine! I have enough serum and I wanted a he protectent and I&#x27;m really disappointed!</li>
            <li> This product I used only with dryed hair. It leaves a silk texture. I aproved, I still do not tryed it with my wet hair. It worths.</li>
            <li> I bought this product yesterday after receiving my HSI  flatiron from amazon. My hair is natural no relaxer and with the straightening serum I was able to combat Virginia&#x27;s  humidity. My hair is smooth, straight, silky, and more importantly protected from heat and the sun. I love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this product it leaves my hair so smooth, and Shiny but doesnt over do the shine ive tried other products where my hair looks greasy and gross this is far from that it does not do that at all. Love it</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not using enough of this product but didn&#x27;t achieve the desired results. Will have to experiment some more to reach a happy medium.</li>
            <li> I love, love this heat protector.!! The shipping was really fast to.!!!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like the smell very much, and I&#x27;m not sure It protects hair from heat. But It&#x27;s good as a serum.</li>
            <li> This serum provides a lot of shine on my hair, with a touch of softness. Not sure if it&#x27;s suppose to prevent frizz but it doesn&#x27;t. Not too great of a heat protectant because some of my ends still got burned. But every hair type is different and products may work for some, but not others.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair I use it when straightening my hair. It works pretty good. I&#x27;m overall happy with the product. The smell of this product is really nice. I sometimes use it on my skin. I still have so much left you only need a little with this product it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I was informed through a review that this is every bit the same as Chi Polishing Spray.  Not so.  I think this is much too much. Leaves the hair looking like it was treated with something, whereas the Chi just makes the hair look soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Amazing!! Saved my hair and smells amazing! Works well and definitely polishes your hair. The packaging was great! I love how recycled newspaper was used! c: overall good product and great shipping!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Is doesn&#x27;t look like the picture it came with a different label it still works good thank you shipping was fast</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this as a heat protectant cause I really don&#x27;t flat iron my hair much and never had my hair break due to heat I use this cause I love how soft it makes my hair specially my natural fro I wash it the apply this throughought my hair this makes my hair so so soft and shiny I love it</li>
            <li> i ordered the fantasia protector straightening serum because i left my other hair protector back in GA, while i was visiting. i straightened my hair 2 times without using any protection and damaged my hair a little. after i seen the damage i was doing, i stopped straightening. i really don&#x27;t straighten my hair anymore since i went natural but every so often i will. i was looking for cheap but effective hair serums and came across this one. once i tried it, i instantly fell in love with it. it left my hair so shiny, smooth, and smelling good.</li>
            <li> Oh, man! I haven&#x27;t been able to flat iron my hair without it puffing up within a few hours after all that hard work of deep conditioning, blow drying and then pressing with a flat iron. I have been completely natural for over 2 years now - I have kinky/curly frizzy hair which requires heavy products and mousse to keep it tame. Today I bought this flat ironing serum at Kmart because I remembered using it once before when my hair was still permed a few years ago. Oh, man! I can&#x27;t believe I forgot how good it works! All I used in my hair was some Infusium leave in conditioner and this serum to blow dry and flat iron my hair and it is SILKY STRAIGHT with no frizz or burned hair. I&#x27;m SO glad I remembered this product or I would seriously never try to flat iron my hair again.</li>
            <li> Hey ya&#x27;ll this product is amazing. I am a black college student and before I entered college, I would go to the salon once a month and my hairstylist would use this product before blowdrying my hair. It would came out hgreat every time! i had no idea how to do my hair so I started taking tips from my hairstylist. she told me to thoroughly wash my hair (sulfate free products of course) and then apply a dime size amount of the heat protectant to my hair, as it can be oily if you use more (a tact I unfortunately found out on my own). after blowdrying my hair i use my ceramic ionic straightener (HSI) and my hair comes out 85% parallel to my salon tresses. I be whippin it y&#x27;all! Definitely a must buy!</li>
            <li> Three years later and I&#x27;m still not done with this bottle. Great product that lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> I just love this serum for protecting my hair against the heat of curling and flat irons. I flat iron and then use the curling irons (only when I want a style that is not straight). With that process, I needed a good heat protector and Fantasia is wonderful for it. It leaves my hair feeling soft, not sticky or heavy.</li>
            <li> I was given some of this by my hairdresser - it went as hard as a rock although only used a small amount - 6 washes and it still would not come out of my hair ended up having to get an anti-build up shampoo which after 2 washes eventually got it out - a terrible product for fine hair - would never consider using again.</li>
