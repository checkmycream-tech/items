    <ol>
            <li>I was impressed</li>
            <li>Best for my legs...</li>
            <li>Best Razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This is the best deal out there on multi-blade razor.</li>
            <li>They are the best on the market for the price!</li>
            <li>Buy it excellent product.</li>
            <li>My husband is the user and says its the best he&#x27;s used in years.  </li>
            <li>Great razor cartridges for a good price!</li>
            <li>This is a great shaving system.  </li>
            <li>Great razor and cartridges.  </li>
            <li>Great Deal and Product.</li>
            <li>These guys have got the blades and have a great price point, refills are on the way.</li>
            <li>What a great shave...  </li>
            <li>I AM A HAPPY CAMPER AGAIN.....</li>
            <li>I recommends not to buy it, you will be happy.</li>
            <li>the blades are great too.</li>
            <li>The king of shaves razor is a great deal at the price.  </li>
            <li>razor heads provide the closest, gentlest shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced with a razor and that includes everything I&#x27;ve tried made by Gillette.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>The 5 blade Azor is certainly a top Bang for the Buck product, but it isn&#x27;t perfect.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and and gives a great shave!</li>
            <li>My husband just loved the razor and the blades are really a good buy....</li>
            <li>However, the good part is that this box includes 6 cartridges.</li>
            <li>I find them really good for shaving my head.</li>
            <li>He loved it but we could not find replacement blades.  </li>
            <li>Never cuts me... always a perfect shave and cheap</li>
            <li>That said, I don&#x27;t need a super-duper shaver to get a good close shave.</li>
            <li>Always superior product&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I gave up trying to get a good shave from these.</li>
            <li>The shave with the King of Shaves razor system, though, is even smoother and closer than with any three or four-blade system I&#x27;ve tried from Schick or Gillette, and as a result works in tandem with Remington&#x27;s gel exceptionally well.  </li>
            <li>, I love my king of shaves gel and the combination of the two gave me a great close</li>
            <li>Great value, better product!&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li>Everyone will have their own opinion, and I have mine.  </li>
            <li>Nice buy.  </li>
            <li>It is a quality razor that will give you a nice close shave.</li>
            <li>Nice retro experience.</li>
            <li>They look cool and they seem like a great idea</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a close shave, fairly easy to use and no problems cleaning, seems like a good value.</li>
            <li>They also clog very easily.</li>
            <li>I am happy to use it and will be replacing my old one for sure!!</li>
            <li>The King of Shaves razor is by far the best razor I have ever used and</li>
            <li>The cartridges are good, but I didn&#x27;t get a clean shave because the locking mechanism of the razor was defective.</li>
            <li>Oil works just fine !</li>
            <li>LOVE this razor.  </li>
            <li>winter don&#x27;t ask :)</li>
            <li>For me, the Gillettes are a bit too aggressive (angles &amp; spacing) and while they give close shaves, they also produce more nicks.  </li>
            <li>Glad I found you.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li>I have found that the Gillette Proglide Gel to be easier to rinse from between the blades, and is a better price than the Remington</li>
            <li>Much better than going to a retail store.</li>
            <li>These go with the Azor razor, which I really love and rely on.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had cheapo disposables that work 10x better -</li>
            <li>Love this product...</li>
            <li>it seams that the more blades a razor has the money you have to lay out for a shave.</li>
            <li>The best way to describe is this is a daily use razor.  </li>
            <li>razor has more flex than any system out there on the handle that holds the blades.  </li>
            <li>I love the shape and the way it looks, but the balance isn&#x27;t correct.</li>
            <li>What is interesting is that I do not see this sold at Maryland department stores.  </li>
            <li>You may LOVE it.</li>
            <li>If I skip a day, I&#x27;m still usually OK.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a kitten patting your face (claws not included).</li>
            <li>So I had to replace the cartridge more often than Gillette.</li>
            <li>They would do in a pinch but would rather spend my money on the better ones.</li>
            <li>I had to get more after a year.</li>
            <li>quick delivery great price close shave liked it very well  </li>
            <li>Cheaper than Gillette, and a more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Just as important as not dinging it, make sure to not let the blade get clogged.</li>
            <li>And though it provides the closest, gentlest shave I&#x27;ve ever encountered, I still think that high-end Gillette blades are superior from an all-around perspective (close shave, don&#x27;t clog).  </li>
            <li>And though it provides the closest, gentlest shave I&#x27;ve ever encountered, I still think that high-end Gillette blades are superior from an all-around perspective (close shave, don&#x27;t clog).  </li>
            <li>One downside is how easy it is to unintentionally eject a cartridge.</li>
            <li>They are easy to take on and off.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The blades are too close together and clog easily.</li>
            <li>Cartridges come off of the handle too easily.</li>
            <li>The blades are too close together and get clogged easily.</li>
            <li>Even with that, I give it a strong 5 stars.</li>
            <li>As always, user experience will vary, but here are the problems I had with this razor, all of which are a matter of fine tuning:  </li>
            <li>Overall, Remington &#x27; &amp;#34;King of Shaves&amp;#34; razors have been consistent in providing an excellent shave.</li>
            <li>The first shave with one of those throwaway blades was sheer joy!</li>
            <li>The Remington gel really seems to help me get a close shave and maintain good moisture, especially important in dry winter weather.  </li>
            <li>Keep the razor clean and thoroughly rinses, and you can easily get over a month of smooth shaves from the blade.</li>
            <li>It gives you a smoother comfortable shave than the others.  </li>
            <li>It was great because this (Amazon) was the only place I could find this item.</li>
            <li>bottom line is that the smoothest, most economical shave comes by using the Remington Azor 5 blade razor, combines with the Gillette Proglide shave Gel.</li>
            <li>My impression is overall great of this 5 blade product.</li>
            <li>and I get baby smooth.</li>
            <li>My husband got this razor free at Walgreens.  </li>
            <li>The shave it gives, at a price that is more economical</li>
            <li>I bought a bunch because they were cheap.</li>
            <li>I found a deal for the Remington King of Shaves razor and refills on Woot and thought that it would give me a great shave and last me the rest of my life!</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best, longest lasting blade on the market.</li>
            <li>It is by far a more superior razor and worth the price in my opinion.</li>
            <li>After shaving look carefully and make sure that you have successfully rinsed all the debris away from between the blades.</li>
            <li>Cuts clean, no shave burns.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even tried using a toothbrush to clean between the blades - no use.</li>
            <li>My significant other loved this brand and razor, so I purchased more.  </li>
            <li>This is usually not an issue in your own bathroom, but when you trevel, take care to pack it so that nothing can bump it in your travel bag.</li>
            <li>The blades are very sharp,and very precise..</li>
            <li>I bought this razor and blades set as an offered special price.</li>
            <li>Its hard to find the replacement blades in stores so coming to Amazon is the best choice.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love them.</li>
            <li>Overall a good product.</li>
            <li>As a lifetime Gillette guy, even typing that stuns me, but it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>Kings of shaves is the best shave I ever gotten hands down!!!</li>
            <li>Clean shaves, very rare nicks or cuts, very reasonable prices.</li>
            <li>If enough ads proclaim more blades are better then it must be true.</li>
            <li>We were so happy to find them at such a reasonable price here.</li>
            <li>The replacement cartridges are easy to change out in the razor, and they provide the same smooth shave as the original cartridge!</li>
            <li>Not worth it even at a great price.</li>
            <li>I have had mine for a week and went from a Gillette Fusion 4 blade to a much better Schick Quattro 4 blade to this new Remington.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t knock the hairs out of the blade because the blade is not attached very well to the handle and comes off too easily.  </li>
            <li>The five blades in the KOS razor are REALLY close together and can clog easily.</li>
            <li>will never purchase those brand named razor cartridges nor razor again, as long as this Remington Azor Shavor Cartridges exist and at this great customer discount and specials for an even greater bargain purchase , which I totally took advantage</li>
            <li>/&gt;Even if they are free, they cost too much.</li>
            <li>If it had been free, it would have cost to much.  </li>
            <li>The reason why the Azor is such an effective razor is because of</li>
            <li>, well worth the price</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>The product offers a smooth shave which my wife loves!</li>
            <li>She really liked it so it wasn&#x27;t a total wash out</li>
            <li>Good for not much growth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried tapping the head in hot water and the blades are still full of hairs.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s also fun to get a shaving soap in a dish and a shaving brush.</li>
            <li>The shaver has a funny angle but he adapted to it quite quickly and loves the feel of the razor in his hand.</li>
            <li>I much prefer the original, pre-Remington co-branded,4 blade version.</li>
            <li>No nicks or cuts and glided right over the skin.  </li>
            <li>The handle design does not allow the blade to get the area right under my nose</li>
            <li>again - putting a new blade on the razor is not at all easy.</li>
            <li>&quot; This is not 100% accurate for that particular area.</li>
            <li>I have tried both and consider this to be just as good as the Gillette blade at half</li>
            <li>I had the 4 blade razors by these guys and found them far superior in that they weren&#x27;t constantly clogged up.</li>
            <li>When I got these and had the first shave</li>
            <li>pretty uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>While the blade does provide an interestingly close shave (I used it constantly for two months)</li>
            <li>Since I like my legs to be soft and smooth</li>
            <li>I was recently given a sample Azor 5 razor to try and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used all sorts of razors over the years, most recently all multi-bladed.  </li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t work very well!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s replacement cartridges that run up to $46.00 or higher for packs of 8, 16 and 24 replacement</li>
            <li>When I first got the razor, the razors that came with it shaved so well</li>
            <li>I like these a lot, but I worry about being able to get them in the future.</li>
            <li>The blades are much closer together than US Razor Blades !</li>
            <li>The first stroke of the razor cuts some of the hair.</li>
            <li>(Make sure you get a well-reviewed handle -- they&#x27;re not all created equal.)  </li>
            <li>(Make sure you get a well-reviewed handle -- they&#x27;re not all created equal.)  </li>
            <li>got the razor as a gift and loved it, blades were hard to find till I found these at a super price.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, you may have found your new favorite razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great on the first shave, but the cartridge requires more frequent replacement than several of the other razors; the space between the blades are more prone to getting stuffed with hair stubble and shaving cream than other designs.  </li>
            <li>But if you have 4+ days of growth, then first use one of those cheap blades that are at a 45 degree angle to reduce the size of the beard then go back and use the King of shave5.  </li>
            <li>If I have a lot of growth I first use a store brand which gets me semi smooth, then I go back with King of Shave5</li>
            <li>According to the description, \\&quot;The cartridges&#x27; slimline design makes precision grooming easy in tricky areas, such as under the nose.\\</li>
            <li>They last a good long time as well.  </li>
            <li>Why do reviews need a certain number of words?</li>
            <li>It will continue to give a smooth clean cut longer than any other.</li>
            <li>though these blades are considerably cheaper than my Gillette blades changing them so often does not make them an economical purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and despite the fact that I really wanted it to kick Schick and Gillette&#x27;s behinds just to mix things up a bit, its flaws eventually wore me done as I realized</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this razor and these cartridges!  </li>
            <li>Schicks are much safer but you have to work at getting a close shave.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I am using it very please with this purchase.</li>
            <li>That close and gentle shave comes with some useability asterisks, however.</li>
            <li>(This is one arena where Gillette razors really shine.</li>
            <li>This razor is so gentle, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t even feel like you&#x27;re shaving.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The bottom line:  I really like the King of</li>
            <li>After using this for a shave, I took out my el cheapo Gillette throw away razor and got a much closer shave.</li>
            <li>Much rather use Mach 3 or Gillette Fusion.</li>
            <li>These were my find for reasonably priced (about a dollar) cartridge blades.</li>
            <li>I can get at least 3 good shaves per cartridge</li>
            <li>Putting a new blade on the razor can be a challenge--definitely not as easy as the Big Two.  </li>
            <li>I got exactly what I expected from this 5 blade razor - a nice close shave - just that simple!</li>
            <li>I can use each KOS cartridge for a month (sometimes more) if I&#x27;m shaving every other day and not clogging the blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Due to a strip on the top of the cartridge, you will have to move your nose &amp; change the direction of your shave to get @</li>
            <li>I have found that by keeping the blade thoroughly clean and not allowing anything to build up between the blades is the key to longevity in the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>And even then, with a fresh new blade, it tugs at my skin and hair as if it were three months old.</li>
            <li>I would rather have a much closer shave with a little more after effect skin irritation.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this new razer as glides much easier and leaves your face skin feeling nicer than the competition.    </li>
            <li>I gave the razor three stars mainly for effort.</li>
            <li>Yes i am really enjoying Garcinia Gambogia Extract not only loosing 15 pounds cut back my food bill.&lt;br /&gt;Took</li>
            <li>This seems to be the main problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It took three to four more swipes to remove the facial hair than it normally does with my regular blade.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rate this a little better than the Gillette Proglide and Mach3.</li>
            <li>With that said, I am a self-appointed expert on the major razors available commercially.</li>
            <li>The blade flexes naturally with your face, thanks to high-torque suspension or whatever you want to call it.</li>
            <li>I like having the razor in my arsenal and as soon as I or King of Shaves figure out a way to get all the stubble out of the blades as well as make the razors last as long as they claim, I&#x27;ll throw two more stars up there.</li>
            <li>Then again this is a pretty common problem for me with most razors.    </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re just jumping into the upscale razor market and aren&#x27;t sure about the cost (as compared the the single &amp; double razors you get by the bucketload at the drug store)</li>
            <li>These blades don&#x27;t work a third as well right out of the package.</li>
            <li>This blade will give a super smooth shave, and if you take care of it, it stays sharp a long time.</li>
            <li>The cost of replacement cartridges is a genuine incentive for me due to the rate at which I go through cartridges.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, for the quality of the razor cartridge blades themselves, and that I get more shaves, equally as close with this Remington King Azor Shaver Cartridges, and an Equally close and long lasting shave with as I do or rather did, with the ridiculously overpriced , very popular main-streamed or main brand named razor</li>
            <li>The overall cost of a clean shave turned out to be same.</li>
            <li>you can use the blade 5 times before getting red off... found it at big lots but sold out quickly &#x27;</li>
            <li>also noticed the blades had started to go rusty, so I&#x27;m suspecting a lesser grade of stainless steal than Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found that no matter what I did, the blades dulled just as fast as the big brands.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do not waste your time with this product.</li>
            <li>The Razor gives a very close shave, however US standard shaving cream clogs up razor !&lt;</li>
            <li>Because of the wishbone design, there is no place to put your finger up near the blade to get maximum contact and therefore, a close shave.</li>
            <li>My old razor &amp; blades system:</li>
            <li>Amazing design is the only shaver of any number of blades which actually fails to shave right.</li>
            <li>If there is a downside (and I don&#x27;t consider it as such) - it&#x27;s that the individual blades are close enough together, that I need to rinse more often during the shave than with other 5 blades razors.</li>
            <li>They dull easily.</li>
            <li>These blades barely last one shave before getting clogged and/or dull in spots (which causes grabbing of hairs more than slicing them).</li>
            <li>The price also seems very reasonable compared to other brands.</li>
            <li>Also, the blades don&#x27;t seem to hold up very well as I had to shave over the same spot multiple times.</li>
            <li>This provides an uneven shave as well as mild depression,.  </li>
            <li>If you leave any at all, it will quickly build up in subsequent shaves, and very quickly your shave will become uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>My husband has a tough beard and has tried many kinds of blades and shaving systems over the years.</li>
            <li>The shave from the Azor 5 razor has been unparalleled for us so far, and the replacement cartridges no different.</li>
            <li>Overall, the pros FAR outweigh the cons.</li>
            <li>My thought this system and blades are not for anyone, but ESPECIALLY those with sensitive skin........</li>
            <li>This product is great and much less expensive than Gilette Fusion Razor and blades.  </li>
            <li>My beard is of medium thickness, medium coarseness, and grows at an average to fast rate.  </li>
            <li>In fact, a regular two or three blade razor generally lasts 6-9 months for me.</li>
            <li>Although the cartridges were easy to remove (in fact sometime they just pop off) found it difficult to replace with a new one.</li>
            <li>I agree totally with an earlier review, I thought I could save a ton of money versus muy old razor, but this system after 1/2 dozen uses literally tore up my face, ESPECIALLY the upper lip area!  </li>
            <li>It is not very water soluble, and becomes trapped between the blades, where it then captures whiskers and quickly renders the blade unusable.</li>

            <li> Great razor and cartridges.  </li>
            <li> Great Deal and Product.</li>
            <li> These guys have got the blades and have a great price point, refills are on the way.</li>
            <li> What a great shave...  </li>
            <li> I AM A HAPPY CAMPER AGAIN.....</li>
            <li> I recommends not to buy it, you will be happy.</li>
            <li> the blades are great too.</li>
            <li> The king of shaves razor is a great deal at the price.  </li>
            <li> razor heads provide the closest, gentlest shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced with a razor and that includes everything I&#x27;ve tried made by Gillette.</li>
            <li> lol</li>
            <li> The 5 blade Azor is certainly a top Bang for the Buck product, but it isn&#x27;t perfect.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and and gives a great shave!</li>
            <li> My husband just loved the razor and the blades are really a good buy....</li>
            <li> However, the good part is that this box includes 6 cartridges.</li>
            <li> I find them really good for shaving my head.</li>
            <li> He loved it but we could not find replacement blades.  </li>
            <li> Never cuts me... always a perfect shave and cheap</li>
            <li> That said, I don&#x27;t need a super-duper shaver to get a good close shave.</li>
            <li> Always superior product&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I gave up trying to get a good shave from these.</li>
            <li> The shave with the King of Shaves razor system, though, is even smoother and closer than with any three or four-blade system I&#x27;ve tried from Schick or Gillette, and as a result works in tandem with Remington&#x27;s gel exceptionally well.  </li>
            <li> , I love my king of shaves gel and the combination of the two gave me a great close</li>
            <li> Great value, better product!&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li> Everyone will have their own opinion, and I have mine.  </li>
            <li> Nice buy.  </li>
            <li> It is a quality razor that will give you a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> Nice retro experience.</li>
            <li> They look cool and they seem like a great idea</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a close shave, fairly easy to use and no problems cleaning, seems like a good value.</li>
            <li> They also clog very easily.</li>
            <li> I am happy to use it and will be replacing my old one for sure!!</li>
            <li> The King of Shaves razor is by far the best razor I have ever used and</li>
            <li> The cartridges are good, but I didn&#x27;t get a clean shave because the locking mechanism of the razor was defective.</li>
            <li> Oil works just fine !</li>
            <li> LOVE this razor.  </li>
            <li> winter don&#x27;t ask :)</li>
            <li> For me, the Gillettes are a bit too aggressive (angles &amp; spacing) and while they give close shaves, they also produce more nicks.  </li>
            <li> Glad I found you.</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> I have found that the Gillette Proglide Gel to be easier to rinse from between the blades, and is a better price than the Remington</li>
            <li> Much better than going to a retail store.</li>
            <li> These go with the Azor razor, which I really love and rely on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had cheapo disposables that work 10x better -</li>
            <li> Love this product...</li>
            <li> it seams that the more blades a razor has the money you have to lay out for a shave.</li>
            <li> The best way to describe is this is a daily use razor.  </li>
            <li> razor has more flex than any system out there on the handle that holds the blades.  </li>
            <li> I love the shape and the way it looks, but the balance isn&#x27;t correct.</li>
            <li> What is interesting is that I do not see this sold at Maryland department stores.  </li>
            <li> You may LOVE it.</li>
            <li> If I skip a day, I&#x27;m still usually OK.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like a kitten patting your face (claws not included).</li>
            <li> So I had to replace the cartridge more often than Gillette.</li>
            <li> They would do in a pinch but would rather spend my money on the better ones.</li>
            <li> I had to get more after a year.</li>
            <li> quick delivery great price close shave liked it very well  </li>
            <li> Cheaper than Gillette, and a more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Just as important as not dinging it, make sure to not let the blade get clogged.</li>
            <li> And though it provides the closest, gentlest shave I&#x27;ve ever encountered, I still think that high-end Gillette blades are superior from an all-around perspective (close shave, don&#x27;t clog).  </li>
            <li> And though it provides the closest, gentlest shave I&#x27;ve ever encountered, I still think that high-end Gillette blades are superior from an all-around perspective (close shave, don&#x27;t clog).  </li>
            <li> One downside is how easy it is to unintentionally eject a cartridge.</li>
            <li> They are easy to take on and off.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The blades are too close together and clog easily.</li>
            <li> Cartridges come off of the handle too easily.</li>
            <li> The blades are too close together and get clogged easily.</li>
            <li> Even with that, I give it a strong 5 stars.</li>
            <li> As always, user experience will vary, but here are the problems I had with this razor, all of which are a matter of fine tuning:  </li>
            <li> Overall, Remington &#x27; &amp;#34;King of Shaves&amp;#34; razors have been consistent in providing an excellent shave.</li>
            <li> The first shave with one of those throwaway blades was sheer joy!</li>
            <li> The Remington gel really seems to help me get a close shave and maintain good moisture, especially important in dry winter weather.  </li>
            <li> Keep the razor clean and thoroughly rinses, and you can easily get over a month of smooth shaves from the blade.</li>
            <li> It gives you a smoother comfortable shave than the others.  </li>
            <li> It was great because this (Amazon) was the only place I could find this item.</li>
            <li> bottom line is that the smoothest, most economical shave comes by using the Remington Azor 5 blade razor, combines with the Gillette Proglide shave Gel.</li>
            <li> My impression is overall great of this 5 blade product.</li>
            <li> and I get baby smooth.</li>
            <li> My husband got this razor free at Walgreens.  </li>
            <li> The shave it gives, at a price that is more economical</li>
            <li> I bought a bunch because they were cheap.</li>
            <li> I found a deal for the Remington King of Shaves razor and refills on Woot and thought that it would give me a great shave and last me the rest of my life!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best, longest lasting blade on the market.</li>
            <li> It is by far a more superior razor and worth the price in my opinion.</li>
            <li> After shaving look carefully and make sure that you have successfully rinsed all the debris away from between the blades.</li>
            <li> Cuts clean, no shave burns.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even tried using a toothbrush to clean between the blades - no use.</li>
            <li> My significant other loved this brand and razor, so I purchased more.  </li>
            <li> This is usually not an issue in your own bathroom, but when you trevel, take care to pack it so that nothing can bump it in your travel bag.</li>
            <li> The blades are very sharp,and very precise..</li>
            <li> I bought this razor and blades set as an offered special price.</li>
            <li> Its hard to find the replacement blades in stores so coming to Amazon is the best choice.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love them.</li>
            <li> Overall a good product.</li>
            <li> As a lifetime Gillette guy, even typing that stuns me, but it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> Kings of shaves is the best shave I ever gotten hands down!!!</li>
            <li> Clean shaves, very rare nicks or cuts, very reasonable prices.</li>
            <li> If enough ads proclaim more blades are better then it must be true.</li>
            <li> We were so happy to find them at such a reasonable price here.</li>
            <li> The replacement cartridges are easy to change out in the razor, and they provide the same smooth shave as the original cartridge!</li>
            <li> Not worth it even at a great price.</li>
            <li> I have had mine for a week and went from a Gillette Fusion 4 blade to a much better Schick Quattro 4 blade to this new Remington.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t knock the hairs out of the blade because the blade is not attached very well to the handle and comes off too easily.  </li>
            <li> The five blades in the KOS razor are REALLY close together and can clog easily.</li>
            <li> will never purchase those brand named razor cartridges nor razor again, as long as this Remington Azor Shavor Cartridges exist and at this great customer discount and specials for an even greater bargain purchase , which I totally took advantage</li>
            <li> /&gt;Even if they are free, they cost too much.</li>
            <li> If it had been free, it would have cost to much.  </li>
            <li> The reason why the Azor is such an effective razor is because of</li>
            <li> , well worth the price</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> The product offers a smooth shave which my wife loves!</li>
            <li> She really liked it so it wasn&#x27;t a total wash out</li>
            <li> Good for not much growth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried tapping the head in hot water and the blades are still full of hairs.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s also fun to get a shaving soap in a dish and a shaving brush.</li>
            <li> The shaver has a funny angle but he adapted to it quite quickly and loves the feel of the razor in his hand.</li>
            <li> I much prefer the original, pre-Remington co-branded,4 blade version.</li>
            <li> No nicks or cuts and glided right over the skin.  </li>
            <li> The handle design does not allow the blade to get the area right under my nose</li>
            <li> again - putting a new blade on the razor is not at all easy.</li>
            <li> &quot; This is not 100% accurate for that particular area.</li>
            <li> I have tried both and consider this to be just as good as the Gillette blade at half</li>
            <li> I had the 4 blade razors by these guys and found them far superior in that they weren&#x27;t constantly clogged up.</li>
            <li> When I got these and had the first shave</li>
            <li> pretty uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> While the blade does provide an interestingly close shave (I used it constantly for two months)</li>
            <li> Since I like my legs to be soft and smooth</li>
            <li> I was recently given a sample Azor 5 razor to try and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all sorts of razors over the years, most recently all multi-bladed.  </li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t work very well!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s replacement cartridges that run up to $46.00 or higher for packs of 8, 16 and 24 replacement</li>
            <li> When I first got the razor, the razors that came with it shaved so well</li>
            <li> I like these a lot, but I worry about being able to get them in the future.</li>
            <li> The blades are much closer together than US Razor Blades !</li>
            <li> The first stroke of the razor cuts some of the hair.</li>
            <li> (Make sure you get a well-reviewed handle -- they&#x27;re not all created equal.)  </li>
            <li> (Make sure you get a well-reviewed handle -- they&#x27;re not all created equal.)  </li>
            <li> got the razor as a gift and loved it, blades were hard to find till I found these at a super price.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, you may have found your new favorite razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works great on the first shave, but the cartridge requires more frequent replacement than several of the other razors; the space between the blades are more prone to getting stuffed with hair stubble and shaving cream than other designs.  </li>
            <li> But if you have 4+ days of growth, then first use one of those cheap blades that are at a 45 degree angle to reduce the size of the beard then go back and use the King of shave5.  </li>
            <li> If I have a lot of growth I first use a store brand which gets me semi smooth, then I go back with King of Shave5</li>
            <li> According to the description, \\&quot;The cartridges&#x27; slimline design makes precision grooming easy in tricky areas, such as under the nose.\\</li>
            <li> They last a good long time as well.  </li>
            <li> Why do reviews need a certain number of words?</li>
            <li> It will continue to give a smooth clean cut longer than any other.</li>
            <li> though these blades are considerably cheaper than my Gillette blades changing them so often does not make them an economical purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and despite the fact that I really wanted it to kick Schick and Gillette&#x27;s behinds just to mix things up a bit, its flaws eventually wore me done as I realized</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this razor and these cartridges!  </li>
            <li> Schicks are much safer but you have to work at getting a close shave.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I am using it very please with this purchase.</li>
            <li> That close and gentle shave comes with some useability asterisks, however.</li>
            <li> (This is one arena where Gillette razors really shine.</li>
            <li> This razor is so gentle, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t even feel like you&#x27;re shaving.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bottom line:  I really like the King of</li>
            <li> After using this for a shave, I took out my el cheapo Gillette throw away razor and got a much closer shave.</li>
            <li> Much rather use Mach 3 or Gillette Fusion.</li>
            <li> These were my find for reasonably priced (about a dollar) cartridge blades.</li>
            <li> I can get at least 3 good shaves per cartridge</li>
            <li> Putting a new blade on the razor can be a challenge--definitely not as easy as the Big Two.  </li>
            <li> I got exactly what I expected from this 5 blade razor - a nice close shave - just that simple!</li>
            <li> I can use each KOS cartridge for a month (sometimes more) if I&#x27;m shaving every other day and not clogging the blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Due to a strip on the top of the cartridge, you will have to move your nose &amp; change the direction of your shave to get @</li>
            <li> I have found that by keeping the blade thoroughly clean and not allowing anything to build up between the blades is the key to longevity in the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And even then, with a fresh new blade, it tugs at my skin and hair as if it were three months old.</li>
            <li> I would rather have a much closer shave with a little more after effect skin irritation.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this new razer as glides much easier and leaves your face skin feeling nicer than the competition.    </li>
            <li> I gave the razor three stars mainly for effort.</li>
            <li> Yes i am really enjoying Garcinia Gambogia Extract not only loosing 15 pounds cut back my food bill.&lt;br /&gt;Took</li>
            <li> This seems to be the main problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took three to four more swipes to remove the facial hair than it normally does with my regular blade.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rate this a little better than the Gillette Proglide and Mach3.</li>
            <li> With that said, I am a self-appointed expert on the major razors available commercially.</li>
            <li> The blade flexes naturally with your face, thanks to high-torque suspension or whatever you want to call it.</li>
            <li> I like having the razor in my arsenal and as soon as I or King of Shaves figure out a way to get all the stubble out of the blades as well as make the razors last as long as they claim, I&#x27;ll throw two more stars up there.</li>
            <li> Then again this is a pretty common problem for me with most razors.    </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re just jumping into the upscale razor market and aren&#x27;t sure about the cost (as compared the the single &amp; double razors you get by the bucketload at the drug store)</li>
            <li> These blades don&#x27;t work a third as well right out of the package.</li>
            <li> This blade will give a super smooth shave, and if you take care of it, it stays sharp a long time.</li>
            <li> The cost of replacement cartridges is a genuine incentive for me due to the rate at which I go through cartridges.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, for the quality of the razor cartridge blades themselves, and that I get more shaves, equally as close with this Remington King Azor Shaver Cartridges, and an Equally close and long lasting shave with as I do or rather did, with the ridiculously overpriced , very popular main-streamed or main brand named razor</li>
            <li> The overall cost of a clean shave turned out to be same.</li>
            <li> you can use the blade 5 times before getting red off... found it at big lots but sold out quickly &#x27;</li>
            <li> also noticed the blades had started to go rusty, so I&#x27;m suspecting a lesser grade of stainless steal than Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found that no matter what I did, the blades dulled just as fast as the big brands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do not waste your time with this product.</li>
            <li> The Razor gives a very close shave, however US standard shaving cream clogs up razor !&lt;</li>
            <li> Because of the wishbone design, there is no place to put your finger up near the blade to get maximum contact and therefore, a close shave.</li>
            <li> My old razor &amp; blades system:</li>
            <li> Amazing design is the only shaver of any number of blades which actually fails to shave right.</li>
            <li> If there is a downside (and I don&#x27;t consider it as such) - it&#x27;s that the individual blades are close enough together, that I need to rinse more often during the shave than with other 5 blades razors.</li>
            <li> They dull easily.</li>
            <li> These blades barely last one shave before getting clogged and/or dull in spots (which causes grabbing of hairs more than slicing them).</li>
            <li> The price also seems very reasonable compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> Also, the blades don&#x27;t seem to hold up very well as I had to shave over the same spot multiple times.</li>
            <li> This provides an uneven shave as well as mild depression,.  </li>
            <li> If you leave any at all, it will quickly build up in subsequent shaves, and very quickly your shave will become uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> My husband has a tough beard and has tried many kinds of blades and shaving systems over the years.</li>
            <li> The shave from the Azor 5 razor has been unparalleled for us so far, and the replacement cartridges no different.</li>
            <li> Overall, the pros FAR outweigh the cons.</li>
            <li> My thought this system and blades are not for anyone, but ESPECIALLY those with sensitive skin........</li>
            <li> This product is great and much less expensive than Gilette Fusion Razor and blades.  </li>
            <li> My beard is of medium thickness, medium coarseness, and grows at an average to fast rate.  </li>
            <li> In fact, a regular two or three blade razor generally lasts 6-9 months for me.</li>
            <li> Although the cartridges were easy to remove (in fact sometime they just pop off) found it difficult to replace with a new one.</li>
            <li> I agree totally with an earlier review, I thought I could save a ton of money versus muy old razor, but this system after 1/2 dozen uses literally tore up my face, ESPECIALLY the upper lip area!  </li>
            <li> It is not very water soluble, and becomes trapped between the blades, where it then captures whiskers and quickly renders the blade unusable.</li>
            <li> These Kings seem something different -- safe as a Schick (even less dead skin cells in the swarf) but close in few passes like a Gillette.</li>
            <li> Anyone, with a thick beard and who must shave every day, this Remington King Azor shaver Cartridges can&#x27;t be beat for the price and the quality of the blades that last longer than the brand name offered at a MUCH HIGHER price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think the blades on the Remington King are spaced to close together and also are to flat an angle to give you a close shave.  </li>
            <li> They did not give me any cuts and will last a long time for me.</li>
            <li> (they each last quite long!)</li>
            <li> but after a few months and this new box of razor blades...</li>
            <li> The blades are very durable and cut cleanly, not leaving me with a rash like other brands.</li>
            <li> He stated that it was more difficult to get these on and off as compared to other razors with replacement cartridges.  </li>
            <li> I was really surprised when one review said you could not clean it?</li>
            <li> If the cartridge lasted as long as 3 or 4 bladed models, I would rate this item at 4 or 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The cartridges are less expensive than the other top three razor brands currently on the market.</li>
            <li> Just looking at this razor, you know it is going to feel different on your face than any other razor you&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Or maybe me &amp; the other guy complaining about this just have big honking</li>
            <li> Whiskers get stuck between the blades and near impossible to clean out</li>
            <li> I also bought one for my wife to use instead of her single blade throw aways.  </li>
            <li> In my experience, a SINGLE cartridge, used 3 times a week lasts me 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> A single shave would clog the blades and gives un even shaves.</li>
            <li> These cartridges last longer than any other I have ever used!  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much more I can say, except that I&#x27;m perplexed by all the poor reviews.</li>
            <li> do agree with a previous reviewer that there are issues with the design of the razor and especially with the cartridges remaining on the razor.  </li>
            <li> Not a big deal, but a little annoying.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The design of the blade is such that even my wimpy little hairs don&#x27;t get cut close unless I scrape my face three or four times.</li>
            <li> - Marquis de Sade couldn&#x27;t have come up with a more painful way of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;By taking care of the blade, of course be careful not to ding it or bump it on anything.</li>
            <li> After receiving a handle and few sample blades as a bonus with a purchase of Remington&#x27;s King of Shave low foam shaving gel, I became hooked on these.  </li>
            <li> If I tap it harder the blade comes off the handle which is not easy to put back on.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t give a good shave, hair gets stuck between the blades and is impossible to remove making them useless after one shave, the head does not flex nearly enough to shave along the neck, and the blades continually fall off the handle.</li>
            <li> Bursting with hit-yourself-on-the-forehead-and-say-why-didn&#x27;t-I-think-of-that?!kind of simplicity, this razor is basically all the other mega-multiblade razors turned backwards and inside out.</li>
            <li> Could just be me, but I like a sharp blade and toss &#x27;em as soon as they even look like they&#x27;re going to start dragging.  </li>
            <li> What other motivation would they need?</li>
            <li> other brands don&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> This was a problem with some other shavers.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t find a sharp cartridge I will end up throwingf all of them</li>
            <li> With blades in the past he only got maybe 3 shaves out of a blade</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the blades are a slight bit awkward to replace - takes a little more effort than razors w/ the button that pops them off.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a little hard to put on a new razor from the pack.  </li>
            <li> I have had other brand razors in the past that you could not clean, but you definitely can with this</li>
            <li> Let me preface my review with this little tidbit: I have very little facial hair to shave.</li>
            <li> If you DON&#x27;T shave every day, you may be in for some tough sledding, having to pause frequently to dislodge beard from between the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the Remington last about 2-3 days before they are dull.</li>
            <li> but man it is no fun to shave anymore.  </li>
            <li> It in fact does not shave as close as my Schick Quattro and have down rated to 3 stars.  </li>
            <li> It could be that I have worn out the rubber bend thing for the razor head (which is part of the razor handle) or it could be some oddly angled blades</li>
            <li> Costs a lot less than Gillette replacements.</li>
            <li> The blades will not stay attached to the odd divining-rod style attachment.</li>
            <li> Allegedly less resources are used in production, to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For me - the worst problem is that I can not shave the top of my upper lip AT ALL with this razor.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought that five cutting blades would be overkill and probably unwieldy; however, that&#x27;s not the case.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little work, but once you figure out where to hold the razor when you&#x27;re ejecting and attaching a razor</li>
            <li> it gets a little easier.  </li>
            <li> The cartridges are a little tricky to install &amp; remove from the holder.</li>
            <li> so you get a really close comfy shave and less chance of cutting or blade dulling.</li>
            <li> Just as expected hard to find in retail stores</li>
            <li> have heavy beard and one razor</li>
            <li> It clogs after a few strokes.</li>
            <li> So it then gives an uneven shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the replacement cartridges are slightly awkward to apply back onto the razor.</li>
            <li> He experiences fewer ingrown hairs, and doesn&#x27;t have to use excessive pressure to shave.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, 5 blades are no better than four which are no better than three.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the problem is.  </li>
            <li> Then I was not able to get replacements...  </li>
            <li> It shaves just like the competition if not better.</li>
            <li> I should shave every day, but usually shave every</li>
            <li> No more than a days growth is acceptable.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s useless for travel because I&#x27;d have to carry 2 different razors.</li>
            <li> Blades are as dull as used blades.</li>
            <li> Not on his legs - at least I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s using it on his legs......</li>
            <li> The five blades lacked the cutting power of my regular blade.  </li>
            <li> This product sucks.</li>
            <li> I have a really thick beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He has used the king of shaves of razors for that past 4 months, and he thinks that it rocks!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually difficult to nick yourself using the Azor and there is so much less irritation.</li>
            <li> blades are a little too close together, so rinsing stubble from between the blades is difficult.</li>
            <li> Disappointing and not worth the cost</li>
            <li> gel is very hard to rinse from between the blades.</li>
            <li> Five wear out faster than the others and it&#x27;s tough to realize the value.</li>
            <li> three even worse</li>
            <li> Poor design.</li>
            <li> In any case, you could do a lot worse than Remington&#x27;s King of Shaves blades.</li>
            <li> In any case, you could do a lot worse than Remington&#x27;s King of Shaves blades.</li>
            <li> If you have a thick beard, they are useless.  </li>
            <li> Anyone who has used King of Shave gels and oils know they&#x27;re committed to giving men something other than that dreadful useless white foam.</li>
            <li> God forbid you should go with out shaving for a few days and then try to use these bad boys</li>
            <li> The blades are a little too close together, so rinsing stubble from the razor is difficult if not sometimes impossible.</li>
            <li> Like one of the other reviews said, its just crap.</li>
            <li> The angle of the blades is terrible and you will have to go over one spot multiple times just to remove the stubble.  </li>
            <li> like others have said, you get 1 or 2 mediocre shaves, and then the blades are useless.  </li>
            <li> Because razors and blades are so expensive, I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> I tried to make them work and suffered for three months, changing the blade every month because I thought something was wrong with each one.</li>
            <li> And when the do, the quality of the shave is very poor.</li>
            <li> I am prone to cutting myself when shaving, but I finish without cuts with these blades.</li>
            <li> All in all a disappointment.</li>
            <li> One of the worst purchases ever - seriously considering throwing away the remaining blades and using a weed whacker.  </li>
            <li> but it turned out to be a bad choice.</li>
            <li> Regardless of whether the blades were bad or the handle is worn out, I&#x27;m scared to shave... :(</li>
            <li> Really crap.</li>
            <li> You may HATE it.</li>
            <li> This creates horrible razor burn and irritation.  </li>
            <li> These are the worst razors I have bought and tried.  </li>
            <li> These are, without a doubt, the WORST blades I have ever had the misfortune to purchase.</li>
            <li> wanted to say that I bought these and used them and they are terrible.</li>
            <li> This razor is horrible and barley removes any hair.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s a close shave, fairly easy to use and no problems cleaning, seems like a good value. One downside is how easy it is to unintentionally eject a cartridge.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaving system.  I also bought one for my wife to use instead of her single blade throw aways.  Clean shaves, very rare nicks or cuts, very reasonable prices.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints for these replacement blades. I am prone to cutting myself when shaving, but I finish without cuts with these blades. They glide over the skin with ease. I would recommend these blades to others.</li>
            <li> I have had mine for a week and went from a Gillette Fusion 4 blade to a much better Schick Quattro 4 blade to this new Remington.  It gives you a smoother comfortable shave than the others.  The blade hinge mechanism could have stronger tension and will see if becomes weaker over time.  I will continue to use this new razer as glides much easier and leaves your face skin feeling nicer than the competition.    Update:    I jumped to conclusions on my review and did not allow enough time to thoroughly examine.  After a weeks usage, I have changed my mind.  It in fact does not shave as close as my Schick Quattro and have down rated to 3 stars.  I think the blades on the Remington King are spaced to close together and also are to flat an angle to give you a close shave.  Because of the softness of the hinge design, you can&#x27;t apply pressure of the blades to your skin for possible closer shave.  I have gone back to using my Schick Quattro.  I would rather have a much closer shave with a little more after effect skin irritation.</li>
            <li> Although the cartridges were easy to remove (in fact sometime they just pop off) found it difficult to replace with a new one.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than Gillette, and a more comfortable shave. There&#x27;s not much more I can say, except that I&#x27;m perplexed by all the poor reviews.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> When I got these and had the first shave I was impressed, I love my king of shaves gel and the combination of the two gave me a great close shave.&lt;br /&gt;Day two with the same blade and it was noticeably duller&lt;br /&gt;Day three even worse&lt;br /&gt;Day four it was starting to feel pretty uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;Even though these blades are considerably cheaper than my Gillette blades changing them so often does not make them an economical purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed the blades had started to go rusty, so I&#x27;m suspecting a lesser grade of stainless steal than Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they run out I will not be replacing them.</li>
            <li> They look cool and they seem like a great idea but you are simply wasting your money.  The angle of the blades is terrible and you will have to go over one spot multiple times just to remove the stubble.  This creates horrible razor burn and irritation.  I attempted to shave my head as I do with my Schick Hydro and there was no way that was occurring.  The blades simply would not grab the hairs.  These are the worst razors I have bought and tried.  I really wanted to love them.</li>
            <li> Just looking at this razor, you know it is going to feel different on your face than any other razor you&#x27;ve ever used. Bursting with hit-yourself-on-the-forehead-and-say-why-didn&#x27;t-I-think-of-that?!kind of simplicity, this razor is basically all the other mega-multiblade razors turned backwards and inside out. The blade flexes naturally with your face, thanks to high-torque suspension or whatever you want to call it. Take a look at the picture. You just know that thing is going to give you a close shave. Anyone who has used King of Shave gels and oils know they&#x27;re committed to giving men something other than that dreadful useless white foam. So why would their stab at a razor be any different?  Engineering baby. Engineering.  While the blade does provide an interestingly close shave (I used it constantly for two months) and despite the fact that I really wanted it to kick Schick and Gillette&#x27;s behinds just to mix things up a bit, its flaws eventually wore me done as I realized I was not going to get around them. As always, user experience will vary, but here are the problems I had with this razor, all of which are a matter of fine tuning:  *The blades are a little too close together, so rinsing stubble from the razor is difficult if not sometimes impossible.This provides an uneven shave as well as mild depression,.  *Putting a new blade on the razor can be a challenge--definitely not as easy as the Big Two.  *I found that no matter what I did, the blades dulled just as fast as the big brands. Could just be me, but I like a sharp blade and toss &#x27;em as soon as they even look like they&#x27;re going to start dragging.  I gave the razor three stars mainly for effort. I like having the razor in my arsenal and as soon as I or King of Shaves figure out a way to get all the stubble out of the blades as well as make the razors last as long as they claim, I&#x27;ll throw two more stars up there. What other motivation would they need?</li>
            <li> LOVE this razor.  Best for my legs...ever.  And, I catch my husband using it, too.  Not on his legs - at least I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s using it on his legs......</li>
            <li> These are, without a doubt, the WORST blades I have ever had the misfortune to purchase. You couldn&#x27;t shave the fuzz off of a peach with these blades. They do not come anywhere close to giving me a close shave without going over areas multiple times. The blades are too close together and constantly clog. The blades housing does not allow water to get to the clog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste your time with this product.</li>
            <li> The five blades lacked the cutting power of my regular blade.  It took three to four more swipes to remove the facial hair than it normally does with my regular blade.</li>
            <li> I like this razor and cartridges.  They are easy to take on and off.  They did not give me any cuts and will last a long time for me. The price also seems very reasonable compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> The replacement cartridges are easy to change out in the razor, and they provide the same smooth shave as the original cartridge!</li>
            <li> The shave from the Azor 5 razor has been unparalleled for us so far, and the replacement cartridges no different. My only complaint is that the replacement cartridges are slightly awkward to apply back onto the razor. Overall, the pros FAR outweigh the cons. Great razor cartridges for a good price! (they each last quite long!)</li>
            <li> The reason why the Azor is such an effective razor is because of it&#x27;s five blades.  That&#x27;s why I like to change my razors regularly so that it keeps a close shave.  My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a little hard to put on a new razor from the pack.  It takes a little work, but once you figure out where to hold the razor when you&#x27;re ejecting and attaching a razor it gets a little easier.  Then again this is a pretty common problem for me with most razors.    Overall a good product.</li>
            <li> My husband just loved the razor and the blades are really a good buy....You cant buy them at this price which we got it for in the store...would recomment it to anyone</li>
            <li> quick delivery great price close shave liked it very well  I  will definitely try it again., well worth the price</li>
            <li> To put it bluntly, if you an owner of the Azor 5, you&#x27;re going to eventually need to purchase replacement cartridges. However, the good part is that this box includes 6 cartridges. In my experience, a SINGLE cartridge, used 3 times a week lasts me 2-3 weeks. Based upon my usage, this box will last me quite some time.    Not bad.</li>
            <li> Great razor and cartridges.  No nicks or cuts and glided right over the skin.  I highly recommend this razor and these cartridges!  Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Since I like my legs to be soft and smooth I shave them regularly all summer...winter don&#x27;t ask :) I was recently given a sample Azor 5 razor to try and fell in love with it. The gliding plane delivers a close, nick-free shave each time. I can get at least 3 good shaves per cartridge so this will last me a bit. I actually purchased TWO boxes of cartridges while on sale and another razor for my travel bag.</li>
            <li> The cartridges are good, but I didn&#x27;t get a clean shave because the locking mechanism of the razor was defective.</li>
            <li> Everyone will have their own opinion, and I have mine.  I&#x27;ve used all sorts of razors over the years, most recently all multi-bladed.  For me, the Gillettes are a bit too aggressive (angles &amp; spacing) and while they give close shaves, they also produce more nicks.  Schicks are much safer but you have to work at getting a close shave.  These Kings seem something different -- safe as a Schick (even less dead skin cells in the swarf) but close in few passes like a Gillette.</li>
            <li> Garbage. Poor design. Amazing design is the only shaver of any number of blades which actually fails to shave right. Are the engineers just making anything and the bosses putting them in the market? Try shaving with this thing!! Oh lord horrid.</li>
            <li> My significant other loved this brand and razor, so I purchased more.  He experiences fewer ingrown hairs, and doesn&#x27;t have to use excessive pressure to shave.  Nice buy.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> It was great because this (Amazon) was the only place I could find this item. Otherwise, 5 blades are no better than four which are no better than three. Five wear out faster than the others and it&#x27;s tough to realize the value.</li>
            <li> Just as expected hard to find in retail stores</li>
            <li> Best Razor I have ever used.Great value, better product!&lt;br /&gt;Wish it was sold in stores around here!&lt;br /&gt;I would never go back to the Gillette Mach gain!</li>
            <li> Yes i am really enjoying Garcinia Gambogia Extract not only loosing 15 pounds cut back my food bill.&lt;br /&gt;Took other brands don&#x27;t compare. Thanks Garcinia Gambogia Glad I found you. Harold Zito</li>
            <li> I love these. I&#x27;ve been using them for over a year, for both my beard and my legs (I&#x27;m a long-time bicycle racer - we shave our legs) and they give a rally close shave and I have literally never had a nick or cut.  What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t work very well! Disappointing and not worth the cost</li>
            <li> This blade will give a super smooth shave, and if you take care of it, it stays sharp a long time. This is the best deal out there on multi-blade razor. Note these are priced at well under $2 a blade, while the Gillete 5 blade fusion blades come in at close to $4 a blade. I have tried both and consider this to be just as good as the Gillette blade at half the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By taking care of the blade, of course be careful not to ding it or bump it on anything. This is usually not an issue in your own bathroom, but when you trevel, take care to pack it so that nothing can bump it in your travel bag. Just as important as not dinging it, make sure to not let the blade get clogged. After shaving look carefully and make sure that you have successfully rinsed all the debris away from between the blades. If you leave any at all, it will quickly build up in subsequent shaves, and very quickly your shave will become uncomfortable. I have found that by keeping the blade thoroughly clean and not allowing anything to build up between the blades is the key to longevity in the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that the Remington Aqua Gel shave gel is very hard to rinse from between the blades. It is not very water soluble, and becomes trapped between the blades, where it then captures whiskers and quickly renders the blade unusable. I have found that the Gillette Proglide Gel to be easier to rinse from between the blades, and is a better price than the Remington product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bottom line is that the smoothest, most economical shave comes by using the Remington Azor 5 blade razor, combines with the Gillette Proglide shave Gel. Keep the razor clean and thoroughly rinses, and you can easily get over a month of smooth shaves from the blade.</li>
            <li> Great Deal and Product. Much better than going to a retail store. The product offers a smooth shave which my wife loves! wink wink</li>
            <li> These go with the Azor razor, which I really love and rely on.  I find them really good for shaving my head. They last a good long time as well.  I&#x27;ve used the same blade for up to 2 weeks with no problem. If there is a downside (and I don&#x27;t consider it as such) - it&#x27;s that the individual blades are close enough together, that I need to rinse more often during the shave than with other 5 blades razors. Even with that, I give it a strong 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I bought the handle to give it a try. Did not like it at all so I gave to my wife. She really liked it so it wasn&#x27;t a total wash out</li>
            <li> The blade to beat is the Gillette Mach Three. These blades don&#x27;t work a third as well right out of the package. They also clog very easily.</li>
            <li> Bought these off Woot because they were offered at a steep discount.  One of the worst purchases ever - seriously considering throwing away the remaining blades and using a weed whacker.  I&#x27;ve had cheapo disposables that work 10x better - like others have said, you get 1 or 2 mediocre shaves, and then the blades are useless.  God forbid you should go with out shaving for a few days and then try to use these bad boys - Marquis de Sade couldn&#x27;t have come up with a more painful way of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if they are free, they cost too much.</li>
            <li> I recently got my hands on this razor for my boyfriend and it came with 3 cartridges.  He stated that it was more difficult to get these on and off as compared to other razors with replacement cartridges.  While they were not the most difficult it was not like the ones he has used where you click a button and they snap off.</li>
            <li> My impression is overall great of this 5 blade product.The blades are very sharp,and very precise..I am happy to use it and will be replacing my old one for sure!! The replacement box should last you at a minimum of 6-8 weeks!</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I expected from this 5 blade razor - a nice close shave - just that simple! My only complaint is the blades are a slight bit awkward to replace - takes a little more effort than razors w/ the button that pops them off.</li>
            <li> After receiving a handle and few sample blades as a bonus with a purchase of Remington&#x27;s King of Shave low foam shaving gel, I became hooked on these.  At first, I thought that five cutting blades would be overkill and probably unwieldy; however, that&#x27;s not the case.  The Remington gel really seems to help me get a close shave and maintain good moisture, especially important in dry winter weather.  The shave with the King of Shaves razor system, though, is even smoother and closer than with any three or four-blade system I&#x27;ve tried from Schick or Gillette, and as a result works in tandem with Remington&#x27;s gel exceptionally well.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have been shaving my head daily in the shower for the last seventeen years. With that said, I am a self-appointed expert on the major razors available commercially. Overall, Remington &#x27; &amp;#34;King of Shaves&amp;#34; razors have been consistent in providing an excellent shave. The cartridges are less expensive than the other top three razor brands currently on the market. The cost of replacement cartridges is a genuine incentive for me due to the rate at which I go through cartridges. If you are irritated by the price for Gillette and/or Schick brand replacement razor cartridges, but do not want to annihilate your skin with garbage dollar store razors, I recommend using Remington&#x27;s &amp;#34;King of Shaves&amp;#34; yourself for the minimum of one month.</li>
            <li> This product is great and much less expensive than Gilette Fusion Razor and blades.  Easy to use and and gives a great shave! I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> got the razor as a gift and loved it, blades were hard to find till I found these at a super price.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Remington  King Azor razor and shaver replacement cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do agree with a previous reviewer that there are issues with the design of the razor and especially with the cartridges remaining on the razor.  This seems to be the main problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, for the quality of the razor cartridge blades themselves, and that I get more shaves, equally as close with this Remington King Azor Shaver Cartridges, and an Equally close and long lasting shave with as I do or rather did, with the ridiculously overpriced , very popular main-streamed or main brand named razor and it&#x27;s replacement cartridges that run up to $46.00 or higher for packs of 8, 16 and 24 replacement cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never purchase those brand named razor cartridges nor razor again, as long as this Remington Azor Shavor Cartridges exist and at this great customer discount and specials for an even greater bargain purchase , which I totally took advantage of!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mentioned that there is a problem with the cartridge not staying on the razor during use.  However, this cartridge has a plastic attachment that makes it easier to just grab the cartridge and shave my face without the razor.  Either way.  Anyone, with a thick beard and who must shave every day, this Remington King Azor shaver Cartridges can&#x27;t be beat for the price and the quality of the blades that last longer than the brand name offered at a MUCH HIGHER price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Love this product...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brian&lt;br /&gt;garciaretin@yahoo.com</li>
            <li> I had the 4 blade razors by these guys and found them far superior in that they weren&#x27;t constantly clogged up. I wont  buy the 5 blade razors again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the problem is.  It could be that I have worn out the rubber bend thing for the razor head (which is part of the razor handle) or it could be some oddly angled blades but man it is no fun to shave anymore.  When I first got the razor, the razors that came with it shaved so well but after a few months and this new box of razor blades...OUCH!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have decided to move away from the Azor after this experience.  Regardless of whether the blades were bad or the handle is worn out, I&#x27;m scared to shave... :(</li>
            <li> TOTAL GARBAGE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just wanted to say that I bought these and used them and they are terrible. Really crap. DO NOT PURCHASE! They don&#x27;t give a good shave, hair gets stuck between the blades and is impossible to remove making them useless after one shave, the head does not flex nearly enough to shave along the neck, and the blades continually fall off the handle. Ugh.</li>
            <li> A razors go today it seams that the more blades a razor has the money you have to lay out for a shave. These guys have got the blades and have a great price point, refills are on the way.</li>
            <li> What a great shave...  Then I was not able to get replacements...  Found these on Amazon and&lt;br /&gt;NOW I AM A HAPPY CAMPER AGAIN.....</li>
            <li> I like these a lot, but I worry about being able to get them in the future.</li>
            <li> These cartridges last longer than any other I have ever used!  They are the best on the market for the price!</li>
            <li> I have tried just about every razor.  The best way to describe is this is a daily use razor.  The blades are angled \\&quot;down\\&quot; so you get a really close comfy shave and less chance of cutting or blade dulling. But if you have 4+ days of growth, then first use one of those cheap blades that are at a 45 degree angle to reduce the size of the beard then go back and use the King of shave5.  If I have a lot of growth I first use a store brand which gets me semi smooth, then I go back with King of Shave5 and I get baby smooth. I have a really thick beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor has more flex than any system out there on the handle that holds the blades.  Turned the razord backwards in the water washed out all the stubble.  I was really surprised when one review said you could not clean it? because you can. I have had other brand razors in the past that you could not clean, but you definitely can with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rate this a little better than the Gillette Proglide and Mach3.</li>
            <li> Picked this item on a sale.  Works great on the first shave, but the cartridge requires more frequent replacement than several of the other razors; the space between the blades are more prone to getting stuffed with hair stubble and shaving cream than other designs.  If the cartridge lasted as long as 3 or 4 bladed models, I would rate this item at 4 or 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best, longest lasting blade on the market. It will continue to give a smooth clean cut longer than any other.</li>
            <li> I found this razor and blades one day while surfing the site and decided why not. The razor blades I used were $16 for four. The shave is close but it does take some getting used to.</li>
            <li> Blades are not sold in US !  The Razor gives a very close shave, however US standard shaving cream clogs up razor !&lt;br /&gt;Baby Oil works just fine ! I would buy again if sold in USA. The blades are much closer together than US Razor Blades !</li>
            <li> Cuts clean, no shave burns. Would definitely buy again. Costs a lot less than Gillette replacements.</li>
            <li> Their are a lot of 3, 4, and 5 blade shavers on the market.I get a close shave and have not cut myself. This was a problem with some other shavers.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my Quad blade razor. I love the shape and the way it looks, but the balance isn&#x27;t correct. Because of the wishbone design, there is no place to put your finger up near the blade to get maximum contact and therefore, a close shave. Also, the blades don&#x27;t seem to hold up very well as I had to shave over the same spot multiple times. All in all a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Buy it excellent product. I am using it very please with this purchase. I recommends not to buy it, you will be happy.</li>
            <li> This razor is horrible and barley removes any hair. I switched from using Gillette Fusion Pro-Glide for over 7 years to the Remington King of Shaves because it was on clearance and now I know why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are too close together and clog easily. The first stroke of the razor cuts some of the hair. Then after a rinse and repeat all I feel is tugging on my face. I find myself reapplying shaving cream 2-3 times and re-shaving in order to get all of the hair. Even then there is plenty of stubble left but by then I have given up and need to get on with my day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going back to my Fusion as soon as possible. It is by far a more superior razor and worth the price in my opinion. Especially considering I can go 3-4 weeks on one Fusion cartridge but the Remington last about 2-3 days before they are dull.</li>
            <li> I agree totally with an earlier review, I thought I could save a ton of money versus muy old razor, but this system after 1/2 dozen uses literally tore up my face, ESPECIALLY the upper lip area!  My thought this system and blades are not for anyone, but ESPECIALLY those with sensitive skin........Do not buy.  My old razor &amp; blades system: Gillette Fusion</li>
            <li> These blades barely last one shave before getting clogged and/or dull in spots (which causes grabbing of hairs more than slicing them). You can&#x27;t knock the hairs out of the blade because the blade is not attached very well to the handle and comes off too easily.  Not worth it even at a great price.</li>
            <li> Closest shave yet.  My son gave these to me a year ago for Xmas and I had to restock.  Use to use a 3 blade shaved this beats it.</li>
            <li> The King of Shaves razor is by far the best razor I have ever used and the blades are great too. Its hard to find the replacement blades in stores so coming to Amazon is the best choice.The blades are very durable and cut cleanly, not leaving me with a rash like other brands.</li>
            <li> My husband got this razor free at Walgreens.  He loved it but we could not find replacement blades.  We were so happy to find them at such a reasonable price here.</li>
            <li> The king of shaves razor is a great deal at the price.  My husband loves it.  It shaves just like the competition if not better. He has tried them all.  What is interesting is that I do not see this sold at Maryland department stores.  The shave it gives, at a price that is more economical then the competition, keeps him coming back.  He has used the king of shaves of razors for that past 4 months, and he thinks that it rocks!</li>
            <li> My husband is the user and says its the best he&#x27;s used in years.  Why do reviews need a certain number of words?</li>
            <li> So you can tell by my review title that I&#x27;ve got mixed feelings about this razor. You may LOVE it. You may HATE it. Let&#x27;s try to figure out what camp you&#x27;ll find yourself in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The baseline: My beard is of medium thickness, medium coarseness, and grows at an average to fast rate.  I should shave every day, but usually shave every other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remmington King of Shaves (KOS) razor heads provide the closest, gentlest shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced with a razor and that includes everything I&#x27;ve tried made by Gillette. As a lifetime Gillette guy, even typing that stuns me, but it&#x27;s true. That close and gentle shave comes with some useability asterisks, however. The five blades in the KOS razor are REALLY close together and can clog easily. I find that if I shave every day, I don&#x27;t have a problem with hair getting stuck between the blades. If I skip a day, I&#x27;m still usually OK. Skip two days? Fuggetaboutit. This baby is getting clogged. (This is one arena where Gillette razors really shine. You can get Gillette razors to cut just about anything of any length with some TLC.)  If you have sensitive skin, you may have found your new favorite razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF you shave every day, you&#x27;ll be rewarded. This razor is so gentle, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t even feel like you&#x27;re shaving. It&#x27;s more like a kitten patting your face (claws not included). If you DON&#x27;T shave every day, you may be in for some tough sledding, having to pause frequently to dislodge beard from between the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re just jumping into the upscale razor market and aren&#x27;t sure about the cost (as compared the the single &amp; double razors you get by the bucketload at the drug store), let me encourage you: Do it.  You&#x27;ll actually SAVE money using this type of razor.  The cheapies have to be disposed of after 1 - 2 shaves.  I can use each KOS cartridge for a month (sometimes more) if I&#x27;m shaving every other day and not clogging the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line:  I really like the King of Shaves blades.  (Make sure you get a well-reviewed handle -- they&#x27;re not all created equal.)  And though it provides the closest, gentlest shave I&#x27;ve ever encountered, I still think that high-end Gillette blades are superior from an all-around perspective (close shave, don&#x27;t clog).  In any case, you could do a lot worse than Remington&#x27;s King of Shaves blades.King of Shaves blades.  (Make sure you get a well-reviewed handle -- they&#x27;re not all created equal.)

            <li> I used to shave with Gillette, this time I wanted to try Remington but it turned out to be a bad choice. A single shave would clog the blades and gives un even shaves. So I had to replace the cartridge more often than Gillette. The overall cost of a clean shave turned out to be same. Even though it is cheaper in price I would not recommend this. Given two stars for the price. What you pay what you get!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this razor and blades set as an offered special price. Because razors and blades are so expensive, I gave it a try. If it had been free, it would have cost to much.  The blades will not stay attached to the odd divining-rod style attachment. And when the do, the quality of the shave is very poor. Caveat emptor!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price versus the big advertising competition. It&#x27;s actually difficult to nick yourself using the Azor and there is so much less irritation. If you are trying them for the 1st time, you&#x27;ll find that you will be shaving @ a different angle. It is a quality razor that will give you a nice close shave. The leading pre-tensioning strip actually works well. Allegedly less resources are used in production, to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  That being said, some complaints in these reviews are valid.&lt;br /&gt;1. Due to a strip on the top of the cartridge, you will have to move your nose &amp; change the direction of your shave to get @ the hair under your nostrils. According to the description, \\&quot;The cartridges&#x27; slimline design makes precision grooming easy in tricky areas, such as under the nose.\\&quot; This is not 100% accurate for that particular area. Or maybe me &amp; the other guy complaining about this just have big honking noses.&lt;br /&gt;2. The cartridges are a little tricky to install &amp; remove from the holder. Not a big deal, but a little annoying.&lt;br /&gt;3. Cartridges come off of the handle too easily. If you like to bang your razor on the sink, it&#x27;s not for you.&lt;br /&gt;4. The 5 blades are spaced so close together that they are prone to clogging if you aren&#x27;t vigilant and rinse often. If you keep up on it, the blades will last longer than the competition. If you don&#x27;t, they won&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ve been using King of Shaves products for around 4 years. I much prefer the original, pre-Remington co-branded,4 blade version. If you can believe what you read, the head of KoS was against going to 5 blades but succumbed to market pressure. If enough ads proclaim more blades are better then it must be true. The 5 blade Azor is certainly a top Bang for the Buck product, but it isn&#x27;t perfect. I guess I should mention that I shave daily, occasionally twice a day.</li>
            <li> Kings of shaves is the best shave I ever gotten hands down!!! Never cuts me... always a perfect shave and cheap you can use the blade 5 times before getting red off... found it at big lots but sold out quickly &#x27;(  so now I&#x27;m here  lol</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get in a close area with this razor. Also does not give a close cut for areas that you can reach. Forget trying to trim around a mustache etc. After using this for a shave, I took out my el cheapo Gillette throw away razor and got a much closer shave. Like one of the other reviews said, its just crap.</li>
            <li> The blades are too close together and get clogged easily. Good for not much growth. No more than a days growth is acceptable. They dull easily. Much rather use Mach 3 or Gillette Fusion. I actually prefer the Mach 3 disposables. I bought a bunch because they were cheap. You get want you pay for I guess. They would do in a pinch but would rather spend my money on the better ones.</li>
            <li> These were my find for reasonably priced (about a dollar) cartridge blades. Seems Walgreen&#x27;s discontinued, so I stocked up here.</li>
            <li> Let me preface my review with this little tidbit: I have very little facial hair to shave. I can go three days without shaving to have the same amount of facial hair as \\&quot;most\\&quot; men have at the end of the work day. That said, I don&#x27;t need a super-duper shaver to get a good close shave. In fact, a regular two or three blade razor generally lasts 6-9 months for me. I found a deal for the Remington King of Shaves razor and refills on Woot and thought that it would give me a great shave and last me the rest of my life! But NO! The design of the blade is such that even my wimpy little hairs don&#x27;t get cut close unless I scrape my face three or four times. And even then, with a fresh new blade, it tugs at my skin and hair as if it were three months old. I tried to make them work and suffered for three months, changing the blade every month because I thought something was wrong with each one. Then one day I was on a trip and need a razor so I bought a $2.59 pack of 5 double-bladed disposables. The first shave with one of those throwaway blades was sheer joy! I got the closest shave I&#x27;ve had since before the \\&quot;King of Shaves\\&quot; and immediately boxed the handle and all the unused blades to donate to charity. DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> Always superior product&lt;br /&gt;I have heavy beard and one razor lasts me a month of daily shaves</li>
            <li> These blades last and last. I had to get more after a year.</li>
            <li> Blades are as dull as used blades. If I don&#x27;t find a sharp cartridge I will end up throwingf all of them away.&lt;br /&gt;Would not reccommend to anyone</li>
            <li> For me - the worst problem is that I can not shave the top of my upper lip AT ALL with this razor. The handle design does not allow the blade to get the area right under my nose AT ALL - I have to use another brand to shave that area. So it&#x27;s useless for travel because I&#x27;d have to carry 2 different razors. Even at home why would I spend money on keeping 2 different brands in the house all the time. I&#x27;m amazed that this was not noticed by anyone in tests or trials or by the designers. I defy anyone to demonstrate that they can shave with this razor and shave off the hairs under their nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are a little too close together, so rinsing stubble from between the blades is difficult. I&#x27;ve tried tapping the head in hot water and the blades are still full of hairs. If I tap it harder the blade comes off the handle which is not easy to put back on. I&#x27;ve even tried using a toothbrush to clean between the blades - no use. It clogs after a few strokes. So it then gives an uneven shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And again - putting a new blade on the razor is not at all easy.</li>
            <li> This product sucks. Whiskers get stuck between the blades and near impossible to clean out</li>
            <li> My husband has a tough beard and has tried many kinds of blades and shaving systems over the years. The shaver has a funny angle but he adapted to it quite quickly and loves the feel of the razor in his hand. With blades in the past he only got maybe 3 shaves out of a blade but with this one he gets 8-10! Highly recommend this product and it&#x27;s also fun to get a shaving soap in a dish and a shaving brush. Nice retro experience.</li>
            <li> I gave up trying to get a good shave from these. If you have a thick beard, they are useless.  They get clogged up and basically don&#x27;t take the hair off.</li>
