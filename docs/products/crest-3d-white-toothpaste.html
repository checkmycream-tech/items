            <li>This does a great job at whitening your teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste!!</li>
            <li>But, whether it does or not, I don&#x27;t care as this toothpaste has the most wonderful mouthwash-like taste of any toothpaste I have tried.  </li>
            <li>We noticed my teeth were getting whiter after a week of using it, and my teeth were a good amount whiter by the time we ran out.</li>
            <li>Crest is a good name in dental hygiene</li>
            <li>I am really delighted that I chose to give this product a try.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant to buy this after reading the not so good reviews, but i have no issues with this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Still, it is a good toothpaste and you can&#x27;t beat this price</li>
            <li>I was very pleased to find this offered by Amazon on subscribe &amp; save.  </li>
            <li>So, this is great since it is cheaper and it has more toothpaste in the tube.</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste!</li>
            <li>This enjoyable flavor stays in your mouth for hours--really!  </li>
            <li>There is something about this toothpaste when it foams up that invigorates your mouth and it helps to make your gums tingly in the most pleasant way.  </li>
            <li>I notice my teeth look amazing and shiny.</li>
            <li>I feel great, and know that its fluoride and anti-cavity properties keep me protected, clean, and</li>
            <li>but, I then used Radiant Mint flavour, which is very strong tasting.  </li>
            <li>I really love this toothpaste; it&#x27;s effective, but doesn&#x27;t sting.</li>
            <li>I used this toothpaste, Mint Fresh flavour with great results.  </li>
            <li>Now, in an effort at full disclosure, I&#x27;m one of those women who believes a good head of lather means my hair is getting really clean, and that a good bit of foam from my toothpaste means that my teeth and gums are getting good and clean.  </li>
            <li>The mint taste is great and my mouth feels very clean and fresh after use.</li>
            <li>My wife and I used this toothpaste and we were pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this toothpaste and Amazon has the best price to buy in bulk!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you, if I&#x27;m fully satisfied with this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather as much as most toothpastes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>What a fantastic surprise this stuff is!  </li>
            <li>I love the way my breath smells and mouth feels after brushing.  </li>
            <li>Ok, so everyone else is talking about the whitening effects of the toothpaste.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You know the drill with most toothpastes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would be beneficial to our environment as well.</li>
            <li>Love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Ive been using this for over a month now and LOVE</li>
            <li>This toothpaste has been our favorite for about a year now.  </li>
            <li>Love ordering my household item stuff from Amazon.</li>
            <li>:))</li>
            <li>I love Crest, I&#x27;ve used it for years now.</li>
            <li>Love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>The texture is lovely.</li>
            <li>Always buy my toothpaste from Amazon, buying in bulk is better and they always deliver on time with no problem.</li>
            <li>but it took 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, pretty good whitener</li>
            <li>Just purchased the product...has a nice taste, leaves my mouth feeling fresh, will give it more tme and update review</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, I&#x27;m satisfied with the results so far, and will be happy to continue using this product.&lt;br /&gt;Small tip:</li>
            <li>B004NMZR9A Crest Pro Health Invigorating Clean Mint Rinse, 16.9-Fluid Ounce (Pack of 2)]]&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!</li>
            <li>But my teeth feel clean even after waking up!</li>
            <li>My teeth are slick and feel clean under my tongue as I make sure I&#x27;ve gotten everything and that nice pop of breath freshening mint is really wonderful.  </li>
            <li>It tastes nice, is a good sized container, is effective in whitening, leaves my teeth feeling fresh until the next meal.  </li>
            <li>Not too strong flavored</li>
            <li>packaged fine</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please do yourself, your family, neighbors and the rest of the world a huge favor and get this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste worked great - i definitely had noticable results within two weeks, even using it alone.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t like Crest, but this is awesome!</li>
            <li>I did notice a significant difference....</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s see that smile!</li>
            <li>They will be dazzling for prom next month!</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t need to use the Crest Whitestrips as often.&lt;br /&gt;Reliable delivery - worth the multibuy!</li>
            <li>I bought this because I like the clean mint flavor crest makes (also in crest pro health), and I like it.</li>
            <li>makes teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li>&quot; Thanks to Crest 3D :)</li>
            <li>B00013TQPQ Listerine Antiseptic Mouthwash, Cool Mint, 1.5 Liters]]</li>
            <li>makes the whole mouth feel better.</li>
            <li>Again, it is NOT a bad product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great toothpaste in all other respects tho.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels fresh and clean when using this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only giving this thing 2 stars because the flavor is nice and my teeth feel clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>If you can use it with the additional Crest 3D White products for even better results!</li>
            <li>Plackers Gentle Fine Dental Flossers - 90]]</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m curious if I&#x27;m the only one who&#x27;s noticed the awesome breath-freshening aspects of this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>i was just hoping to get a movie star smile.</li>
            <li>Not only is the flavor intensely refreshing, it keeps your breath fresh for a good long while after you&#x27;ve rinsed your mouth.  </li>
            <li>It works really well and makes my mouth feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>This is easy to use, I can easily get to the last of the tube.</li>
            <li>after a good brushing and using other assorted tools to remove the offensive sight, I realized that they were coffee stains.  </li>
            <li>, right?</li>
            <li>I admit I was one of those people who watched the commercials on TV and thought, &#x27;Yeah, right...&#x27;</li>
            <li>So these came in the 4 pack, shipped right away,</li>
            <li>it makes my mouth feel really minty and clean</li>
            <li>The minty taste is pleasant but not too strong, the paste lathers into a thick foam that makes it easier to brush (I use an electric brush), and I did notice some whitening during the first week of use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It isn&#x27;t going to make them magically bright, but it will lighten them a few shades and give your smile a noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li>Try it first @</li>
            <li>/&gt;Colgate Total is proven to work better at preventing tartar buildup and cavities than Crest Pro-Health per PubMed article 21269038.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave any filmy residue in your mouth and really whitens smile.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty pricey tho.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper per tube than in the drugstores (unless it happens to be on sale somewhere else)!    </li>
            <li>We honestly couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between his other crest toothpaste and my Spry toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Not cheap, but truly different in a very good way.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t like Crest products, but this toothpaste is really good.</li>
            <li>But the whitening wasn&#x27;t strong enough.</li>
            <li>(it was $12 for 4 large tubes).</li>
            <li>The flavor is not so intense as to be unpleasant, it tastes good, and when you start brushing, it does work up a nice bit of foam.  </li>
            <li>but there are better solutions to whiten your teeth, to me this should be used to keep your teeth white if you had them professionally whitened!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gel-like with little beads and it polishes teeth nicely.  </li>
            <li>It does clean the surface stains, my teeth are pretty white</li>
            <li>As someone who lives at starbucks, really gets a lot of the stains off my teeth whether they are stuck on or just the day to day stuff.</li>
            <li>When you buy this, don&#x27;t expect it to whiten your teeth as much as the dramatization in the commercials.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t foam too much.</li>
            <li>I drink a lot of coffee, so my teeth are often very yellow-ish.</li>
            <li>It really does make teeth whiter.  </li>
            <li>and it really helps to get your teeth whiter.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for anyone wanting whiter teeth!</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference when i used this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>i went thru 2 whole tubes before i switched to another brand</li>
            <li>I mean this in a GOOD way, of course.  </li>
            <li>the whiteness that it claims it gives your teeth: Not exactly convinced about that once but still love Crest.</li>
            <li>I see a sparkling white \\&quot;dental office\\&quot; smile!</li>
            <li>Her teeth are already very white and clean, so the whitening effect was not noticeable on her.</li>
            <li>brushing up and down, vs. side-to-side or a circular motion, gave me better results faster.</li>
            <li>this has is the stuff in any decent toothpaste - flouride to remineralize teeth, sand to scrape away plaque, flavor, etc.</li>
            <li>Next, this stuff really does brighten your smile.</li>
            <li>My very first impression was - hey, I&#x27;m brushing my teeth with a weak-ass mojito, except there&#x27;s no white rum in it</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.</li>
            <li>highly, highly recommend this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>My husband loves crest, I on the other hand love all natural like Spry, I went ahead and tried this</li>
            <li>Really, if I never set foot into a Walmart or Target, I think I will be fine.</li>
            <li>I am extremely satisfied with the price, as it comes with 4 tubes that will last me a very long time.</li>
            <li>, I bought this thinking, it&#x27;s so affordable, and I need a new toothpaste anyhow -</li>
            <li>and now when I look at photos with my new baby</li>
            <li>It seems like just a regular Crest at a higher price.</li>
            <li>But, another paper found on PubMed shows that Crest Pro-Health is better than Colgate Total for folks with sensitive teeth (due to exposed dentin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a busy new Mom</li>
            <li>I have tried pretty much every whitening toothpaste out there from various brands and this is the first and only one where I could actually tell that it worked and worked well.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re starting with very yellow teeth, then I highly recommend going with Crest&#x27;s whitening strips first.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste works very well to keep my teeth white.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Crest whitening strips before, but had to stop half-way through the treatment because my teeth got way too sensitive.</li>
            <li>Cleans very well and leaves a lasting freshness.  </li>
            <li>After a few days  my mouth felt like it had been burnt and the inner membrane of my top lip is red, swollen and filled with  tiny white ulcers.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll stick with Crest 3D White Vivid toothpaste!</li>
            <li>To me all toothpaste seems the same, but I have been using this for a few weeks and my girlfriend already noted that my teeth look more white.</li>
            <li>Definitely seem to be working its magic slowly.</li>
            <li>There seems to be a plateau as far as how white it can get your teeth.  </li>
            <li>On the other hand, we did not see much of a difference on my wifes teeth.</li>
            <li>and I was horrified in the past several years to see my dull smile, more yellow towards the back teeth, in photos.  </li>
            <li>FINALLY doesn&#x27;t smell like the cat-box, and then, 10-20 minutes later, you&#x27;re killing plants by just exhaling near them....</li>
            <li>The only thing that made me give it 4 stars is that I don&#x27;t really see the difference with some of the other brands that I sometimes use -</li>
            <li>I also have naturally grayish and yellowish hues to my teeth, so there are only a few products that really work for me.  </li>
            <li>This is a little TOO much, perhaps.</li>

            <li> If you can use it with the additional Crest 3D White products for even better results!</li>
            <li> Plackers Gentle Fine Dental Flossers - 90]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious if I&#x27;m the only one who&#x27;s noticed the awesome breath-freshening aspects of this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> i was just hoping to get a movie star smile.</li>
            <li> Not only is the flavor intensely refreshing, it keeps your breath fresh for a good long while after you&#x27;ve rinsed your mouth.  </li>
            <li> It works really well and makes my mouth feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use, I can easily get to the last of the tube.</li>
            <li> after a good brushing and using other assorted tools to remove the offensive sight, I realized that they were coffee stains.  </li>
            <li> , right?</li>
            <li> I admit I was one of those people who watched the commercials on TV and thought, &#x27;Yeah, right...&#x27;</li>
            <li> So these came in the 4 pack, shipped right away,</li>
            <li> it makes my mouth feel really minty and clean</li>
            <li> The minty taste is pleasant but not too strong, the paste lathers into a thick foam that makes it easier to brush (I use an electric brush), and I did notice some whitening during the first week of use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It isn&#x27;t going to make them magically bright, but it will lighten them a few shades and give your smile a noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li> Try it first @</li>
            <li> /&gt;Colgate Total is proven to work better at preventing tartar buildup and cavities than Crest Pro-Health per PubMed article 21269038.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave any filmy residue in your mouth and really whitens smile.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty pricey tho.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper per tube than in the drugstores (unless it happens to be on sale somewhere else)!    </li>
            <li> We honestly couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between his other crest toothpaste and my Spry toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Not cheap, but truly different in a very good way.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t like Crest products, but this toothpaste is really good.</li>
            <li> But the whitening wasn&#x27;t strong enough.</li>
            <li> (it was $12 for 4 large tubes).</li>
            <li> The flavor is not so intense as to be unpleasant, it tastes good, and when you start brushing, it does work up a nice bit of foam.  </li>
            <li> but there are better solutions to whiten your teeth, to me this should be used to keep your teeth white if you had them professionally whitened!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gel-like with little beads and it polishes teeth nicely.  </li>
            <li> It does clean the surface stains, my teeth are pretty white</li>
            <li> As someone who lives at starbucks, really gets a lot of the stains off my teeth whether they are stuck on or just the day to day stuff.</li>
            <li> When you buy this, don&#x27;t expect it to whiten your teeth as much as the dramatization in the commercials.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t foam too much.</li>
            <li> I drink a lot of coffee, so my teeth are often very yellow-ish.</li>
            <li> It really does make teeth whiter.  </li>
            <li> and it really helps to get your teeth whiter.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for anyone wanting whiter teeth!</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference when i used this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> i went thru 2 whole tubes before i switched to another brand</li>
            <li> I mean this in a GOOD way, of course.  </li>
            <li> the whiteness that it claims it gives your teeth: Not exactly convinced about that once but still love Crest.</li>
            <li> I see a sparkling white \\&quot;dental office\\&quot; smile!</li>
            <li> Her teeth are already very white and clean, so the whitening effect was not noticeable on her.</li>
            <li> brushing up and down, vs. side-to-side or a circular motion, gave me better results faster.</li>
            <li> this has is the stuff in any decent toothpaste - flouride to remineralize teeth, sand to scrape away plaque, flavor, etc.</li>
            <li> Next, this stuff really does brighten your smile.</li>
            <li> My very first impression was - hey, I&#x27;m brushing my teeth with a weak-ass mojito, except there&#x27;s no white rum in it</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.</li>
            <li> highly, highly recommend this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> My husband loves crest, I on the other hand love all natural like Spry, I went ahead and tried this</li>
            <li> Really, if I never set foot into a Walmart or Target, I think I will be fine.</li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied with the price, as it comes with 4 tubes that will last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> , I bought this thinking, it&#x27;s so affordable, and I need a new toothpaste anyhow -</li>
            <li> and now when I look at photos with my new baby</li>
            <li> It seems like just a regular Crest at a higher price.</li>
            <li> But, another paper found on PubMed shows that Crest Pro-Health is better than Colgate Total for folks with sensitive teeth (due to exposed dentin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a busy new Mom</li>
            <li> I have tried pretty much every whitening toothpaste out there from various brands and this is the first and only one where I could actually tell that it worked and worked well.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re starting with very yellow teeth, then I highly recommend going with Crest&#x27;s whitening strips first.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste works very well to keep my teeth white.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Crest whitening strips before, but had to stop half-way through the treatment because my teeth got way too sensitive.</li>
            <li> Cleans very well and leaves a lasting freshness.  </li>
            <li> After a few days  my mouth felt like it had been burnt and the inner membrane of my top lip is red, swollen and filled with  tiny white ulcers.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll stick with Crest 3D White Vivid toothpaste!</li>
            <li> To me all toothpaste seems the same, but I have been using this for a few weeks and my girlfriend already noted that my teeth look more white.</li>
            <li> Definitely seem to be working its magic slowly.</li>
            <li> There seems to be a plateau as far as how white it can get your teeth.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, we did not see much of a difference on my wifes teeth.</li>
            <li> and I was horrified in the past several years to see my dull smile, more yellow towards the back teeth, in photos.  </li>
            <li> FINALLY doesn&#x27;t smell like the cat-box, and then, 10-20 minutes later, you&#x27;re killing plants by just exhaling near them....</li>
            <li> The only thing that made me give it 4 stars is that I don&#x27;t really see the difference with some of the other brands that I sometimes use -</li>
            <li> I also have naturally grayish and yellowish hues to my teeth, so there are only a few products that really work for me.  </li>
            <li> This is a little TOO much, perhaps.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this toothpaste if you have bad color stains and want to clean your teeth or if you just want to maintain the whiteness you already have, then it would be useful for that too.</li>
            <li> The only downfall and this is very minimal, is that it does seem to make my mouth a little dry right after use, as well as my lips.</li>
            <li> First let me say, that ever since I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste (little less then a week)</li>
            <li> Definitely notice a cleaner mouth than with other products, plus way cheaper than having to buy white strips every month.  </li>
            <li> AM USING THE RADIANT WHITE, BUT HAVE NOT EXPERIENCE THAT ONE OF HE OTHER REVIEWERS SIFFERED (\\&quot;FROM WHITE TO RED\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cannot find this locally and certainly not at the price I get here.</li>
            <li> , then I went back about a week and a half later</li>
            <li> no sugar, but instead - a lot of bleach, I mean a LOT, and way too much of a mint flavor.</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;3D\\&quot; toothpaste seems to be long on marketing and short on active ingredients or results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had no idea my teeth could actually look like this and for such little $.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought, well, I just don&#x27;t have the money to get a fancy dental office treatment for whitening, and I had tried several white strips packs - which either didn&#x27;t work, were too expense, messy, hurt my teeth or gums...</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it promises to do, it cleans my teeth, fights bad breath, and it has made a clear improvement in the brightness of my teeth in a relatively short amount of time.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product in December, and have not really seen any benefit.  </li>
            <li> Usually with regular toothpaste within a few hours I can feel plaque starting to build up.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t taste any whitening ingredients or aftertaste as with some of the other whitening toothpastes.</li>
            <li> other retailers (WM, WD, PBLX, etc.)</li>
            <li> Going back to my usual Crest with baking soda and calling my dentist for a whitening treatment.</li>
            <li> I drink 2-3 cups of coffee on average and have never had stains with any of the other Crest toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> It causes a bit of that peeling of the inner skin on the lip (At least for me.</li>

            <li> (that he secretly enjoys smelling, otherwise he wouldn&#x27;t take a second sniff).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter</li>

            <li> I have tried quite a few, have never done anything noticeable for</li>
            <li> I use it everyday to keep my teeth polished and remove any surface stain build-up.  </li>
            <li> A few days ago I noticed something brown between a few of my teeth,</li>
            <li> THAT WAS NO EASY TASK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not experience the small beads that people complain about.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a &amp;#34;Crest Kid&amp;#34; and usually use the ones containing baking soda.  </li>
            <li> Unlike some whitening solutions, this does not taste terrible, so that is a big positive.</li>
            <li> I use this toothpaste at least twice a day, and I can tell that my teeth are getting whiter.</li>
            <li> Seriously though, this works.</li>
            <li> we&#x27;re so freaking obsessed with that, aren&#x27;t we?</li>
            <li> The comparison to garlic is a bit lame, I&#x27;ll admit, but that&#x27;s what it reminds me of.</li>
            <li> Probably too expensive to buy in stores, but in bulk via Amazon will buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying, that it&#x27;s a bad product.</li>
            <li> (too bad),</li>
            <li> FYI - I watched my friend brush her teeth today and noticed how bad she is at it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My wife and I used this toothpaste and we were pleased with it. We noticed my teeth were getting whiter after a week of using it, and my teeth were a good amount whiter by the time we ran out. On the other hand, we did not see much of a difference on my wifes teeth. Her teeth are already very white and clean, so the whitening effect was not noticeable on her. I would definitely recommend this toothpaste if you have bad color stains and want to clean your teeth or if you just want to maintain the whiteness you already have, then it would be useful for that too.</li>
            <li> With everyday use - multiple times a day of course, this toothpaste really does whiten your teeth. I am a smoker and I can definitely tell a difference 100%. The mint taste is great and my mouth feels very clean and fresh after use. You don&#x27;t taste any whitening ingredients or aftertaste as with some of the other whitening toothpastes. I have tried pretty much every whitening toothpaste out there from various brands and this is the first and only one where I could actually tell that it worked and worked well. The only downfall and this is very minimal, is that it does seem to make my mouth a little dry right after use, as well as my lips. I use lip balm or gloss constantly anyway though, so it isn&#x27;t a problem. Just thought I&#x27;d mention it though. I definitely recommend this toothpaste and Amazon has the best price to buy in bulk!</li>
            <li> Just purchased the product...has a nice taste, leaves my mouth feeling fresh, will give it more tme and update review</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you, if I&#x27;m fully satisfied with this toothpaste. Whitening... we&#x27;re so freaking obsessed with that, aren&#x27;t we? White teeth at all cost, right? Not for me, though. I&#x27;m not saying, that it&#x27;s a bad product. All I&#x27;m saying is, it&#x27;s not for everyone. My very first impression was - hey, I&#x27;m brushing my teeth with a weak-ass mojito, except there&#x27;s no white rum in it (too bad), no sugar, but instead - a lot of bleach, I mean a LOT, and way too much of a mint flavor. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll stick with Crest 3D White Vivid toothpaste! Aftertaste&#x27;s horrible, and it lasts, like forever. I&#x27;m getting back to Aquafresh! Again, it is NOT a bad product. Try it first @ other retailers (WM, WD, PBLX, etc.), before you buy it.</li>
            <li> Definitely notice a cleaner mouth than with other products, plus way cheaper than having to buy white strips every month.  As someone who lives at starbucks, really gets a lot of the stains off my teeth whether they are stuck on or just the day to day stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about a week and I&#x27;m starting to see the difference! I usually don&#x27;t like Crest, but this is awesome! I had gone for my cavity filings and not started using this yet, then I went back about a week and a half later and my dentist even noticed they were whiter! She said \\&quot;Good job!! you&#x27;ve been taking of your oral hygiene\\&quot; Thanks to Crest 3D :) (: I can&#x27;t imagine what my teeth will look like in a month from now! White white white! I love this toothpaste!</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;3D\\&quot; toothpaste seems to be long on marketing and short on active ingredients or results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colgate Total is proven to work better at preventing tartar buildup and cavities than Crest Pro-Health per PubMed article 21269038. But, another paper found on PubMed shows that Crest Pro-Health is better than Colgate Total for folks with sensitive teeth (due to exposed dentin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All this has is the stuff in any decent toothpaste - flouride to remineralize teeth, sand to scrape away plaque, flavor, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m at the two week mark, and I can say I definitely see whiter teeth now.&lt;br /&gt;I knocked off one star because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It causes a bit of that peeling of the inner skin on the lip (At least for me. Brushing the lips with water after rinsing helped this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) It doesn&#x27;t lather as much as most toothpastes I&#x27;ve used. If you&#x27;re used to a lot of lather when brushing, this may take some getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) 80% in 14 days seems like an exaggeration. Who knows how to measure 80% for each individual anyway?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I&#x27;m satisfied with the results so far, and will be happy to continue using this product.&lt;br /&gt;Small tip: brushing up and down, vs. side-to-side or a circular motion, gave me better results faster.</li>
            <li> You can tell the difference after using it for two weeks.  There seems to be a plateau as far as how white it can get your teeth.  Definitely helps maintain white teeth and doesn&#x27;t feel too abrasive.</li>
            <li> I admit I was one of those people who watched the commercials on TV and thought, &#x27;Yeah, right...&#x27; but after awhile I decided to give it a try.  Crest is a good name in dental hygiene so I thought why not try a tube after the stuff I was currently using is finished.  What a fantastic surprise this stuff is!  Not only is the flavor intensely refreshing, it keeps your breath fresh for a good long while after you&#x27;ve rinsed your mouth.  The flavor is not so intense as to be unpleasant, it tastes good, and when you start brushing, it does work up a nice bit of foam.  Now, in an effort at full disclosure, I&#x27;m one of those women who believes a good head of lather means my hair is getting really clean, and that a good bit of foam from my toothpaste means that my teeth and gums are getting good and clean.  There is something about this toothpaste when it foams up that invigorates your mouth and it helps to make your gums tingly in the most pleasant way.  My teeth are slick and feel clean under my tongue as I make sure I&#x27;ve gotten everything and that nice pop of breath freshening mint is really wonderful.  I am really delighted that I chose to give this product a try.  It does exactly what it promises to do, it cleans my teeth, fights bad breath, and it has made a clear improvement in the brightness of my teeth in a relatively short amount of time.  I give this two thumbs up and a zigzag snap!</li>
            <li> When you buy this, don&#x27;t expect it to whiten your teeth as much as the dramatization in the commercials. I used to drink a lot of coffee and when I stopped I started using Crest White. I did notice a significant difference....but it took 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, pretty good whitener but there are better solutions to whiten your teeth, to me this should be used to keep your teeth white if you had them professionally whitened!</li>
            <li> I really love this toothpaste; it&#x27;s effective, but doesn&#x27;t sting. It leaves you minty-fresh, but not overly so. It also doesn&#x27;t foam too much. I feel great, and know that its fluoride and anti-cavity properties keep me protected, clean, and healthy!&lt;br /&gt;Use with dental picks like: [[ASIN:B001DVY632 Plackers Gentle Fine Dental Flossers - 90]] or if you&#x27;re a die-hard Crest fan: [[ASIN:B004RSV8TI Crest Glide Floss Picks-30 count (Pack of 6)]]&lt;br /&gt;Also use with a reliable mouthwash like: [[ASIN:B00013TQPQ Listerine Antiseptic Mouthwash, Cool Mint, 1.5 Liters]] or if you&#x27;re a die-hard Crest fan/hate having alcohol in your mouthwash: [[ASIN:B004NMZR9A Crest Pro Health Invigorating Clean Mint Rinse, 16.9-Fluid Ounce (Pack of 2)]]&lt;br /&gt;Cheers! Let&#x27;s see that smile! :-D</li>
            <li> Well, I thought my teeth were white until one day....anyway, I have been using this for about two months and it does work!  Are my teeth as white as the Hollywood Stars teeth? no, but they are about two shades whiter.  I love the way my breath smells and mouth feels after brushing.  It leaves a tingly feeling of \\&quot;Calgone take me away..\\&quot;  Wait, this is not Calgone.  Seriously though, this works. I did not experience the small beads that people complain about.  Rinse your mouth properly and all beads and suds will be history.  Buy this if you think your teeth looks like butter--it works.</li>
            <li> Ok, so everyone else is talking about the whitening effects of the toothpaste. Read those posts for that. But I wanted to chime in and say that this toothpaste makes you&#x27;re mouth feel like you&#x27;ve been sucking on mints 24/7.  I mean this in a GOOD way, of course.  Everyone loves minty breath, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know the drill with most toothpastes. You brush your teeth. They feel great and you&#x27;re mouth FINALLY doesn&#x27;t smell like the cat-box, and then, 10-20 minutes later, you&#x27;re killing plants by just exhaling near them.... you&#x27;re friends all take a step away from you when you&#x27;re talking, and you&#x27;re cat gives you the nasty-face (that he secretly enjoys smelling, otherwise he wouldn&#x27;t take a second sniff).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Crest 3D toothpaste.  Exit caca-mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know when you eat garlic bread that was bathed in garlic how that garlic taste stays on your tongue for hours?  The oils or something coat your mouth and no amount of toothpaste, mouthwash, or sandblasting can get rid of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, that&#x27;s how it is with this toothpaste.  This enjoyable flavor stays in your mouth for hours--really!  The comparison to garlic is a bit lame, I&#x27;ll admit, but that&#x27;s what it reminds me of. You can \\&quot;feel\\&quot; the garlic in your mouth for hours--BAD!  Likewise, you can \\&quot;feel\\&quot; the minty-goodness in your mouth hours after brushing--GOOD!ging me to kiss them.  Dang! This is incredible. This is a little TOO much, perhaps. Maybe I should go back to Aquafresh and just keep my cat happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SERIOUSLY, try it. I&#x27;m curious if I&#x27;m the only one who&#x27;s noticed the awesome breath-freshening aspects of this toothpaste. Comments?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please do yourself, your family, neighbors and the rest of the world a huge favor and get this toothpaste. I&#x27;m sure it would be beneficial to our environment as well.</li>
            <li> My husband loves crest, I on the other hand love all natural like Spry, I went ahead and tried this, we are on the third tube and neither of us notice a difference. We honestly couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between his other crest toothpaste and my Spry toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Excelent product and great results, it whitens as promised, I am very happy, after using the product I decide to buy the rest of whitening products.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste works very well to keep my teeth white. I&#x27;ve used Crest whitening strips before, but had to stop half-way through the treatment because my teeth got way too sensitive. Now I used only Crest whitening toothpaste and I find that I can keep my teeth quite white.  If you&#x27;re starting with very yellow teeth, then I highly recommend going with Crest&#x27;s whitening strips first. After that, you can use Crest&#x27;s toothpaste to maintain the whiteness.</li>
            <li> I am really impressed with this toothpaste. It works really well and makes my mouth feel clean and fresh. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this after reading the not so good reviews, but i have no issues with this toothpaste. Definitely seem to be working its magic slowly. I use Crest advantage+Scope also apart from this, sometimes together or sometimes later. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I drink a lot of coffee, so my teeth are often very yellow-ish. I use this toothpaste at least twice a day, and I can tell that my teeth are getting whiter. They will be dazzling for prom next month! I am extremely satisfied with the price, as it comes with 4 tubes that will last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> I prefer this toothpaste to the \\&quot;advanced\\&quot; systems that have two different tubes inside them. This is easy to use, I can easily get to the last of the tube. This toothpaste keeps my teeth white so I don&#x27;t need to use the Crest Whitestrips as often.&lt;br /&gt;Reliable delivery - worth the multibuy!</li>
            <li> I used this toothpaste, Mint Fresh flavour with great results.  It really does make teeth whiter.  But, and its a big but, I then used Radiant Mint flavour, which is very strong tasting.  After a few days  my mouth felt like it had been burnt and the inner membrane of my top lip is red, swollen and filled with  tiny white ulcers.  I had to stop using it. So beware, any soreness and stop using it. It is not sold in the UK,  now I know why.</li>
            <li> To me all toothpaste seems the same, but I have been using this for a few weeks and my girlfriend already noted that my teeth look more white. Guess it works. Probably too expensive to buy in stores, but in bulk via Amazon will buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste. Not too strong flavored and it really helps to get your teeth whiter. If you can use it with the additional Crest 3D White products for even better results!</li>
            <li> I bought this product in December, and have not really seen any benefit.  It seems like just a regular Crest at a higher price.</li>
            <li> I like the texture, flavor, and packaging of the toothpaste itself, but for the whitening aspect itself, it didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  I also have naturally grayish and yellowish hues to my teeth, so there are only a few products that really work for me.  But the whitening wasn&#x27;t strong enough.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels fresh and clean when using this toothpaste.  I was very pleased to find this offered by Amazon on subscribe &amp; save.  I cannot find this locally and certainly not at the price I get here.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for over a month now and LOVE it!I got my husband hooked on the stuff too.Finally a product that is affordable and delivers.Totally recommend this .</li>
            <li> This toothpaste has been our favorite for about a year now.  Cleans very well and leaves a lasting freshness.  Doesn&#x27;t leave any filmy residue in your mouth and really whitens smile.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t like Crest products, but this toothpaste is really good. The minty taste is pleasant but not too strong, the paste lathers into a thick foam that makes it easier to brush (I use an electric brush), and I did notice some whitening during the first week of use. However, the whitening effect hasn&#x27;t continued, my teeth are still the same shade that they were after one week of use, so don&#x27;t expect a whitening miracle. Still, it is a good toothpaste and you can&#x27;t beat this price (it was $12 for 4 large tubes).</li>
            <li> This toothpaste worked great - i definitely had noticable results within two weeks, even using it alone. I highly recommend for anyone wanting whiter teeth!</li>
            <li> Having only used this toothpaste for a couple of days, I don&#x27;t know whether it will make my teeth 3D white. But, whether it does or not, I don&#x27;t care as this toothpaste has the most wonderful mouthwash-like taste of any toothpaste I have tried.  I look forward to brushing my teeth just to get the feeling of odor-free breath.</li>
            <li> Love ordering my household item stuff from Amazon. Really, if I never set foot into a Walmart or Target, I think I will be fine. :)) So these came in the 4 pack, shipped right away, packaged fine and they are the finest toothpaste. I love Crest, I&#x27;ve used it for years now. Can&#x27;t imagine switching. The only thing that made me give it 4 stars is that I don&#x27;t really see the difference with some of the other brands that I sometimes use - the whiteness that it claims it gives your teeth: Not exactly convinced about that once but still love Crest.</li>
            <li> THIS TOOTHPASTE, WHICH I PURCHASED AT AMAZON.COM, TOOK MY TEETH FROM \\&quot;UNSHOWABLE\\&quot; TO \\&quot;SMILEABLE.\\&quot;  THAT WAS NO EASY TASK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I AM USING THE RADIANT WHITE, BUT HAVE NOT EXPERIENCE THAT ONE OF HE OTHER REVIEWERS SIFFERED (\\&quot;FROM WHITE TO RED\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS TOOTHPASTE DELIVERED ON ITS PROMISE.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I like the clean mint flavor crest makes (also in crest pro health), and I like it. Brush your teeth routinely for a couple weeks and you&#x27;ll notice it.     FYI - I watched my friend brush her teeth today and noticed how bad she is at it. You&#x27;ll notice it in a couple weeks if you put some elbow grease into it!!</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference when i used this toothpaste. my teeth aren&#x27;t THAT yellow to begin with, so maybe that is the issue. i was just hoping to get a movie star smile. i went thru 2 whole tubes before i switched to another brand so it&#x27;s not from being impatient. it&#x27;s a great toothpaste in all other respects tho. it makes my mouth feel really minty and clean and it doesn&#x27;t scratch up my gums. it&#x27;s pretty pricey tho.</li>
            <li> I am a busy new Mom and I was horrified in the past several years to see my dull smile, more yellow towards the back teeth, in photos.  I thought, well, I just don&#x27;t have the money to get a fancy dental office treatment for whitening, and I had tried several white strips packs - which either didn&#x27;t work, were too expense, messy, hurt my teeth or gums...Whitening toothpastes, and I have tried quite a few, have never done anything noticeable for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a tea drinker, though I also drink a lot of water, and truth be told I haven&#x27;t been going to the dentist as religiously as I should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I bought this thinking, it&#x27;s so affordable, and I need a new toothpaste anyhow - and now when I look at photos with my new baby I see a sparkling white \\&quot;dental office\\&quot; smile! I had no idea my teeth could actually look like this and for such little $.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly, highly recommend this toothpaste.  It tastes nice, is a good sized container, is effective in whitening, leaves my teeth feeling fresh until the next meal.  Amazon has a great price too!</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste!! First let me say, that ever since I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste (little less then a week) no plaque has been on my teeth. Usually with regular toothpaste within a few hours I can feel plaque starting to build up. But my teeth feel clean even after waking up! Next, this stuff really does brighten your smile. I always notice how shiny my teeth look..I can see they are gradually getting whiter too. I&#x27;m still waiting for my whitening strips that I ordered from Amazon to get here, so I&#x27;m looking to see how the results will be combined. Definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Advance White Toothpaste for about a year, I just recently switched to the 3D White. I don&#x27;t see a difference in how white this keeps my teeth versus the Advance White. So, this is great since it is cheaper and it has more toothpaste in the tube. It does clean the surface stains, my teeth are pretty white and I drink black tea everyday.</li>
            <li> works great. its a toothe paste. w h a t m o r e c a n you say? ya.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste.  I use it everyday to keep my teeth polished and remove any surface stain build-up.  This toothpaste works great! The texture is lovely. It&#x27;s gel-like with little beads and it polishes teeth nicely.  After I brush I notice my teeth look amazing and shiny. This doesn&#x27;t perform miracles, but it does help surface stains.  Also, you cannot beat this price on Amazon! Much cheaper per tube than in the drugstores (unless it happens to be on sale somewhere else)!    I recommend trying. This is the only toothpaste that has done anything to the physical appearance of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Keeps mouth  feeling cool and refreshed!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a &amp;#34;Crest Kid&amp;#34; and usually use the ones containing baking soda.  About a month ago I decided to give this a try.  I use it daily, along with flossing and mouthwash.  A few days ago I noticed something brown between a few of my teeth, after a good brushing and using other assorted tools to remove the offensive sight, I realized that they were coffee stains.  Aggghhhh!!!!  I drink 2-3 cups of coffee on average and have never had stains with any of the other Crest toothpastes.  I thought this one supposed to whiten my teeth, not turn them brown.  I guess it doesn&#x27;t work on all stains.  Going back to my usual Crest with baking soda and calling my dentist for a whitening treatment.</li>
            <li> Going on 7 weeks since switching to this toothpaste, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in my teeth color. No comments from anyone else, including the dentist. I&#x27;m only giving this thing 2 stars because the flavor is nice and my teeth feel clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> perfect product and service.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think toothpaste could be different, but everyone that has tried it loves it.  Not cheap, but truly different in a very good way.</li>
            <li> Always buy my toothpaste from Amazon, buying in bulk is better and they always deliver on time with no problem. I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> great taste. cleans teeth well. makes teeth feel clean. works well with an electric toothbrush. makes the whole mouth feel better.</li>
            <li> This does a great job at whitening your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t going to make them magically bright, but it will lighten them a few shades and give your smile a noticeable difference.  Unlike some whitening solutions, this does not taste terrible, so that is a big positive. I am a big fan of this</li>
