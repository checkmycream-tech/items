            <li>the change on my skin is really remarkable.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I decided to trust and treat myself with this delicious cream.</li>
            <li>I find the menthol quite pleasant and it tingles and dissipates within 30 minutes or so.</li>
            <li>I think it has a pleasant smell with it also.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant, non-offensive smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, makes the skin soft…</li>
            <li>This cellulite cream is so creamy and feels so good when you put it on your skin.  </li>
            <li>This cream is as good as advertised.  </li>
            <li>But for now all is good.</li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>I received this great product at reduced price in exchange on my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>- I knew I would since it&#x27;s already worked great for my girlfriend, but it&#x27;s nice to see it work on me, too.</li>
            <li>You can understand that people, who can have anything in the world, can not get rid of this orange peel for good.</li>
            <li>It seems to be a good formula and even after just a couple days skin seems to be smoothing out.</li>
            <li>Used the bottle up in like 2 1/2 weeks, hope that gives you a good time frame.</li>
            <li>One of my really good friends had success with Purressant,  I just couldn&#x27;t find one that worked for me, but this cream is awesome!  </li>

            <li>Plus the price is very ok.</li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with the results of this cream.</li>
            <li>She is extremely satisfied with the results of the cream and seeing her happy is all I could ask for.</li>
            <li>Also the price is just right for the quality you get, and I have already recommended this cream to all my best friends</li>
            <li>It is a very effective cream that works to decrease fat deposits and water retention on the affected area which for me was mostly the area around my thighs and buttocks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I LOVE that!</li>
            <li>I am in love with this lotion!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering more of this product!</li>
            <li>I have seen some improvement, but people who think this is the magic cure - wake up!</li>
            <li>Well I am SO glad I did!</li>
            <li>I ordered some more for myself and also decided to get some for my sister, mother in law, and sister in law as gifts!</li>
            <li>I love this cream!</li>
            <li>wife is definitely satisfied and I&#x27;m grateful she got it!</li>

            <li>I can honestly say I love this product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;~ Is it best for a certain skin type?</li>
            <li>I had very high hopes for this product,  all reviews taken into consideration &amp; an Amazon best seller!</li>
            <li>I have seen amazing results from using this product.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Thank you for an amazing product.</li>
            <li>This product is absolutely amazing..</li>
            <li>Works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>and I have this amazing company to thank for that.</li>
            <li>and I had to get some of my own.</li>
            <li>This product is absolutely the best in it&#x27;s category.</li>
            <li>It’s smells nice and absorbs without a greasy residue.  </li>
            <li>and I am loving the results.</li>
            <li>I honestly see no difference in my skin then before I started using it.</li>
            <li>It has a nice consistency and isn&#x27;t greasy.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t sticky or oily like some lotions and makes your skin feel nice too.</li>
            <li>Honestly, what did I have to lose?</li>
            <li>and I honestly tried some cream but didn&#x27;t work out.</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent too.</li>
            <li>(but don&#x27;t when you find something effective - your skin needs continuing support).</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t know what to expect</li>
            <li>Of course not all of them are effective but I found“Cellulite with Retinal &amp; Caffeine and Body Firming Cream”  effective.</li>
            <li>Really this is a best seller !!!!!!</li>
            <li>Now, I wish I would have found it right away, because the results have been so incredible.</li>
            <li>I first started using this cream off my sister who has been using it for quite some time herself, with very good results.</li>
            <li>It has a nice pleasant light scent.</li>
            <li>cream is totally worth the price and will make your body beautiful again.</li>
            <li>Feels very cool!</li>
            <li>With my cellulite gone, I&#x27;m so much more confident, and I even purchased a swim suit, and plan to go swimming this weekend!</li>
            <li>This cream is by far one of the best that I have ever tried!</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s told me how much better she feels now in her own skin.</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing result oriented cellulite cream I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>My remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
            <li>I have been very happy so far with this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The most effective elements of this product, the Organic Herbal Infusion, Organic Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera), Isopropyl Palmitate (Palm Oil), Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Caffeine, Organic Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower Oil), PAcrylates/C10-30</li>
            <li>The ideal product would be both cosmetically and long-term effective, but it&#x27;s more realistic to expect a formula to tilt towards one or the</li>
            <li>This is a unique &amp; gorgeous product.</li>
            <li>This body cream is the best I&#x27;ve found, and I&#x27;ve tried the &amp;#34;best!&amp;#34; I have found no other cream that gives me the results that I get with this one</li>
            <li>It feels good and sort of cool on your skin and absorbs quicklys</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant scent, nothing too powerful or noticeable.</li>
            <li>It has a nice and non-offensive smell and absorbs easily without greasy, sticky or oily feeling.</li>
            <li>Out of the many treatments we’ve tested, this has certainly been a great one.</li>
            <li>My cellulite in turn has become markedly reduced (on my rear  end and arms), and this impressive difference has increased my self-esteem by huge margins.  </li>
            <li>Puressant is a really nice cellulite cream for firmer and smooth skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been impressed with this product, especially for the price point!</li>
            <li>so you may need to buy more than 1 to see any results, also the bottle</li>
            <li>I love this cream.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely satisfied with this cream :)</li>
            <li>I have tried so many cellulite reducing creams that are either too oily, smelly, or just don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s been extremely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Like most women, I find cellulite to be unsightly and embarrassing.  </li>
            <li>It has a smooth feeling and adds softness to my skin!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>have lead my legs and butt to become more, well &amp;#34;dimpled&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really glad I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve paid a lot more for many of the products.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this cream.</li>
            <li>story short, this is the best cellulite cream I’ve ever used (and I’ve used well over a dozen of others).</li>
            <li>After taking a year to get back in shape and shedding 60lbs, I looked awesome</li>
            <li>I really liked the smeel and it was so smooth on my skin..</li>
            <li>My legs look more toned towards the top.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I also do a body wrap around the areas I put the cream on to keep more heat in.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product, because I’ve been using it still now</li>
            <li>So I’ll more purchase this product for my friends.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re about to the bottom of her tub of it, so we&#x27;ll be getting some more soon.</li>
            <li>It will work better.</li>
            <li>I am thankful to Puressant for providing me this cream for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>even more results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thank you! :)</li>
            <li>I got this product for FREE in a exchange of honest review</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>cellulite&#x27;s reduced significantly, and I&#x27;m buying another jar for sure!</li>
            <li>I look and feel much better after the weight loss</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll get better results</li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>I feel like it firms and smooths my skin, and my legs are looking much better nowadays.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are safe and do not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li>and it feels wonderfully refreshing, especially on a hot summer day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>: Probably okay for all.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it tested on animals?</li>
            <li>But you can make skin tighter and firmer and better conditioned so as to hide the cellulite.</li>
            <li>My stomach became more toned and I am committed by it</li>
            <li>so I personally know that this is one of the best creams for cellulite out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While I looked and felt much better, I did have an embarrassing problem of stretch marks around my shoulders, waist, and buttocks.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been beginning to see more aging in my legs</li>
            <li>and I do feel more tightening of my skin as opposed to before and the dimples I used to see seem to be lessening in size.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been much more confident and have felt much better about myself.</li>
            <li>but it made my cellulite show more than before.</li>
            <li>In a week I started noticing smoother skin and with every week it was getting better and better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found this cream in time for summer.</li>
            <li>love this product</li>
            <li>I am really satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>So if you see this in stock you better get it while you can</li>
            <li>I am pleased to say that this cream WORKS.</li>
            <li>I came to order me some after seeing a visible difference in her problem areas, mostly her thighs.</li>
            <li>Okay,</li>
            <li>and we love it.</li>
            <li>I have ever used love</li>
            <li>Was facing some post babies, over 30 cellulite  - not horrible, but noticeable and not going away with our workout and diet.</li>
            <li>I have been working out and eating right, and this cream was the perfect addition to get summer ready.</li>
            <li>Within a month I noticed a significant improvement and with continuous use I am actually able to feel comfortable in shorts again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall an excellent cream that really works.</li>
            <li>That said, I was very excited to try this product.</li>
            <li>nice cream have not noticed any significant changes yet but hopeful</li>
            <li>but this one in particular is really great in minimizing my cellulite while firming up.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a nice minty scent, and a cool soothing feeling once applied.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seem to be working pretty good.</li>
            <li>She uses it sparingly and I&#x27;ll happily get her a new jar as needed.</li>
            <li>The cellulite cream has a nice smell and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I really REALLY wanted to be able to write a good review for this, but I can not.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this effective cream!</li>
            <li>and I feel so much more comfortable in a bikini at the beach now.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it does a fantastic job of smoothing &amp; my skin</li>
            <li>Boy am I glad, my skin feels smooth and the imperfections have diminished.</li>
            <li>I sure hope it’s available soon.</li>
            <li>that’s nice for the skin like shea butter, allantoin, aloe and oils that it’d be worth using even if it didn’t help your cellulite.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have now got my own supply as I have seen very positive results on myself.</li>
            <li>Was excited to know that there is a possibility to be able to rid my body of any cellulite.</li>
            <li>I like the scent of the cream and how easily it glides on my skin and is gradually making a difference.</li>
            <li>but like I said you could easily see the difference.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple, effective, and incredibly fairly priced.</li>
            <li>the best part was that it has a nice scent to it which made it very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Within a week my skin was smoother, firmer and healthier with definitely gained it&#x27;s elasticity back.  </li>
            <li>Works exactly as intended and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results, my wife&#x27;s mood dramatically improved and her skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li>I have to say I am quite surprised with how amazing of a job this has done on helping remove them!</li>
            <li>and I eat very healthy and stay very hydrated</li>
            <li>If there would be a true magic cream for cellulite removal</li>
            <li>Perhaps one of the most effective creams I’ve ever seen in action, that’s what you get with this cellulite treatment lotion.</li>
            <li>Overall, I have been really happy.</li>
            <li>and she says it feels fantastic.</li>
            <li>I only use once a day with great results.</li>
            <li>it being so smooth.</li>
            <li>I really love this product and feel that it was well worth the money.</li>
            <li>So I was really happy, that after just a short time using this cream, I can see a visible reduction in cellulite.  </li>
            <li>I think this cream is awesome and have already restocked a few times.</li>
            <li>&amp; i just got it for free.</li>
            <li>Great that it is made in the US, and that there is a money back guarantee!</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or sticky residue.</li>
            <li>After a while it actually feels nice and refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review and opinion.</li>
            <li>Smooth, like a light moisture lotion.</li>
            <li>Cream is light yellow.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review.</li>
            <li>found things I could now feel comfortable wearing again.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m surprised that it is supposedly the most popular cellulite cream on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about 3 weeks now on the back of my thighs and already see a huge difference!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, most cellulite creams don&#x27;t carry the most important ingredients in high levels, Retinol and Caffeine.</li>
            <li>After a couple of week&#x27;s use, even without exercise and consistent use,  I noticed a HUGE difference!</li>
            <li>My cellulite has diminished by more than 90%  since the first time I&#x27;ve used this, which was three months ago.  </li>
            <li>I fell in love with this cream within the first week of use.</li>
            <li>I am still exercising and watching my diet, but I am hoping that I will be able to get rid of all of them after I finish the first bottle.</li>
            <li>and I can see significant changes to my skin&#x27;s elasticity.</li>
            <li>I found it to be light and no bad smell.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought that it had to be a search engine mistake, but as I read on, many people said that this product worked for stretch marks as well.  </li>
            <li>In fact, this is the best anti cellulite product that has really helped my skin to look tight and smooth and thanks to it, I feel much more confident.</li>
            <li>Beyond working incredibly, the price point is so much cheaper than most other cellulite reducing creams.&lt;br /&gt;Long</li>
            <li>I can’t wait to see what other positive results that I’ll get from this wonderful product!</li>
            <li>The product works better than described, the price is unbelievably cheap, and works within no time.&lt;br /&gt;10/10 highly recommended to all!</li>
            <li>/&gt;You really do see a huge difference faster, than what most creams would do.</li>
            <li>I eat exceptionally well, work out consistently and lead a healthy life style in general</li>
            <li>Smooth, almost powdery, moisturized, no unpleasant film.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cream itself is very light and rubs into the skin very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks Puressant for making such a good product!</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a lotion like this, you have found the right one!</li>
            <li>Super excited.</li>
            <li>I wish I had this product right after having my son, it’ll most certainly be included in any baby shower gifts I give!</li>
            <li>But in addition, there is greater blood flow, and my skin is so much softer.</li>
            <li>My skin looks so much healthier and more</li>
            <li>was&#x27;nt completely full.</li>
            <li>After one full jar used on one leg</li>
            <li>It really works to tighten my skins, making a more firmer appearance and therefore reduces the cellulite.</li>
            <li>I really like that this is fragrance free!</li>
            <li>I seen a big difference I use after my morning shower and after a good work out at night  seen lots of improvement in midsection abdomen  </li>
            <li>The product smells clean and feels fresh.</li>
            <li>I was looking to reduce cellulite on some parts of my body, and this cream did it quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li>I recently bought this product for my wife and I could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li>Over the years I have purchased and tried several different cellulite creams on Amazon and have found this one of the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and my legs feel smoother since I started using it.</li>
            <li>Luckily, this cream knows what it&#x27;s doing.</li>

            <li>First off I like how light-weight and scent free</li>
            <li>And, I was very interested in the reviews.</li>
            <li>Nice product with attendant skin softening and vibrant looking.</li>
            <li>and I am pregnant and its definitely reduced my cellulite like magic!</li>
            <li>I found it very pleasant to use and will continue to use and report back further results.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li>&amp; i noticed a significant reduction in cellulite after my first week of using the product.</li>
            <li>It really works !!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had anything work this quickly and with such amazing results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve seen results and will order more as I continue to loose weight.</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s had some really great results after a few weeks.</li>
            <li>I am so happy some have found a great product here, however, after 3 weeks of continued use, sadly I tossed nearly 3/4 a jar out.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a few weeks now, and I&#x27;ve noticed some great results.</li>
            <li>She was always self conscious about doing things that would show off her legs, like wearing shorts or going to the beach, but now she&#x27;s a proud short wearing beach goer like the rest of us!</li>
            <li>It is a natural thing that happens in most women and some men.</li>
            <li>My sister mentioned she had success with this product and thought I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is worth the five stars</li>
            <li>Definitely worth giving this cellulite cream a try.</li>
            <li>So far this one works a bit better.</li>
            <li>It leaves skin nice and soft.&lt;br /&gt;~ Potential long-term effectiveness:</li>
            <li>It was kind of a reward to myself for loosing over 50 pounds in the last year.</li>
            <li>I hope to get to completely solve my problem, and it&#x27;s sure I will not stop using this product.</li>
            <li>-- no one will know your secret to perfect legs!</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping, got mine in TWO DAYS with Prime!</li>
            <li>Nope, &amp;#34;everyone&amp;#34; is right.</li>
            <li>I find myself using it right after a shower, and massaging it well into my skin.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>The cream does not work right away -- you have to use it routinely.</li>
            <li>I lost most of my baby weight quickly, but my skin just wasn&#x27;t quite the same.  </li>
            <li>I also forgot to mention that I have very sensitive skin and react badly to many things I try, and this works very well for me.  </li>
            <li>The product is smooth and worked very fast on her skin, mainly her legs (about 5 weeks -</li>
            <li>The cream takes some time, but according to my girlfriend the use of a cream is completely worth the delay between the first application and results.</li>
            <li>I, like most other women across America, have experienced an increasing amount of cellulite as I&#x27;ve aged.</li>
            <li>My rough parts of skin has now become soft and and it looks great.</li>
            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t show real results quickly, it might as well not even work at all in my mind.</li>
            <li>I see little traces of the cellulite that I did have on my thighs which is a good indication to me that this cream does indeed work.</li>
            <li>This product is best for those that just want to smooth those thighs(or other body parts) and make small noticeable reductions.</li>
            <li>more time.&lt;br /&gt;The main products I&#x27;ve learned to look for in a great cellulite cream includes ingredients like retinol, which thickens and improves circulation in the skin; caffeine, which can reduce the size of the fat cells that cause cellulite; and alpha hydroxy acids, which improve the overall texture of skin by helping to rid it of dead cells&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>Obviously, the cellulite is mostly gone.</li>
            <li>Thanks Puressant!</li>
            <li>And this lotion definitly helped me and my body out so much!</li>
            <li>consistently applied the cream to all my affected areas and made sure I massaged it entirely into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love the Puressant products, especially this cellulite cream.</li>
            <li>This cream really does the job!  </li>
            <li>It feels tighter to the touch as well, which I really appreciate, talk about a self-esteem boost!  </li>
            <li>I plan to buy more for the future.</li>
            <li>I saw the first results after around ten days so keep using it, it will make you or your wife/girlfriend sexyyy :)</li>
            <li>It has really tightened her skin and she couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>We will definitely be purchasing more soon.</li>
            <li>I wish I would have ordered more than one on my first order as this is something I will be using on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many cellulite creams and a friend recently told me about this one.</li>
            <li>Overall, phenomenal product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any cellulite, but it worked pretty well on hers and also works like a charm on stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I have bought a punch of cellulite cremes and some of them work better than others, but the key is to keep on using it.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more, and recommending it to all my mama friends.</li>
            <li>Thanks Puressant, you saved me!</li>
            <li>Also, if you &amp;#34;apply a generous amount&amp;#34; 1-2x daily this container will only last 1-2 weeks at best.  </li>
            <li>I take a hot bath before I apply so that my pores are open and hopes that it&#x27;ll work even better</li>
            <li>This cellulite cream saved me!&lt;br /&gt;After my first pregnancy</li>
            <li>It works REALLY well!</li>
            <li>and my skin was feeling firmer while remaining soft and smooth on the exterior.</li>
            <li>of course isn&#x27;t some magic wonder cream that will just make all your cellulite disappear, but it will definitely help in reducing it.</li>
            <li>The combination of powerful ingredients seem to really be making a difference.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It was gradual, but over the course of using this cream my cellulite is pretty much disappeared!</li>
            <li>yeah, first bottle in and</li>
            <li>One container has lasted me 5 weeks and looks like a have a couple more left.</li>
            <li>Anyways, this is my third cream in as many months</li>
            <li>Puressant had a lot of good reviews here, I believe over 100 and most said it starts showing softening of skin in a few days and results become obvious in couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>You can really feel the caffeine tightening the skin!</li>
            <li>It has a very nice scent that is subtle and fresh.</li>
            <li>I am at my pre-pregnancy weight but found my stomach, while flat, needed to recover more tautness.</li>
            <li>As much as I had hoped that the cellulite on my legs would go away when I lost weight, I had no such luck, even when I started to pack on more muscle.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t see so much improvement on my cellulites, since the container is small/medium size and if you use it every day it&#x27;s not going to last more than 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>Until one day I found this product, all natural and safe to use even if you got a sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really looking forward to see more positive effects in the future.</li>
            <li>She has been using it for a month and has been giving me positive feedback.</li>
            <li>I have seen positive results from a close friend that used it</li>
            <li>I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so.</li>
            <li>I can’t say anything but positive feedback for this cream.  </li>
            <li>I honestly got this for my wife, and while it was a hard sell at first, she is now a full believer.</li>
            <li>BE AWARE of ingredients, any reactions or sensitivities you may have....and use in an inconspicuous area and have benedryl cream ready.</li>
            <li>My skin there is also becoming firmer and feels younger.  </li>
            <li>I continued dry brushing (and my usual gallon of water a day), and the results were incredible on just the first application!</li>
            <li>So if you are wanting to look younger by having firmer, more attractive skin, try this product and you&#x27;ll be looking younger in as little as a month.</li>
            <li>It also moisturizes my skin and makes it super soft.</li>
            <li>It soaks up pretty quick and there&#x27;s no long waiting around for it to dry before being able to get</li>
            <li>Actually I purchased two more from my local beautician because she said they would give me quick results - lessons learnt there.</li>
            <li>I got this cream as a gift for my mother and she absolutely adores it.</li>
            <li>I really do like this.</li>
            <li>Finally ready to show some leg at the beach.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In conclusion, I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It has helped with smoothing out my rear, haha.</li>
            <li>I have used this for two weeks straight</li>
            <li>This cellulite reduction cream works really well</li>
            <li>The appearance of cellulite in my legs and thighs really improved, just in time for bikini season.</li>
            <li>Everyone knows cellulite creams don&#x27;t really work</li>
            <li>but I just really wanted to prove &amp;#34;everyone&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Before I ordered this product I really wanted it to work..</li>
            <li>This one really is working.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this cream for my wife who is very self conscience of her appearance.</li>
            <li>This cream works really very well.</li>
            <li>And its price is so much reasonable.</li>
            <li>Used whole container, noticed no difference.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really do anything.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It is a reasonable sized jar for the price.</li>
            <li>The Price of the cream is reasonable.</li>
            <li>highly recommended!</li>
            <li>The caffeine in the product is very helpful, and not always found in cellulite creams.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it very beneficial in firming up my cellulite patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not too much and nothing too drastic</li>
            <li>Cellulite can really ruin your life.</li>
            <li>Myself, I go straight to Google.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do anything really.</li>
            <li>It worked very well for me.</li>
            <li>The jar is almost empty and I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s made one difference other than it&#x27;s definitely a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I am excited to see the end results once I get through the entire tub.</li>
            <li>After reading many of the other reviews and the ingredients I decided to try</li>
            <li>She has even tried using some on other areas of her body that look better as well.</li>
            <li>The cream is made with Retinol and caffeine, which gives it a distinctive difference to so many other cellulite creams on the market.</li>
            <li>Either that or spend two thousand dollars or more to get minimal improvement from plastic surgery!</li>
            <li>Usually they don&#x27;t work, but this product has changed my skin for the better!</li>
            <li>but I like to believe it is all due to this cream mostly.</li>
            <li>With the new year, I have been trying to take better car of myself and loose weight.  </li>
            <li>My skin is firmer, bouncier, and appears to be much healthier and vibrant.</li>
            <li>Ordering my second jar right now!</li>
            <li>Within a short period of time after applying the cream consistently for a couple of days, I&#x27;m already seeing positive results!</li>
            <li>My skin seemed to be considerably healthier and obviously made a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>I am going to be realistic here.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly on my thighs, rear, and stomach.</li>
            <li>After initially using it for about a week, I couldn’t believe how soft and smooth my skin became.</li>
            <li>maybe it only works for more obvious cases.</li>
            <li>and even I can tell the particular difference.</li>
            <li>I got this mainly for use in my legs</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about two weeks now through a recommendation of a friend who bought it on Amazon, and I&#x27;ve seen some positive results so far.  </li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t like using creams and such for beautification, but this product has organic an herbal ingredients, which made me feel much more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>After just a couple weeks of using it, my skin feels smoother and is very soft!</li>
            <li>After using this cream for two weeks it is evident that my stretch marks are clearly less noticeable as well my skin tone is smooth and even.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for anyone struggling with cellulite reduction remedies.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend the Puressant cellulite cream.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended to all.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for anyone looking for a solution to cellulite.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it to any one who has problems with cellulite.</li>
            <li>The smell is somewhat strong at first, but you get used to it... plus it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>My skin feels much smoother and tighter in the areas that I apply the cream to and the scent is pleasant, which I can&#x27;t say for a few other creams on the market.  </li>
            <li>I really needed something to make my skin feel soft and lotion wasn&#x27;t doing the job.</li>
            <li>I am one of those people genetically doomed to have cellulite, I&#x27;ve had it since I was a kid even though I&#x27;ve always been normal to petite sized.</li>
            <li>Some of my friends had been having success with various cellulite creams, but I just couldn&#x27;t find one that worked for me.</li>
            <li>In a few weeks I saw a visible improvement in my skin, finding it more toned and elastic, as if I was</li>
            <li>I mean, it&#x27;s not all gone, but for just one bottle, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smoother and tighter in the areas that I apply the cream to and the scent is pleasant, which I can&#x27;t say for a few other creams on the market.</li>
            <li>It’s natural, strong, and really does well for the skin without harsh irritants or chemicals that can burn.</li>
            <li>This makes my skin feel so soft and vibrant looking.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty big size for the price!</li>
            <li>All natural!  </li>
            <li>After reading other peoples reviews I was so excited to try this.</li>
            <li>I feel a complete self-esteem boost and can go out with confidence!</li>
            <li>I would also suggest to use it as your regular lotion after shower and before bedtime, it&#x27;s not sticky even if your sweating in hot days.</li>
            <li>I have never been a big believer in all the creams and salves on the market and was surprised at how well it really works.</li>
            <li>The product I received came with the &amp;#34;for my protection&amp;#34; seal off, and clearly it had been used and returned as 1/4 of it was gone already.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin really soft.</li>
            <li>This cream goes on so well and tightens up your skin making the cellulite completely disappear.</li>
            <li>As far as I&#x27;m concerned it&#x27;s just an overpriced cream.</li>
            <li>so it can last me the whole month.</li>
            <li>I am seeing marked improvement.</li>
            <li>over time, it has completely rejuvenated her skin.</li>
            <li>maybe the problem is that i don&#x27;t really have much cellulite- the only time you can see it is if its compressed like when i cross my legs.</li>
            <li>Getting cellulite in your mid 20s after having two kids is REALLY embarrassing.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin soft</li>
            <li>After finishing my whole jar my stretch marks are no longer raised and the ones that are left are minuet.</li>
            <li>always feels so soft after having applied in the morning before bed.</li>
            <li>Been using for four days now, it makes my skin soft</li>
            <li>However, this cream actually worked very well for</li>
            <li>The skin absorbs the cream naturally and within days I began to notice some improvement.</li>
            <li>The seal was completely opened and looked as though someone used it and returned it</li>
            <li>I went on a strict exercise and diet regimen and lost nearly 100 pounds.  </li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>Though it won&#x27;t completely rid you of cellulite troubles, it severely lessens the problem.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel as self conscious these days</li>
            <li>This cream helped to get rid of that stubborn stuff and get me feeling like my old self again.  </li>
            <li>I suffered from it even when I was young</li>
            <li>Completely unsanitary.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my mom who is self conscious about the way she looks.</li>
            <li>However, none works nearly as well as this cream.  </li>
            <li>Some time ago I heard for the first time of this cream, I was initially skeptical about it, but I decided to try the same, having read many positive opinions and having the confidence to be refunded.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>I was super excited with the dramatic reduction in the appearance of cellulite</li>
            <li>It simply works!&lt;br /&gt;I spent sooo much money on a lot of different and also a lot more expensive creams but never really had good results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I was skeptical at first because there are so many products that promise results like this.</li>
            <li>and I already see cellulite where I previously never thought of seeing them.</li>
            <li>Nice that the smell is not over bearing, very subtle.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this cream to anybody attempting to remove any gross skin blemishes.</li>
            <li>I tried everything: changing my diet, dry brushing, massage… I have to say, the one thing that really made a difference was this cream.</li>
            <li>I do dry brush ands use nylon gloves in the shower to excoriate... wish there was something that didn&#x27;t cost so much and truly would help.</li>
            <li>Those weight acquired signs are gone and she looks like she&#x27;s back to being a teen, really.</li>
            <li>It goes on good and isn&#x27;t sticky or chalky but it&#x27;s extremely expensive , the container is tiny</li>
            <li>This dimply skin cream provides you with caffeine and retinol, which plays a major role in its effectiveness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really excited about getting my slim, firm legs back in time for bathing suit season!</li>
            <li>I stumble upon this cream by Puressant that market those as it&#x27;s main ingredients.</li>
            <li>As you get older, even if you are reasonably fit and thin, you will still probably have cellulite.  </li>
            <li>Smooth texture cream, little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>The fragrance and the cooling action are a little offsetting at first but, after a day or two of use, I have become quite fond of both.</li>
            <li>With summer fast approaching, I wanted to get a little boost to getting my bikini body ready.</li>
            <li>With summer fast approaching, I wanted to get a little boost to getting my bikini body ready.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed some considerable difference after starting to use this product.</li>
            <li>When you bare that in mind, you realize there is no &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; to this problem.</li>
            <li>Used the whole thing and noticed absolutely no difference.</li>
            <li>Puressant has developed a revolutionary cellulite cream that actually works.  </li>
            <li>I tried a couple of drugstore creams but nothing worked, no matter how much money I spent.</li>
            <li>Her skin is extra soft now</li>
            <li>This is a definite fast acting cream in the short time we have used it and my wife has been telling her friends about it like</li>
            <li>cream is basically a medium thick cream that goes on smoothly and absorbs</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s yummy texture is a pleasure to apply and the subtle scent is fine too.</li>
            <li>No product I&#x27;ve used in past has EVER produced results this quickly.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t look at my legs for this whole month other than day one, and day 30.</li>
            <li>Really even plastic surgeons can only minimally change the appearance of cellulite, so it does not come as a surprise that this has not worked.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really expecting the physical changes in my body to help me out in other ways too.</li>
            <li>but after a 2 weeks there was a noticeable difference and not that I am on my 3rd jar, the stretch marks are still there, but are barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li>The first few things I found for treating cellulite were caffeine and retinol.</li>
            <li>She loves this product, especially the price tag compared to other high end products that just don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>After using this cream for a short time I noticed that my skin was much softer and firmer and craters in my cellulite became less visible.</li>
            <li>By the time i was nearing the end, I had noticed that unsightly veins that made me appeared older had gone down.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had bad cellulite on my legs for many years and was looking for a real solution.</li>

            <li> Warmly recommended!</li>
            <li> the change on my skin is really remarkable.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I decided to trust and treat myself with this delicious cream.</li>
            <li> I find the menthol quite pleasant and it tingles and dissipates within 30 minutes or so.</li>
            <li> I think it has a pleasant smell with it also.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant, non-offensive smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, makes the skin soft…</li>
            <li> This cellulite cream is so creamy and feels so good when you put it on your skin.  </li>
            <li> This cream is as good as advertised.  </li>
            <li> But for now all is good.</li>
            <li> Good luck.</li>
            <li> I received this great product at reduced price in exchange on my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> - I knew I would since it&#x27;s already worked great for my girlfriend, but it&#x27;s nice to see it work on me, too.</li>
            <li> You can understand that people, who can have anything in the world, can not get rid of this orange peel for good.</li>
            <li> It seems to be a good formula and even after just a couple days skin seems to be smoothing out.</li>
            <li> Used the bottle up in like 2 1/2 weeks, hope that gives you a good time frame.</li>
            <li> One of my really good friends had success with Purressant,  I just couldn&#x27;t find one that worked for me, but this cream is awesome!  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s happy and I&#x27;m really glad</li>
            <li> Plus the price is very ok.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with the results of this cream.</li>
            <li> She is extremely satisfied with the results of the cream and seeing her happy is all I could ask for.</li>
            <li> Also the price is just right for the quality you get, and I have already recommended this cream to all my best friends</li>
            <li> It is a very effective cream that works to decrease fat deposits and water retention on the affected area which for me was mostly the area around my thighs and buttocks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I LOVE that!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this lotion!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be ordering more of this product!</li>
            <li> I have seen some improvement, but people who think this is the magic cure - wake up!</li>
            <li> Well I am SO glad I did!</li>
            <li> I ordered some more for myself and also decided to get some for my sister, mother in law, and sister in law as gifts!</li>
            <li> I love this cream!</li>
            <li> wife is definitely satisfied and I&#x27;m grateful she got it!</li>
            <li> I love how my thighs look now!</li>

            <li> I can honestly say I love this product!</li>
            <li> /&gt;~ Is it best for a certain skin type?</li>
            <li> I had very high hopes for this product,  all reviews taken into consideration &amp; an Amazon best seller!</li>
            <li> I have seen amazing results from using this product.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> Thank you for an amazing product.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing..</li>
            <li> Works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> and I have this amazing company to thank for that.</li>
            <li> and I had to get some of my own.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely the best in it&#x27;s category.</li>
            <li> It’s smells nice and absorbs without a greasy residue.  </li>
            <li> and I am loving the results.</li>
            <li> I honestly see no difference in my skin then before I started using it.</li>
            <li> It has a nice consistency and isn&#x27;t greasy.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t sticky or oily like some lotions and makes your skin feel nice too.</li>
            <li> Honestly, what did I have to lose?</li>
            <li> and I honestly tried some cream but didn&#x27;t work out.</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent too.</li>
            <li> (but don&#x27;t when you find something effective - your skin needs continuing support).</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t know what to expect</li>
            <li> Of course not all of them are effective but I found“Cellulite with Retinal &amp; Caffeine and Body Firming Cream”  effective.</li>
            <li> Really this is a best seller !!!!!!</li>
            <li> Now, I wish I would have found it right away, because the results have been so incredible.</li>
            <li> I first started using this cream off my sister who has been using it for quite some time herself, with very good results.</li>
            <li> It has a nice pleasant light scent.</li>
            <li> cream is totally worth the price and will make your body beautiful again.</li>
            <li> Feels very cool!</li>
            <li> With my cellulite gone, I&#x27;m so much more confident, and I even purchased a swim suit, and plan to go swimming this weekend!</li>
            <li> This cream is by far one of the best that I have ever tried!</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s told me how much better she feels now in her own skin.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing result oriented cellulite cream I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> My remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
            <li> I have been very happy so far with this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The most effective elements of this product, the Organic Herbal Infusion, Organic Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera), Isopropyl Palmitate (Palm Oil), Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Caffeine, Organic Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower Oil), PAcrylates/C10-30</li>
            <li> The ideal product would be both cosmetically and long-term effective, but it&#x27;s more realistic to expect a formula to tilt towards one or the</li>
            <li> This is a unique &amp; gorgeous product.</li>
            <li> This body cream is the best I&#x27;ve found, and I&#x27;ve tried the &amp;#34;best!&amp;#34; I have found no other cream that gives me the results that I get with this one</li>
            <li> It feels good and sort of cool on your skin and absorbs quicklys</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant scent, nothing too powerful or noticeable.</li>
            <li> It has a nice and non-offensive smell and absorbs easily without greasy, sticky or oily feeling.</li>
            <li> Out of the many treatments we’ve tested, this has certainly been a great one.</li>
            <li> My cellulite in turn has become markedly reduced (on my rear  end and arms), and this impressive difference has increased my self-esteem by huge margins.  </li>
            <li> Puressant is a really nice cellulite cream for firmer and smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been impressed with this product, especially for the price point!</li>
            <li> so you may need to buy more than 1 to see any results, also the bottle</li>
            <li> I love this cream.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied with this cream :)</li>
            <li> I have tried so many cellulite reducing creams that are either too oily, smelly, or just don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s been extremely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Like most women, I find cellulite to be unsightly and embarrassing.  </li>
            <li> It has a smooth feeling and adds softness to my skin!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> have lead my legs and butt to become more, well &amp;#34;dimpled&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really glad I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid a lot more for many of the products.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cream.</li>
            <li> story short, this is the best cellulite cream I’ve ever used (and I’ve used well over a dozen of others).</li>
            <li> After taking a year to get back in shape and shedding 60lbs, I looked awesome</li>
            <li> I really liked the smeel and it was so smooth on my skin..</li>
            <li> My legs look more toned towards the top.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I also do a body wrap around the areas I put the cream on to keep more heat in.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product, because I’ve been using it still now</li>
            <li> So I’ll more purchase this product for my friends.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re about to the bottom of her tub of it, so we&#x27;ll be getting some more soon.</li>
            <li> It will work better.</li>
            <li> I am thankful to Puressant for providing me this cream for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> even more results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thank you! :)</li>
            <li> I got this product for FREE in a exchange of honest review</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> cellulite&#x27;s reduced significantly, and I&#x27;m buying another jar for sure!</li>
            <li> I look and feel much better after the weight loss</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll get better results</li>
            <li> I really love it.</li>
            <li> I feel like it firms and smooths my skin, and my legs are looking much better nowadays.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are safe and do not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> and it feels wonderfully refreshing, especially on a hot summer day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> : Probably okay for all.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it tested on animals?</li>
            <li> But you can make skin tighter and firmer and better conditioned so as to hide the cellulite.</li>
            <li> My stomach became more toned and I am committed by it</li>
            <li> so I personally know that this is one of the best creams for cellulite out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While I looked and felt much better, I did have an embarrassing problem of stretch marks around my shoulders, waist, and buttocks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been beginning to see more aging in my legs</li>
            <li> and I do feel more tightening of my skin as opposed to before and the dimples I used to see seem to be lessening in size.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been much more confident and have felt much better about myself.</li>
            <li> but it made my cellulite show more than before.</li>
            <li> In a week I started noticing smoother skin and with every week it was getting better and better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found this cream in time for summer.</li>
            <li> love this product</li>
            <li> I am really satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> So if you see this in stock you better get it while you can</li>
            <li> I am pleased to say that this cream WORKS.</li>
            <li> I came to order me some after seeing a visible difference in her problem areas, mostly her thighs.</li>
            <li> Okay,</li>
            <li> and we love it.</li>
            <li> I have ever used love</li>
            <li> Was facing some post babies, over 30 cellulite  - not horrible, but noticeable and not going away with our workout and diet.</li>
            <li> I have been working out and eating right, and this cream was the perfect addition to get summer ready.</li>
            <li> Within a month I noticed a significant improvement and with continuous use I am actually able to feel comfortable in shorts again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall an excellent cream that really works.</li>
            <li> That said, I was very excited to try this product.</li>
            <li> nice cream have not noticed any significant changes yet but hopeful</li>
            <li> but this one in particular is really great in minimizing my cellulite while firming up.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a nice minty scent, and a cool soothing feeling once applied.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seem to be working pretty good.</li>
            <li> She uses it sparingly and I&#x27;ll happily get her a new jar as needed.</li>
            <li> The cellulite cream has a nice smell and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I really REALLY wanted to be able to write a good review for this, but I can not.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this effective cream!</li>
            <li> and I feel so much more comfortable in a bikini at the beach now.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it does a fantastic job of smoothing &amp; my skin</li>
            <li> Boy am I glad, my skin feels smooth and the imperfections have diminished.</li>
            <li> I sure hope it’s available soon.</li>
            <li> that’s nice for the skin like shea butter, allantoin, aloe and oils that it’d be worth using even if it didn’t help your cellulite.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have now got my own supply as I have seen very positive results on myself.</li>
            <li> Was excited to know that there is a possibility to be able to rid my body of any cellulite.</li>
            <li> I like the scent of the cream and how easily it glides on my skin and is gradually making a difference.</li>
            <li> but like I said you could easily see the difference.</li>
            <li> Strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple, effective, and incredibly fairly priced.</li>
            <li> the best part was that it has a nice scent to it which made it very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Within a week my skin was smoother, firmer and healthier with definitely gained it&#x27;s elasticity back.  </li>
            <li> Works exactly as intended and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results, my wife&#x27;s mood dramatically improved and her skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li> I have to say I am quite surprised with how amazing of a job this has done on helping remove them!</li>
            <li> and I eat very healthy and stay very hydrated</li>
            <li> If there would be a true magic cream for cellulite removal</li>
            <li> Perhaps one of the most effective creams I’ve ever seen in action, that’s what you get with this cellulite treatment lotion.</li>
            <li> Overall, I have been really happy.</li>
            <li> and she says it feels fantastic.</li>
            <li> I only use once a day with great results.</li>
            <li> it being so smooth.</li>
            <li> I really love this product and feel that it was well worth the money.</li>
            <li> So I was really happy, that after just a short time using this cream, I can see a visible reduction in cellulite.  </li>
            <li> I think this cream is awesome and have already restocked a few times.</li>
            <li> &amp; i just got it for free.</li>
            <li> Great that it is made in the US, and that there is a money back guarantee!</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or sticky residue.</li>
            <li> After a while it actually feels nice and refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review and opinion.</li>
            <li> Smooth, like a light moisture lotion.</li>
            <li> Cream is light yellow.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review.</li>
            <li> found things I could now feel comfortable wearing again.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m surprised that it is supposedly the most popular cellulite cream on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 3 weeks now on the back of my thighs and already see a huge difference!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, most cellulite creams don&#x27;t carry the most important ingredients in high levels, Retinol and Caffeine.</li>
            <li> After a couple of week&#x27;s use, even without exercise and consistent use,  I noticed a HUGE difference!</li>
            <li> My cellulite has diminished by more than 90%  since the first time I&#x27;ve used this, which was three months ago.  </li>
            <li> I fell in love with this cream within the first week of use.</li>
            <li> I am still exercising and watching my diet, but I am hoping that I will be able to get rid of all of them after I finish the first bottle.</li>
            <li> and I can see significant changes to my skin&#x27;s elasticity.</li>
            <li> I found it to be light and no bad smell.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought that it had to be a search engine mistake, but as I read on, many people said that this product worked for stretch marks as well.  </li>
            <li> In fact, this is the best anti cellulite product that has really helped my skin to look tight and smooth and thanks to it, I feel much more confident.</li>
            <li> Beyond working incredibly, the price point is so much cheaper than most other cellulite reducing creams.&lt;br /&gt;Long</li>
            <li> I can’t wait to see what other positive results that I’ll get from this wonderful product!</li>
            <li> The product works better than described, the price is unbelievably cheap, and works within no time.&lt;br /&gt;10/10 highly recommended to all!</li>
            <li> /&gt;You really do see a huge difference faster, than what most creams would do.</li>
            <li> I eat exceptionally well, work out consistently and lead a healthy life style in general</li>
            <li> Smooth, almost powdery, moisturized, no unpleasant film.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cream itself is very light and rubs into the skin very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks Puressant for making such a good product!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a lotion like this, you have found the right one!</li>
            <li> Super excited.</li>
            <li> I wish I had this product right after having my son, it’ll most certainly be included in any baby shower gifts I give!</li>
            <li> But in addition, there is greater blood flow, and my skin is so much softer.</li>
            <li> My skin looks so much healthier and more</li>
            <li> was&#x27;nt completely full.</li>
            <li> After one full jar used on one leg</li>
            <li> It really works to tighten my skins, making a more firmer appearance and therefore reduces the cellulite.</li>
            <li> I really like that this is fragrance free!</li>
            <li> I seen a big difference I use after my morning shower and after a good work out at night  seen lots of improvement in midsection abdomen  </li>
            <li> The product smells clean and feels fresh.</li>
            <li> I was looking to reduce cellulite on some parts of my body, and this cream did it quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this product for my wife and I could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have purchased and tried several different cellulite creams on Amazon and have found this one of the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and my legs feel smoother since I started using it.</li>
            <li> Luckily, this cream knows what it&#x27;s doing.</li>

            <li> First off I like how light-weight and scent free</li>
            <li> And, I was very interested in the reviews.</li>
            <li> Nice product with attendant skin softening and vibrant looking.</li>
            <li> and I am pregnant and its definitely reduced my cellulite like magic!</li>
            <li> I found it very pleasant to use and will continue to use and report back further results.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> &amp; i noticed a significant reduction in cellulite after my first week of using the product.</li>
            <li> It really works !!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had anything work this quickly and with such amazing results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve seen results and will order more as I continue to loose weight.</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s had some really great results after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I am so happy some have found a great product here, however, after 3 weeks of continued use, sadly I tossed nearly 3/4 a jar out.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now, and I&#x27;ve noticed some great results.</li>
            <li> She was always self conscious about doing things that would show off her legs, like wearing shorts or going to the beach, but now she&#x27;s a proud short wearing beach goer like the rest of us!</li>
            <li> It is a natural thing that happens in most women and some men.</li>
            <li> My sister mentioned she had success with this product and thought I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is worth the five stars</li>
            <li> Definitely worth giving this cellulite cream a try.</li>
            <li> So far this one works a bit better.</li>
            <li> It leaves skin nice and soft.&lt;br /&gt;~ Potential long-term effectiveness:</li>
            <li> It was kind of a reward to myself for loosing over 50 pounds in the last year.</li>
            <li> I hope to get to completely solve my problem, and it&#x27;s sure I will not stop using this product.</li>
            <li> -- no one will know your secret to perfect legs!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, got mine in TWO DAYS with Prime!</li>
            <li> Nope, &amp;#34;everyone&amp;#34; is right.</li>
            <li> I find myself using it right after a shower, and massaging it well into my skin.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> The cream does not work right away -- you have to use it routinely.</li>
            <li> I lost most of my baby weight quickly, but my skin just wasn&#x27;t quite the same.  </li>
            <li> I also forgot to mention that I have very sensitive skin and react badly to many things I try, and this works very well for me.  </li>
            <li> The product is smooth and worked very fast on her skin, mainly her legs (about 5 weeks -</li>
            <li> The cream takes some time, but according to my girlfriend the use of a cream is completely worth the delay between the first application and results.</li>
            <li> I, like most other women across America, have experienced an increasing amount of cellulite as I&#x27;ve aged.</li>
            <li> My rough parts of skin has now become soft and and it looks great.</li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t show real results quickly, it might as well not even work at all in my mind.</li>
            <li> I see little traces of the cellulite that I did have on my thighs which is a good indication to me that this cream does indeed work.</li>
            <li> This product is best for those that just want to smooth those thighs(or other body parts) and make small noticeable reductions.</li>
            <li> more time.&lt;br /&gt;The main products I&#x27;ve learned to look for in a great cellulite cream includes ingredients like retinol, which thickens and improves circulation in the skin; caffeine, which can reduce the size of the fat cells that cause cellulite; and alpha hydroxy acids, which improve the overall texture of skin by helping to rid it of dead cells&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> Obviously, the cellulite is mostly gone.</li>
            <li> Thanks Puressant!</li>
            <li> And this lotion definitly helped me and my body out so much!</li>
            <li> consistently applied the cream to all my affected areas and made sure I massaged it entirely into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love the Puressant products, especially this cellulite cream.</li>
            <li> This cream really does the job!  </li>
            <li> It feels tighter to the touch as well, which I really appreciate, talk about a self-esteem boost!  </li>
            <li> I plan to buy more for the future.</li>
            <li> I saw the first results after around ten days so keep using it, it will make you or your wife/girlfriend sexyyy :)</li>
            <li> It has really tightened her skin and she couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> We will definitely be purchasing more soon.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have ordered more than one on my first order as this is something I will be using on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many cellulite creams and a friend recently told me about this one.</li>
            <li> Overall, phenomenal product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any cellulite, but it worked pretty well on hers and also works like a charm on stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I have bought a punch of cellulite cremes and some of them work better than others, but the key is to keep on using it.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more, and recommending it to all my mama friends.</li>
            <li> Thanks Puressant, you saved me!</li>
            <li> Also, if you &amp;#34;apply a generous amount&amp;#34; 1-2x daily this container will only last 1-2 weeks at best.  </li>
            <li> I take a hot bath before I apply so that my pores are open and hopes that it&#x27;ll work even better</li>
            <li> This cellulite cream saved me!&lt;br /&gt;After my first pregnancy</li>
            <li> It works REALLY well!</li>
            <li> and my skin was feeling firmer while remaining soft and smooth on the exterior.</li>
            <li> of course isn&#x27;t some magic wonder cream that will just make all your cellulite disappear, but it will definitely help in reducing it.</li>
            <li> The combination of powerful ingredients seem to really be making a difference.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It was gradual, but over the course of using this cream my cellulite is pretty much disappeared!</li>
            <li> yeah, first bottle in and</li>
            <li> One container has lasted me 5 weeks and looks like a have a couple more left.</li>
            <li> Anyways, this is my third cream in as many months</li>
            <li> Puressant had a lot of good reviews here, I believe over 100 and most said it starts showing softening of skin in a few days and results become obvious in couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> You can really feel the caffeine tightening the skin!</li>
            <li> It has a very nice scent that is subtle and fresh.</li>
            <li> I am at my pre-pregnancy weight but found my stomach, while flat, needed to recover more tautness.</li>
            <li> As much as I had hoped that the cellulite on my legs would go away when I lost weight, I had no such luck, even when I started to pack on more muscle.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t see so much improvement on my cellulites, since the container is small/medium size and if you use it every day it&#x27;s not going to last more than 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Until one day I found this product, all natural and safe to use even if you got a sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really looking forward to see more positive effects in the future.</li>
            <li> She has been using it for a month and has been giving me positive feedback.</li>
            <li> I have seen positive results from a close friend that used it</li>
            <li> I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so.</li>
            <li> I can’t say anything but positive feedback for this cream.  </li>
            <li> I honestly got this for my wife, and while it was a hard sell at first, she is now a full believer.</li>
            <li> BE AWARE of ingredients, any reactions or sensitivities you may have....and use in an inconspicuous area and have benedryl cream ready.</li>
            <li> My skin there is also becoming firmer and feels younger.  </li>
            <li> I continued dry brushing (and my usual gallon of water a day), and the results were incredible on just the first application!</li>
            <li> So if you are wanting to look younger by having firmer, more attractive skin, try this product and you&#x27;ll be looking younger in as little as a month.</li>
            <li> It also moisturizes my skin and makes it super soft.</li>
            <li> It soaks up pretty quick and there&#x27;s no long waiting around for it to dry before being able to get</li>
            <li> Actually I purchased two more from my local beautician because she said they would give me quick results - lessons learnt there.</li>
            <li> I got this cream as a gift for my mother and she absolutely adores it.</li>
            <li> I really do like this.</li>
            <li> Finally ready to show some leg at the beach.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In conclusion, I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It has helped with smoothing out my rear, haha.</li>
            <li> I have used this for two weeks straight</li>
            <li> This cellulite reduction cream works really well</li>
            <li> The appearance of cellulite in my legs and thighs really improved, just in time for bikini season.</li>
            <li> Everyone knows cellulite creams don&#x27;t really work</li>
            <li> but I just really wanted to prove &amp;#34;everyone&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Before I ordered this product I really wanted it to work..</li>
            <li> This one really is working.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this cream for my wife who is very self conscience of her appearance.</li>
            <li> This cream works really very well.</li>
            <li> And its price is so much reasonable.</li>
            <li> Used whole container, noticed no difference.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really do anything.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It is a reasonable sized jar for the price.</li>
            <li> The Price of the cream is reasonable.</li>
            <li> highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The caffeine in the product is very helpful, and not always found in cellulite creams.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it very beneficial in firming up my cellulite patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not too much and nothing too drastic</li>
            <li> Cellulite can really ruin your life.</li>
            <li> Myself, I go straight to Google.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything really.</li>
            <li> It worked very well for me.</li>
            <li> The jar is almost empty and I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s made one difference other than it&#x27;s definitely a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I am excited to see the end results once I get through the entire tub.</li>
            <li> After reading many of the other reviews and the ingredients I decided to try</li>
            <li> She has even tried using some on other areas of her body that look better as well.</li>
            <li> The cream is made with Retinol and caffeine, which gives it a distinctive difference to so many other cellulite creams on the market.</li>
            <li> Either that or spend two thousand dollars or more to get minimal improvement from plastic surgery!</li>
            <li> Usually they don&#x27;t work, but this product has changed my skin for the better!</li>
            <li> but I like to believe it is all due to this cream mostly.</li>
            <li> With the new year, I have been trying to take better car of myself and loose weight.  </li>
            <li> My skin is firmer, bouncier, and appears to be much healthier and vibrant.</li>
            <li> Ordering my second jar right now!</li>
            <li> Within a short period of time after applying the cream consistently for a couple of days, I&#x27;m already seeing positive results!</li>
            <li> My skin seemed to be considerably healthier and obviously made a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> I am going to be realistic here.</li>
            <li> I use it mainly on my thighs, rear, and stomach.</li>
            <li> After initially using it for about a week, I couldn’t believe how soft and smooth my skin became.</li>
            <li> maybe it only works for more obvious cases.</li>
            <li> and even I can tell the particular difference.</li>
            <li> I got this mainly for use in my legs</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two weeks now through a recommendation of a friend who bought it on Amazon, and I&#x27;ve seen some positive results so far.  </li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t like using creams and such for beautification, but this product has organic an herbal ingredients, which made me feel much more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> After just a couple weeks of using it, my skin feels smoother and is very soft!</li>
            <li> After using this cream for two weeks it is evident that my stretch marks are clearly less noticeable as well my skin tone is smooth and even.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for anyone struggling with cellulite reduction remedies.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend the Puressant cellulite cream.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended to all.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for anyone looking for a solution to cellulite.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it to any one who has problems with cellulite.</li>
            <li> The smell is somewhat strong at first, but you get used to it... plus it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> My skin feels much smoother and tighter in the areas that I apply the cream to and the scent is pleasant, which I can&#x27;t say for a few other creams on the market.  </li>
            <li> I really needed something to make my skin feel soft and lotion wasn&#x27;t doing the job.</li>
            <li> I am one of those people genetically doomed to have cellulite, I&#x27;ve had it since I was a kid even though I&#x27;ve always been normal to petite sized.</li>
            <li> Some of my friends had been having success with various cellulite creams, but I just couldn&#x27;t find one that worked for me.</li>
            <li> In a few weeks I saw a visible improvement in my skin, finding it more toned and elastic, as if I was</li>
            <li> I mean, it&#x27;s not all gone, but for just one bottle, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smoother and tighter in the areas that I apply the cream to and the scent is pleasant, which I can&#x27;t say for a few other creams on the market.</li>
            <li> It’s natural, strong, and really does well for the skin without harsh irritants or chemicals that can burn.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin feel so soft and vibrant looking.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty big size for the price!</li>
            <li> All natural!  </li>
            <li> After reading other peoples reviews I was so excited to try this.</li>
            <li> I feel a complete self-esteem boost and can go out with confidence!</li>
            <li> I would also suggest to use it as your regular lotion after shower and before bedtime, it&#x27;s not sticky even if your sweating in hot days.</li>
            <li> I have never been a big believer in all the creams and salves on the market and was surprised at how well it really works.</li>
            <li> The product I received came with the &amp;#34;for my protection&amp;#34; seal off, and clearly it had been used and returned as 1/4 of it was gone already.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin really soft.</li>
            <li> This cream goes on so well and tightens up your skin making the cellulite completely disappear.</li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned it&#x27;s just an overpriced cream.</li>
            <li> so it can last me the whole month.</li>
            <li> I am seeing marked improvement.</li>
            <li> over time, it has completely rejuvenated her skin.</li>
            <li> maybe the problem is that i don&#x27;t really have much cellulite- the only time you can see it is if its compressed like when i cross my legs.</li>
            <li> Getting cellulite in your mid 20s after having two kids is REALLY embarrassing.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin soft</li>
            <li> After finishing my whole jar my stretch marks are no longer raised and the ones that are left are minuet.</li>
            <li> always feels so soft after having applied in the morning before bed.</li>
            <li> Been using for four days now, it makes my skin soft</li>
            <li> However, this cream actually worked very well for</li>
            <li> The skin absorbs the cream naturally and within days I began to notice some improvement.</li>
            <li> The seal was completely opened and looked as though someone used it and returned it</li>
            <li> I went on a strict exercise and diet regimen and lost nearly 100 pounds.  </li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> Though it won&#x27;t completely rid you of cellulite troubles, it severely lessens the problem.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel as self conscious these days</li>
            <li> This cream helped to get rid of that stubborn stuff and get me feeling like my old self again.  </li>
            <li> I suffered from it even when I was young</li>
            <li> Completely unsanitary.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom who is self conscious about the way she looks.</li>
            <li> However, none works nearly as well as this cream.  </li>
            <li> Some time ago I heard for the first time of this cream, I was initially skeptical about it, but I decided to try the same, having read many positive opinions and having the confidence to be refunded.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> I was super excited with the dramatic reduction in the appearance of cellulite</li>
            <li> It simply works!&lt;br /&gt;I spent sooo much money on a lot of different and also a lot more expensive creams but never really had good results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I was skeptical at first because there are so many products that promise results like this.</li>
            <li> and I already see cellulite where I previously never thought of seeing them.</li>
            <li> Nice that the smell is not over bearing, very subtle.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this cream to anybody attempting to remove any gross skin blemishes.</li>
            <li> I tried everything: changing my diet, dry brushing, massage… I have to say, the one thing that really made a difference was this cream.</li>
            <li> I do dry brush ands use nylon gloves in the shower to excoriate... wish there was something that didn&#x27;t cost so much and truly would help.</li>
            <li> Those weight acquired signs are gone and she looks like she&#x27;s back to being a teen, really.</li>
            <li> It goes on good and isn&#x27;t sticky or chalky but it&#x27;s extremely expensive , the container is tiny</li>
            <li> This dimply skin cream provides you with caffeine and retinol, which plays a major role in its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really excited about getting my slim, firm legs back in time for bathing suit season!</li>
            <li> I stumble upon this cream by Puressant that market those as it&#x27;s main ingredients.</li>
            <li> As you get older, even if you are reasonably fit and thin, you will still probably have cellulite.  </li>
            <li> Smooth texture cream, little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The fragrance and the cooling action are a little offsetting at first but, after a day or two of use, I have become quite fond of both.</li>
            <li> With summer fast approaching, I wanted to get a little boost to getting my bikini body ready.</li>
            <li> With summer fast approaching, I wanted to get a little boost to getting my bikini body ready.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed some considerable difference after starting to use this product.</li>
            <li> When you bare that in mind, you realize there is no &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; to this problem.</li>
            <li> Used the whole thing and noticed absolutely no difference.</li>
            <li> Puressant has developed a revolutionary cellulite cream that actually works.  </li>
            <li> I tried a couple of drugstore creams but nothing worked, no matter how much money I spent.</li>
            <li> Her skin is extra soft now</li>
            <li> This is a definite fast acting cream in the short time we have used it and my wife has been telling her friends about it like</li>
            <li> cream is basically a medium thick cream that goes on smoothly and absorbs</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s yummy texture is a pleasure to apply and the subtle scent is fine too.</li>
            <li> No product I&#x27;ve used in past has EVER produced results this quickly.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t look at my legs for this whole month other than day one, and day 30.</li>
            <li> Really even plastic surgeons can only minimally change the appearance of cellulite, so it does not come as a surprise that this has not worked.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really expecting the physical changes in my body to help me out in other ways too.</li>
            <li> but after a 2 weeks there was a noticeable difference and not that I am on my 3rd jar, the stretch marks are still there, but are barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li> The first few things I found for treating cellulite were caffeine and retinol.</li>
            <li> She loves this product, especially the price tag compared to other high end products that just don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> After using this cream for a short time I noticed that my skin was much softer and firmer and craters in my cellulite became less visible.</li>
            <li> By the time i was nearing the end, I had noticed that unsightly veins that made me appeared older had gone down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had bad cellulite on my legs for many years and was looking for a real solution.</li>
            <li> My skin is very soft and moisturized, and possibly I see a slight reduction in cellulite.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to see results.</li>
            <li> There was no tingle as others reported and it just flat out did not work for me.  </li>
            <li> Since she has started using it, I can notice a big difference in her skin around her hips where she had some minor stretch marks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, and I haven&#x27;t faced any problems like rashes or uncomfortable itchiness.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is one of the few products that actually does what it&#x27;s supposed to and definitely not a waste.</li>
            <li> I decided to look into creams to try out and bought one at my local drugstore which turned out to be a complete waste.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel soft and tight.  </li>
            <li> you should seriously consider this one first, I can truly see the difference.</li>
            <li> All the other factors i.e. eating healthy and exercising are there, so this should have done the trick but sadly, it did not.</li>
            <li> I tried several other products, spending literally hundreds of dollars in total, and nothing proved sufficient, until I came across this.</li>
            <li> After using the cream for a little over 2 weeks the results were clear.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The combination of the coolness and the caffeine makes it feel kind of tingly when you apply it, which isn&#x27;t bad though, and you get used to the feeling in no time.</li>
            <li> The skin in my trouble areas has softened considerably.  </li>
            <li> They are not completely gone</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month in a half after searching for solutions to this problem now that beach season is approaching, and after meticulously looking through lots of individual ingredients that supposedly work, I found this cream which includes all of them (principally caffeine and retinol).</li>
            <li> /&gt;It arrived promptly in the mail and unlike other creams this had both retinol and caffeine which are essential in the reduction of cellulite.  </li>
            <li> you are struggling with cellulite, stretch marks, or other blemishes, I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough.</li>
            <li> On day three, I noticed that my skin wasn&#x27;t as dry and felt tighter (</li>
            <li> This product within a very short amount of time started working and over the next few weeks I saw a drastic appearance of my thighs  </li>
            <li> I have been using Puressant&#x27;s Cellulite Reducing Cream on my mid section for a few weeks now and have noticed that my stretch marks and dimples are starting to fade.  </li>
            <li> As part of her overall diet &amp; exercise plan, my girl says this cellulite cream has helped her firm up the skin on back of her legs and and arms.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this cream for a few short days, but I already see a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered with very dimpled and loose skin after a big weight gain and then dramatic weight loss</li>
            <li> With the help of my practitioner, we finally deduced it down to the application of this product.</li>
            <li> Not a slightly difference noticed after finishing the jar, and I have very little cellulite.</li>
            <li> So I recently gained a little bit of weight.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have seen absolutely no difference?</li>
            <li> I have spent money on all kinds of creams and potions and to no avail.  </li>
            <li> I saw no results at all , I did apply twice a day until both jars were empty.</li>
            <li> only takes a few minutes per thigh.</li>
            <li> /&gt;~ Packaging: 4oz plastic wide mouth jar with screw on lid.&lt;br /&gt;~ Immediate cosmetic effects:</li>
            <li> But with this product, I saw results in only a few weeks.</li>
            <li> She told me it wasn’t like you can see a difference in a few days, but she’s definitely made a believer out of me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a little under a week now - not long enough to see dramatic results, but long enough to see some.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a 36 year old mom lets just say I had some serious cellulite to deal with.  </li>
            <li> This makes me glad that i hadn&#x27;t gotten surgery for removing them, because this cream was a cheaper and less painful alternative.</li>
            <li> If you have tried others in the past, look no further.</li>
            <li> I have tried two other products  </li>
            <li> It is not greasy or &#x27;tacky&#x27; like some other creams.  </li>
            <li> I have been on several prescribed medications over this past week for hives (urticaria) ...and prednisone,  benedryl and no avail.</li>
            <li> It contains caffeine, retinol, and other herbal infusions to help repair the skin and keep it glowing.</li>
            <li> I know she&#x27;s been testing some other products before, but none could compete with Puressant&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This cream is going to help you regain elasticity of skin lost due to weight gain.</li>
            <li> This cream like every other cream out there is designed to REDUCE not eliminate cellulite.</li>
            <li> It is non greasy when applied, unlike other creams.</li>
            <li> so I could compare to the other leg</li>
            <li> For those looking for extreme changes there is not a product out there that is going to give it to you for $20.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also had to deal with unflattering stretch marks and other blemishes that I just couldn&#x27;t get rid of.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to wait for things, and that includes when I&#x27;m dealing with creams or other medicinal items.</li>
            <li> , never having used any product like this is the past, but this has definitely surpassed my expectations!</li>
            <li> I just turned 30, and I noticed a few days ago that my legs are starting to look a little jiggly.</li>
            <li> I am hoping that within two months, the cellulite will be very minimal.</li>
            <li> Just a few minutes for each thigh and use the dry brushing technique, massaging/stroking upward toward heart (for lymphatic system).</li>
            <li> Little application of this product results in wide range of results.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 Jars of this cream and  I work out hard daily</li>
            <li> NOT worth it to me to continue suffering with this.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I hate that having cellulite kept me from doing something I love.</li>
            <li> This product works extremely well!</li>
            <li> As one of those rare men who suffers from cellulite, I felt a little embarrassed to have this in my cabinet.</li>
            <li> A week and a half of searching for allergen triggers-mind</li>
            <li> I know that masassing itself helps to do wonders to cellulite, but this cream doubled with massag into the afflicted area showed results in less than a week.</li>
            <li> yeah, now the cellulite is less visible.</li>
            <li> tried various remedies, also quite expensive, but no one seemed to have an effect on me, in fact, for a period of time I stopped taking care and obviously the situation has worsened.</li>
            <li> I would give this less than 1 star if I could.</li>
            <li> This cellulite cream is equipped with caffeine and retinol, which plays a major role behind its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> It also isn&#x27;t oily like some of the other creams I used before, which is a huge plus for me because I hate the feeling of being oily.</li>
            <li> The cream itself is rather cold when you first apply it</li>
            <li> No it doesn&#x27;t help you lose weight, but it makes my skin look tight and toned</li>
            <li> My legs and butt weren&#x27;t as tight as I wanted them to be, so I bought this to supplement my exercise.</li>
            <li> My lovely wife had cellulite on her legs and backside, and she felt horribly self-conscious about it for a long time.</li>
            <li> this Cellulite Reducing Cream has given me a little added encouragement as I see my thighs looking firmer and smoother.  </li>
            <li> I was a little embarrassed to wear shorts</li>
            <li> Even putting a little bit here and there seems to be doing the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a month now</li>
            <li> I never really believed in cellulite creams, I have tried a few in the past with no luck and had written them off as a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I also like that this cream has little to no fragrance</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product and after a few weeks I saw some diminishing signs of cellulite.</li>
            <li> It tones your skin, giving it a firm and youthful look.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks I can tell the difference in my  gluteus maximus area.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I used this product everyday and it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> My legs were firm looking and for once no cottage cheese legs.  </li>
            <li> I could see a difference within a few weeks and it has a bonus that it does not leave a greasy, or oily feel to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every day for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want to waste anymore money than I already have.</li>
            <li> It took a few applications, and we started to see results take hold within a few days, then</li>
            <li> You can see a gradual change in cellulite when applying it everyday.  </li>
            <li> It helps firm the skin and gives a smoother appearance.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> but after approximately 2 weeks I started noticing that my skin was not only tighter but smoother.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money...</li>
            <li> My wife had purchased this cream a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> Waste of money...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, I&#x27;m an impatient person.</li>
            <li> In my 30s that shape started to be round.</li>
            <li> Nothing was change ,I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> , I guess I am a bit impatient with results.</li>
            <li> The market is saturated with phony products, and I must admit to having tried a few throughout the years.  </li>
            <li> I’ve been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> After a couple weeks of faithful use, my skin looks smoother and less “hail damaged”!  </li>
            <li> Smoother skin and less cottage cheese!</li>
            <li> It is no easy, but</li>
            <li> I used to be insecure wearing shorts because of my cellulite, but this definitely helped eliminate the problem.</li>
            <li> , there was a small tingly feeling .</li>
            <li> I work out and eat healthy, but there were still those annoying, unsightly dimples!</li>
            <li> I found no magic here.</li>
            <li> One of my friends recommended this cream that she ordered from Amazon, and while I usually prefer to buy these types of products in person, I decided to try it anyways.</li>
            <li> , I felt so uncomfortable about my extra pounds and infirm skin around stomach area...</li>
            <li> Usually people use over the counter cosmetic creams to treat cellulite.</li>
            <li> This impatient late 20s cellulite scared individual is still impatient but no longer cellulite afraid.</li>
            <li> nearly instantly, all over the application areas.&lt;br /&gt;Please be advised when purchasing, even for folks who have never had these issues, as I am new to hives; I wouldn&#x27;t wish this misery on a worst enemy!</li>
            <li> : subtle scent, not overwhelming; &amp; did make smoother skin in about a week.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s tried other creams and lotions that are twice the price only to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Cellulite gives me a complex</li>
            <li> Give this product at least a month</li>
            <li> and I researched different products like crazy...</li>
            <li> I think I need at least three containers to see results.</li>
            <li> Listen, I&#x27;m a thick girl.</li>
            <li> Being thick comes with cellulite  and stretch marks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s annoying, and it makes me very self-conscious.</li>
            <li> I found it difficult to resist feeling the complexion of my skin due to</li>
            <li> : after week 2, no further results; worst of all it made me break out in head to toe HOT, itchy, fire-like, random hives.</li>
            <li> I mean I am just about to turn 30</li>
            <li> BUT serious cons.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> As a man it may seem a little silly for me to use it</li>
            <li> I’ve tried a couple different things for cellulite in the paste and one of them smelled so bad</li>
            <li> and I was completely shocked that it actually worked.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to get a hold of these days because it&#x27;s always sold out!</li>
            <li> unfortunately it did very little for me.</li>
            <li> On day 30 my legs looked like I stripped 10 years off of them and they felt and looked like my legs I had in my late teens!</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife who is in the process of cutting down weight, as a sign of support.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to try this and dealt with cellulite for a long time, but I was desperate.</li>
            <li> That being said, some of us have it worse than others.</li>
            <li> As for me, I was one of the ones who had it worse.</li>
            <li> Not to be over dramatic, but if you have no confidence, it shows.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend is very insecure about her cellulite, but I honestly do not mind it at all.</li>
            <li> This is the cream that will actually help reduce that nasty cellulite and puckered areas.</li>
            <li> so you know that there are weird ingredients.</li>
            <li> wrong.</li>
            <li> So its really expensive to use</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this product at all.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, cellulite is a lot easier to get than to get rid of.</li>
            <li> I have lost a ton of weight after having my two babies and with weight loss (and gain, unfortunately)</li>
            <li> After losing 25 pounds I have been desperately looking for a solution to rid my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> When you apply this cream, it feels cold, has a smell that will fade away and the jar lasts about a month.</li>
            <li> I was desperate for a solution, so I tried this cream.</li>
            <li> .. :{</li>
            <li> feeling disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was just disappointed because I wanted to see some results like it spoke of.</li>
            <li> and it stinks !</li>
            <li> 100% disappointed.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any results :(</li>
            <li> Seriously, I hated wearing skirts because Blah, but,</li>
            <li> I am very very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Feels nasty and it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Absolutely disgusting.</li>
            <li> horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This cream didn&#x27;t do anything for my cellulite</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product that works wonders for cellulite! If you have tried others in the past, look no further. This is the cream that will actually help reduce that nasty cellulite and puckered areas. I like the fact that this cream has caffine in it because that is supposed to help constrict and reduce cellulite. In addition this is prduct is also made in the US so you know that there are weird ingredients. But of cousre regardless of all of that, you want the product to work! This actually does work! I have been using this for about a week and I can already see signs of reduced cellulite on the back of my legs. I haven&#x27;t had anything work this quickly and with such amazing results. It feels good and sort of cool on your skin and absorbs quicklys so its not grease or sticky. I am excited to see the end results once I get through the entire tub. It is pretty big size for the price! Overall, I have been really happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a product that will help reduce my cellulite. With working out and eating healthier, I still had residual cellulite. This cellulite cream help eliminate my unwanted cellulite and made my legs sexier. I used to be insecure wearing shorts because of my cellulite, but this definitely helped eliminate the problem. Great product!</li>
            <li> I really needed something to make my skin feel soft and lotion wasn&#x27;t doing the job. I decided to try out this cellulite cream and it has been a great decision. My rough parts of skin has now become soft and and it looks great. Perfect product.</li>
            <li> I got this cream as a gift for my mother and she absolutely adores it. She uses it every day as directed and she&#x27;s had some really great results after a few weeks. Her face is noticeably tighter and smoother and she says it feels fantastic. She&#x27;s happy and I&#x27;m really glad i got this cream for her!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two weeks now through a recommendation of a friend who bought it on Amazon, and I&#x27;ve seen some positive results so far.  I use it once a day in the evenings before going to bed, and after about two weeks I&#x27;ve been noticing that my skin looks smoother and I feel so much more comfortable in a bikini at the beach now.</li>
            <li> Puressant is a really nice cellulite cream for firmer and smooth skin. It works wonderfully after a spa body wrap. My cellulite has diminished by more than 90%  since the first time I&#x27;ve used this, which was three months ago.  I have tried two other products  but this one in particular is really great in minimizing my cellulite while firming up.  It is not greasy or &#x27;tacky&#x27; like some other creams.  It has a very nice scent that is subtle and fresh. The directions suggested it can be used twice a day. I only use once a day with great results. Great product!</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this cream within the first week of use. I found it difficult to resist feeling the complexion of my skin due to it being so smooth. Joking aside, this product eliminated close to all imperfections by the time I was around two-thirds of the way through the jar. By the time i was nearing the end, I had noticed that unsightly veins that made me appeared older had gone down. This makes me glad that i hadn&#x27;t gotten surgery for removing them, because this cream was a cheaper and less painful alternative. I would highly recommend this cream to anybody attempting to remove any gross skin blemishes.</li>
            <li> After using this for almost 6 weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed some results. My skin is definitely firmer and a bit of reduction of some of the cellulite on my thighs. I didn&#x27;t expect any miracles, but I&#x27;m am quite pleaded with this product.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin feel so soft and vibrant looking.  I really do like this. I have only been using it for 4 weeks and have already noticed some change.  Just what I need to keep me motivated on my weightlosss journey. No it doesn&#x27;t help you lose weight, but it makes my skin look tight and toned and I LOVE that!</li>
            <li> I am saddened to write this review. I had very high hopes for this product,  all reviews taken into consideration &amp; an Amazon best seller! There are pros....BUT serious cons.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: subtle scent, not overwhelming; &amp; did make smoother skin in about a week.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: after week 2, no further results; worst of all it made me break out in head to toe HOT, itchy, fire-like, random hives. A week and a half of searching for allergen triggers-mind you I am not a person that has ever had allergies over seasonal/occasional. And I have never had hives. With the help of my practitioner, we finally deduced it down to the application of this product. I have been on several prescribed medications over this past week for hives (urticaria) ...and prednisone,  benedryl and no avail. I got the hives to go away, before I figured this out, and then boom 2 days later I applied this product again, and hives...nearly instantly, all over the application areas.&lt;br /&gt;Please be advised when purchasing, even for folks who have never had these issues, as I am new to hives; I wouldn&#x27;t wish this misery on a worst enemy! BE AWARE of ingredients, any reactions or sensitivities you may have....and use in an inconspicuous area and have benedryl cream ready. I am so happy some have found a great product here, however, after 3 weeks of continued use, sadly I tossed nearly 3/4 a jar out. NOT worth it to me to continue suffering with this.</li>
            <li> I used some of my friends cellulite cream and I had to get some of my own. I&#x27;m hopeful that it will work fantastically.</li>
            <li> I have not used yet but believe it will help me with my belly buldge</li>
            <li> As much as I had hoped that the cellulite on my legs would go away when I lost weight, I had no such luck, even when I started to pack on more muscle. I tried everything: changing my diet, dry brushing, massage… I have to say, the one thing that really made a difference was this cream. I continued dry brushing (and my usual gallon of water a day), and the results were incredible on just the first application! Finally ready to show some leg at the beach.</li>
            <li> This product works extremely well! I was looking to reduce cellulite on some parts of my body, and this cream did it quickly and efficiently. It contains caffeine, retinol, and other herbal infusions to help repair the skin and keep it glowing. It reduce cellulite and firms up the skin. In addition, the skin looks slimmer. After using the product, I have seen a noticeable improvement in my skin. Obviously, the cellulite is mostly gone. But in addition, there is greater blood flow, and my skin is so much softer. It&#x27;s as if I&#x27;ve gone back 20 years in time! My skin looks so much healthier and more attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I highly recommend this product! It gets the job done and works efficiently. I have seen amazing results from using this product. It also comes at a great price, so one doesn&#x27;t need to break the bank to buy this cream. Thanks Puressant!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to see results.</li>
            <li> The cellulite cream has a nice smell and absorbs quickly. It makes my skin feel soft and tight.  I have also noticed a reduction in stretch marks on my upper thighs using this. While you will not lose weight from using it, you will notice that your skin is toned after using it for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I have recently lost a lot of weight (around 50 lbs. or so, yay me! lol) and I have been looking for a cream to help reduce some of the cellulite left on my body, especially in my waist area. I have been using this product for a few weeks now, and I&#x27;ve noticed some great results. The cellulite appears to be reducing in size and overall visibility. I&#x27;ve been impressed with this product, especially for the price point!</li>
            <li> My wife was looking for a cream to get rid of cellulite and that&#x27;s where one of my colleague recommended this product to me. This cellulite cream is equipped with caffeine and retinol, which plays a major role behind its effectiveness. It reduced the skin dimples on my wife&#x27;s face that were caused by cellulite within a short period of two weeks. She is highly impressed with the results. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this lotion! With summer fast approaching, I wanted to get a little boost to getting my bikini body ready. And this lotion definitly helped me and my body out so much! I already saw result after a couple of days! This product is absolutely the best in it&#x27;s category. If you are looking for a lotion like this, you have found the right one!</li>
            <li> I been using this cream for 3 days twice a day. It makes my skin really soft. The bottle is pretty small so you may need to buy more than 1 to see any results, also the bottle was&#x27;nt completely full.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, makes the skin soft… but I didn&#x27;t see so much improvement on my cellulites, since the container is small/medium size and if you use it every day it&#x27;s not going to last more than 3 weeks. I need more time to judge the quality of the product, but I am not buying again, it&#x27;s too expensive for only lasting 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.  It is a very effective cream that works to decrease fat deposits and water retention on the affected area which for me was mostly the area around my thighs and buttocks.&lt;br /&gt;I consistently applied the cream to all my affected areas and made sure I massaged it entirely into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I used the product twice daily and the best part was that it has a nice scent to it which made it very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Within a week my skin was smoother, firmer and healthier with definitely gained it&#x27;s elasticity back.  I was super excited with the dramatic reduction in the appearance of cellulite and I can’t wait to see the results after more time.&lt;br /&gt;The main products I&#x27;ve learned to look for in a great cellulite cream includes ingredients like retinol, which thickens and improves circulation in the skin; caffeine, which can reduce the size of the fat cells that cause cellulite; and alpha hydroxy acids, which improve the overall texture of skin by helping to rid it of dead cells&lt;br /&gt;Great product, buy it you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> With the new year, I have been trying to take better car of myself and loose weight.  It is no easy, but this Cellulite Reducing Cream has given me a little added encouragement as I see my thighs looking firmer and smoother.  I usually don&#x27;t like using creams and such for beautification, but this product has organic an herbal ingredients, which made me feel much more comfortable.  I like the scent of the cream and how easily it glides on my skin and is gradually making a difference.</li>
            <li> I love the Puressant products, especially this cellulite cream. It has helped with smoothing out my rear, haha. The retinol combination with the caffeine in my case smoothed out the visible cellulite so that it is not as noticable as it was before. For best results, this definetly needs to be used as directed. 2x a day every day rbreak downeally massaging it into the skin. I know that masassing itself helps to do wonders to cellulite, but this cream doubled with massag into the afflicted area showed results in less than a week. I am extremely satisfied with this cream :)</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I was a little embarrassed to wear shorts let alone a bathing suit. I know that I needed to do something. I was exercising but that wasn’t fixing the problem alone. I decided to try Puressat Cellulite Reducing Cream. I must say, this cream is awesome. After using this cream for a short time I noticed that my skin was much softer and firmer and craters in my cellulite became less visible. I really love this product and feel that it was well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! I have tried so many cellulite reducing creams that are either too oily, smelly, or just don&#x27;t work. This cream goes on so well and tightens up your skin making the cellulite completely disappear. I highly recommend this for anyone struggling with cellulite reduction remedies. This product is for you! Great price and so effective!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had bad cellulite on my legs for many years and was looking for a real solution. I decided to try this product and after a few weeks I saw some diminishing signs of cellulite. I also like how it feels, there was a small tingly feeling . Great product.</li>
            <li> I have used this for two weeks straight and I have not seen any results. Maybe its just me?</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother and she couldn&#x27;t be happier! She was always self conscious about doing things that would show off her legs, like wearing shorts or going to the beach, but now she&#x27;s a proud short wearing beach goer like the rest of us! And the best part is that she looks great! Her legs look smoother and the cellulite has all but disappeared! Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> This cellulite reduction cream works really well, I was skeptical at first because there are so many products that promise results like this. My skin felt softer and smoother within days. The appearance of cellulite in my legs and thighs really improved, just in time for bikini season. It has a pleasant scent, nothing too powerful or noticeable. I&#x27;m really looking forward to see more positive effects in the future.</li>
            <li> Sent it back too pricey</li>
            <li> This cellulite cream is so creamy and feels so good when you put it on your skin.  I have used it for about 2 weeks ad my stretch marks are almost invisible ad the cottage cheese look that some women get around their upper thigh area has smoothed out about 50%.  In just 2 weeks!!!&lt;br /&gt;Will continue using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with my sisters constant complaining of Cellulite for years now! So out of the kindness in my heart I helped her search for Cellulite reduction products online, and now I&#x27;m here! Her complaining has now stopped, so I am forever grateful for finding this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So basically what it does is firms the skin reducing the dimples or indents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, great product!</li>
            <li> Have used this product for several weeks, see no change what so ever!</li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife after her pregnancy and she&#x27;s been extremely pleased with the results. The product is smooth and worked very fast on her skin, mainly her legs (about 5 weeks - several parts of the body). I know she&#x27;s been testing some other products before, but none could compete with Puressant&#x27;s. Plus the price is very ok. Warmly recommended!</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife who is in the process of cutting down weight, as a sign of support. She has been using it for a month and has been giving me positive feedback. (Is that a hint for me?) She loves the fragrance and her skin has been firmer with the weight loss. Of course sufficient hydration and diet plays a key role as well. A great tool for anyone who is looking to reduce wight and cellulite.</li>
            <li> This cream really does the job!  All natural!  Just apply some in the morning and at night and voila... dimples disappear.  It takes about a week to see results.  This cream is as good as advertised.  5 stars for sure!!</li>
            <li> I’ve had difficulty with cellulite since I was 16 without even being over-weight those dimples on your thighs that every woman dreads were still there.  I have tried many cellulite creams in the past and they have done nothing but waste my money!  I can honestly say I love this product! After a couple weeks of faithful use, my skin looks smoother and less “hail damaged”!  It feels tighter to the touch as well, which I really appreciate, talk about a self-esteem boost!  I also forgot to mention that I have very sensitive skin and react badly to many things I try, and this works very well for me.  It’s smells nice and absorbs without a greasy residue.  Don’t hesitate!  It works!</li>
            <li> With summer fast approaching, I wanted to get a little boost to getting my bikini body ready. I found this and I am loving the results. I can see myself adding this to my regiment on a nightly basis. Feeling great</li>
            <li> Like most women, I find cellulite to be unsightly and embarrassing.  As you get older, even if you are reasonably fit and thin, you will still probably have cellulite.  So I was really happy, that after just a short time using this cream, I can see a visible reduction in cellulite.  Beyond my skin looking smoother, it also feels smoother and softer, another great benefit.  Strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> Works as intended. I don&#x27;t have any issues with this and it feels really great! I plan to buy more for the future. It has a smooth feeling and adds softness to my skin!</li>
            <li> As a mother of two, I have tried everything to get rid of the cellulite on the back of my thighs. I work out and eat healthy, but there were still those annoying, unsightly dimples! I tried Puressant Cellulite Reducing Cream and can&#x27;t believe the difference. After just a couple weeks of using it, my skin feels smoother and is very soft! The unsightly marks are decreasing by the day! I am so happy that I gave this cream a try and will continue to use it! Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> The feel and smell is very good, I have to wait for a while to update this review when I have noticed improvement on my skin. But for now all is good.</li>
            <li> I feel great! This cream is by far one of the best that I have ever tried! I absolutely love it. I recommend it for everyone who may be hesitant to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Even putting a little bit here and there seems to be doing the job. I&#x27;ve noticed some considerable difference after starting to use this product. I feel great about myself!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a month now and notice zero difference.  As far as I&#x27;m concerned it&#x27;s just an overpriced cream.</li>
            <li> None of these things work.</li>
            <li> This cream is going to help you regain elasticity of skin lost due to weight gain. It tones your skin, giving it a firm and youthful look. I have seen positive results from a close friend that used it and I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It simply works!&lt;br /&gt;I spent sooo much money on a lot of different and also a lot more expensive creams but never really had good results.&lt;br /&gt;This cream is totally worth the price and will make your body beautiful again. I saw the first results after around ten days so keep using it, it will make you or your wife/girlfriend sexyyy :)</li>
            <li> Everyone knows cellulite creams don&#x27;t really work but I just really wanted to prove &amp;#34;everyone&amp;#34; wrong. Nope, &amp;#34;everyone&amp;#34; is right. This cream works for nothing. Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I am going to be realistic here. This cream like every other cream out there is designed to REDUCE not eliminate cellulite. When you bare that in mind, you realize there is no &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; to this problem. It is a natural thing that happens in most women and some men. That being said, some of us have it worse than others. As for me, I was one of the ones who had it worse. Even thought I am not severely over weight, I sit a lot and years of sitting have lead my legs and butt to become more, well &amp;#34;dimpled&amp;#34;. Someone I speak with online recommended this cream and said she saw results in 2 weeks. I gave it one month. I didn&#x27;t look at my legs for this whole month other than day one, and day 30. I used it once a day so it can last me the whole month. On day 30 my legs looked like I stripped 10 years off of them and they felt and looked like my legs I had in my late teens! Yes, I still have cellulite but I can tell you, my skin looks damn good! It is almost like I airbrushed it off! I am hooked. I plan on using this on my sides as well as some people said it reduces stretchmarks. Ordering my second jar right now!</li>
            <li> Used the whole thing and noticed absolutely no difference.</li>
            <li> I recently received the cream but is too soon to provide actual results....Will update!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife to use. It has really tightened her skin and she couldn&#x27;t be happier! Thank you for an amazing product.</li>
            <li> Before I ordered this product I really wanted it to work.. unfortunately it did very little for me. Also, it last only 2 weeks if you use it twice a day.. So its really expensive to use.. :{</li>
            <li> After losing 25 pounds I have been desperately looking for a solution to rid my stretch marks. One of my really good friends had success with Purressant,  I just couldn&#x27;t find one that worked for me, but this cream is awesome!  After a few weeks I can tell the difference in my  gluteus maximus area.  I am still exercising and watching my diet, but I am hoping that I will be able to get rid of all of them after I finish the first bottle. After reading many of the other reviews and the ingredients I decided to try and I&#x27;m really glad I did.</li>
            <li> after weeks no results yet!</li>
            <li> I honestly see no difference in my skin then before I started using it. It didn&#x27;t diminish any mark and the Creme is  gone.):</li>
            <li> It worked for me! I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and I am pregnant and its definitely reduced my cellulite like magic!</li>
            <li> I have used several different products to reduce the appearance of cellulite. I&#x27;ve paid a lot more for many of the products. This one really is working. I&#x27;m using it in conjunction with the roller/massager and the two together are tightening up my skin and reducing the amount and size of the cellulite. The fragrance and the cooling action are a little offsetting at first but, after a day or two of use, I have become quite fond of both. I use it as recommended - morning and night. I use it mainly on my thighs, rear, and stomach. There are no miracle cures and I read up on how to reduce cellulite prior to starting anything. This is what is working for me: Cellulite Defense Cream by Body Merry along with the massage roller; massaging the cream into desired areas morning and night for a minimum of two to three minutes per body part; increase water intake; and interval cardio exercise designed to burn fat. Good luck. This is a fantastically priced product that works.</li>
            <li> I used this product everyday and it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cream. After initially using it for about a week, I couldn’t believe how soft and smooth my skin became. My skin seemed to be considerably healthier and obviously made a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on jar 4, I am hooked for life. If you’re looking for a cellulite reducing cream that actually works, this is the one to use. There is no question about it, this product firms and slims the skin. Beyond working incredibly, the price point is so much cheaper than most other cellulite reducing creams.&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, this is the best cellulite cream I’ve ever used (and I’ve used well over a dozen of others). The product works better than described, the price is unbelievably cheap, and works within no time.&lt;br /&gt;10/10 highly recommended to all! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great product, with awesome results. Have been using this for a couple weeks and I can see significant changes to my skin&#x27;s elasticity. It feels smoother and looks healthier. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see it doing all it promises.</li>
            <li> I have seen absolutely no difference? Would not recommend product</li>
            <li> Great stuff. I use morning and night and also wear a sweat belt during the day while at work! Every day I&#x27;m seeing a difference. Thanks!</li>
            <li> As a 36 year old mom lets just say I had some serious cellulite to deal with.  I have spent money on all kinds of creams and potions and to no avail.  After taking a year to get back in shape and shedding 60lbs, I looked awesome but my cellulite was horrendous.  My sister mentioned she had success with this product and thought I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived promptly in the mail and unlike other creams this had both retinol and caffeine which are essential in the reduction of cellulite.  This product within a very short amount of time started working and over the next few weeks I saw a drastic appearance of my thighs  My legs were firm looking and for once no cottage cheese legs.  This product is awesome.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this product for my wife and I could not be more pleased. She started using it and we could begin to see reduction in her cellulite from aging in only three weeks. Her legs also began to look and feel softer in only four days of repeated use. She&#x27;s told me how much better she feels now in her own skin. She has even tried using some on other areas of her body that look better as well. We will definitely be purchasing more soon.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this product at all.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing result oriented cellulite cream I have ever used.  Puressant has developed a revolutionary cellulite cream that actually works.  The cream is made with Retinol and caffeine, which gives it a distinctive difference to so many other cellulite creams on the market. After using this cream for two weeks it is evident that my stretch marks are clearly less noticeable as well my skin tone is smooth and even.  I see little traces of the cellulite that I did have on my thighs which is a good indication to me that this cream does indeed work. I wish I would have ordered more than one on my first order as this is something I will be using on a regular basis.  Highly recommend the Puressant cellulite cream.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine recommended this product, so i tried it out.PURESSANT&#x27;s Cellulite Reducing Cream and I am happy with it. It is non greasy when applied, unlike other creams.I found it very pleasant to use and will continue to use and report back further results.I really liked the smeel and it was so smooth on my skin..This product is absolutely amazing..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer.I received this great product at reduced price in exchange on my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Based on the glowing reviews I bought this and a cellulite massager.  After one full jar used on one leg so I could compare to the other leg, I see no difference what so ever.  There was no tingle as others reported and it just flat out did not work for me.  I had high hopes.  They were dashed.</li>
            <li> I used this for a month religiously and didn&#x27;t see a change.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have purchased and tried several different cellulite creams on Amazon and have found this one of the best I&#x27;ve tried. I use the product in the morning and at night and noticed a difference in my skin within about 2 weeks. My skin feels smoother and tighter in the areas that I apply the cream to and the scent is pleasant, which I can&#x27;t say for a few other creams on the market. I haven&#x27;t noticed any adverse effects from this at all. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It absorbs quickly and my legs feel smoother since I started using it.</li>
            <li> This has done nothing for me and I&#x27;m surprised that it is supposedly the most popular cellulite cream on Amazon. Really even plastic surgeons can only minimally change the appearance of cellulite, so it does not come as a surprise that this has not worked. I had bought another cream before this that seemed to improve the appearance temporarily, and I will probably go back to that. Either that or spend two thousand dollars or more to get minimal improvement from plastic surgery! One star for a product that did nothing whatsoever for me. And I used it faithfully.</li>
            <li> I first started using this cream off my sister who has been using it for quite some time herself, with very good results. I have now got my own supply as I have seen very positive results on myself. My legs look more toned towards the top. My routine is to exfoliate, then apply the cream in the morning and then again in the evening. Sometimes I also do a body wrap around the areas I put the cream on to keep more heat in. Also the price is just right for the quality you get, and I have already recommended this cream to all my best friends</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many cellulite creams and a friend recently told me about this one. I must say this actually does works. It really works to tighten my skins, making a more firmer appearance and therefore reduces the cellulite. A noticeable difference! I think this cream is awesome and have already restocked a few times. Thanks Puressant for making such a good product!</li>
            <li> Purchased this cream for my wife who is very self conscience of her appearance. After using the cream for a little over 2 weeks the results were clear. She loves this product, especially the price tag compared to other high end products that just don&#x27;t work. Works exactly as intended and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results, my wife&#x27;s mood dramatically improved and her skin looks amazing. Love it.</li>
            <li> On advice from a friend I tried this cellulite reducing cream and damn if it didn&#x27;t work! I have never been a big believer in all the creams and salves on the market and was surprised at how well it really works. I could see a difference within a few weeks and it has a bonus that it does not leave a greasy, or oily feel to it. I cannot recommend this enough it is worth the five stars</li>
            <li> I found no magic here.</li>
            <li> This body cream is the best I&#x27;ve found, and I&#x27;ve tried the &amp;#34;best!&amp;#34; I have found no other cream that gives me the results that I get with this one, it&#x27;s yummy texture is a pleasure to apply and the subtle scent is fine too. I won&#x27;t go without this one, I consider it a must-have in my travel kit and bathroom both.I see and feel the results immediately I&#x27;ve always trusted the Puressant Cellulite Cream and this performs beautifully. It gives me the confidence that I know I look my best!. Highly recommended to all.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, cellulite is a lot easier to get than to get rid of. Luckily, this cream knows what it&#x27;s doing. My legs and butt weren&#x27;t as tight as I wanted them to be, so I bought this to supplement my exercise. It did the trick. It doesn&#x27;t take the place of exercising, and you won&#x27;t look like you just took a dive in the fountain of youth, but it definitely makes a difference. It also isn&#x27;t oily like some of the other creams I used before, which is a huge plus for me because I hate the feeling of being oily. Overall, phenomenal product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a month now and I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable change in my skin. It&#x27;s tighter and smoother and has boosted my confidence! I&#x27;ll be ordering more of this product!</li>
            <li> As a 40 something woman who has experience being overweight, I have definite problems with cellulite.  I&#x27;ve tried several types of products designed to help reduce these problem areas and must say that Puressant is a winner.  It has a nice consistency and isn&#x27;t greasy.  I have seen visible reduction in dimpling in problem areas and overall skin tightening.  Definitely worth giving this cellulite cream a try.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 Jars of this cream and  I work out hard daily I saw no results at all , I did apply twice a day until both jars were empty. feeling disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love this product, because I’ve been using it still now and I already see a benefits..!!!! This cream works really very well. My friends suggest me for this cellulite cream. He used this cream and got benefits as a result i purchased this cellulite cream. Its work awesome And its price is so much reasonable. So I’ll more purchase this product for my friends.</li>
            <li> I actually started using this because my girlfriend had some and it worked wonders for her (yes, guys can use it too). Whether from weight or muscle gain (because I&#x27;ve gained some of both), I have some stretch marks on my arms that I wanted gone. I&#x27;ve been using this every day for a few weeks now and I am seeing results - I knew I would since it&#x27;s already worked great for my girlfriend, but it&#x27;s nice to see it work on me, too. I don&#x27;t have any cellulite, but it worked pretty well on hers and also works like a charm on stretch marks. We&#x27;re about to the bottom of her tub of it, so we&#x27;ll be getting some more soon. It isn&#x27;t sticky or oily like some lotions and makes your skin feel nice too.</li>
            <li> Over the last few years, I have had very unsightly cellulite building up on my legs. This has basically made shorts a no go for some time. This cream was recommended by a friend and it has been brilliant. Within a month I noticed a significant improvement and with continuous use I am actually able to feel comfortable in shorts again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall an excellent cream that really works. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a solution to cellulite.</li>
            <li> Works amazingly well. It has reduced my cellulite drastically. One of the best cellulite creams i have ever used. Highly recommend it to any one who has problems with cellulite.</li>
            <li> I really REALLY wanted to be able to write a good review for this, but I can not. After reading other peoples reviews I was so excited to try this. I am one of those people genetically doomed to have cellulite, I&#x27;ve had it since I was a kid even though I&#x27;ve always been normal to petite sized. I eat exceptionally well, work out consistently and lead a healthy life style in general but I still struggle with the curse of cellulite. That said, I was very excited to try this product. The jar is almost empty and I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s made one difference other than it&#x27;s definitely a great moisturizer. I saw no improvement what so ever using this. I am very very disappointed. All the other factors i.e. eating healthy and exercising are there, so this should have done the trick but sadly, it did not. I thought about ordering another jar just to see if extended use would make a difference but frankly, I don&#x27;t think it will and I don&#x27;t want to waste anymore money than I already have.</li>
            <li> Listen, I&#x27;m a thick girl. Being thick comes with cellulite  and stretch marks. Since I&#x27;m a Puressant Girl, I thought I&#x27;d try Cellulite cream. Honestly, what did I have to lose? Its been 6 weeks since I&#x27;ve started trying this cream. I am seeing marked improvement. The skin in my trouble areas has softened considerably.  The marks have begun to fade and I&#x27;m impressed. I&#x27;ve even gotten my sisters to try it.</li>
            <li> If I could take a bath in this product I would!!!</li>
            <li> nice cream have not noticed any significant changes yet but hopeful</li>
            <li> This product did not reduce the appearance of my moderate cellulite, note the quantity only last 2 weeks. I was just disappointed because I wanted to see some results like it spoke of. I found it to be light and no bad smell. It does need sometime to penetrate the skin before it dries and it caused a tingling sensation. I do dry brush ands use nylon gloves in the shower to excoriate... wish there was something that didn&#x27;t cost so much and truly would help. Cellulite gives me a complex</li>
            <li> I never really believed in cellulite creams, I have tried a few in the past with no luck and had written them off as a waste of money. My sister gave me a container of this cream to try out and I was completely shocked that it actually worked. I have been working out and eating right, and this cream was the perfect addition to get summer ready. I wish I had this product right after having my son, it’ll most certainly be included in any baby shower gifts I give!</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time. No damages and item was as described.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for shaping up that booty and thigh area. The Puressant Cellulite Cream will work deep into the skin cells and remove the fat that is storing in your thighs and butt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is basically a medium thick cream that goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a nice minty scent, and a cool soothing feeling once applied.&lt;br /&gt;However, most cellulite creams don&#x27;t carry the most important ingredients in high levels, Retinol and Caffeine. These two ingredients work hand in hand boosting your body&#x27;s ability to circulate the area, where applied and cause those fat cells to disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really do see a huge difference faster, than what most creams would do. I find myself using it right after a shower, and massaging it well into my skin. I feel a complete self-esteem boost and can go out with confidence!</li>
            <li> Perhaps one of the most effective creams I’ve ever seen in action, that’s what you get with this cellulite treatment lotion. I honestly got this for my wife, and while it was a hard sell at first, she is now a full believer. It took a few applications, and we started to see results take hold within a few days, then over time, it has completely rejuvenated her skin. Out of the many treatments we’ve tested, this has certainly been a great one. It’s natural, strong, and really does well for the skin without harsh irritants or chemicals that can burn. Results speak for themselves, recommended.</li>
            <li> Used whole container, noticed no difference. It goes on good and isn&#x27;t sticky or chalky but it&#x27;s extremely expensive , the container is tiny and I couldn&#x27;t tell you if it even worked, cause I&#x27;ve still got cellulite.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really do anything. maybe the problem is that i don&#x27;t really have much cellulite- the only time you can see it is if its compressed like when i cross my legs. i applied this cream twice daily and massaged it in but i didn&#x27;t notice any difference. maybe it only works for more obvious cases.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all!  Save your money!</li>
            <li> I have bought a punch of cellulite cremes and some of them work better than others, but the key is to keep on using it. Massage it in and if you can use one of those waist trimmers around your thigh with the cream. It will work better. You ca use kitchen plastic as well, but I like the extra heat I get from the waist trimmer. When you apply this cream, it feels cold, has a smell that will fade away and the jar lasts about a month. I have seen some improvement, but people who think this is the magic cure - wake up! If there would be a true magic cream for cellulite removal (hint! not reduction) you would not see the Hollywood celebrities on the beach with cellulite!!! You can understand that people, who can have anything in the world, can not get rid of this orange peel for good. But they can reduce the appearance. And this cream works well for that over time and constant usage. I am thankful to Puressant for providing me this cream for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Creamy off-white lotion treatment reduces cellulite.  I&#x27;ve tried the one from Bath and Body Works that is the same price.  So far this one works a bit better. You can see a gradual change in cellulite when applying it everyday.  It helps firm the skin and gives a smoother appearance.  For those looking for extreme changes there is not a product out there that is going to give it to you for $20.  This product is best for those that just want to smooth those thighs(or other body parts) and make small noticeable reductions.</li>
            <li> Getting cellulite in your mid 20s after having two kids is REALLY embarrassing. I tried a couple of drugstore creams but nothing worked, no matter how much money I spent. One of my friends recommended this cream that she ordered from Amazon, and while I usually prefer to buy these types of products in person, I decided to try it anyways. Well I am SO glad I did! I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and I&#x27;m already seeing a difference. I&#x27;m really excited about getting my slim, firm legs back in time for bathing suit season! I will definitely be buying more, and recommending it to all my mama friends. Thanks Puressant, you saved me!</li>
            <li> I used as described and saw no changes.  It makes my skin soft but so does lotion.  Also, if you &amp;#34;apply a generous amount&amp;#34; 1-2x daily this container will only last 1-2 weeks at best.  Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> My lovely wife had cellulite on her legs and backside, and she felt horribly self-conscious about it for a long time. She would hesitate to wear a bikini, or shorts, or even a shorter skirt, for fear of judgment. I tried to convince her that it wasn&#x27;t a problem, but eventually decided I had to help  her fix it -- I tried several other products, spending literally hundreds of dollars in total, and nothing proved sufficient, until I came across this. Now, I wish I would have found it right away, because the results have been so incredible. She looks, and feels, so great. I&#x27;m eternally grateful for Puressant and their amazing cream!</li>
            <li> This is a product to invest in if you have plenty of time to wait for the effects. I wouldn&#x27;t&#x27;;t buy it as a last minute thing if you are planning on going away for vacation the same week. Give this product at least a month and you see great results. First off I like how light-weight and scent free this cream is. After finishing my whole jar my stretch marks are no longer raised and the ones that are left are minuet.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it does a fantastic job of smoothing &amp; my skin always feels so soft after having applied in the morning before bed. &amp; i noticed a significant reduction in cellulite after my first week of using the product. &amp; i just got it for free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several cellulite products over the years, however, this is only product that is working for me. I was searching for a product and stumbled onto this one. And, I was very interested in the reviews. Thank you, Puressant! In the evening, I apply after shower and massage in on my problem areas. Just a few minutes for each thigh and use the dry brushing technique, massaging/stroking upward toward heart (for lymphatic system). only takes a few minutes per thigh. On day three, I noticed that my skin wasn&#x27;t as dry and felt tighter (no way I thought) but after approximately 2 weeks I started noticing that my skin was not only tighter but smoother. I will not question the results. I&#x27;m amazed. No product I&#x27;ve used in past has EVER produced results this quickly. Or produced results...period! I find the menthol quite pleasant and it tingles and dissipates within 30 minutes or so. I ordered some more for myself and also decided to get some for my sister, mother in law, and sister in law as gifts! I will let you know how it works for them as well! I am so lucky to have received this product for my review.</li>
            <li> I am posting this review on behalf of my wife, she&#x27;s been using this product for one month and even I can tell the particular difference. Those weight acquired signs are gone and she looks like she&#x27;s back to being a teen, really. Availability is definitely an issue because of its popularity so it must be ordered while it is in stock. My wife wanted a cream to reduce cellulite, and one of my friends recommended this supplement to her. This dimply skin cream provides you with caffeine and retinol, which plays a major role in its effectiveness. It reduced the skin dimples on my wife&#x27;s face within 14 days.. She is very impressed with the results. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I really like that this is fragrance free! It seems to be a good formula and even after just a couple days skin seems to be smoothing out. I am going to have to pay closer attention. I am using it in conjunction with a derma roller that I have to hopefully expedite the results! Great that it is made in the US, and that there is a money back guarantee! Looking forward to even more results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller was great! Super fast shipping, got mine in TWO DAYS with Prime! Thank you! :)</li>
            <li> Not all treatments are made equal, but this Cellulite Reducing Cream is a miracle! I got stubborn cellulite in my tummy and I honestly tried some cream but didn&#x27;t work out. Until one day I found this product, all natural and safe to use even if you got a sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve been using this for a week now and I could see the immediate results (please see the before and after result photo). They are not completely gone but like I said you could easily see the difference. My skin is very soft and moisturized, and possibly I see a slight reduction in cellulite. I believe my skin surface is firmer, and reduced the visibility of the cellulite with the continuous application. I would also suggest to use it as your regular lotion after shower and before bedtime, it&#x27;s not sticky even if your sweating in hot days. I love this and 2 thumbs up!!! I got this product for FREE in a exchange of honest review</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but no cream will help. I got strawberry Lipo and never looked back.</li>
            <li> I saw this on Dr Oz, , so I bought a jar and saw some results, so  I just bought another 2  jars!!  It really works !!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any results .</li>
            <li> Been using for four days now, it makes my skin soft and I can also fill the firmness of it..I take a hot bath before I apply so that my pores are open and hopes that it&#x27;ll work even better</li>
            <li> I love this cream! It has reduce the appearance of cellulite on my legs. On day 4 is when I started noticing the difference. The cream itself is very light and rubs into the skin very well. It has a nice scent too. I did receive it to review.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waist your money.  Not a slightly difference noticed after finishing the jar, and I have very little cellulite. Do not know how it got all the best cream ever reviews</li>
            <li> Nice product with attendant skin softening and vibrant looking.I have only been used it for a couple of weeks and the change on my skin is really remarkable.Little application of this product results in wide range of results.It has a nice pleasant light scent. It is a reasonable sized jar for the price.I recommend it to all.</li>
            <li> Have not seen any even slightest difference but have not finished the jar yet so maybe…………..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But do not expect to re-order this product.</li>
            <li> As one of those rare men who suffers from cellulite, I felt a little embarrassed to have this in my cabinet. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month in a half after searching for solutions to this problem now that beach season is approaching, and after meticulously looking through lots of individual ingredients that supposedly work, I found this cream which includes all of them (principally caffeine and retinol). My cellulite in turn has become markedly reduced (on my rear  end and arms), and this impressive difference has increased my self-esteem by huge margins.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any side effects and applying it is a breeze.  I would definitely recommend this product, especially now that it&#x27;s on sale.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money... I regret buying this..Doesn&#x27;t do anything and it stinks !</li>
            <li> My wife had purchased this cream a few weeks ago. Since she has started using it, I can notice a big difference in her skin around her hips where she had some minor stretch marks. Her skin is extra soft now and I can visually notice reduction in stretch marks as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> This cellulite cream saved me!&lt;br /&gt;After my first pregnancy, I felt so uncomfortable about my extra pounds and infirm skin around stomach area... However, this cream actually worked very well for me!&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for 2 weeks already, 2 times a day, and I can see the change!&lt;br /&gt;My cellulite&#x27;s reduced significantly, and I&#x27;m buying another jar for sure!</li>
            <li> Several years ago I lost 75 pounds after being overweight all my life.  I look and feel much better after the weight loss but I have a lot of stretch marks and cellulite dimples especially around my mid section.  I have been using Puressant&#x27;s Cellulite Reducing Cream on my mid section for a few weeks now and have noticed that my stretch marks and dimples are starting to fade.  My skin there is also becoming firmer and feels younger.  This product works and is great!</li>
            <li> Waste of money... Feels nasty and it doesn&#x27;t work. Just massage the area with lotion and you&#x27;ll get better results</li>
            <li> i still have it i tryed somthing else</li>
            <li> This is a great stuff. I have tried a lot of products for cellulite, but none of them worked for me. This is the perfect for me, reduces cellulite&lt;br /&gt;and makes my skin smoother &amp; Skin looks like shinny after using this. This is a unique &amp; gorgeous product. This one of the best cellular&lt;br /&gt;cream i ever used. Skin become smother and cleaner. The Price of the cream is reasonable. I really love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this cream! I just turned 30, and I noticed a few days ago that my legs are starting to look a little jiggly. Upon closer look, I realized that I have the beginnings of cellulite! I was desperate for a solution, so I tried this cream. It works REALLY well! I feel like it firms and smooths my skin, and my legs are looking much better nowadays. highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have seen definite improvement since using this product.  My problem area is my thighs and upper arms.  I use this daily, and with time I have seen improvement. Smoother skin and less cottage cheese!</li>
            <li> Did not meet expectations</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with the results of this cream. I like the way it feels on my skin. It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or sticky residue. The skin absorbs the cream naturally and within days I began to notice some improvement. I could feel the product working and my skin was feeling firmer while remaining soft and smooth on the exterior. The product smells clean and feels fresh. I have also began using it on some stretch marks which seems to be helping to repair the skin in those areas. The ingredients are safe and do not irritate my skin at all. Five stars for its quality, ingredients and effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a little under a week now - not long enough to see dramatic results, but long enough to see some.&lt;br /&gt;This of course isn&#x27;t some magic wonder cream that will just make all your cellulite disappear, but it will definitely help in reducing it. The smell is somewhat strong at first, but you get used to it... plus it doesn&#x27;t last very long. The cream itself is rather cold when you first apply it and it feels wonderfully refreshing, especially on a hot summer day.&lt;br /&gt;I apply it twice a day - in the morning and evening after my shower, then wait about 5-10 minutes for it to sink in. It soaks up pretty quick and there&#x27;s no long waiting around for it to dry before being able to get dressed.&lt;br /&gt;The combination of the coolness and the caffeine makes it feel kind of tingly when you apply it, which isn&#x27;t bad though, and you get used to the feeling in no time. After a while it actually feels nice and refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review and opinion.</li>
            <li> When I received my cellulite cream in the mail.... The seal was completely opened and looked as though someone used it and returned it and then I ended up getting it</li>
            <li> How do you compare the hundreds of skin care products? As a regular tester, I&#x27;ve arrived at a list of key considerations. I hope these are helpful to you!&lt;br /&gt;~ Fragrance: Lotiony. None added.&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel during application: Smooth, like a light moisture lotion. Cream is light yellow.&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel after absorption: Smooth, almost powdery, moisturized, no unpleasant film.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it best for a certain skin type?: Probably okay for all.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it tested on animals?: No.&lt;br /&gt;~ Packaging: 4oz plastic wide mouth jar with screw on lid.&lt;br /&gt;~ Immediate cosmetic effects:* It leaves skin nice and soft.&lt;br /&gt;~ Potential long-term effectiveness:* I’m not sold on the idea that a skin cream can treat subdermal fat. But you can make skin tighter and firmer and better conditioned so as to hide the cellulite. This cream might help do that with its retinol and caffeine, and it’s got enough stuff that’s nice for the skin like shea butter, allantoin, aloe and oils that it’d be worth using even if it didn’t help your cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Know the difference between cosmetic and long-term effects: Cosmetic effects are immediate and only present when the product has been applied recently - just like makeup. Long-term effects take longer to see and should remain when you stop using the product (but don&#x27;t when you find something effective - your skin needs continuing support). The ideal product would be both cosmetically and long-term effective, but it&#x27;s more realistic to expect a formula to tilt towards one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so. My aim is to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend is very insecure about her cellulite, but I honestly do not mind it at all. Even though I was reluctant to even want to try the cream, I have noticed that her skin is firmer. She is extremely satisfied with the results of the cream and seeing her happy is all I could ask for. The cream takes some time, but according to my girlfriend the use of a cream is completely worth the delay between the first application and results.</li>
            <li> I used this after I had my second son. My skin was a bit &amp;#34;flabby&amp;#34; around my stomach area. After a couple of week&#x27;s use, even without exercise and consistent use,  I noticed a HUGE difference! My stomach became more toned and I am committed by it everyday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks and have definitely noticed my skin is smoother and firmer. I&#x27;ve suffered with very dimpled and loose skin after a big weight gain and then dramatic weight loss so I decided to try this out. It was kind of a reward to myself for loosing over 50 pounds in the last year. I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve seen results and will order more as I continue to loose weight.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have purchased and tried several different cellulite creams on Amazon and have found this one to be the one that I get the best results from.  I use the product in the morning and at night and notice a difference in my skin within about 1-2 weeks of use.  My skin feels much smoother and tighter in the areas that I apply the cream to and the scent is pleasant, which I can&#x27;t say for a few other creams on the market.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any adverse effects from this at all. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product my wife started using and I have to personally say it shows a difference. I work in the industry so I personally know that this is one of the best creams for cellulite out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the few products that actually does what it&#x27;s supposed to and definitely not a waste. It has done wonders for my wife and you won&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend getting this if you are trying to get rid of cellulite and want it gone fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife is definitely satisfied and I&#x27;m grateful she got it!</li>
            <li> I just started using it, so can&#x27;t tell you</li>
            <li> As part of her overall diet &amp; exercise plan, my girl says this cellulite cream has helped her firm up the skin on back of her legs and and arms. I don&#x27;t  think she had any issues to start with but if she happy about it that&#x27;s what matter. She&#x27;s tried other creams and lotions that are twice the price only to be disappointed. I got this on a whim and and turned out to be a great move. She uses it sparingly and I&#x27;ll happily get her a new jar as needed.</li>
            <li> I went on a strict exercise and diet regimen and lost nearly 100 pounds.  While I looked and felt much better, I did have an embarrassing problem of stretch marks around my shoulders, waist, and buttocks.  I did a search online for stretch mark cream and this product came up.  At first, I thought that it had to be a search engine mistake, but as I read on, many people said that this product worked for stretch marks as well.  So, I gave it a try and I was pleasantly surprised.  I did not have overnight results but after a 2 weeks there was a noticeable difference and not that I am on my 3rd jar, the stretch marks are still there, but are barely noticeable.  I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I got this mainly for use in my legs and I&#x27;m beginning to see some progress.  I&#x27;ve been beginning to see more aging in my legs and they don&#x27;t appear as toned as they used to be.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now and I do feel more tightening of my skin as opposed to before and the dimples I used to see seem to be lessening in size.  Although I bought this for use on my legs, I feel like I should start using it on my upper body as a preventive cream to avoid cellulite in the future.</li>
            <li> I, like most other women across America, have experienced an increasing amount of cellulite as I&#x27;ve aged. I&#x27;ve also had to deal with unflattering stretch marks and other blemishes that I just couldn&#x27;t get rid of. Some of my friends had been having success with various cellulite creams, but I just couldn&#x27;t find one that worked for me. Then, I tried this one by Puressant. It won&#x27;t make all of your problems go away, but I feel and look so much younger than I did before it. It&#x27;s easy to use, and I haven&#x27;t faced any problems like rashes or uncomfortable itchiness. It&#x27;s the perfect cellulite cream for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I&#x27;m an impatient person. I don&#x27;t like to wait for things, and that includes when I&#x27;m dealing with creams or other medicinal items. If it doesn&#x27;t show real results quickly, it might as well not even work at all in my mind. But with this product, I saw results in only a few weeks. My skin is firmer, bouncier, and appears to be much healthier and vibrant. I wasn&#x27;t really expecting the physical changes in my body to help me out in other ways too. I&#x27;ve been much more confident and have felt much better about myself. I even went digging through my closet adn found things I could now feel comfortable wearing again. The caffeine in the product is very helpful, and not always found in cellulite creams. I&#x27;ve found it very beneficial in firming up my cellulite patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are struggling with cellulite, stretch marks, or other blemishes, I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough. It&#x27;s simple, effective, and incredibly fairly priced. Though it won&#x27;t completely rid you of cellulite troubles, it severely lessens the problem. So if you are wanting to look younger by having firmer, more attractive skin, try this product and you&#x27;ll be looking younger in as little as a month.</li>
            <li> So I recently gained a little bit of weight. Not too much and nothing too drastic but it made my cellulite show more than before. I didn&#x27;t mind gaining weight but cellulite showing so obviously I did not like at all. I decided to look into creams to try out and bought one at my local drugstore which turned out to be a complete waste. I then came across this cream and decided to give it a go. It has worked out wonderfully for me. In a week I started noticing smoother skin and with every week it was getting better and better. I love how my thighs look now! I&#x27;m glad I found this cream in time for summer. I highly recommend it for anyone to try, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> This product has totally changed my view on creams that help fight skin blemishes and cellulite. Usually they don&#x27;t work, but this product has changed my skin for the better! Within a short period of time after applying the cream consistently for a couple of days, I&#x27;m already seeing positive results! Besides being a very effective cream, this product is fairly priced! Thank you for this life changing product!</li>
            <li> Great...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Amazing stuff! I was skeptical to try this and dealt with cellulite for a long time, but I was desperate. I finally  decided to give it a try after my friend recommended it. Along with a healthy diet and exercise, this product seems to be doing the trick! The combination of powerful ingredients seem to really be making a difference. I have been very happy so far with this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Cellulite can really ruin your life. Not to be over dramatic, but if you have no confidence, it shows. People can tell. It can keep you from being the person you want to be. So you&#x27;ve decided to do something about it. Great. But what? Well, if you&#x27;re like me... research! Maybe you ask some friends or family that are close to you if they know any remedies. Myself, I go straight to Google. The first few things I found for treating cellulite were caffeine and retinol. And what do you know? I stumble upon this cream by Puressant that market those as it&#x27;s main ingredients. It was meant to be.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything really. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I got this product couple of weeks ago with the referral of my friends. I found some changes after using this product with my skin problem. The most effective elements of this product, the Organic Herbal Infusion, Organic Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera), Isopropyl Palmitate (Palm Oil), Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Caffeine, Organic Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower Oil), PAcrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, (2s)-2-Amino-5-Guanidinopentanoic Acid and so on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product becasue it has no side-effects on your skin as well. Accordeing it&#x27;s description, I&#x27;ve got everithing. Recommending!</li>
            <li> I have struggled with Cellulite for awhile now. It&#x27;s annoying, and it makes me very self-conscious. I haven&#x27;t gone swimming in years because I&#x27;m embarrassed about the cellulite on my upper legs. I hate that having cellulite kept me from doing something I love. That&#x27;s why I decided to stop letting the cellulite win! I got this product, hoping to see results, and I did! It was gradual, but over the course of using this cream my cellulite is pretty much disappeared! With my cellulite gone, I&#x27;m so much more confident, and I even purchased a swim suit, and plan to go swimming this weekend! I honestly didn&#x27;t know what to expect, never having used any product like this is the past, but this has definitely surpassed my expectations!</li>
            <li> In my 20s I was in great shape. In my 30s that shape started to be round. Working on it the roundness is dropping but the stretch marks hadn&#x27;t. Going off of reviews I figured I would give this one a try and I&amp;#34;m glad I did! Well, after using this the stretch marks are fading away just as the fat has from working out. I have to say I am quite surprised with how amazing of a job this has done on helping remove them!</li>
            <li> I am really satisfied with this product. In fact, this is the best anti cellulite product that has really helped my skin to look tight and smooth and thanks to it, I feel much more confident. Overall, great product that really work for me &amp; I recommend it to everyone who is struggling with cellulite.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this cream! It&#x27;s so hard to get a hold of these days because it&#x27;s always sold out! So if you see this in stock you better get it while you can Lol. I have lost a ton of weight after having my two babies and with weight loss (and gain, unfortunately) your skin, especially MY skin went to hell and back. I am pleased to say that this cream WORKS. I stuck with this cream because all my friends raved about it and I researched different products like crazy... and this one was the winner. Boy am I glad, my skin feels smooth and the imperfections have diminished. I am one happy customer! I don&#x27;t feel as self conscious these days and I have this amazing company to thank for that. Thank you!! Will continue to purchase this awesome cream!</li>
            <li> I bought this cream to help get my stomach back in pre-baby form. I am at my pre-pregnancy weight but found my stomach, while flat, needed to recover more tautness. I&#x27;ve been using it for a while and it seems to be working. It also moisturizes my skin and makes it super soft.</li>
            <li> This Cellulite Cream with caffeine and retinol has worked well for my daughter over the last 4 months or so. I came to order me some after seeing a visible difference in her problem areas, mostly her thighs. I can’t believe it’s sold out! When I told her she was just as upset as I was since she will want to reorder someday soon also. She told me it wasn’t like you can see a difference in a few days, but she’s definitely made a believer out of me. Her being a nurse, said that it’s like anything else, you have to stick with it. I think it has a pleasant smell with it also. I’ve tried a couple different things for cellulite in the paste and one of them smelled so bad I wouldn’t even put it on me. I sure hope it’s available soon.</li>
            <li> I used it with Topnotch Cellulite Massager but in my case I didn&#x27;t notice any beneficial effect.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Usually people use over the counter cosmetic creams to treat cellulite. Of course not all of them are effective but I found“Cellulite with Retinal &amp; Caffeine and Body Firming Cream”  effective. I applied it twice daily by massage to help improve circulation and combined with products that help circulation and activate venous return.It has a nice and non-offensive smell and absorbs easily without greasy, sticky or oily feeling. I feel my skin in those areas which I applied looks firmer, taut, tighter and smoother.  I notice how it help reducing of cellulite and unwanted bumps and lumps especially when you combine it with massage! Feels very cool!</li>
            <li> Oh god, I&#x27;m buying this baby in bulks. Okay, so yeah, first bottle in and I can already see the difference on my thighs, and the back of my legs. Seriously, I hated wearing skirts because Blah, but, yeah, now the cellulite is less visible. I mean, it&#x27;s not all gone, but for just one bottle, it&#x27;s amazing. Used the bottle up in like 2 1/2 weeks, hope that gives you a good time frame. I&#x27;ll keep using and posting updates on how it goes for me. Super excited. Peace.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of products for cellulite, but none of them worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;This is the perfect for me, reduces cellulite and makes my skin smoother.</li>
            <li> Really this is a best seller !!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with some of the stubborn cellulite I had after the birth of my daughter.  I lost most of my baby weight quickly, but my skin just wasn&#x27;t quite the same.  I had cellulite around my hips and thighs that had never been there before.  This cream helped to get rid of that stubborn stuff and get me feeling like my old self again.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Since reaching our 30&#x27;s, my wife and I both noticed we were starting develop some cellulite around or thighs so we found this cream and tried it. I have heard tremendously great things about the retinol chemical and so we decided to try this. We have both been using it for a while now and we see why retinol truly is the fountain of youth drug. My wife is working out and doing everything right so I don&#x27;t know if that helped with her skin as well but she now swears by this cream. As a man it may seem a little silly for me to use it but we are both seeing the results and we love it. Maybe we just have a great fighting chance because we are in our 30&#x27;s but I like to believe it is all due to this cream mostly. This is a definite fast acting cream in the short time we have used it and my wife has been telling her friends about it like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I you are considering a cellulite cream you should seriously consider this one first, I can truly see the difference.</li>
            <li> It is below my expectation</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I decided to try the Puressant Cellulite Reducing Cream. I can enthusiastically report that my skin feels both softer and firmer! Sometimes, we have to suspend judgement and go with our intuition. I am so glad that I decided to trust and treat myself with this delicious cream. I can’t wait to see what other positive results that I’ll get from this wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Its about two weeks I am using the cream no results as yet. I think I need at least three containers to see results.</li>
            <li> Saw this on Dr. Oz.  I have now tried 3 things I have seen on his show and none of them have made the slightest improvement.  I am done with Dr. Oz.  I used the brush and this cream in combination 2 x a day for a month and saw no improvement.  I am a skinny person who happens to have cellulite on the back side for some reason.  I am 5&#x27; 6&amp;#34; 123 lbs and I eat very healthy and stay very hydrated so I guess there are some things you just can&#x27;t fix regardless of exercise or diet.  Must be genetic, although I&#x27;ve never seen my mom or dad&#x27;s back side.</li>
            <li> It has no scent at all it was runny and I felt no sensation when applied but I just started to use it I hope I get results</li>
            <li> Cellulite has always been a problem for me: I suffered from it even when I was young and I have never succeeded to heal completely.&lt;br /&gt;I tried various remedies, also quite expensive, but no one seemed to have an effect on me, in fact, for a period of time I stopped taking care and obviously the situation has worsened. Some time ago I heard for the first time of this cream, I was initially skeptical about it, but I decided to try the same, having read many positive opinions and having the confidence to be refunded.&lt;br /&gt;And I changed my mind! In a few weeks I saw a visible improvement in my skin, finding it more toned and elastic, as if I was&lt;br /&gt;twenty again. I hope to get to completely solve my problem, and it&#x27;s sure I will not stop using this product.</li>
            <li> I see no difference it doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> I would give this less than 1 star if I could. The product I received came with the &amp;#34;for my protection&amp;#34; seal off, and clearly it had been used and returned as 1/4 of it was gone already. Absolutely disgusting. I don&#x27;t want to put something on my body that has had someone else&#x27;s germy fingers in it. Completely unsanitary. 100% disappointed.</li>
            <li> The best cream!!!! I have ever used love the smell dries up quickly  on my second container I seen a big difference I use after my morning shower and after a good work out at night  seen lots of improvement in midsection abdomen  arms iner legs and O.M.G. loveee adicted to this cream</li>
            <li> horrible. Nothing was change ,I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom who is self conscious about the way she looks. The cream does not work right away -- you have to use it routinely. With persistent use this cream did reduce my moms cellulite. I recommend this to customers with the ability to stick to a regimen.</li>
            <li> Was facing some post babies, over 30 cellulite  - not horrible, but noticeable and not going away with our workout and diet. After about 5 weeks of using, I can&#x27;t tell a difference, but there is a noticeable difference in the before and after photos. Nice that the smell is not over bearing, very subtle. Smooth texture cream, little goes a long way. One container has lasted me 5 weeks and looks like a have a couple more left. About once a week I mix with coffee grounds for exfoliation and because I heard it works.</li>
            <li> Cellulite I guess is something that hits us all regardless of your age. I mean I am just about to turn 30 and I already see cellulite where I previously never thought of seeing them. Anyways, this is my third cream in as many months, I guess I am a bit impatient with results. Actually I purchased two more from my local beautician because she said they would give me quick results - lessons learnt there. Puressant had a lot of good reviews here, I believe over 100 and most said it starts showing softening of skin in a few days and results become obvious in couple of weeks. That was what sold me and I headed over to my beautician who had a bottle that she wasn&#x27;t using, rather she purchased to try it out. Got her to part ways with it and here I am ogling over it. Ordering up two bottles together, so that should speak volumes of Puressant&#x27;s cellulite cream. This impatient late 20s cellulite scared individual is still impatient but no longer cellulite afraid.</li>
            <li> Was excited to know that there is a possibility to be able to rid my body of any cellulite. I stumbled upon this product while doing several searches and decided to buy it. Now I have no need to even look at costly operations when I can do it myself at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> I can’t say anything but positive feedback for this cream.  The market is saturated with phony products, and I must admit to having tried a few throughout the years.  However, none works nearly as well as this cream.  I’ve been using it for a few weeks and I already see vast improvements in my skin tone, even where I’ve had stretch marks for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this cream for a few short days, but I already see a difference. It has a pleasant, non-offensive smell. I will update this review after I&#x27;ve used it awhile longer. At this point, I do recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;m going to Hawaii in a couple weeks, and it&#x27;s dramatically reduced my cellulite on the back of my legs. It worked very well for me.</li>
            <li> Seem to be working pretty good.</li>
            <li> Oh my god. This cellulite cream is fricken amazing! I used to buy the one from bath and body works but they discontinued it. This one is cheaper, bigger, and not as oily. I have been using it for about 3 weeks now on the back of my thighs and already see a huge difference!!! I am hoping that within two months, the cellulite will be very minimal. I will definitely update!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any results :(</li>
            <li> Cellulite is pesky and plagues literally everyone, but thankfully this cream does its part to help. With regular use, the cream will soften the look of problem areas and decrease the appearance of stretch marks. You can really feel the caffeine tightening the skin! I also like that this cream has little to no fragrance -- no one will know your secret to perfect legs! I highly recommend this effective cream!</li>
