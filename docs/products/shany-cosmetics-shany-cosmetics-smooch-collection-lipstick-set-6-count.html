            <li>I am becoming to love the Shany products more and more.</li>
            <li>The colors are awesome and they do stay for long.</li>
            <li>They are to bright for lipstick and fade really fast.</li>
            <li>Off really easy too.</li>
            <li>It comes with easy to bring with you in your purse</li>
            <li>I liked the colours very much in this set.</li>
            <li>The color lasts about 4 hours, which is fine with me.</li>
            <li>I love wearing vibrant, powerful colors and thought this product would be a good way to try a variety of lipsticks.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly, and was pleasantly pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m honestly quite suprised with all these positive reviews.</li>
            <li>The lipsticks are creamy and smooth.</li>
            <li>I know they enjoy</li>
            <li>Cheaply made.</li>
            <li>but you&#x27;ll enjoy ALL.</li>
            <li>..not smooth at all.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t last forever, but the price is great</li>
            <li>advise everyone Bsthaddamh Genuine First, because he was sure of it</li>
            <li>Slim case was perfect for small purse.</li>
            <li>Colors received were all a bright orange, thought this showed multiple colors.</li>
            <li>The gold top parts popped off easily but I fixed that with superglue.</li>
            <li>Good for little cute go-to lip color options.</li>
            <li>Luckily it wasn&#x27;t ruined.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for bold, neon like colors then this is for you.</li>
            <li>it shipped very fast!</li>
            <li>I was really excited about these, but aside from durability, the color is pretty muted and almost goes on like a crayon might.</li>
            <li>And the lipstick tubes were very... cheap.</li>
            <li>Great for everyday use or a night on the town..</li>
            <li>All of these problems weren&#x27;t worth 16 bucks plus tax.</li>
            <li>The colors are overall very nice, and light feeling, so I don&#x27;t necessarily regret buying them.</li>
            <li>Lesson learned but served my purpose fine for a decent price.</li>
            <li>So smooth and doesnt feel like normal lipstick.</li>
            <li>The colors are nice and I bought this mainly to experiment with color before spending a lot on individual lipsticks.</li>
            <li>, it last a long time, it feels great, doesn&#x27;t feather, it&#x27;s super pigmented and pretty much</li>
            <li>The only downside is that the lipstick containers are a little cheap feeling, and the gold pieces at the bottom fall off, but it was a great deal for all the colours and you can always glue the gold parts back on :)</li>
            <li>DID FIND THE COLORS TO BE PRETTY PIGMENTED&lt;</li>
            <li>They were rather chalky when I first applied these lipsticks, but after I applied them a second time, they were much more creamy.</li>
            <li>Each lipstick case was already falling apart when I tried to take then out for the first time to use them.</li>
            <li>The only reason I am giving this 4 stars is because the top part of the lipstick casing keeps popping off</li>
            <li>: For extended staying power, try applying chapstick first</li>
            <li>Pretty colors, but the caps will not stay on.  </li>
            <li>Fell apart first day</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this especially since it is animal torture free! :)</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind bringing back the &amp;#34;1980s lipstick style&amp;#34; then go for it, for example, if you&#x27;re wearing an orange top</li>
            <li>the color variety is really pretty</li>
            <li>I planned on buying both but wanted the second first because more colors matched my skin/ hair type.</li>
            <li>you get more than your monies worth and no where else will you buy such high quality at such a low price...and the Free Samples are to die for!</li>
            <li>The colors are very subtle but beautiful.</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant and wear pretty well also.</li>
            <li>The quality is very high.  </li>
            <li>and it seems to stay on much</li>
            <li>I really like this lipstick</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t much up my purse and get covered in lint and stuff.</li>
            <li>The colors were very clumped when applied on the lips, and were not spread out evenly.</li>
            <li>I was very upset but decided to give the lipgloss a whirl</li>
            <li>but I really wanted the no. 2.</li>
            <li>The actual lipstick seems to be ok so far but the lipstick container starts to fall apart before it is even out of the box.  </li>
            <li>I have only tried 2 colors but the actual product is pretty good especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>I expected more vibrant color because of how my eyeshadow turned out, but I was mistaken.</li>
            <li>Be warned, though: the other reviews are right about the cheap packaging.</li>
            <li>The colors are nice, but the color doesn&#x27;t last long on my lips.</li>
            <li>i love the deep red  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>and you want your lips to be just as vibrant orange, again go for it.</li>
            <li>I like the products and would buy again, but I better receive what I order next time or it will be the last time I order their products.</li>
            <li>SO highly pigmented.</li>
            <li>cute little box</li>
            <li>These I can live with though.</li>
            <li>The light pink is really the only one I can&#x27;t see myself wearing.</li>
            <li>But the coral, darker red, fuchsia are all really pretty.</li>
            <li>As long as you expect the golden caps to pop off, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would have returned them instantly when I first tried them on, but i did not want to return lipsticks I already tried on.</li>
            <li>They are highly pigmented but seeing as I have medium/dark skin, I can only really pull of 4-5 of the colors.  </li>
            <li>I bought these as a birthday gift for my little sister and she says she loves them because they go on so smoothly.</li>
            <li>The lipstick quality seems a little cheap, but I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li>Each of the six shades glides on for a smooth application and they are very buildable so you can control just how thick you want the color to be.</li>
            <li>Out of the 6 that they came with, only one is really what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>The packaging of Shany products is so professional and sleek.  </li>
            <li>For those who are more subtle, I don&#x27;t think you should buy.</li>
            <li>I do wish that they were larger, and the packaging was less cheap.</li>
            <li>No regrets considering how affordable this was for 6 colors!</li>
            <li>The cap coming off in my purse is a major issue.</li>
            <li>The color are vibrant they dry on your lips with no transfer they have aloe Vera in them</li>
            <li>The colors are too soft and don&#x27;t last</li>
            <li>And the one baby pink color was stuck on the lid of the tube when I first opened it, and I had to manually push it all back in the stick.</li>
            <li>The lipstick was oiled and most were broken when I opened them.</li>
            <li>Very pretty color not smooth enough for my person liking though.</li>
            <li>Does not dry my lips out.</li>
            <li>They did not dry my lips out.</li>
            <li>The colors were not as vibrant as expected.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I barely used the lipsticks because none of them really flattered me at all, and the reds were all too similar, while the other brighter and darker colors were just not flattering.</li>
            <li>She had to give the light pink one to me because they were so pale.</li>
            <li>although, the colors that I did receive were pretty I was missing one....</li>
            <li>This is pure rubbish my wife got rid of it after 3 uses the colours are faded and the texture of the product is dry had to wet lips to apply.</li>

            <li> it shipped very fast!</li>
            <li> I was really excited about these, but aside from durability, the color is pretty muted and almost goes on like a crayon might.</li>
            <li> And the lipstick tubes were very... cheap.</li>
            <li> Great for everyday use or a night on the town..</li>
            <li> All of these problems weren&#x27;t worth 16 bucks plus tax.</li>
            <li> The colors are overall very nice, and light feeling, so I don&#x27;t necessarily regret buying them.</li>
            <li> Lesson learned but served my purpose fine for a decent price.</li>
            <li> So smooth and doesnt feel like normal lipstick.</li>
            <li> The colors are nice and I bought this mainly to experiment with color before spending a lot on individual lipsticks.</li>
            <li> , it last a long time, it feels great, doesn&#x27;t feather, it&#x27;s super pigmented and pretty much</li>
            <li> The only downside is that the lipstick containers are a little cheap feeling, and the gold pieces at the bottom fall off, but it was a great deal for all the colours and you can always glue the gold parts back on :)</li>
            <li> DID FIND THE COLORS TO BE PRETTY PIGMENTED&lt;</li>
            <li> They were rather chalky when I first applied these lipsticks, but after I applied them a second time, they were much more creamy.</li>
            <li> Each lipstick case was already falling apart when I tried to take then out for the first time to use them.</li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving this 4 stars is because the top part of the lipstick casing keeps popping off</li>
            <li> : For extended staying power, try applying chapstick first</li>
            <li> Pretty colors, but the caps will not stay on.  </li>
            <li> Fell apart first day</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this especially since it is animal torture free! :)</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind bringing back the &amp;#34;1980s lipstick style&amp;#34; then go for it, for example, if you&#x27;re wearing an orange top</li>
            <li> the color variety is really pretty</li>
            <li> I planned on buying both but wanted the second first because more colors matched my skin/ hair type.</li>
            <li> you get more than your monies worth and no where else will you buy such high quality at such a low price...and the Free Samples are to die for!</li>
            <li> The colors are very subtle but beautiful.</li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant and wear pretty well also.</li>
            <li> The quality is very high.  </li>
            <li> and it seems to stay on much</li>
            <li> I really like this lipstick</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t much up my purse and get covered in lint and stuff.</li>
            <li> The colors were very clumped when applied on the lips, and were not spread out evenly.</li>
            <li> I was very upset but decided to give the lipgloss a whirl</li>
            <li> but I really wanted the no. 2.</li>
            <li> The actual lipstick seems to be ok so far but the lipstick container starts to fall apart before it is even out of the box.  </li>
            <li> I have only tried 2 colors but the actual product is pretty good especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> I expected more vibrant color because of how my eyeshadow turned out, but I was mistaken.</li>
            <li> Be warned, though: the other reviews are right about the cheap packaging.</li>
            <li> The colors are nice, but the color doesn&#x27;t last long on my lips.</li>
            <li> i love the deep red  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> and you want your lips to be just as vibrant orange, again go for it.</li>
            <li> I like the products and would buy again, but I better receive what I order next time or it will be the last time I order their products.</li>
            <li> SO highly pigmented.</li>
            <li> cute little box</li>
            <li> These I can live with though.</li>
            <li> The light pink is really the only one I can&#x27;t see myself wearing.</li>
            <li> But the coral, darker red, fuchsia are all really pretty.</li>
            <li> As long as you expect the golden caps to pop off, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would have returned them instantly when I first tried them on, but i did not want to return lipsticks I already tried on.</li>
            <li> They are highly pigmented but seeing as I have medium/dark skin, I can only really pull of 4-5 of the colors.  </li>
            <li> I bought these as a birthday gift for my little sister and she says she loves them because they go on so smoothly.</li>
            <li> The lipstick quality seems a little cheap, but I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> Each of the six shades glides on for a smooth application and they are very buildable so you can control just how thick you want the color to be.</li>
            <li> Out of the 6 that they came with, only one is really what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The packaging of Shany products is so professional and sleek.  </li>
            <li> For those who are more subtle, I don&#x27;t think you should buy.</li>
            <li> I do wish that they were larger, and the packaging was less cheap.</li>
            <li> No regrets considering how affordable this was for 6 colors!</li>
            <li> The cap coming off in my purse is a major issue.</li>
            <li> The color are vibrant they dry on your lips with no transfer they have aloe Vera in them</li>
            <li> The colors are too soft and don&#x27;t last</li>
            <li> And the one baby pink color was stuck on the lid of the tube when I first opened it, and I had to manually push it all back in the stick.</li>
            <li> The lipstick was oiled and most were broken when I opened them.</li>
            <li> Very pretty color not smooth enough for my person liking though.</li>
            <li> Does not dry my lips out.</li>
            <li> They did not dry my lips out.</li>
            <li> The colors were not as vibrant as expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I barely used the lipsticks because none of them really flattered me at all, and the reds were all too similar, while the other brighter and darker colors were just not flattering.</li>
            <li> She had to give the light pink one to me because they were so pale.</li>
            <li> although, the colors that I did receive were pretty I was missing one....</li>
            <li> This is pure rubbish my wife got rid of it after 3 uses the colours are faded and the texture of the product is dry had to wet lips to apply.</li>
            <li> they dont last long</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t go wrong with finishing my face if I&#x27;m applying my Smooth Collection lipstick.</li>
            <li> they stay on for a long time</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried all the colors or worn the product for long</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a sticky or dry feeling lipstick</li>
            <li> and if your lips start to feel dry just add some balm with them.</li>
            <li> I got this product a few months ago and the packaging was cheap, some of the lipsticks were broken, and the quality of color pay off is average.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t do well for long time wear and the lids do not stay on which resulted in pink lipstick on the inside fabric of my purse.</li>
            <li> The only thing is the caps don&#x27;t snap on too tightly</li>
            <li> Like the other colors.</li>
            <li> I will be buying the other color options in this brand.</li>
            <li> Something was not right at all.</li>
            <li> The package was only at least four inches tall.</li>
            <li> I had to wear a base and a top coating of lip gloss when I used the lipsticks to reduce the clumped feeling.</li>
            <li> i am very disappointed, the quality is very low, price high, colors are normal, don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> Tubes and lids were ill fitted and strange, contents oddly gummy with odor similar to walking down the lawn care aisle at a Home Depot.</li>
            <li> The colors are not entirely true to the sample colors on the box or the swatches on the lipsticks themselves, but I still like them.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately those colors do not last long time on the lip.</li>
            <li> Also one is a little too orange.</li>
            <li> so they fall off in the makeup bag sometimes and the little gold piece snaps off as well.</li>
            <li> I would like the lipstick to stay on just a little longer, but considering the price</li>
            <li> i have to give this lipstick  one star because I was missing one tube of lipstick.</li>
            <li> It suited my dark skin and small lips tho.</li>
            <li> If you like your lips to be heavily noticed then this is for you.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> Small tubes but lots of colors.  </li>
            <li> This makes it hard to just throw one into my purse and go, I have to put it in a plastic bag</li>
            <li> When I received them at least three of the lipsticks were squished and smudged.</li>
            <li> As stated, they arrived with the little gold pieces broken off, and then I discovered upon fist opening each tube, two of the lipsticks had chunks broken off.</li>
            <li> No good.</li>
            <li> Neon  lipstick and lips are not a good combination at all</li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> (Usually when you buy a kit, some of the colors are useless, but not in this case!)</li>
            <li> buy, Don&#x27;t waste money! ! ! !</li>
            <li> Perhaps others can find that these compliment their skin tone, but for me, they were useless.</li>
            <li> Sadly had to return.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I was sent the wrong product.  </li>
            <li> Looks and feels so expensive.  </li>
            <li> The casings are very thin, and the gold trimming detail is snapped on so it all fell apart on</li>
            <li> I would horrible product don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> BUT I hate the tube that it&#x27;s in because the lids don&#x27;t stay on well.</li>
            <li> So disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> but this one was awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> They&#x27;re very good I love the colors and the small box to keep them together, and as usual they came just on time</li>
            <li> This is a great deal. No regrets considering how affordable this was for 6 colors! The light pink is really the only one I can&#x27;t see myself wearing. Also one is a little too orange. But the coral, darker red, fuchsia are all really pretty. Good for little cute go-to lip color options. The only thing is the caps don&#x27;t snap on too tightly so they fall off in the makeup bag sometimes and the little gold piece snaps off as well. These I can live with though.</li>
            <li> The lipsticks are creamy and smooth. Just that, three of the colors don&#x27;t suit my skin tone, ( it&#x27;s brown )</li>
            <li> The colors are awesome and they do stay for long. They break if you don&#x27;t know how to use them correctly.</li>
            <li> I liked the colours very much in this set. I would like the lipstick to stay on just a little longer, but considering the price, it&#x27;s good value and I just put on a lipstick sealant over it and it seems to stay on much longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Luvtravel&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> If I could give this a zero I would horrible product don&#x27;t waste your money. I love shany products that I&#x27;ve purchased before but this one was awful. The lipstick was oiled and most were broken when I opened them.</li>
            <li> Love this came on time... love the colors and we&#x27;re packaged well... Also purchased the chocolates set of the lip gloss love them both...!!! Will keep buy from Shany Cosmetic</li>
            <li> SO THE SHIPPING CAME BEFORE TIME .&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;AS SOON AS I PICKED UP A LIPSTICK THE LIL GOLD PART ON THE TOP FELL OFF&lt;br /&gt;CHEAP PACKAGING&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;I DID FIND THE COLORS TO BE PRETTY PIGMENTED&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LIKE THE LIPSTICKS , I WOULDNT BUY THEM AGAIN BUT I DONT REGRET PURCHASING BECAUSE THIS COLLECTION DOES BRING SOME NICE COLORS... OVERALL I LIKE SHANY COSMETICS I JUST THINK THEY CAN DO BETTER ..</li>
            <li> I bought this product for myself as a Christmas present. I did some research on it online and it seemed like a really good value. But when I got this in the mail, I couldn&#x27;t believe how TINY it was! The package was only at least four inches tall. And the lipstick tubes were very... cheap. And the one baby pink color was stuck on the lid of the tube when I first opened it, and I had to manually push it all back in the stick. Luckily it wasn&#x27;t ruined. They were rather chalky when I first applied these lipsticks, but after I applied them a second time, they were much more creamy. The colors are overall very nice, and light feeling, so I don&#x27;t necessarily regret buying them. I do wish that they were larger, and the packaging was less cheap.</li>
            <li> Perfect colors! Just what i ordered. Does not dry my lips out. it shipped very fast! The color lasts all day without re application i would buy this again!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re okay but the colors are different than they look on the bottom of each lip stick. They come. Off really easy too. Each lipstick case was already falling apart when I tried to take then out for the first time to use them.</li>
            <li> I expected more vibrant color because of how my eyeshadow turned out, but I was mistaken. The colors are very subtle but beautiful. It&#x27;s not a sticky or dry feeling lipstick either it&#x27;s a very nice feeling.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I love lipstick and wanted a bunch of variety of colours. It came in very quickly (way before the estimated date which made me extremely happy) and the package looks very sophisticated. The colors are vibrant and wear pretty well also. The only downside is that the lipstick containers are a little cheap feeling, and the gold pieces at the bottom fall off, but it was a great deal for all the colours and you can always glue the gold parts back on :)</li>
            <li> they stay on for a long time but I do find them waxy.  Good value for the price.  Good variety of colors</li>
            <li> It looks like very cheap, not take this one if u want to change the brand ko ok ko ko</li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving this 4 stars is because the top part of the lipstick casing keeps popping off so I glued them on so they look nice :)  The colors are very nice and smooth. They did not dry my lips out. I am very happy with the colors.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t go wrong with finishing my face if I&#x27;m applying my Smooth Collection lipstick. It goes on smooth and stays!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried all the colors or worn the product for long but it went on well and can&#x27;t complain for what I paid for it</li>
            <li> Waste of money! This is NOT matte lipstick! It&#x27;s like a cheap dollar store lip gloss!  So disappointed!</li>
            <li> Amazing amazing amazing... love the colors. So smooth and doesnt feel like normal lipstick. More of a glossy texture, which is very nice. Love this product along with the eye pallet n the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Www.Reviews@shanycosmetics.com</li>
            <li> Very good product. I like everything about the product and will definitely recommend you to others. I know they enjoy</li>
            <li> I love wearing vibrant, powerful colors and thought this product would be a good way to try a variety of lipsticks. Shany didn&#x27;t disappoint. Each of the six shades glides on for a smooth application and they are very buildable so you can control just how thick you want the color to be. Be warned, though: the other reviews are right about the cheap packaging. As long as you expect the golden caps to pop off, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: For extended staying power, try applying chapstick first and then the lipstick of your choice. Blot your lips with a tissue, then reapply the lipstick. Do that twice more and put on lip gloss. Works wonders every time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set to experiment with color. A case broke on one of the lipsticks upon opening package. I am medium skin toned.3 of the 6 colors wore well. The colors were not as vibrant as expected. The 3 lighter shades were too opaque. I will say that they are creamy and I only had to reapply once. Slim case was perfect for small purse.</li>
            <li> Small tubes but lots of colors.  I am not so fond of the pinks.  They seem too white for me.  Like the other colors.</li>
            <li> Product more wonderful&lt;br /&gt;Product beyond description&lt;br /&gt;I advise everyone Bsthaddamh Genuine First, because he was sure of it personally&lt;br /&gt;I am very wonderful wonderful performance&lt;br /&gt;I loved this product.</li>
            <li> Pretty colors, but the caps will not stay on.  Most women keep their lipstick in their purse. The cap coming off in my purse is a major issue.</li>
            <li> These lipsticks feel great, and they have great pigmentation. I was expecting for the colors to be a bit darker, but for the price they are awesome</li>
            <li> Very cheap made. Gold caps fall off and colors are not as the look in the picture.</li>
            <li> This is pure rubbish my wife got rid of it after 3 uses the colours are faded and the texture of the product is dry had to wet lips to apply.No good.</li>
            <li> Smell like a very strong wax was on my lips.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made. Fell apart first day</li>
            <li> Cute Colors...any tone can pull them off they dont last long but you&#x27;ll enjoy ALL.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these colors. They are so creamy when you apply them over a matte lipstick. The color lasts about 4 hours, which is fine with me. I will be buying the other color options in this brand. I am becoming to love the Shany products more and more. They are affordable and apply just as well as NARS or MAC.</li>
            <li> i have to give this lipstick  one star because I was missing one tube of lipstick. although, the colors that I did receive were pretty I was missing one.... bummer!</li>
            <li> The colors aren&#x27;t what&#x27;s shown on the box at all. As soon as I took them out of the box, the packaging to each individual lipstick started falling apart. The caps don&#x27;t stay on. Out of the 6 that they came with, only one is really what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Colors received were all a bright orange, thought this showed multiple colors. Tubes and lids were ill fitted and strange, contents oddly gummy with odor similar to walking down the lawn care aisle at a Home Depot. No idea what affected product received, or if product had been tampered with. Took away from daughter and tossed immediately. Taking no chances in this instance. Something was not right at all.</li>
            <li> The actual lipstick seems to be ok so far but the lipstick container starts to fall apart before it is even out of the box.  The lids do not stay on and the lipstick itself will fall out on the floor.  However, it seems to be good once you get it on.  I have only tried 2 colors but the actual product is pretty good especially for the price.  i would buy it for myself but never as a gift.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with these lipsticks. The gold top parts popped off easily but I fixed that with superglue. The color are vibrant they dry on your lips with no transfer they have aloe Vera in them and if your lips start to feel dry just add some balm with them. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> The colors are nice and I bought this mainly to experiment with color before spending a lot on individual lipsticks. They don&#x27;t do well for long time wear and the lids do not stay on which resulted in pink lipstick on the inside fabric of my purse. Lesson learned but served my purpose fine for a decent price.</li>
            <li> Poor quality. ..not smooth at all.</li>
            <li> SO highly pigmented. love them.</li>
            <li> Very pretty color not smooth enough for my person liking though.</li>
            <li> because I love the colors it came with , shipping was nice and on time cute little box It comes with easy to bring with you in your purse</li>
            <li> Nice colors, good box to storage and fancy sticks but unfortunately those colors do not last long time on the lip.</li>
            <li> Great price and product, lip colors are nice and was packaged so nicely, I want to reuse the box they came in! I definitely recommend this especially since it is animal torture free! :)</li>
            <li> I received something different. It wasn&#x27;t what I ordered. It&#x27;s a lip gloss not lipsticks showing in the picture. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I really like this lipstick, it last a long time, it feels great, doesn&#x27;t feather, it&#x27;s super pigmented and pretty much is everything you could possibly want in a lipstick. BUT I hate the tube that it&#x27;s in because the lids don&#x27;t stay on well. This makes it hard to just throw one into my purse and go, I have to put it in a plastic bag so it doesn&#x27;t much up my purse and get covered in lint and stuff. Anyway, it still gets four stars because it&#x27;s freaking great (as good as MAC lipstick) and it&#x27;s affordable.</li>
            <li> This is beautiful, I love each and every color! (Usually when you buy a kit, some of the colors are useless, but not in this case!) It&#x27;s great as a gift and great for yourself! Price is amazing, very nice product! I would recommend to any friend!</li>
            <li> Just as the picture showed.  Shipped quickly, and was pleasantly pleased with the product.  The colors are richer and deeper than the picture shows....</li>
            <li> They are to bright for lipstick and fade really fast. Neon  lipstick and lips are not a good combination at all</li>
            <li> The colors are too soft and don&#x27;t last</li>
            <li> Great for everyday use or a night on the town.. And be used for mixing and matching and looks great with any lip liner.</li>
            <li> Colors were not as bright as they appeared to be. The colors were very clumped when applied on the lips, and were not spread out evenly. I had to wear a base and a top coating of lip gloss when I used the lipsticks to reduce the clumped feeling. Would have returned them instantly when I first tried them on, but i did not want to return lipsticks I already tried on. I am definitely not recommending these lipstick.</li>
            <li> I love love love these lipsticks although there are only three shades that I can use for my complextion but those three shades are totally awesome.</li>
            <li> i love all the colors it works for me! the price is okay anybody can afford to have this...even for collection must have!</li>
            <li> i am very disappointed, the quality is very low, price high, colors are normal, don&#x27;t buy i advise you .........</li>
            <li> I bought these as a birthday gift for my little sister and she says she loves them because they go on so smoothly. She had to give the light pink one to me because they were so pale. It suited my dark skin and small lips tho.</li>
            <li> As stated, they arrived with the little gold pieces broken off, and then I discovered upon fist opening each tube, two of the lipsticks had chunks broken off. I was really excited about these, but aside from durability, the color is pretty muted and almost goes on like a crayon might. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honestly quite suprised with all these positive reviews. As soon as I opened my box, one of the lipstick casings just fell apart. It&#x27;s all very cheap, to be honest. The casings are very thin, and the gold trimming detail is snapped on so it all fell apart on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I barely used the lipsticks because none of them really flattered me at all, and the reds were all too similar, while the other brighter and darker colors were just not flattering. Perhaps others can find that these compliment their skin tone, but for me, they were useless. Sadly had to return.</li>
            <li> The colors are not entirely true to the sample colors on the box or the swatches on the lipsticks themselves, but I still like them.  They are highly pigmented but seeing as I have medium/dark skin, I can only really pull of 4-5 of the colors.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> great for the price it is a good product love it all colors are amazing i love the deep red  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Two comments about this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. If you&#x27;re looking for bold, neon like colors then this is for you. If you like your lips to be heavily noticed then this is for you. If you don&#x27;t mind bringing back the &amp;#34;1980s lipstick style&amp;#34; then go for it, for example, if you&#x27;re wearing an orange top and you want your lips to be just as vibrant orange, again go for it. This is a great product for those who want boldness and vibrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. For those who are more subtle, I don&#x27;t think you should buy. Stick with what you&#x27;re used to.</li>
            <li> I ordered the lipstick and received the package it was the lipgloss. I was very upset but decided to give the lipgloss a whirl n it&#x27;s great. Just once again just not what I ordered!!</li>
            <li> Perhaps I was sent the wrong product.  The box calls this collection &amp;#34;chocolate gloss&amp;#34;.  It is in a liquid form with a brush included.  The colors are nice, but the color doesn&#x27;t last long on my lips.</li>
            <li> I got this product a few months ago and the packaging was cheap, some of the lipsticks were broken, and the quality of color pay off is average.&lt;br /&gt;These lipsticks were just an overall  hasslel the tops kept poping off. When I received them at least three of the lipsticks were squished and smudged. All of these problems weren&#x27;t worth 16 bucks plus tax. I returned this garbage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy, Don&#x27;t waste money! ! ! !</li>
            <li> When I opened the package, the gold caps were falling off. The lipstick quality seems a little cheap, but I got what I paid for. The shipment was great though.</li>
            <li> I thought the colors would be too light and not go well with my medium-dark brown complexion, but they are wonderful. They don&#x27;t last forever, but the price is great and I love the colors.</li>
            <li> the color variety is really pretty and it goes on smoothly and feels nice on my lips. i would deff repurchase.</li>
            <li> this produce is so flimsily WHEN IT REACH IT started to fell apart and i got two of the same shade lip stick wont be ordering from u guys a again</li>
            <li> I purchased both sets of this lipstick.  One word, AWESOME.  The packaging of Shany products is so professional and sleek.  Looks and feels so expensive.  The quality is very high.  I think their products are very SEXY!  I feel like a queen when I use, see, store, carry, travel, and purchase Shany products.  That&#x27;s all I can say...you get more than your monies worth and no where else will you buy such high quality at such a low price...and the Free Samples are to die for!</li>
            <li> I ordered the SHANY smooch collection No. 2 and was sent collection 1. It&#x27;s ok but I really wanted the no. 2. I planned on buying both but wanted the second first because more colors matched my skin/ hair type. I like the products and would buy again, but I better receive what I order next time or it will be the last time I order their products.</li>
            <li> i like this product a lot  cause it has all the colors that i want and satisfied about the price...</li>
