            <li> Style it every day with blow-dryer and flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I use it in conjunction with chi&#x27;s blow dry spray and my hair feels softer than before I flat iron.</li>
            <li> Just be careful when you spray  it, all of the excess product that ends on your floor turns it into ice skating</li>
            <li> I use this stuff everyday and it makes a world of difference when I flat iron.</li>
            <li> Product doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down in any way...</li>
            <li> My hair is noticeably shinier and significantly less frizzy when I use it.</li>
            <li> I almost killed myself on a night visit to the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Use this everyday and my hair doesn&#x27;t get fried when I flat iron it or have a burnt smell, however after a few weeks the spray nozzle broke :(</li>
            <li> I would give it five stars but the sprayer feels awkward.</li>

            <li> I use this stuff everyday and it makes a world of difference when I flat iron. I use it in conjunction with chi&#x27;s blow dry spray and my hair feels softer than before I flat iron. Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I use it every time I need to use heat on my hair. But i can&#x27;t tell if it did protect my hair. Since I bought the 3 bottles as one package, I will continue use it just hope it does work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a thermal protectant before trying this product, so I&#x27;ve nothing to compare it to. It has a great fresh clean scent and I prefer the trigger to a &amp;#34;pump&amp;#34; nozzle. Product doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down in any way... good stuff for the cost. I&#x27;ve not seen any heat damage to my hair since using this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent, excellent product!</li>

            <li> OK the product is great and smells really nice. Just be careful when you spray  it, all of the excess product that ends on your floor turns it into ice skating rink!!!No kidding I almost killed myself on a night visit to the bathroom.</li>
