            <li>LOL)</li>
            <li>Of course it works great on the legs.</li>
            <li>The Braun 5180 is great.  </li>

            <li>it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>it takes alot of work to get the knees done, otherwise it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Great</li>
            <li>, you might end up with some strays here and there, but all in all it is a very nice job.    </li>
            <li>This product is really good.</li>
            <li>The end result is as good as waxing can be, which is to say</li>
            <li>but I ordered this product as it seemed good.</li>
            <li>Good luck! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>and although it wasn&#x27;t painless, it was tolerable and I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I find the product very worthwhile.</li>
            <li>I am so delighted to get the process out of the shower and into a nice, comfy chair that I don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>I decided to combine epilation and the smooth away type produts and couldn&#x27;t be happier!!  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be able to epilate without it!  </li>
            <li>So much more pleasant that waxing.  </li>
            <li>If it was just the pain followed by blissfully smooth legs, bikini line, and underarms, that would be great, but it was not that way for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m beginging to think I&#x27;m some kind of freak bc reading the majority of posts on here</li>
            <li>I do my legs, arms, and arm pits, and during the winter was doing maintenance once a week, now that the warm weather is here</li>
            <li>, it hurts kind of, but eh you get used to it.</li>
            <li>Good product, however it needs a direct wall connection for best use.</li>
            <li>I used to own a Braun Epilator that I bought 6 years ago.  </li>
            <li>I loved my first one too, but, I really really love this one!!</li>
            <li>Product easy to use and seems to be good quality.</li>
            <li>The light, something I originally thought I wouldn&#x27;t need, is incredibly helpful.  </li>
            <li>My biggest gripe about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t do a good job on fine hair.  </li>
            <li>but after more than a year of use it seems my hair growth cycle refuses to play nice and synch up.</li>
            <li>The results there are the most impressive by far.</li>
            <li>Sure, it is not a comfy experience -- but it&#x27;s not horrible.  </li>
            <li>It has a light!</li>
            <li>Plus I was having more hair break than pulled out all the way</li>
            <li>I figure one more wax and the maintenance should be a breeze.</li>
            <li>I think I will be able to get use to the epilator</li>
            <li>the more I use it.</li>
            <li>From there you can always work up the line and see if you find anything better.</li>
            <li>I use the braun more than the panasonic because I still think it does a much better job at getting every thing.</li>
            <li>the more I use it.</li>
            <li>From there you can always work up the line and see if you find anything better.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)    </li>
            <li>I use the braun more than the panasonic because I still think it does a much better job at getting every thing.</li>
            <li>the more I have used it</li>
            <li>I pay for waxing every month because it is nice to be hair free for a longer period of time than shaving allows.</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews I decided to try this mid-priced Braun model</li>
            <li>the more you use it.  </li>
            <li>and I think this is THE KEY TO THE SUCCESS OF THIS PROCESS!!!!!!!  </li>
            <li>On most of my legs I don&#x27;t feel anything at all</li>
            <li>All I can say is that I really do love this epilator and it does everything I need it to.  </li>
            <li>After about 1 minute I even switched from the \\&quot;beginner\\&quot; head to the one with more tweezers.  </li>
            <li>Works fantastic!</li>
            <li>It is perfect and what I like about the last model Epil</li>
            <li>OK well I had a coupon</li>
            <li>Feeling adventurous</li>
            <li>Felt great getting the hair turbo tweezed and it didn&#x27;t hurt much at all.  </li>
            <li>After reading the reviews on most products I decided to get the</li>
            <li>This is my fourth epilator, and it&#x27;s the best one yet!</li>
            <li>It has to be plugged in to use, which is okay,</li>
            <li>Overall however I am extremely happy with this product and recommend it to people all the time!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this product for more than 3 years.</li>
            <li>Ok, still acceptable.</li>
            <li>but i am glad i found the reason of it</li>
            <li>but until i found a better product...</li>
            <li>Wish i was able to return it</li>
            <li>I was okay buying a volatage converter.    </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li>I started to do a write up on the best way to get started with an epilator, but found it to be WAY too long.  </li>
            <li>More tweezers would be better but 40 works fine.</li>
            <li>I Don&#x27;t mind the noise and love the light.  </li>
            <li>I love the light</li>
            <li>Also, the Emjoi Light Caress Gold Corded Epilator was a lot cheaper on folica 49.99 and free shipping plus it has all the bells and whistles of this one without the PAIN!</li>
            <li>I used it on my under arms and the hair was removed easily.</li>
            <li>Easy Start Epilator.</li>
            <li>It really does leave my legs nice and smooth</li>
            <li>This means that I&#x27;ll never have perfectly smooth legs as I did from shaving.</li>
            <li>Another important tip for use: don&#x27;t make sweeping motions with the device.</li>
            <li>They still didn&#x27;t look or feel smooth.</li>
            <li>The one down-size I can see it that your legs are never as smooth as with shaving to the touch, but you can&#x27;t see any hair and that is all I need.  </li>
            <li>My bikini area is completely smooth.  </li>
            <li>If anyone has tips for using it on your chin, I&#x27;d much appreciate it as I&#x27;m scared of catching my skin.</li>
            <li>We all want silky smooth legs etc...</li>
            <li>I was in-love and happy to have it ,especially in summer time.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I have used this Braun several times and it is so fast and painless with excellent results.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t lie it does hurt the first two times you&#x27;ll use it unless you already have fine hair, but I will tell you the more I&#x27;ve used it</li>
            <li>I use the panasonic for the first run just to get most of the hair</li>
            <li>I use the panasonic for the first run just to get most of the hair</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>I really love it and frankly, this is the first review I have ever been moved to write.  </li>
            <li>This is the first summer that I have been able to go to a pool with a moment&#x27;s notice--no going home to shave and break out afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I think my favorite part about this product is the smart light feature.  </li>
            <li>This works great on the little chin hairs, I thought it would hurt more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used lots of different kinds of epilators but this is the best one I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>(yes, my skin was clean.</li>
            <li>u ladies got stronger legs then me and if u have same problem as i did,,make sure u quit using any kind of &#x27;&#x27;pulling&#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know much about it, other than my wife is very, very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this epilator, three years and still going strong!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li>I had read the many rave reviews and thought that is was priced in the medium range (and a reasonable price for the Braun brand).  </li>
            <li>Then I moved onto my bikini line but did not attempt the full brazilian.</li>
            <li>Unlike my old Panasonic, it is very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>quickly and now don&#x27;t even think about the discomfort.  </li>
            <li>I still shave the armpits but it is quick.</li>
            <li>read reviews of multiple products before purchasing this item, this is it , reasonable price for a great product .</li>
            <li>It was my very first epilator.</li>
            <li>I stopped doing my full brazilian bikini fun.</li>
            <li>Also I stopped doing my full brazilian bikini fun.</li>
            <li>, I love also that the new model has the capability of working in 220 Volt as well, all you need is a plate</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I had to keep stopping to check that it was removing the hair!    </li>
            <li>but u should research more and maybe find better quality if u willing to pay lil extra.</li>
            <li>It really does make a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Took longer than I expected but the results were good.</li>
            <li>It is so totally worth it.  </li>
            <li>They say with regular use it gets more comfortable.</li>
            <li>We did have a lot of fun laughing at my sons friends trying to use it just to see if they could stand it .</li>
            <li>In less than 20 minutes I successfully finished both legs.</li>
            <li>Having tried the original Epilady way back when, I was more than hesitant to buy another epilator.</li>
            <li>+ I am STILL suffering and can&#x27;t seem to get the hairs to grow the right way again.  </li>
            <li>Great product , you can&#x27;t miss a spot and last very long time , leaves you with smooth skin .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So, all things considered, this thing is AMAZING, but you have to be able to get past the pain.</li>
            <li>Considering I&#x27;m pregnant, my skin is extra sensitive, probably wasn&#x27;t a good idea to start epilating now</li>
            <li>first thing I did was go after my underarms since they are what I am the most self conscious about.</li>
            <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Great value... it won&#x27;t completely replace razors, and if you have a low tolerance for pain, you should really look elsewhere for hair removal.</li>
            <li>Easy Start Epilator after my old Panasonic died.  </li>
            <li>My Australian-bought Epilator was easily 10 years old, and if it hadn&#x27;t been for the annoyance mentioned, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have bothered to change it.    </li>
            <li>5 years later, I purchased a Emjoi Light Caress Gold Corded Epilator and it works fabulously.</li>
            <li>At first it hurts</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m pretty used to it.</li>
            <li>and it is more than tolerable; especially after your first time doing it.</li>
            <li>This is the first epilator I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>I read a lot of reviews and decided to try this one as my first.</li>
            <li>It hurts for the first two runs and then I&#x27;m use to it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a solid product and a worthwhile investment.     </li>
            <li>The only thing that could make it better is if it was rechargeable/wireless.</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with an epilator.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth not having to shave so much.</li>
            <li>and then the third time is even better.  </li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars only because I think that with this method, you get more ingrown hairs than with waxing or shaving.    </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be scared, use a cream and get rid of all the hair you want first then use this.  </li>
            <li>This is my first epilator</li>
            <li>The epilator is intimidating when you turn it on the first time</li>
            <li>I have to say I do think the massaging rollers help at first</li>
            <li>/&gt;Good luck ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katie</li>
            <li>The first time I would recommend using the rollers.</li>
            <li>My first time using the epilator</li>
            <li>I used it 2 days in a row because I missed hairs the first time.</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s working exactly as it should</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to everyone including first time users.</li>
            <li>The first was a torture device.  </li>
            <li>First weeks ..amazed ...</li>
            <li>So anybody with same diliema can order this product without concern :)</li>
            <li>I used the cold pack, which was really nice but after the very first instance of putting it to my skin the rest was a piece of cake, it didn&#x27;t hurt as much as I expected and it did a great job getting all my hairs!</li>
            <li>liked the interchangeable heads and other gadgets.</li>
            <li>I liked the interchangeable heads and other gadgets.</li>
            <li>It hurt quite a bit on the first use, but I don&#x27;t feel too much pain anymore.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much like everyone says it is for the \\&quot;things that suck\\&quot; list.</li>
            <li>One thing that some might find useful to know is that it&#x27;s neither whisper quite nor obtrusively loud - pretty much like an electric razor.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaper then a wax, probably hurts just as much, and you don&#x27;t have to go in somewhere for someone else to do it.</li>
            <li>Well, I use it absolutely everywhere</li>
            <li>also learned a very helpful tip which is to epilate in a circular motion.</li>
            <li>I also learned a very helpful tip which is to epilate in a circular motion.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest this treatment if you have the money!</li>
            <li>I really like how it works.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>and now I am so glad I finally spent the money.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews I decided to purchase this epilator, after it arrived I turned it on and with much trepidation I rolled it across my legs.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect.</li>
            <li>I can go a whole week without shaving my legs and that saves me tons of time.</li>
            <li>The pain isn&#x27;t as intense as when I used the Braun one</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t have too much</li>
            <li>/&gt;This makes waxing feel like a gentle massage.</li>
            <li>Oh and thanks to another reviewer mentioning 20% off BBB.   </li>
            <li>I remove the head for really course hairs, cause the massaging head sometimes misses them.</li>
            <li>is no worse than waxing.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>However, I think it does what it&#x27;s advertised to do and probably very well at that.</li>
            <li>I have to admit, some parts are more sensitive than others (like the back of my knee, for instance)    </li>
            <li>I had a hard time getting the right angles to get an effective run.</li>
            <li>They were impressed that it was SO difficult to battle this bout of MAJOR ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t attempt to do the full area because its close to my next wax and there is way too much to cover.</li>
            <li>There is a tiny bit of pain in sensitive areas, but I found it easily bearable.</li>
            <li>It is amazing if you can get past the pain.</li>
            <li>I wax the upper lip, underarms, forearms, legs, and full brazilian bikini.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe that more people don&#x27;t use these; they have come such a long way from their first models.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a very very very long time (it seemed) of searing pain on both my underarms and legs, they still did not seem smooth.</li>
            <li>It helps the process go faster with better results plus it hurts a hell of a lot less too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It helps the process go faster with better results plus it hurts a hell of a lot less too.     </li>
            <li>Once most of the hair has been removed it hurts less.</li>
            <li>And the more often you use it, the less it hurts.</li>
            <li>I used the \\&quot;beginner\\&quot; head for overall epilating and then switched to \\&quot;big girl\\&quot; mode for finishing &amp; better results.</li>
            <li>I used the \\&quot;beginner\\&quot; head for overall epilating and then switched to \\&quot;big girl\\&quot; mode for finishing &amp; better results.</li>
            <li>If you can get past those first two times you will love it.</li>
            <li>When I saw that it was causing me to bleed, I quickly took this thing back to the store!</li>
            <li>As a male user I had never heard of or employed a &amp;#34;epilator&amp;#34; and wasn&#x27;t too sure how it actually worked.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get every single hair on my face, but it&#x27;s a huge improvement over shaving.</li>
            <li>Pulling the skin tight also helps a lot in reducing pain and getting better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pulling the skin tight also helps a lot in reducing pain and getting better results.     </li>
            <li>(and I have a high threshhold for pain).  </li>
            <li>I highly suggest this treatment if you have the money!e epilator</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.    </li>
            <li>I have a high tolerance for pain.</li>
            <li>i bought this epilator for my wife ,it is really brand new with its new cover,it has all the manfestition they describe ,and i get it at the time they said</li>
            <li>all the results were about on par with waxing except I have a little more stubble here and there.</li>
            <li>so I have to wait for it to grow out a little more.</li>
            <li>I took the other&#x27;s advice and had first waxed to get the first time hair removed for the first time</li>
            <li>I completely recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>If you are letting a little thing like excrutiating discomfort stop you from the joys of being hair free, then get rid of the excrutiating discomfort, not the epilator!    </li>
            <li>The fabulous little light is a big help</li>
            <li>and I had absolutely no bleeding with the Emjoi Light</li>
            <li>You have to go over each area several times, but it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>By the third time, it&#x27;s pretty much just \\&quot;discomfort\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>The second one did an okay job, but it was chargeable and didn&#x27;t hold a charge for very long.</li>
            <li>The leg portions don&#x27;t hurt me at all, but can sometimes leave my legs spotty and red for about a day before it goes back to being smooth just because I have sensitive skin in certain parts of my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am new at the underarm waxing, so maybe that is why my pain tolerance is lower.    </li>
            <li>But this new model has fullfilled my need</li>
            <li>Good-luck to new buyers</li>
            <li>fast speed setting but slow movement up the leg IS better   </li>
            <li>I have a fair completion and that may be why I&#x27;m also left with little red dots where the hairs used to be, and these never disappear either no matter what I try.</li>
            <li>You have to understand that I wax pretty much my entire body.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what my wife told me after using this for the first time, and she is now a former waxer.    </li>
            <li>reading the words excruciating so often prepared me to grit my teeth and cry the entire time I used it for the first time.</li>
            <li>It is the first and only epilator that I have ever owned, and I have no need or desire to find another epilator.  </li>
            <li>Originally I had wanted the 5270 model because of the extra shaver but wanted to get one locally</li>
            <li>It does take some time, especially when you are first getting used to it.  </li>
            <li>The first time I only did one leg</li>
            <li>My first experience was a dab on my ankle and back into the pouch it went.  </li>
            <li>at first do it in private</li>
            <li>so I take breaks when I finish one area and clean it out before starting the next area.  </li>
            <li>X&#x27;elle is the little light.  </li>
            <li>This product does a fine job and the pain in minimal, especially using the massaging head.</li>
            <li>It takes a few weeks to get completely hair free legs.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to use it very often, because the hair takes longer to grow back.</li>
            <li>As for underarms, I will admit, the pain was too much to take, so I am back to waxing.</li>
            <li>The hair on my legs is very course, I swear when I shave it comes back like a mans beard, so I epilate.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin and waxing is not an option.</li>
            <li>After epilating the first time, going over the same areas was a joke on the pain scale, barely even felt it.</li>
            <li>I got it as a Black Friday special.</li>
            <li>is minimal and most importantly the pain is temporary getting less and less</li>
            <li>I took away one star because the Epilator has a tendency to break off some of the hairs especially around the knee area that I have to go back and clean up with tweezers later.</li>
            <li>It hurt the first few times and I really had to get used to it...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt - not even on my upper lip which was far too sensitive to use my old epilator on!</li>
            <li>In the previous models I always though, I wish it has a light, bcs you never can see well when you are doing the back of your calf.</li>
            <li>I purchased one of the original Epiladies many years ago and only used it a handful of times, it was much too painful to endure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that taking smaller strokes (about 4 inches, back and forth) really helps the tweezers to catch virtually every hair.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed that my hair grows back much more slowly and sparsely</li>
            <li>In the past I used to have an adapter which worked fine, but it an extra thing that one needs to buy if travelling.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll let you know that if you want smooth skin that will last for days-weeks (as you use continuously) there is no better option.</li>
            <li>am NOT a sensitive person and my hairs are not extremely thick</li>
            <li>While internet searching for the wax I stumbled upon all these different Epilators and I was so surprised because I didn&#x27;t even know they still made these.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been shaving for years and only had my eyebrows waxed twice, and tried shaving my legs once so this was completely out of depth for me.</li>
            <li>Also, it only took me 2 minutes max to shave in the shower, and this takes considerably longer.</li>
            <li>so you pores are open and your hair is soft and standing up.  </li>
            <li>I use product about once every 2 weeks and it barely hurts now.</li>
            <li>and I almost couldn&#x27;t do it even though I barely flinched using it anywhere else.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get as close as shaving, but well worth it because I don&#x27;t have to shave everyday now.</li>
            <li>I mean it won&#x27;t ever be totally painless especially on sensitive areas like the \\&quot;golden triangle of pain\\</li>
            <li>I mean it won&#x27;t ever be totally painless especially on sensitive areas like the \\&quot;golden triangle of pain\\</li>
            <li>It takes a lot less time to epilate than the first one I owned.</li>
            <li>Every week now I take it out after showering and have it work my legs and bikini area (which for me hurts less than the armpits) and I still feel pain but nothing like the first couple times.    </li>
            <li>It does, however keep hair from coming back quickly and the hair appears to come back in softer and less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>Lastly, unless you are majorly into S&amp;M, don&#x27;t ever try this on your armpits.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time a few minutes ago.  </li>
            <li>I have established (at least for me) that it was not the best for hair removal, but what came after (a few weeks after) was much much worse.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t hurt me that bad, certain areas are more sensitive such as around my knees and inner thighs</li>
            <li>shower (and dry off completely) BEFORE you use it to soften your skins grip on your hair  3.</li>
            <li>but it was still worth toughing it out since the first time was really the only painful one.  </li>
            <li>The first use left my underarms red and raw, but I just bit the bullet and did it.</li>

            <li> The efficiency of epilators have greatly improved through the years.</li>
            <li> LOL)</li>
            <li> Of course it works great on the legs.</li>
            <li> The Braun 5180 is great.  </li>
            <li> The device itself works great and feels well constructed.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> it takes alot of work to get the knees done, otherwise it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Great</li>

            <li> This product is really good.</li>
            <li> The end result is as good as waxing can be, which is to say</li>
            <li> but I ordered this product as it seemed good.</li>
            <li> Good luck! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> and although it wasn&#x27;t painless, it was tolerable and I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I find the product very worthwhile.</li>
            <li> I am so delighted to get the process out of the shower and into a nice, comfy chair that I don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> I decided to combine epilation and the smooth away type produts and couldn&#x27;t be happier!!  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be able to epilate without it!  </li>
            <li> So much more pleasant that waxing.  </li>
            <li> If it was just the pain followed by blissfully smooth legs, bikini line, and underarms, that would be great, but it was not that way for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m beginging to think I&#x27;m some kind of freak bc reading the majority of posts on here</li>
            <li> I do my legs, arms, and arm pits, and during the winter was doing maintenance once a week, now that the warm weather is here</li>
            <li> , it hurts kind of, but eh you get used to it.</li>
            <li> Good product, however it needs a direct wall connection for best use.</li>
            <li> I used to own a Braun Epilator that I bought 6 years ago.  </li>
            <li> I loved my first one too, but, I really really love this one!!</li>
            <li> Product easy to use and seems to be good quality.</li>
            <li> The light, something I originally thought I wouldn&#x27;t need, is incredibly helpful.  </li>
            <li> My biggest gripe about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t do a good job on fine hair.  </li>
            <li> but after more than a year of use it seems my hair growth cycle refuses to play nice and synch up.</li>
            <li> The results there are the most impressive by far.</li>
            <li> Sure, it is not a comfy experience -- but it&#x27;s not horrible.  </li>
            <li> It has a light!</li>
            <li> Plus I was having more hair break than pulled out all the way</li>
            <li> I figure one more wax and the maintenance should be a breeze.</li>
            <li> I think I will be able to get use to the epilator</li>
            <li> the more I use it.</li>
            <li> From there you can always work up the line and see if you find anything better.</li>
            <li> I use the braun more than the panasonic because I still think it does a much better job at getting every thing.</li>
            <li> the more I use it.</li>
            <li> From there you can always work up the line and see if you find anything better.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)    </li>
            <li> I use the braun more than the panasonic because I still think it does a much better job at getting every thing.</li>
            <li> the more I have used it</li>
            <li> I pay for waxing every month because it is nice to be hair free for a longer period of time than shaving allows.</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews I decided to try this mid-priced Braun model</li>
            <li> the more you use it.  </li>
            <li> and I think this is THE KEY TO THE SUCCESS OF THIS PROCESS!!!!!!!  </li>
            <li> On most of my legs I don&#x27;t feel anything at all</li>
            <li> All I can say is that I really do love this epilator and it does everything I need it to.  </li>
            <li> After about 1 minute I even switched from the \\&quot;beginner\\&quot; head to the one with more tweezers.  </li>
            <li> Works fantastic!</li>
            <li> It is perfect and what I like about the last model Epil</li>
            <li> OK well I had a coupon</li>
            <li> Feeling adventurous</li>
            <li> Felt great getting the hair turbo tweezed and it didn&#x27;t hurt much at all.  </li>
            <li> After reading the reviews on most products I decided to get the</li>
            <li> This is my fourth epilator, and it&#x27;s the best one yet!</li>
            <li> It has to be plugged in to use, which is okay,</li>
            <li> Overall however I am extremely happy with this product and recommend it to people all the time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for more than 3 years.</li>
            <li> Ok, still acceptable.</li>
            <li> but i am glad i found the reason of it</li>
            <li> but until i found a better product...</li>
            <li> Wish i was able to return it</li>
            <li> I was okay buying a volatage converter.    </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li> I started to do a write up on the best way to get started with an epilator, but found it to be WAY too long.  </li>
            <li> More tweezers would be better but 40 works fine.</li>
            <li> I Don&#x27;t mind the noise and love the light.  </li>
            <li> I love the light</li>
            <li> Also, the Emjoi Light Caress Gold Corded Epilator was a lot cheaper on folica 49.99 and free shipping plus it has all the bells and whistles of this one without the PAIN!</li>
            <li> I used it on my under arms and the hair was removed easily.</li>
            <li> Easy Start Epilator.</li>
            <li> It really does leave my legs nice and smooth</li>
            <li> This means that I&#x27;ll never have perfectly smooth legs as I did from shaving.</li>
            <li> Another important tip for use: don&#x27;t make sweeping motions with the device.</li>
            <li> They still didn&#x27;t look or feel smooth.</li>
            <li> The one down-size I can see it that your legs are never as smooth as with shaving to the touch, but you can&#x27;t see any hair and that is all I need.  </li>
            <li> My bikini area is completely smooth.  </li>
            <li> If anyone has tips for using it on your chin, I&#x27;d much appreciate it as I&#x27;m scared of catching my skin.</li>
            <li> We all want silky smooth legs etc...</li>
            <li> I was in-love and happy to have it ,especially in summer time.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I have used this Braun several times and it is so fast and painless with excellent results.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t lie it does hurt the first two times you&#x27;ll use it unless you already have fine hair, but I will tell you the more I&#x27;ve used it</li>
            <li> I use the panasonic for the first run just to get most of the hair</li>
            <li> I use the panasonic for the first run just to get most of the hair</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> I really love it and frankly, this is the first review I have ever been moved to write.  </li>
            <li> This is the first summer that I have been able to go to a pool with a moment&#x27;s notice--no going home to shave and break out afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I think my favorite part about this product is the smart light feature.  </li>
            <li> This works great on the little chin hairs, I thought it would hurt more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of different kinds of epilators but this is the best one I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> (yes, my skin was clean.</li>
            <li> u ladies got stronger legs then me and if u have same problem as i did,,make sure u quit using any kind of &#x27;&#x27;pulling&#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about it, other than my wife is very, very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this epilator, three years and still going strong!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li> I had read the many rave reviews and thought that is was priced in the medium range (and a reasonable price for the Braun brand).  </li>
            <li> Then I moved onto my bikini line but did not attempt the full brazilian.</li>
            <li> Unlike my old Panasonic, it is very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> quickly and now don&#x27;t even think about the discomfort.  </li>
            <li> I still shave the armpits but it is quick.</li>
            <li> read reviews of multiple products before purchasing this item, this is it , reasonable price for a great product .</li>
            <li> It was my very first epilator.</li>
            <li> I stopped doing my full brazilian bikini fun.</li>
            <li> Also I stopped doing my full brazilian bikini fun.</li>
            <li> , I love also that the new model has the capability of working in 220 Volt as well, all you need is a plate</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I had to keep stopping to check that it was removing the hair!    </li>
            <li> but u should research more and maybe find better quality if u willing to pay lil extra.</li>
            <li> It really does make a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Took longer than I expected but the results were good.</li>
            <li> It is so totally worth it.  </li>
            <li> They say with regular use it gets more comfortable.</li>
            <li> We did have a lot of fun laughing at my sons friends trying to use it just to see if they could stand it .</li>
            <li> In less than 20 minutes I successfully finished both legs.</li>
            <li> Having tried the original Epilady way back when, I was more than hesitant to buy another epilator.</li>
            <li> + I am STILL suffering and can&#x27;t seem to get the hairs to grow the right way again.  </li>
            <li> Great product , you can&#x27;t miss a spot and last very long time , leaves you with smooth skin .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So, all things considered, this thing is AMAZING, but you have to be able to get past the pain.</li>
            <li> Considering I&#x27;m pregnant, my skin is extra sensitive, probably wasn&#x27;t a good idea to start epilating now</li>
            <li> first thing I did was go after my underarms since they are what I am the most self conscious about.</li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Great value... it won&#x27;t completely replace razors, and if you have a low tolerance for pain, you should really look elsewhere for hair removal.</li>
            <li> Easy Start Epilator after my old Panasonic died.  </li>
            <li> My Australian-bought Epilator was easily 10 years old, and if it hadn&#x27;t been for the annoyance mentioned, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have bothered to change it.    </li>
            <li> 5 years later, I purchased a Emjoi Light Caress Gold Corded Epilator and it works fabulously.</li>
            <li> At first it hurts</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m pretty used to it.</li>
            <li> and it is more than tolerable; especially after your first time doing it.</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews and decided to try this one as my first.</li>
            <li> It hurts for the first two runs and then I&#x27;m use to it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a solid product and a worthwhile investment.     </li>
            <li> The only thing that could make it better is if it was rechargeable/wireless.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with an epilator.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth not having to shave so much.</li>
            <li> and then the third time is even better.  </li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars only because I think that with this method, you get more ingrown hairs than with waxing or shaving.    </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be scared, use a cream and get rid of all the hair you want first then use this.  </li>
            <li> This is my first epilator</li>
            <li> The epilator is intimidating when you turn it on the first time</li>
            <li> I have to say I do think the massaging rollers help at first</li>
            <li> /&gt;Good luck ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katie</li>
            <li> The first time I would recommend using the rollers.</li>
            <li> My first time using the epilator</li>
            <li> I used it 2 days in a row because I missed hairs the first time.</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s working exactly as it should</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to everyone including first time users.</li>
            <li> The first was a torture device.  </li>
            <li> First weeks ..amazed ...</li>
            <li> So anybody with same diliema can order this product without concern :)</li>
            <li> I used the cold pack, which was really nice but after the very first instance of putting it to my skin the rest was a piece of cake, it didn&#x27;t hurt as much as I expected and it did a great job getting all my hairs!</li>
            <li> liked the interchangeable heads and other gadgets.</li>
            <li> I liked the interchangeable heads and other gadgets.</li>
            <li> It hurt quite a bit on the first use, but I don&#x27;t feel too much pain anymore.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much like everyone says it is for the \\&quot;things that suck\\&quot; list.</li>
            <li> One thing that some might find useful to know is that it&#x27;s neither whisper quite nor obtrusively loud - pretty much like an electric razor.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper then a wax, probably hurts just as much, and you don&#x27;t have to go in somewhere for someone else to do it.</li>
            <li> Well, I use it absolutely everywhere</li>
            <li> also learned a very helpful tip which is to epilate in a circular motion.</li>
            <li> I also learned a very helpful tip which is to epilate in a circular motion.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest this treatment if you have the money!</li>
            <li> I really like how it works.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> and now I am so glad I finally spent the money.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I decided to purchase this epilator, after it arrived I turned it on and with much trepidation I rolled it across my legs.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect.</li>
            <li> I can go a whole week without shaving my legs and that saves me tons of time.</li>
            <li> The pain isn&#x27;t as intense as when I used the Braun one</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t have too much</li>
            <li> /&gt;This makes waxing feel like a gentle massage.</li>
            <li> Oh and thanks to another reviewer mentioning 20% off BBB.   </li>
            <li> I remove the head for really course hairs, cause the massaging head sometimes misses them.</li>
            <li> is no worse than waxing.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> However, I think it does what it&#x27;s advertised to do and probably very well at that.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, some parts are more sensitive than others (like the back of my knee, for instance)    </li>
            <li> I had a hard time getting the right angles to get an effective run.</li>
            <li> They were impressed that it was SO difficult to battle this bout of MAJOR ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t attempt to do the full area because its close to my next wax and there is way too much to cover.</li>
            <li> There is a tiny bit of pain in sensitive areas, but I found it easily bearable.</li>
            <li> It is amazing if you can get past the pain.</li>
            <li> I wax the upper lip, underarms, forearms, legs, and full brazilian bikini.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that more people don&#x27;t use these; they have come such a long way from their first models.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a very very very long time (it seemed) of searing pain on both my underarms and legs, they still did not seem smooth.</li>
            <li> It helps the process go faster with better results plus it hurts a hell of a lot less too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It helps the process go faster with better results plus it hurts a hell of a lot less too.     </li>
            <li> Once most of the hair has been removed it hurts less.</li>
            <li> And the more often you use it, the less it hurts.</li>
            <li> I used the \\&quot;beginner\\&quot; head for overall epilating and then switched to \\&quot;big girl\\&quot; mode for finishing &amp; better results.</li>
            <li> I used the \\&quot;beginner\\&quot; head for overall epilating and then switched to \\&quot;big girl\\&quot; mode for finishing &amp; better results.</li>
            <li> If you can get past those first two times you will love it.</li>
            <li> When I saw that it was causing me to bleed, I quickly took this thing back to the store!</li>
            <li> As a male user I had never heard of or employed a &amp;#34;epilator&amp;#34; and wasn&#x27;t too sure how it actually worked.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get every single hair on my face, but it&#x27;s a huge improvement over shaving.</li>
            <li> Pulling the skin tight also helps a lot in reducing pain and getting better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pulling the skin tight also helps a lot in reducing pain and getting better results.     </li>
            <li> (and I have a high threshhold for pain).  </li>
            <li> I highly suggest this treatment if you have the money!e epilator</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.    </li>
            <li> I have a high tolerance for pain.</li>
            <li> i bought this epilator for my wife ,it is really brand new with its new cover,it has all the manfestition they describe ,and i get it at the time they said</li>
            <li> all the results were about on par with waxing except I have a little more stubble here and there.</li>
            <li> so I have to wait for it to grow out a little more.</li>
            <li> I took the other&#x27;s advice and had first waxed to get the first time hair removed for the first time</li>
            <li> I completely recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> If you are letting a little thing like excrutiating discomfort stop you from the joys of being hair free, then get rid of the excrutiating discomfort, not the epilator!    </li>
            <li> The fabulous little light is a big help</li>
            <li> and I had absolutely no bleeding with the Emjoi Light</li>
            <li> You have to go over each area several times, but it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> By the third time, it&#x27;s pretty much just \\&quot;discomfort\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> The second one did an okay job, but it was chargeable and didn&#x27;t hold a charge for very long.</li>
            <li> The leg portions don&#x27;t hurt me at all, but can sometimes leave my legs spotty and red for about a day before it goes back to being smooth just because I have sensitive skin in certain parts of my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am new at the underarm waxing, so maybe that is why my pain tolerance is lower.    </li>
            <li> But this new model has fullfilled my need</li>
            <li> Good-luck to new buyers</li>
            <li> fast speed setting but slow movement up the leg IS better   </li>
            <li> I have a fair completion and that may be why I&#x27;m also left with little red dots where the hairs used to be, and these never disappear either no matter what I try.</li>
            <li> You have to understand that I wax pretty much my entire body.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what my wife told me after using this for the first time, and she is now a former waxer.    </li>
            <li> reading the words excruciating so often prepared me to grit my teeth and cry the entire time I used it for the first time.</li>
            <li> It is the first and only epilator that I have ever owned, and I have no need or desire to find another epilator.  </li>
            <li> Originally I had wanted the 5270 model because of the extra shaver but wanted to get one locally</li>
            <li> It does take some time, especially when you are first getting used to it.  </li>
            <li> The first time I only did one leg</li>
            <li> My first experience was a dab on my ankle and back into the pouch it went.  </li>
            <li> at first do it in private</li>
            <li> so I take breaks when I finish one area and clean it out before starting the next area.  </li>
            <li> X&#x27;elle is the little light.  </li>
            <li> This product does a fine job and the pain in minimal, especially using the massaging head.</li>
            <li> It takes a few weeks to get completely hair free legs.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to use it very often, because the hair takes longer to grow back.</li>
            <li> As for underarms, I will admit, the pain was too much to take, so I am back to waxing.</li>
            <li> The hair on my legs is very course, I swear when I shave it comes back like a mans beard, so I epilate.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and waxing is not an option.</li>
            <li> After epilating the first time, going over the same areas was a joke on the pain scale, barely even felt it.</li>
            <li> I got it as a Black Friday special.</li>
            <li> is minimal and most importantly the pain is temporary getting less and less</li>
            <li> I took away one star because the Epilator has a tendency to break off some of the hairs especially around the knee area that I have to go back and clean up with tweezers later.</li>
            <li> It hurt the first few times and I really had to get used to it...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt - not even on my upper lip which was far too sensitive to use my old epilator on!</li>
            <li> In the previous models I always though, I wish it has a light, bcs you never can see well when you are doing the back of your calf.</li>
            <li> I purchased one of the original Epiladies many years ago and only used it a handful of times, it was much too painful to endure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that taking smaller strokes (about 4 inches, back and forth) really helps the tweezers to catch virtually every hair.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed that my hair grows back much more slowly and sparsely</li>
            <li> In the past I used to have an adapter which worked fine, but it an extra thing that one needs to buy if travelling.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll let you know that if you want smooth skin that will last for days-weeks (as you use continuously) there is no better option.</li>
            <li> am NOT a sensitive person and my hairs are not extremely thick</li>
            <li> While internet searching for the wax I stumbled upon all these different Epilators and I was so surprised because I didn&#x27;t even know they still made these.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been shaving for years and only had my eyebrows waxed twice, and tried shaving my legs once so this was completely out of depth for me.</li>
            <li> Also, it only took me 2 minutes max to shave in the shower, and this takes considerably longer.</li>
            <li> so you pores are open and your hair is soft and standing up.  </li>
            <li> I use product about once every 2 weeks and it barely hurts now.</li>
            <li> and I almost couldn&#x27;t do it even though I barely flinched using it anywhere else.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get as close as shaving, but well worth it because I don&#x27;t have to shave everyday now.</li>
            <li> I mean it won&#x27;t ever be totally painless especially on sensitive areas like the \\&quot;golden triangle of pain\\</li>
            <li> I mean it won&#x27;t ever be totally painless especially on sensitive areas like the \\&quot;golden triangle of pain\\</li>
            <li> It takes a lot less time to epilate than the first one I owned.</li>
            <li> Every week now I take it out after showering and have it work my legs and bikini area (which for me hurts less than the armpits) and I still feel pain but nothing like the first couple times.    </li>
            <li> It does, however keep hair from coming back quickly and the hair appears to come back in softer and less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Lastly, unless you are majorly into S&amp;M, don&#x27;t ever try this on your armpits.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time a few minutes ago.  </li>
            <li> I have established (at least for me) that it was not the best for hair removal, but what came after (a few weeks after) was much much worse.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t hurt me that bad, certain areas are more sensitive such as around my knees and inner thighs</li>
            <li> shower (and dry off completely) BEFORE you use it to soften your skins grip on your hair  3.</li>
            <li> but it was still worth toughing it out since the first time was really the only painful one.  </li>
            <li> The first use left my underarms red and raw, but I just bit the bullet and did it.</li>
            <li> Here is the link if you&#x27;re interested in how to get started with an epliator with the least amount of pain possible:    </li>
            <li> I was surprised at how little it actually hurt-</li>
            <li> I had been shaving daily because I have a lot of dark thick hair and it grows quickly.  </li>
            <li> bikini line was by far the most painful</li>
            <li> The recipient of this christmas gift was initially anxious and skeptical but ecstatic and a full convert after her first use.</li>
            <li> At least that is what happened to me.&lt;br /&gt;After stopping the use of the epilator all together for a whole year</li>
            <li> As a couple more weeks went by, I started to get very very deep and painful (and red)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wait too long.  </li>
            <li> BUT laser hair removal will save you in the long run...</li>
            <li> i gave it three stars as i have no way of knowing the long term results.  </li>
            <li> so I cannot go that long.</li>
            <li> cause the cord is long.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quicker, cleaner and simply less hassle in general.    </li>
            <li> but you still have to go over and over the same areas - it probably takes me 15 minutes to do both legs well; and it&#x27;s every other day, not every one or two weeks as some people have claimed on here.</li>
            <li> The next day I did the other leg</li>
            <li> I recently bought another one - Panasonic ES-WD51-P Epiglide Ladies Wet Dry Epilator, Pink - which has dual heads.</li>
            <li> I recently bought another one - Panasonic ES-WD51-P Epiglide Ladies Wet Dry Epilator, Pink - which has dual heads.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews, popped my advils, but this thing really hurt, especially around the ankles and behind the knee.</li>
            <li> My once beautiful legs are so scarred from such HORRIBLE ingrown hairs from using the epilator that I am ashamed to wear shorts or cute short dresses anymore :(</li>
            <li> no new ingrowing hair</li>
            <li> I was very wary of trying the Epilator because so many of the reviews focused on the pain.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was tired of spending money every few weeks waxing or shaving in the winter AND because being so busy it&#x27;s hard to fit in these appointments.  </li>
            <li> but the ice pack is dumb; I&#x27;d really rather have another attachment as I can get ice out of the freezer if needed.  </li>
            <li> and I hope this one lives as long as this other ones have.  </li>
            <li> If you find the pain too much, stick it out, take it slow and do a little at a time.  </li>
            <li> The pain is minimal, but maybe I feel that way because I have been waxing for over 18 years now.</li>
            <li> About as much as I expected it to.</li>
            <li> just a few left</li>
            <li> I loved the result, but I hated to keep buying and tossing them out.  </li>
            <li> They grown down deep into my skin and will only emerge as a small comedone.</li>
            <li> Even when hair begins to grow back, it is lighter with less stubble!</li>
            <li> positive note: it gets a LOT easier/less painful after the first few months</li>
            <li> My underarms were red and raw for days afterwards.</li>
            <li> After one $65 wax job that left many hairs behind and only lasted two weeks I was frustrated.  </li>
            <li> In order to buy an epilator I read a lot of reviews and looked at amazon and other places.</li>
            <li> The first armpit made me almost faint</li>
            <li> Yes, the pain and other things were just that detrimental.</li>
            <li> Surely I&#x27;m not the only one to have discovered numbing spray?!!</li>
            <li> So 2-3 ingrowing hair on one leg maybe 3-4 other leg (I must say i used other epilator and never had problem with ingrowing hair .. or never had any by shaving).&lt;br /&gt;Another</li>
            <li> However, my skin is extremely sensitive and it&#x27;s very uncomfortable to shave, so I tried the abrasion products that are new out.  </li>
            <li> I admit I was very afraid to use it since I am a throwback to the ice age in terms of body hair, but this is much better than shaving all the time.    </li>
            <li> Underarms sucked for the simple fact that they were hard to do.</li>
            <li> the only thing i find hard is the knees.</li>
            <li> Once you pull the hairs out for the first time, the second time is not so painful</li>
            <li> the bikini line along the thigh was no biggie, but oh BOY was I wrong when I thought I&#x27;d get the \\&quot;whole area\\&quot; epilated.</li>
            <li> It is not worth it for me to use this.</li>
            <li> I used both a couple times but not worth the money or hassle in my opinion.</li>
            <li> have dark body hair that shows through my skin even five minutes after I shave, but within two uses of this epilator, I can go three days before there is ANY hair visible.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dark thick hair on my legs, and after using this, even when the hair grows back you can&#x27;t see it!</li>
            <li> Then slowly move on to the next spot until you get all of the hair.</li>
            <li> but I also hate lower leg waxes the most.</li>
            <li> Once I had used the abrasion method, the hair wasn&#x27;t so thick and coarse, so after just a couple of epilator uses, I was smoother than ever!!</li>
            <li> I would get those black dots of hair under my skin after shaving, and I don&#x27;t have that in the eplated areas.</li>
            <li> I did get some sores that bled slightly, but after I got the hang of it</li>
            <li> This item was delivered in less time than promised.  </li>
            <li> but I can get them less often because I can use the epilator for easier to reach spots as needed.</li>
            <li> and I can shave with significantly less razor bumps</li>
            <li> If you pull the skin tight in the area you use it on it hurts less.</li>
            <li> I bought this after getting sick of having to use my Australian-bought Epilator (which required a step-up power convertor, a heavy black box that pretty much limited my epilator use to the room where the converter was located).</li>
            <li> (and I did, for sure) on a long term basis, but instead I started to get terrible ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> When hairs are pulled it feels like a little pop.</li>
            <li> I ended up paying a little over $300 for three treatments of laser hair removal.</li>
            <li> I ended up paying a little over $300 for three treatments of laser hair removal.</li>
            <li> I have been using this little machine about once a week for 30 minutes and it has changed my life.  </li>
            <li> Pass after pass after pass just wouldn&#x27;t grab those little hair and my legs still felt prickly.</li>
            <li> It does take a while to use and it hurts a little</li>
            <li> Ingrowing hair is a big problem and is very hard to get rid of.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> At least you could no longer see the thick black hairs on my pasty white</li>
            <li> Some reviewers have had painful experiences - my better half says its no-where near as painful as waxing, for example underarm hair.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that it may be too painful to be worth the results.</li>
            <li> The second time isn&#x27;t anywhere near as painful.</li>
            <li> Just put against your skin and leave it on that spot for a few moments as the tweezers get the hairs.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to wait for it all to grow out, I can remove a few at a time as they grow in.</li>
            <li> + every few weeks</li>
            <li> I bought this intending to save some time by not having to shave my legs everyday, but that&#x27;s not working out for me.</li>
            <li> The result is that my legs are never smooth like when I was shaving.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had quite a few kidney stones</li>
            <li> Exfoliate with a scruby a few days after so you don&#x27;t get ingrown hairs  4.</li>
            <li> I was sweating AND crying trying to do it)</li>
            <li> I would agree with one review that says to start with recently shaved legs and go over them once a day (in the evening as it does leave behind re bumps)until all of the hairs have been removed.</li>
            <li> few months passed</li>
            <li> and this information is not available any where on this site as well as Braun&#x27;s site.  </li>
            <li> All I have to say is USE THE ICE PACK if you&#x27;re having trouble with pain.</li>
            <li> It is a little painful the first time</li>
            <li> It was humiliating and just plain gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it on the thick, dark hair on my arms and the bit of fuzz on my belly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tired of doing the 6 week growth cycles that leave you looking like the wilds of africa for at least the last two weeks or so.</li>
            <li> A bit painful the first couple if times, but no need to shave everyday anymore!</li>
            <li> I read some people can go 4 weeks, but I have thick black hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pregnant and really hate shaving</li>
            <li> The only place I&#x27;ve ever waxed is my brows; unless you count my one failed at-home attempt to do legs -that was painful, after the first strip I was done.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know of any epilators that aren&#x27;t painful, but the Braun epilator if fast and requires fewer pass overs than past epilators.</li>
            <li> I asked for Braun Silk Epil for this past Christmas.  </li>
            <li> Now, this is a relatively small area</li>
            <li> It also comes with a cooling pack and a easy holder for it, it helped, but I was too lazy to keep it cold and was afraid I would forget it in the freezer</li>
            <li> /&gt;I started with my forearms because the hair is very thin and blonde.</li>
            <li> I have tough, black, course hair.  </li>
            <li> I realized I was pressing against my face too hard.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever have to shave</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, if you have dark hair like me and you&#x27;re just looking for a way to make it less visible and thinner to make shaving less of a painful and ineffective ordeal, this is probably what you&#x27;re after.</li>
            <li> I find I have to use the epilator at least twice a week.  </li>
            <li> and if I do it every week then there is less for it to pull out, cutting down on the pain.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m familiar with horrible, prolonged pain.</li>
            <li> I MEAN RIPPING.</li>
            <li> My razor bumps have disappeared and no more ingrown hairs!</li>
            <li> and I seriously wish I&#x27;d have found out about these things sooner.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, i wax and everything</li>
            <li> I seriously checked the epilator for chunky bits of flesh and blood.</li>
            <li> I continued using this thing for a few weeks thinking that I would eventually grab all those nasty little hairs if I used it daily</li>
            <li> It rips the hairs so hard that beginners will need a band-aid!</li>
            <li> read so many reviews before I bought this that ranged from calling this product too painful to use,to being a miracle hair remover that ends the necessity of shaving, to an evil skin ruining device.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any broken hairs.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product because I was tired of going for a wax every 2 to 3 weeks</li>
            <li> I have waxed under my arms before without incident and found that to be WAY less painful than this thing.</li>
            <li> I went into this preparing for the worst and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I think the bit-by-bit tweezing of that area would be too painful, at least for me</li>
            <li> but the cord isn&#x27;t too difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> This was the least painful of them all because I&#x27;ve been doing this the longest.</li>
            <li> I have had this epilator for just shy of three years now.  </li>
            <li> but I do like this thing as I still use it, sadly, almost every day.</li>
            <li> It is so disturbing to see it happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so WE (my dermatologists and I) can&#x27;t figure out what went wrong.</li>
            <li> so, after moving to U.S, it became useless.</li>
            <li> (and I am a very tough consumer to please)</li>
            <li> My legs on the other hand were the worst</li>
            <li> Also, I can see how this would hurt like the dickens if you hadn&#x27;t done this step and started cold turkey.  </li>
            <li> however, when I tried the bikini and leg area this thing was ripping hair like crazy and</li>
            <li> and now i am afraid that the result will be growing hair.  </li>
            <li> Numb too.  </li>
            <li> This product hurts like crazy.</li>
            <li> I like it instead of shaving because razors can be very expensive.</li>
            <li> To my surprise, it wasn&#x27;t so bad</li>
            <li> Bad but not unbearable.</li>
            <li> , so bad in fact that I stopped using the epilator</li>
            <li> It is painful but tolerable.</li>
            <li> It was so painful.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it is extremely painful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit painful on the underarms</li>
            <li> I have shaved for years and always hated the results.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use on armpits/upper pubic area if you can help it (very very painful..</li>
            <li> Terrible!</li>
            <li> The time you use it is the worst.  </li>
            <li> That in itself is VERY annoying!</li>
            <li> /&gt;But here is the worst part.</li>
            <li> disgusting ingrown hairs all over my body.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I waited to review until I&#x27;d had this for some months. The pain is negligible. When hairs are pulled it feels like a little pop. There is a tiny bit of pain in sensitive areas, but I found it easily bearable. In my experience, the hair does not grow back softer. This means that I&#x27;ll never have perfectly smooth legs as I did from shaving. I am so delighted to get the process out of the shower and into a nice, comfy chair that I don&#x27;t care. You have to go over each area several times, but it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about it, other than my wife is very, very happy with it.  That&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li> I bought the Braun 5180 Silk-Epil X&#x27;elle Easy Start Epilator after my old Panasonic died.  I had read the many rave reviews and thought that is was priced in the medium range (and a reasonable price for the Braun brand).  I am very satisfied with this purchase!  I use it on the thick, dark hair on my arms and the bit of fuzz on my belly.  I&#x27;ve found that taking smaller strokes (about 4 inches, back and forth) really helps the tweezers to catch virtually every hair.  The light, something I originally thought I wouldn&#x27;t need, is incredibly helpful.  I have not noticed any broken hairs.  Sure, it is not a comfy experience -- but it&#x27;s not horrible.  However, I do not plan to use this on my bikini area-- I think the bit-by-bit tweezing of that area would be too painful, at least for me (and I have a high threshhold for pain).  Unlike my old Panasonic, it is very easy to clean.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I think my favorite part about this product is the smart light feature.  It hurt quite a bit on the first use, but I don&#x27;t feel too much pain anymore.  The cooling pad didn&#x27;t help at all but it was still worth toughing it out since the first time was really the only painful one.  My biggest gripe about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t do a good job on fine hair.  It does, however keep hair from coming back quickly and the hair appears to come back in softer and less noticeable.  I also wish that this product could be used without the cord but the cord isn&#x27;t too difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of different kinds of epilators but this is the best one I&#x27;ve used so far. At first it hurts but then when you get used to it it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I bought this after getting sick of having to use my Australian-bought Epilator (which required a step-up power convertor, a heavy black box that pretty much limited my epilator use to the room where the converter was located). My Australian-bought Epilator was easily 10 years old, and if it hadn&#x27;t been for the annoyance mentioned, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have bothered to change it.    I LOVE this product! It has a light! It doesn&#x27;t hurt - not even on my upper lip which was far too sensitive to use my old epilator on! I haven&#x27;t even used the ice pack + glove provided as just the epilator alone is so painless. Note: I&#x27;ve been using an epilator for 10 years so I&#x27;m pretty used to it. That being said, I felt nothing with this one - the vibaration of the rollers was all I could feel. The first time I used it I had to keep stopping to check that it was removing the hair!    All up: I recommend this product (I&#x27;m wishing I&#x27;d upgraded sooner!).</li>
            <li> I purchased one of the original Epiladies many years ago and only used it a handful of times, it was much too painful to endure. In less than 20 minutes I successfully finished both legs. The ice glove was definitely a bonus and although it wasn&#x27;t painless, it was tolerable and I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pregnant and really hate shaving and I got one of these so I didn&#x27;t have to. It is amazing if you can get past the pain. I could only manage to get the front of my legs and it took me HOURS. Considering I&#x27;m pregnant, my skin is extra sensitive, probably wasn&#x27;t a good idea to start epilating now haha. I&#x27;ve never been waxed, so I couldn&#x27;t compare it. After epilating the first time, going over the same areas was a joke on the pain scale, barely even felt it. I have extremely dark thick hair on my legs, and after using this, even when the hair grows back you can&#x27;t see it! I would get those black dots of hair under my skin after shaving, and I don&#x27;t have that in the eplated areas. So, all things considered, this thing is AMAZING, but you have to be able to get past the pain. It&#x27;s cheaper then a wax, probably hurts just as much, and you don&#x27;t have to go in somewhere for someone else to do it. It also comes with a cooling pack and a easy holder for it, it helped, but I was too lazy to keep it cold and was afraid I would forget it in the freezer so I didn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> After reading the 1 star reviews (which I suggest everyone do even if a product has only one or two of them) I was concerned that it may be too painful to be worth the results. Well, I use it absolutely everywhere and it is more than tolerable; especially after your first time doing it. The second time isn&#x27;t anywhere near as painful. I&#x27;m a transsexual woman and I&#x27;ve even used it on my face. I did get some sores that bled slightly, but after I got the hang of it I realized I was pressing against my face too hard. It doesn&#x27;t get every single hair on my face, but it&#x27;s a huge improvement over shaving. Another important tip for use: don&#x27;t make sweeping motions with the device. Just put against your skin and leave it on that spot for a few moments as the tweezers get the hairs. Then slowly move on to the next spot until you get all of the hair.</li>
            <li> This product is really good. it does wot it promises to do !!! I like the fact that the hair growth is slower and lesser after it&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator I have ever owned. I read a lot of reviews and decided to try this one as my first. It&#x27;s pretty much like everyone says it is for the \\&quot;things that suck\\&quot; list. But it beats all the money I spend on waxing. You have to understand that I wax pretty much my entire body. I wax the upper lip, underarms, forearms, legs, and full brazilian bikini. So basically I spend a lot of time and money getting hair ripped out. Why I wanted an epilator was simple... save money on waxing and keep results for longer periods of time. I&#x27;m tired of doing the 6 week growth cycles that leave you looking like the wilds of africa for at least the last two weeks or so. Plus I was having more hair break than pulled out all the way so I was getting ingrowns like no one&#x27;s business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started with my forearms because the hair is very thin and blonde. If it can&#x27;t get this hair out then it won&#x27;t get the rest. The pain was on par with waxing. It hurts for the first two runs and then I&#x27;m use to it. Underarms sucked for the simple fact that they were hard to do. I had a hard time getting the right angles to get an effective run. Took longer than I expected but the results were good. Then I moved onto my bikini line but did not attempt the full brazilian. This was the least painful of them all because I&#x27;ve been doing this the longest. I didn&#x27;t attempt to do the full area because its close to my next wax and there is way too much to cover. I figure one more wax and the maintenance should be a breeze. My legs on the other hand were the worst but I also hate lower leg waxes the most. There were areas where I had a tear or two squeeze out but it&#x27;s also like that when I wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all the results were about on par with waxing except I have a little more stubble here and there. I think that&#x27;s only because hair grows in patchy cycles. I think some of the stubble was too short to begin with so I have to wait for it to grow out a little more. I think I will be able to get use to the epilator the more I use it. I mean it won&#x27;t ever be totally painless especially on sensitive areas like the \\&quot;golden triangle of pain\\&quot; brazilians are known for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the interchangeable heads and other gadgets. I used the \\&quot;beginner\\&quot; head for overall epilating and then switched to \\&quot;big girl\\&quot; mode for finishing &amp; better results. Pulling the skin tight also helps a lot in reducing pain and getting better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely not for everyone. If you don&#x27;t like waxing because of the pain... then I suggest not even looking at epilators. If you are a veteran waxer then I suggest starting off with this one just to see if you like it. From there you can always work up the line and see if you find anything better. Good luck! &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been a couple months since I bought this epilator. I recently bought another one - Panasonic ES-WD51-P Epiglide Ladies Wet Dry Epilator, Pink - which has dual heads. I use the panasonic for the first run just to get most of the hair then I go back with the braun for detailing. I use the braun more than the panasonic because I still think it does a much better job at getting every thing. Also a lot of the hair has stopped growing back ever since I started epilating unlike when I waxed. I think the waxing just broke the hairs off in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also learned a very helpful tip which is to epilate in a circular motion. It helps the process go faster with better results plus it hurts a hell of a lot less too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I stopped doing my full brazilian bikini fun. Not because I gave up... oh h*ll no! Its because I won! I ended up paying a little over $300 for three treatments of laser hair removal. I don&#x27;t have to wax or epilate that area ever again. I highly suggest this treatment if you have the money!e epilator the more I use it.

            <li> This item was delivered in less time than promised.  I really like how it works.  It is a little painful the first time but I got used to it quickly and now don&#x27;t even think about the discomfort.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I don&#x27;t know why women wax, it&#x27;s crazy!\\&quot;   That&#x27;s what my wife told me after using this for the first time, and she is now a former waxer.    Oh behalf of her I&#x27;ll let you know that if you want smooth skin that will last for days-weeks (as you use continuously) there is no better option. Some reviewers have had painful experiences - my better half says its no-where near as painful as waxing, for example underarm hair. It&#x27;s quicker, cleaner and simply less hassle in general.    The recipient of this christmas gift was initially anxious and skeptical but ecstatic and a full convert after her first use. As a result I&#x27;m just as happy!!    So, if you&#x27;re thinking of purchasing this - go ahead, don&#x27;t hesitate. It&#x27;s a solid product and a worthwhile investment.     One thing that some might find useful to know is that it&#x27;s neither whisper quite nor obtrusively loud - pretty much like an electric razor. The only thing that could make it better is if it was rechargeable/wireless.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with an epilator.  I got it for my bikini line. So far, I&#x27;m very pleased. It is painful but tolerable. It&#x27;s worth not having to shave so much. Product easy to use and seems to be good quality.</li>
            <li> I have now owned 2 epilators. I loved my first one too, but, I really really love this one!! It takes a lot less time to epilate than the first one I owned. I won&#x27;t lie it does hurt the first two times you&#x27;ll use it unless you already have fine hair, but I will tell you the more I&#x27;ve used it the finer the hair has become and it doesn&#x27;t hurt anymore.If you can get past those first two times you will love it. I will tell you, that you do want to exfoliate before and after and then use a moisturizer. The exfoliating helps to get the hair to stand up. I would definitely recommend this one. Hope this helps anyone who has been considering buying and Epilator. I have shaved for years and always hated the results. I have darker hair, so even when I shaved it was still embarrassing to show my legs. They still didn&#x27;t look or feel smooth. The epilator has helped the hair get thinner and lighter the more I have used it and I don&#x27;t have to use it very often, because the hair takes longer to grow back.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I bought this product! I got it as a Black Friday special. I had been thinking about getting one for a while and now I am so glad I finally spent the money. I pay for waxing every month because it is nice to be hair free for a longer period of time than shaving allows. I used it on my under arms and the hair was removed easily. It did hurt but I would compare it to waxing. Once most of the hair has been removed it hurts less. Now that I have this method of hair removal at home I don&#x27;t have to wait for it all to grow out, I can remove a few at a time as they grow in. I also used this on my bikini area. It is more difficult because of all the angles. I still get the bikini wax but I can get them less often because I can use the epilator for easier to reach spots as needed. In conclusion, I am really happy with this product. I save money because I don&#x27;t have to go get waxed as often.</li>
            <li> After shaving and not shaving for years and having razor bumps and rashes I decided to start waxing no matter what the cost.  After one $65 wax job that left many hairs behind and only lasted two weeks I was frustrated.  I then decided to buy the wax and do it myself at home.  While internet searching for the wax I stumbled upon all these different Epilators and I was so surprised because I didn&#x27;t even know they still made these.  I remember the 80&#x27;s version and the torture they produced.  After reading many reviews I decided to try this mid-priced Braun model and I was instantly happy.  This machine works terrific!  It picks up all my hairs and the pain is minimal and most importantly the pain is temporary getting less and less the more you use it.  I took the other&#x27;s advice and had first waxed to get the first time hair removed for the first time and I think this is THE KEY TO THE SUCCESS OF THIS PROCESS!!!!!!!  I also shower just before and exfoliate regularly to minimize in-grown hairs.  I have been using this little machine about once a week for 30 minutes and it has changed my life.  I really love it and frankly, this is the first review I have ever been moved to write.  The one down-size I can see it that your legs are never as smooth as with shaving to the touch, but you can&#x27;t see any hair and that is all I need.  If you find the pain too much, stick it out, take it slow and do a little at a time.  Once you pull the hairs out for the first time, the second time is not so painful and then the third time is even better.  On most of my legs I don&#x27;t feel anything at all and I&#x27;ve been using this machine for about 3 months.  I Don&#x27;t mind the noise and love the light.  I can&#x27;t believe that more people don&#x27;t use these; they have come such a long way from their first models.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I decided to purchase this epilator, after it arrived I turned it on and with much trepidation I rolled it across my legs. I was surprised at how little it actually hurt- reading the words excruciating so often prepared me to grit my teeth and cry the entire time I used it for the first time. I&#x27;d been shaving for years and only had my eyebrows waxed twice, and tried shaving my legs once so this was completely out of depth for me. I used the cold pack, which was really nice but after the very first instance of putting it to my skin the rest was a piece of cake, it didn&#x27;t hurt as much as I expected and it did a great job getting all my hairs! I would recommend this to anyone!!</li>
            <li> I have had this epilator for just shy of three years now.  It is the first and only epilator that I have ever owned, and I have no need or desire to find another epilator.  Because I haven&#x27;t owned another one I can&#x27;t compare models or brands.  All I can say is that I really do love this epilator and it does everything I need it to.  I started to do a write up on the best way to get started with an epilator, but found it to be WAY too long.  So instead I put it in a blog post.  Here is the link if you&#x27;re interested in how to get started with an epliator with the least amount of pain possible:    [...]    I highly recommend this epilator, three years and still going strong!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I was tired of going for a wax every 2 to 3 weeks and I don&#x27;t like shaving every day.  I have to say, I am very happy!! The end result is as good as waxing can be, which is to say, you might end up with some strays here and there, but all in all it is a very nice job.    The pain is minimal, but maybe I feel that way because I have been waxing for over 18 years now. I have to admit, some parts are more sensitive than others (like the back of my knee, for instance)    As for underarms, I will admit, the pain was too much to take, so I am back to waxing. I am new at the underarm waxing, so maybe that is why my pain tolerance is lower.    I gave it 4 stars only because I think that with this method, you get more ingrown hairs than with waxing or shaving.    All in all, this is a great product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I think that the Braun epilator is great! The efficiency of epilators have greatly improved through the years. I don&#x27;t know of any epilators that aren&#x27;t painful, but the Braun epilator if fast and requires fewer pass overs than past epilators. And the more often you use it, the less it hurts.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was tired of spending money every few weeks waxing or shaving in the winter AND because being so busy it&#x27;s hard to fit in these appointments.  I LOVE THIS THING!!!   I used it for the first time a few minutes ago.  This is what I did.  I used Veet about two weeks ago, now the hair in the bikini area is starting to grow back so I attacked.  I did use the ice pack, but only once and then didn&#x27;t need it. I don&#x27;t think it hurt at all, but I did use the depilatory cream to make the hair sparser, shorter.  Also, I can see how this would hurt like the dickens if you hadn&#x27;t done this step and started cold turkey.  Don&#x27;t do that.  My bikini area is completely smooth.  After about 1 minute I even switched from the \\&quot;beginner\\&quot; head to the one with more tweezers.  No problem.  Don&#x27;t be scared, use a cream and get rid of all the hair you want first then use this.  Don&#x27;t wait too long.  It is so totally worth it.  Now I don&#x27;t have to spend $40+ every few weeks and I don&#x27;t have to put it off in the winter!</li>
            <li> My wife was scared of these things, but after a few minutes, she got the hang of using it and absolutely loves it. Great product!</li>
            <li> I bought this intending to save some time by not having to shave my legs everyday, but that&#x27;s not working out for me. I&#x27;m not even that hairy but after more than a year of use it seems my hair growth cycle refuses to play nice and synch up. The result is that my legs are never smooth like when I was shaving. If it&#x27;s not stray hairs, then it&#x27;s ingrown hairs - just bumps all the time, even after daily before and after exfoliating. I have a fair completion and that may be why I&#x27;m also left with little red dots where the hairs used to be, and these never disappear either no matter what I try. Even using tendskin didn&#x27;t help. Also, it only took me 2 minutes max to shave in the shower, and this takes considerably longer. The fabulous little light is a big help but you still have to go over and over the same areas - it probably takes me 15 minutes to do both legs well; and it&#x27;s every other day, not every one or two weeks as some people have claimed on here. Additionally, I haven&#x27;t noticed the hair growing back in any lighter or softer either. I&#x27;m beginging to think I&#x27;m some kind of freak bc reading the majority of posts on here no one else seems to be having these problems.    Lastly, unless you are majorly into S&amp;M, don&#x27;t ever try this on your armpits. Terrible! God bless the women and their intestinal fortitude that could stand to see it all the way through. Even after reading all the ways to physically (and pharmaceuticaly) prep for it I still almost passed out 1/4 of the way through. My underarms were red and raw for days afterwards. I have waxed under my arms before without incident and found that to be WAY less painful than this thing. I don&#x27;t consider myself to have a low threshold for pain either. I haven&#x27;t had any kids but I&#x27;ve had quite a few kidney stones so I&#x27;m familiar with horrible, prolonged pain. Kidney stones are a walk in the park compared to this thing against under arm hair. It didn&#x27;t hurt at all on my legs or bikini line, but that was just the line mind you. After the armpit fiasco I didn&#x27;t dare take it in any closer.    It might not seem like it but I do like this thing as I still use it, sadly, almost every day. FYI If you&#x27;re buying this for smoothness or saving time you might want to save your money.</li>
            <li> I asked for Braun Silk Epil for this past Christmas.  I admit I was very afraid to use it since I am a throwback to the ice age in terms of body hair, but this is much better than shaving all the time.    The time you use it is the worst.  It is best to plan it for a weekend morning and take a shower or bath so you pores are open and your hair is soft and standing up.  When doing it for the first or second time, just do small sections on the slowest speed.  It will take you a while, that is why I suggest doing it on a day off.  It is also best for me to do it when the sun is up, because my hair is blond.  If I do it at night I notice I miss a lot of hairs.    I do my legs, arms, and arm pits, and during the winter was doing maintenance once a week, now that the warm weather is here I find I have to use the epilator at least twice a week.  I find the product very worthwhile.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator and I seriously wish I&#x27;d have found out about these things sooner.  I had been shaving daily because I have a lot of dark thick hair and it grows quickly.  The only place I&#x27;ve ever waxed is my brows; unless you count my one failed at-home attempt to do legs -that was painful, after the first strip I was done.  The epilator is intimidating when you turn it on the first time but it didn&#x27;t hurt me that bad, certain areas are more sensitive such as around my knees and inner thighs made me want to cry.  By the third time, it&#x27;s pretty much just \\&quot;discomfort\\&quot;.  I have used it on my legs, toes, upper lip, chin, and tried it on my arm but I&#x27;m sticking to shaving there for a while.  Originally I had wanted the 5270 model because of the extra shaver but wanted to get one locally so I had to settle on this one.  I have to say I do think the massaging rollers help at first but the ice pack is dumb; I&#x27;d really rather have another attachment as I can get ice out of the freezer if needed.  I love the light and I like that the unit is corded so I do not have to worry about if it is charged or not.  It does take some time, especially when you are first getting used to it.  My only concern is that after using it a while, the unit seems to heat up so I take breaks when I finish one area and clean it out before starting the next area.  You will want to use it at night or on a day you will be wearing pants as your legs (or wherever you use it) will be red afterward.      P.S.  If anyone has tips for using it on your chin, I&#x27;d much appreciate it as I&#x27;m scared of catching my skin.</li>
            <li> SO I had never used one of these things before. I have never even waxed before. I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect. In order to buy an epilator I read a lot of reviews and looked at amazon and other places. Here is my verdict:    1 This thing hurts... a lot! I read the reviews, popped my advils, but this thing really hurt, especially around the ankles and behind the knee. The first time I only did one leg and it took forever because I kept taking breaks.    2. After the one leg I decided to the armpit because I figured if I could do that I could do anything. Now, this is a relatively small area but it took me about 30 minutes. The machine would audibly rip out the hair and drew blood. It was so painful. I finished the armpit and quit.    3. The next day I did the other leg but I will never do the armpit. The first armpit made me almost faint so I decided against it.    4. A week later after giving myself a pep talk and chastised myself for already spending the money, I took it out again for maintenance on the legs. To my surprise, it wasn&#x27;t so bad and it was a lot quicker.    5. Every week now I take it out after showering and have it work my legs and bikini area (which for me hurts less than the armpits) and I still feel pain but nothing like the first couple times.    Aside from the pain, this thing is awesome. It really does leave my legs nice and smooth and if I do it every week then there is less for it to pull out, cutting down on the pain. I can go a whole week without shaving my legs and that saves me tons of time. I still shave the armpits but it is quick. I highly recommend this product.    Just not for the armpits!</li>
            <li> I purchased this epilator awhile back from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. It was my very first epilator. Let&#x27;s just say the experience I had with this Braun epilator left me to not try another epilator for 5 years. Yes, the pain and other things were just that detrimental. I followed the directions to a T...however, when I tried the bikini and leg area this thing was ripping hair like crazy and I MEAN RIPPING. It rips the hairs so hard that beginners will need a band-aid! OUCH! When I saw that it was causing me to bleed, I quickly took this thing back to the store! 5 years later, I purchased a Emjoi Light Caress Gold Corded Epilator and it works fabulously. The pain isn&#x27;t as intense as when I used the Braun one and I had absolutely no bleeding with the Emjoi Light Caress Gold Corded Epilator. I use it all over...(arms, underarms, legs, bikini, stomach, upper lip...LOL) Also, the Emjoi Light Caress Gold Corded Epilator was a lot cheaper on folica 49.99 and free shipping plus it has all the bells and whistles of this one without the PAIN!</li>
            <li> I bought this product and used it all the time (no shaving ever again) for an entire year.  It hurt the first few times and I really had to get used to it... The pain DOES go away after a while I promise.  What they don&#x27;t tell you though is that you will suffer from ingrown hairs forever to come. At least that is what happened to me.&lt;br /&gt;After stopping the use of the epilator all together for a whole year + I am STILL suffering and can&#x27;t seem to get the hairs to grow the right way again.  They grown down deep into my skin and will only emerge as a small comedone. When that comedone is extracted a 1/2\\&quot; - 1\\&quot; hair comes out with it. It is so disturbing to see it happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am NOT a sensitive person and my hairs are not extremely thick so WE (my dermatologists and I) can&#x27;t figure out what went wrong. I have been to several different doctors who all agreed that they will NEVER let their patients use an epilator ...EVER.  They were impressed that it was SO difficult to battle this bout of MAJOR ingrown hairs. They tried everything and finally my team of doctors told me that at this point with all of the scarring and suffering the ONLY solution is Laser hair removal. My once beautiful legs are so scarred from such HORRIBLE ingrown hairs from using the epilator that I am ashamed to wear shorts or cute short dresses anymore :( ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE PLEASE think twice before putting yourself through this.  We all want silky smooth legs etc... BUT laser hair removal will save you in the long run... I can promise you that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katie</li>
            <li> Great product , you can&#x27;t miss a spot and last very long time , leaves you with smooth skin .&lt;br /&gt;I read reviews of multiple products before purchasing this item, this is it , reasonable price for a great product .</li>
            <li> i gave it three stars as i have no way of knowing the long term results.  not having a lot of hair (waxing all my life), it was a joke for me.  no pain whatsoever but i am worried that it&#x27;s shaving and not pulling out the hair.  i don&#x27;t have too much and now i am afraid that the result will be growing hair.  pls advise. thank you!  should i still use it?  i am not joking about the pain, didn&#x27;t feel any.</li>
            <li> This works great on the little chin hairs, I thought it would hurt more but it is quite tolerable.  Of course it works great on the legs.</li>
            <li> i bought this epilator for my wife ,it is really brand new with its new cover,it has all the manfestition they describe ,and i get it at the time they said</li>
            <li> Works fantastic! Pulls out the hair like nobodies business. No messing with goo, or having to buy anything ever again. I would give it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it hurts. Bad but not unbearable. About as much as I expected it to. I knew that going into the purchase and so should anyone looking to buy one.</li>
            <li> The product works well! I like it a lot, it hurts kind of, but eh you get used to it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product several times. The first time I would recommend using the rollers. It won&#x27;t get as close but you can go over again with the expert head later. Otherwise it is extremely painful. My first time using the epilator I used it 2 days in a row because I missed hairs the first time. I use product about once every 2 weeks and it barely hurts now. About the same as plucking my eyebrows. I read some people can go 4 weeks, but I have thick black hair so I cannot go that long. It doesn&#x27;t get as close as shaving, but well worth it because I don&#x27;t have to shave everyday now. I have only used this product on my legs.</li>
            <li> I like the product and I think it&#x27;s working exactly as it should but now I&#x27;ve been using it for a while I have four tips:  1. fast speed setting but slow movement up the leg IS better   2. shower (and dry off completely) BEFORE you use it to soften your skins grip on your hair  3. Exfoliate with a scruby a few days after so you don&#x27;t get ingrown hairs  4. don&#x27;t use on armpits/upper pubic area if you can help it (very very painful..I was sweating AND crying trying to do it) - it finally worked but I had to do it in 3 stages over 2 weeks.    this product helps me understand the \\&quot;beauty&#x3D;pain\\&quot; adage.    positive note: it gets a LOT easier/less painful after the first few months</li>
            <li> The epilator works well but I seem to have to use it almost every day!! That in itself is VERY annoying! It seems to miss hairs and I have to keep going over a million times for it to finally grab it. I like it instead of shaving because razors can be very expensive. I would buy it again, but I wish I was hairless longer!</li>
            <li> Pain Pain Pain and it doesn&#x27;t get any better&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This makes waxing feel like a gentle massage. They say with regular use it gets more comfortable. They Lie !!!</li>
            <li> Good product, however it needs a direct wall connection for best use. Saw a reduction in power when using from a power strip</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T BUY THIS PRODUCT!! Seriously, i wax and everything so my pain threshold isn&#x27;t that low, but i couldn&#x27;t use this on my legs, let alone anywhere else!  I can&#x27;t believe in this day and age that they haven&#x27;t invented one of these that is bearable.  Do not buy it.  You will not use it.</li>
            <li> Having tried the original Epilady way back when, I was more than hesitant to buy another epilator. My first experience was a dab on my ankle and back into the pouch it went.  Never attempted that again!   However, my skin is extremely sensitive and it&#x27;s very uncomfortable to shave, so I tried the abrasion products that are new out.  I loved the result, but I hated to keep buying and tossing them out.  I decided to combine epilation and the smooth away type produts and couldn&#x27;t be happier!!  Once I had used the abrasion method, the hair wasn&#x27;t so thick and coarse, so after just a couple of epilator uses, I was smoother than ever!! This is the first summer that I have been able to go to a pool with a moment&#x27;s notice--no going home to shave and break out afterwards.  I completely recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I used to own a Braun Epilator that I bought 6 years ago.  I had another Braun before that lived for 6 years.  I use this machine every two weeks on a regular basis, for every thing, my underarms, legs.  It is perfect and what I like about the last model Epil X&#x27;elle is the little light.  In the previous models I always though, I wish it has a light, bcs you never can see well when you are doing the back of your calf. But this new model has fullfilled my need and I hope this one lives as long as this other ones have.  Oh and bcs I travel internationally, I love also that the new model has the capability of working in 220 Volt as well, all you need is a plate so it fits in the socket of the visiting country.  In the past I used to have an adapter which worked fine, but it an extra thing that one needs to buy if travelling.  To me (and I am a very tough consumer to please) this is the BEST epilator EVER.</li>
            <li> OK well I had a coupon and I would like to wear shorts this summer.  I have never had any problem growing hair. Feeling adventurous so I tried it on my face and neck.  I figured gosh I&#x27;ve always plucked and waxed my face and neck what&#x27;s the difference?  Felt great getting the hair turbo tweezed and it didn&#x27;t hurt much at all.  Now the underarm feet and forearms are a different story.  Yowsa!!!  So much more pleasant that waxing.  I haven&#x27;t done my legs yet..maybe I&#x27;ll actually use the cooling mitt for my legs see if that makes it any easier.  In a nutshell I will and do recomend this epilator.  Can&#x27;t beat the results for the price.  Oh and thanks to another reviewer mentioning 20% off BBB.   *wink*</li>
            <li> After my Epilady finally died after 20 years of use, I had to purchase a replacement. I bought another  Epilady -not the coil type again but the tweezers- however it did not remove hairs even after going over the leg repeatedly. It broke after using it only two times. After reading the reviews on most products I decided to get the Braun 5180 Silk-Epil X&#x27;elle Easy Start Epilator. I have used this Braun several times and it is so fast and painless with excellent results. It&#x27;s a bit painful on the underarms but hopefully after time the pain will subside. I would recommend this product to everyone including first time users.</li>
            <li> This is my fourth epilator, and it&#x27;s the best one yet! The hair on my legs is very course, I swear when I shave it comes back like a mans beard, so I epilate. And this epilator does a great job, even on my hairy legs!!</li>
            <li> Surely I&#x27;m not the only one to have discovered numbing spray?!! You can buy it here on Amazon! I wouldn&#x27;t be able to epilate without it!  I also take a couple of ibuprophen about 30 minutes before.  I got the idea from a hair removal technician back when I was trying laser hair removal, which didn&#x27;t work for me. As for the spray, they use it for waxing, you can get creams like Dr.Numb too.  Anything that has lidocaine (sp) in it seems to work, and it&#x27;s all over the counter stuff!  I actually got mine at Sally&#x27;s.    If you are letting a little thing like excrutiating discomfort stop you from the joys of being hair free, then get rid of the excrutiating discomfort, not the epilator!    This product has totally rocked my world!!!</li>
            <li> This is the third Epilator I have purchased.  The first was a torture device.  The second one did an okay job, but it was chargeable and didn&#x27;t hold a charge for very long. (One quarter of a leg) The Braun 5180 is great.  I have tough, black, course hair.  This product does a fine job and the pain in minimal, especially using the massaging head. I even use it on my armpits.  It has to be plugged in to use, which is okay, cause the cord is long.  I remove the head for really course hairs, cause the massaging head sometimes misses them.</li>
            <li> I was very wary of trying the Epilator because so many of the reviews focused on the pain. I went into this preparing for the worst and was pleasantly surprised. I am using the Epilator on my legs under arms and bikini area and the pain for me is no worse than waxing. I would agree with one review that says to start with recently shaved legs and go over them once a day (in the evening as it does leave behind re bumps)until all of the hairs have been removed. It takes a few weeks to get completely hair free legs. The device itself works great and feels well constructed. I took away one star because the Epilator has a tendency to break off some of the hairs especially around the knee area that I have to go back and clean up with tweezers later. Overall however I am extremely happy with this product and recommend it to people all the time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for more than 3 years. it&#x27;s great. the only deficiency is that its adapter input voltage is 220-240 so I can not use it in U.S with 110v. so, after moving to U.S, it became useless.</li>
            <li> I have a high tolerance for pain. I used to regularly give myself Brazilian waxes at home...but HOLY BALLS this thing HURTS! If it was just the pain followed by blissfully smooth legs, bikini line, and underarms, that would be great, but it was not that way for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a very very very long time (it seemed) of searing pain on both my underarms and legs, they still did not seem smooth. Pass after pass after pass just wouldn&#x27;t grab those little hair and my legs still felt prickly. Ok, still acceptable. At least you could no longer see the thick black hairs on my pasty white legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Move on up to the bikini area... the bikini line along the thigh was no biggie, but oh BOY was I wrong when I thought I&#x27;d get the \\&quot;whole area\\&quot; epilated. I seriously checked the epilator for chunky bits of flesh and blood. It hurt BAD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I have established (at least for me) that it was not the best for hair removal, but what came after (a few weeks after) was much much worse. I continued using this thing for a few weeks thinking that I would eventually grab all those nasty little hairs if I used it daily (and I did, for sure) on a long term basis, but instead I started to get terrible ingrown hairs. As a couple more weeks went by, I started to get very very deep and painful (and red) ingrown hairs, so bad in fact that I stopped using the epilator (yes, my skin was clean. Yes, I exfoliate, yes, I tried tend skin.. I have waxed at home, remember?) but the ingrown hairs on my legs, bikini line and underarms were just horrid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But here is the worst part. Those ingrown hairs lasted for almost a year. A YEAR! Red, pussy, disgusting ingrown hairs all over my body. It took months and months for them all to go away. It was humiliating and just plain gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You could not PAY me to use this product again. Worst. Ever.</li>
            <li> I buy this Epilator and  was very happy for a while.The pain is big but not to quit using it.Hair would grow slower then by shaving it...But still could not manage to use above my knees (and thank God i didn&#x27;t).&lt;br /&gt; So only part i use was on both legs from ankles to knees.&lt;br /&gt; First weeks ..amazed ... I was in-love and happy to have it ,especially in summer time.&lt;br /&gt; Anyway after 3-4 months i started to notice my legs would start itch ...A LOT . So 2-3 ingrowing hair on one leg maybe 3-4 other leg (I must say i used other epilator and never had problem with ingrowing hair .. or never had any by shaving).&lt;br /&gt;Another few months passed and i finally decided to quit using it .No mistake ... no new ingrowing hair but is been almost a year and still dealing with ingrowing hair just a few left but i am glad i found the reason of it .Sad i had to get back to shaving again but until i found a better product...It is not worth it for me to use this.Wish i was able to return it but i guess that wont take a used item.&lt;br /&gt; Hope u ladies got stronger legs then me and if u have same problem as i did,,make sure u quit using any kind of &#x27;&#x27;pulling&#x27;&#x27; hair out product or wax ...just go for epilating cream or shaving and try this &#x27;&#x27;Tend Skin&#x27;&#x27; after every wash. Good-luck to new buyers .. i don&#x27;t want to  scare anybody but u should research more and maybe find better quality if u willing to pay lil extra.Ingrowing hair is a big problem and is very hard to get rid of.&lt;br /&gt; Hope it helps.</li>
            <li> I like this epilator. I don&#x27;t use it every time because sometimes I just shave instead. It does take a while to use and it hurts a little but nothing a grown woman cannot handle. If you pull the skin tight in the area you use it on it hurts less. I also read baby powder helps and numbing cream too. I used both a couple times but not worth the money or hassle in my opinion.</li>
            <li> More tweezers would be better but 40 works fine. Gf hates the pain but looks great and now she doesnt have to shave!</li>
            <li> This product hurts like crazy. We did have a lot of fun laughing at my sons friends trying to use it just to see if they could stand it .</li>
            <li> I was looking a Braun eplilator for gifting in India.But since I had to buy the product in US where the volatage specification is 110V/60 Hz and use in India with voltage 220V/50 Hz, I checked with Braun customer care through mail &amp; phone.  Nobody gave a definative information but I ordered this product as it seemed good. I was okay buying a volatage converter.    But now I have recieved this product and I can tell that its a dual voltage and this information is not available any where on this site as well as Braun&#x27;s site.  So anybody with same diliema can order this product without concern :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 weeks. A bit painful the first couple if times, but no need to shave everyday anymore! I have really sensitive skin and waxing is not an option. This product is wonderful! My razor bumps have disappeared and no more ingrown hairs! Even when hair begins to grow back, it is lighter with less stubble! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> i have only used the product twice since i received it. i don&#x27;t have to shave my legs as often as i did before. it doesn&#x27;t hurt the way i thought it might. the only thing i find hard is the knees. it takes alot of work to get the knees done, otherwise it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Great investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read so many reviews before I bought this that ranged from calling this product too painful to use,to being a miracle hair remover that ends the necessity of shaving, to an evil skin ruining device. I figured I&#x27;d take a chance and I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dark body hair that shows through my skin even five minutes after I shave, but within two uses of this epilator, I can go three days before there is ANY hair visible. However, I still get blonde stubble in about the same amount of time I used to grow hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I did was go after my underarms since they are what I am the most self conscious about. The first use left my underarms red and raw, but I just bit the bullet and did it. The results there are the most impressive by far. I hardly ever have to shave anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Legs were a bit different since I need the hair to be longer in order for the epilator to really work, but I&#x27;m impatient. So I&#x27;ve done it bit by bit and pieces at a time. The leg portions don&#x27;t hurt me at all, but can sometimes leave my legs spotty and red for about a day before it goes back to being smooth just because I have sensitive skin in certain parts of my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bikini line was by far the most painful and I almost couldn&#x27;t do it even though I barely flinched using it anywhere else. All I have to say is USE THE ICE PACK if you&#x27;re having trouble with pain. It really does make a huge difference. I have noticed that my hair grows back much more slowly and sparsely and I can shave with significantly less razor bumps now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Great value... it won&#x27;t completely replace razors, and if you have a low tolerance for pain, you should really look elsewhere for hair removal. HOWEVER, if you have dark hair like me and you&#x27;re just looking for a way to make it less visible and thinner to make shaving less of a painful and ineffective ordeal, this is probably what you&#x27;re after.</li>
            <li> After trying this initially I conjured up visions of torture chambers and sadists. As a male user I had never heard of or employed a &amp;#34;epilator&amp;#34; and wasn&#x27;t too sure how it actually worked. Well, I found out and freaked out at the same moment. It&#x27;s an understatement to say this appliance may cause discomfort especially as it pulls out your hair from its roots and actually challenges you to continue on? Getting used to it will be a chore. However, I think it does what it&#x27;s advertised to do and probably very well at that. Hint: at first do it in private so no one sees the tears well up in your ears.</li>
