            <li>I have a super itchy and dry scalp.</li>
            <li>I have been using this item for over a year now, this is the only dandruff product that has consistently used.</li>
            <li>If your willing to try both products together, definitely get the smaller size of 16oz bottle to try before this large size.</li>
            <li>Scalp is still a bit dry right now</li>
            <li>Provides lots of slip and it&#x27;s  not heavy  on hair.  </li>
            <li>When she transitioned from relaxed to natural, she washed her hair every 3 to 5 days</li>
            <li>Try it if you are seeking growth for relaxed hair, transitioning to natural, or maintaining your natural texture-</li>

            <li>I ran out and I started using other stuff, but the other stuff does not work anywhere near as good because my scalp feels tight again</li>
            <li>decided to try this product since I live in a very low humidity weather</li>
            <li>After the first use, I had no more issues with a very itchy scalp.</li>

            <li> I had a slight issue with my scalp being a little dry in the nape area and this product took it away.  </li>
            <li> This product is amazing because when my scalp is dry, my hair itches I am miserable.</li>
            <li> I do not oil my scalp; however, I use the Kera Care Dry &amp; Itchy Shampoo, this conditioner, the Kera Care silken seal, and a small amount of 100% argan oil.</li>

            <li> You can&#x27;t wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> I am not scratching my head like crazy by the end of the week</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using this item for over a year now, this is the only dandruff product that has consistently used. Arrived on time as stated.</li>
            <li> Great bargain over smaller size of the same item.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It is just about the only anti-dandruff shampoo or conditioner that works for me.  It also arrived timely and in a sturdy package.</li>
            <li> this is the best stuff that I have ever tried for my extremely dry scalp, and when i say dry, i mean really dry. its so dry sometimes it feels tight. I found this product and it worked great! no more flakes no more itching and made my hair nice and shiny.  I have really really long curly hair--almost to my waist- and it made the detangling so much easier! well guess what? I ran out and I started using other stuff, but the other stuff does not work anywhere near as good because my scalp feels tight again and I&#x27;m getting flakes again. so im ordering double so I never run out again!</li>
            <li> I suffer from severe dry scalp.  I have to constantly change products to keep my hair from getting &#x27;used&#x27; to it.  This conditioner works well with my current collection of Abba &amp; Organix products.  Although I don&#x27;t use it every wash (only twice a month), it works well for me.</li>
            <li> I love this product in fact im using it as I type this. To me its very relexing it gives you this cold burn that feel wonderful (to me at least). I would reccomend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing because when my scalp is dry, my hair itches I am miserable. This product soothes my scalp instantly and leaves my hair flake free, soft, and bouncy - what more could I ask for from a product!!! I have tried others and none compare, not even Neutrogena!</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry scalp and this conditioner is excellent for my hair...I leave it in my hair as a deep conditioner for 3hrs...love it</li>
            <li> I love Avlon products. I know a lot of people say there are cheaper options, but I have to stick with what works and proves itself to me for greater than 15 years. This is  a great follow up to the Avlon Dry &amp; Itchy Scalp shampoo. It moisturizes and contains ingredients to help control an itchy scalp. My hair was soft and easy to comb through. Absolutely no tangles!</li>
            <li> It really worked to stop the itching.  Really like this product.  I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I found this conditioning product and read some of the reviews and I decided to try it and I&#x27;m now hooked.  I had a slight issue with my scalp being a little dry in the nape area and this product took it away.  Thanks so much Keracare.  I totally love this product and it&#x27;s really helped my scalp.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that works for me in conjunction with a good anti-dandruf shampoo (Alpecin Dandruf Killer). Almost completely supressed my dandruf problem, can only recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner! Provides lots of slip and it&#x27;s  not heavy  on hair.  Has a great tingling  sensation  which I love! Really good.</li>
            <li> I really like it. I wash my hair once a week and after using it twice, I have noticed a huge difference. I am not scratching my head like crazy by the end of the week like I was before using it.</li>
            <li> After the first use, I had no more issues with a very itchy scalp. After just a few shampoos, no more flakes! My hair feels full soft and healthy? I&#x27;m using less moisturizer as my hair is well conditioned and requires less. My hair is stronger, no breakage, and the conditioner makes detangling a breeze. Great product and would recommend it. My hair has never looked better!</li>
            <li> Great tingly sensation, works well for dandruff, good price.</li>
            <li> I just got my order today and I am excited to try it. Honestly I have heard great things about this conditioner but the only thing I am concerned about is it&#x27;s consistency. It has a stringy consistency and the best way I can describe it is &#x27;melted chewing gum&#x27;. I decided to let it sit for a bit just in case it was acting like this from sitting in the delivery truck under this Texas heat but it is still stringy. If this is the normal consistency then that is fine but I have never used it so I don&#x27;t know. Can anyone tell me if this is how their&#x27;s is?</li>
            <li> We use this conditioner for our dogs.  It cleared up their dry, flakey skin.  Don&#x27;t know if it works as well on people.</li>
            <li> I always had breakdowns on my scalp here and there, that bugging itch that becomes scab after had bothered you for a week or two.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try this product since I live in a very low humidity weather and I have to say that after trying it for a few times it really helped a bunch. I apply it and let it stay for 20 minutes, afterwards I go take a shower. First lets start saying that it leaves a pepper mint feeling on your scalp so it soothe the inflamed areas and it reduced my itching and burning feeling from it&#x27;s fist application. It helped with the dandruff as well, I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 5 years! Each time I tried another product, I came back to this one. Let me first explain that my husband uses this and as well. He used to prefer to use an oil product after shampooing his hair; however, after adding the conditioner to his regimen, he no longer requires an oil for his hair. He keeps his hair cut really low and his hair/scalp can be on the oily side. He loves the tingling sensation the conditioner gives him. This product is great paired with the shampoo for Dry &amp; Itchy Scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick, relaxed hair that grows like a chia pet! I have been growing my hair out for about 2 years and this shampoo allows me to keep my hair moisturized and conditioned very well. I do not oil my scalp; however, I use the Kera Care Dry &amp; Itchy Shampoo, this conditioner, the Kera Care silken seal, and a small amount of 100% argan oil. I wash my hair on a weekly basis. I slather my hair with coconut oil the night before washing. I also air dry my hair. I only blow dry my hair once every 3 to 4 months if I am in a rush. And last, I flat iron my hair in cycles. I air dry most often and for most of the year, I wear no heat hair styles. At the moment, I am wearing my hair flat ironed and I wrap it daily.&lt;br /&gt;While sticking to this regimen, I do not require any additional products added to my hair for maintenance. After 2 or 3 days, I might rub argan oil for a bit more shine, but it is not always necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both my daughters have natural ethnic hair with different curl patterns. My youngest has larger curls and thicker hair. We use the shampoo and conditioner along with a curl moisturizer (s curl) for her daily regimen. I wash her hair every 2 weeks (it is just so thick and time consuming LOL!) As she gets older, I am sure she will shift to once a week wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My oldest daughter uses a similar regimen to my youngest daughter, but she will occasionally wear a sew in weave. I do not recommend the Kera Care line for weaves!&lt;br /&gt;When she is wearing a weave, we use a different brand of shampoo/conditioner. When she transitioned from relaxed to natural, she washed her hair every 3 to 5 days and she would often use the conditioner for a cowash vs the traditional wash then condition. Her hair craved extreme moisture during the transition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is highly recommended forAfro- Ethnic hair. Every member of my family has a different hair texture, type and style, but this product works for each of us. Your scalp will feel tingling clean and your hair will be moisturized very well. With regular use, I am sure you will see benefits. Try it if you are seeking growth for relaxed hair, transitioning to natural, or maintaining your natural texture- This works very well!!ne for weaves!&lt;br /&gt;When she is wearing a weave, we use a different brand of shampoo/conditioner.

            <li> I use this on my hair and my daughters and it makes our hair stronger. Thanks so much for fast shipment.</li>
            <li> Keracare is a good brand but I don&#x27;t like this conditioner....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Leaves minty refreshing feeling on the scalp&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizes the scalp&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Consistency - It had a weird gum like feel to it&lt;br /&gt;Did not feel like it actually moisturized my hair at all&lt;br /&gt;Gave my hair a weird stiff-like feel which resulted in breakage when I was detangling :(</li>
            <li> Does not work as well as head and shoulders, threw it out after a month. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Try grampa&#x27;s pine tar shampoo or shea moistures african black soap line made for ichy scalp, I switched over and saw results in a week. Better products out there.</li>
            <li> I wrote a previous review for the Dry and Itchy Shampoo which is the first product to use before this conditioner. I love the shampoo and don&#x27;t like this conditioner in this form. I have found a conditioner from Carol&#x27;s Daughter products, the Black Vanilla Conditioner which is in a spray bottle. The spray bottle allows for better manageability of the product. I used this in conjunction with the Dry and Itchy Shampoo, which in my opinion is a much better product between the two. If your willing to try both products together, definitely get the smaller size of 16oz bottle to try before this large size.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner.  Great for my dermatitis.  Love the cool feeling after every use.  You can&#x27;t wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> great if you have well water</li>
            <li> I seriously love this conditioner! I leaves my scalp soothed, my hair soft and shiny!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a week now. I have a super itchy and dry scalp. I also have thin hair. When I first tried using this product, the itchiness was gone. Scalp is still a bit dry right now but it was not as worse as before. Great conditioner!</li>
            <li> No more itchy scalp. This is a miracle product with a sweet smell.</li>
            <li> Awesome feeling for yor dry and itchy scalp! It tingles getting rid of that itchy feeling. It also leaves your hair soft</li>
            <li> If your buying this product make sure you get the shampoo also because they work better together.&lt;br /&gt;Very good to your hair.</li>
            <li> Due to my eczema I must co-wash often to keep my scalp and hands from breakingout and this product is great for my situation.  It heals my scalp, detangling is a breaze (fantastic slip), and the size is great for the frequency of use.</li>
