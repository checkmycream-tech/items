            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of all things eos, but this is by far my favorite &amp;#34;limited&amp;#34; edition set.</li>
            <li>Works ok, I like the larger applicator but the more I used it, my lips felt drier.</li>
            <li>Other than how cool it looks, it&#x27;s not that good of a balm.</li>
            <li>Fun colors.  </li>
            <li>so I thought it was worth the price.</li>
            <li>Fun design.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t use it under or over lipstick either, makes it come right off.</li>
            <li>Came exactly as shown.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t end up feeling greasy, and your lips are always soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>the box they came in looks exactly like it was advertised.</li>
            <li>Love that it is in a round container and is easy to find in my purse by just reaching my hand Into it and not having to look.</li>
            <li>I was excited when it came in 2 days early.</li>
            <li>set she really wanted</li>
            <li>The Fresh Watermelon was the only flavor</li>
            <li>very soft lips and tasty.</li>
            <li>i already had twp of the flavors, but i wanted the watermelon, so i gifted one of the repeats to a friend as an add on to her christmas present, and gave the other extra chapstick to my sister since her dog keeps eating hers (he LOVES them, and it does make his nose extra smooth..</li>
            <li>This product is 100% a rip off, i did not purchase this product, BUT i was looking at the EOS website and found the exact same product for 12.99...</li>
            <li>It came exactly how it is seen in the picture above.</li>
            <li>My collection is almost complete!</li>

            <li> i got these for my girlfriend for christmas and as always we love eos products. very soft lips and tasty. we have every egg lip balm they make. i got these as extras in case she looses one. the last time it happened she cried... enough said. awesome stuff.</li>
            <li> These were a gift for my grand daughters,  I think they now have every flavor available and the smoothest lips in town1</li>
            <li> I oredered this to get the limited edition watermellon chapstick. I love eos, moisturizing smells great and cute packaging. This would make a cute gift to any girl or teen plus this was a good deal as well!</li>

            <li> Love the smoothness it goes on and the variety of flavors (scent). Love that it is in a round container and is easy to find in my purse by just reaching my hand Into it and not having to look. Very handy and keeps my lips smooth!</li>

            <li> Got this for my granddaughter who collects all the eos lip balms. The Fresh Watermelon was the only flavor she&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t have.  She was VERY HAPPY when she opened this present.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter who collects these.  She&#x27;ll get it for xmas and be delighted.  The packaging left something to be desired though.  Showed up all smushed.</li>
            <li> I love that I found this package.  Nice set.  Came exactly as shown.  Great variety. Fun colors.  Good easter present instead of candy.</li>
            <li> This product is 100% a rip off, i did not purchase this product, BUT i was looking at the EOS website and found the exact same product for 12.99... Always do some resarch before you buy a product..You Choose. &gt;[...]</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s a not bag product, I believe it&#x27;s overrated. Other than how cool it looks, it&#x27;s not that good of a balm.</li>
            <li> have these all over the office, the house and in all of my gym bags! awesome</li>
            <li> i love the scents&lt;br /&gt;Watermelon and Strawberry are my favorites&lt;br /&gt;Help my chapped lips&lt;br /&gt;The fact that they are organic is even better&lt;br /&gt;The other brands did not help&lt;br /&gt;T</li>
            <li> I ordered this specifically because I wanted the watermelon one, and it&#x27;s limited edition. This is the best chapstick. You can always find it in your purse, it moisturizes wonderfully, tastes great, and is long lasting. You don&#x27;t end up feeling greasy, and your lips are always soft and smooth. I&#x27;m a huge fan of all things eos, but this is by far my favorite &amp;#34;limited&amp;#34; edition set. The flavors are great- watermelon of course is just awesome!</li>
            <li> It came exactly how it is seen in the picture above. It was a little banged up but nothing was wrong with the lip balm. I would recommend that people buy it again. It came a couple days before the date that was given to me. I love it.</li>
            <li> Was not watermelon the reason for purchasing this item was because it stated that a watermelon flavor was included. No watermelon.</li>
            <li> Works ok, I like the larger applicator but the more I used it, my lips felt drier. Can&#x27;t use it under or over lipstick either, makes it come right off. My quest for great lip balm still continues....</li>
            <li> Although this was a bit expensive even when I purchased it ($22 at the time) the price has gone up further. It&#x27;s understandable, though, as the set is no longer in production and is one of the few ways left to get the limited edition Watermelon flavor. I collect eos (have all the flavors made except for the Alice in Wonderland Set and the Vanilla Bean Winter Edition) so I thought it was worth the price. Packaging arrived in pristine condition. The Watermelon isn&#x27;t my favorite flavor, but it&#x27;s definitely in my top 3.</li>
            <li> How many can you use at one time? That&#x27;s why this package is a great idea for stocking stuffers for friends and relatives!</li>
            <li> Great scents. Long lasting. Always have soft lips with these lip glosses. Good price. Fun design. My collection is almost complete!</li>
            <li> I have no doubt, it was a good choice for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this purchase. ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these. the box they came in looks exactly like it was advertised. I was excited when it came in 2 days early. will totally buy this again and totally recommend this</li>
            <li> Love them so much, just what I need it, now my lip are gonna be smoth in this weather, very nice</li>
            <li> i love the flavors and the adorable packaging. eos is the best and my lips have survived the winter with limited chapping. i already had twp of the flavors, but i wanted the watermelon, so i gifted one of the repeats to a friend as an add on to her christmas present, and gave the other extra chapstick to my sister since her dog keeps eating hers (he LOVES them, and it does make his nose extra smooth.. LOL)</li>
            <li> All I can report on this product is my daughter n laws reaction to it at Christmas time.  She was thrilled and immediately put some on .She carries it with her and just loves the fruit flavors. .  Told me she always wanted this product  but never  made that step.  This is a nice stocking stuffer gift for any age lady.</li>
            <li> Great product, my wife loved it. Trendy and modern design that captures the attention of everybody. Great taste and smell.</li>
