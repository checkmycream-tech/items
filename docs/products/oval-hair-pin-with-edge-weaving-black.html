            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>The item is okay</li>
            <li>I had a wonderful, big leather and wood hair holder in the 70s....</li>
            <li>It works okay, but my hair perhaps should be longer, thicker?</li>
            <li>I have fine hair.</li>
            <li>I was excited to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>A good hair essential.  </li>
            <li>It is a simple product with a nice style that does well.</li>
            <li>The only thing you need more hair to hold it up, my hair is fine, which it wasn&#x27;t when I was in high school.</li>
            <li>Years ago I had used similar accessories which were great for a quick up do or other styles.  </li>
            <li>Not only was I able to do that with this hair pin, it also kept my hair moisturized as well.</li>
            <li>This is exactly as pictured and described.  </li>
            <li>Item is exactly as pictured...</li>
            <li>Really like the way it looks and feels in my hair.</li>
            <li>All-natural and very &amp;#34;boho&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Good for up styles, but you do need quite thick hair to make this work for a ponytail style.  </li>
            <li>Needs to be used to regularly so that it is soft and easy to place around hair.  </li>
            <li>Its beautiful and fits in my very thin hair.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of one I had in high school.</li>
            <li>Just wish it had a little more grip to it.</li>
            <li>securely and I never had to worry about it slipping.</li>
            <li>It is black and goes with everything, easy to use</li>
            <li>Hair stick is fantastic to pin down my bun!</li>
            <li>but that is as far as I would go with my rating.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute but does not stay in my thick curly hair well.</li>
            <li>I obtained the 3&amp;#34; size which worked fairly well-the wearer though has a mass of hair and coupled with the newness/stiffness made it a bit difficult to properly pin back the hair.</li>
            <li>I have medium thick hair and this actually holds it up easily.</li>
            <li>I have super thick hair &amp;</li>

            <li> Not as nice as I thought it would be...the edging was l not finished as nice as it could have been.</li>
            <li> It is black and goes with everything, easy to use and I have had lots of compliments when I wear it. What more can a girl ask for.</li>
            <li> I love this barrette. Beautiful leather. The weaving adds the touch of flair. I love wearing this with a ponytail.</li>
            <li> Never got it. So I can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s a good buy or not. I didn&#x27;t even want to give a 1 star but I had to give something.</li>
            <li> These have been wonderful for keeping my hair in a bun.  I&#x27;ve also received compliments on them when I&#x27;ve worn them.  Good product and service -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute but does not stay in my thick curly hair well. I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Its beautiful and fits in my very thin hair. I am very happy with the barrette. It reminds me of one I had in high school.</li>
            <li> Really like the way it looks and feels in my hair. Just wish it had a little more grip to it. I have fine hair.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get a hair pin to use as a protective hair style to tuck away the ends of my hair. Not only was I able to do that with this hair pin, it also kept my hair moisturized as well. I have 4c hair type that is relaxed.</li>
            <li> Wanted more colors because I liked the way the hair pin worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;Held securely and I never had to worry about it slipping.</li>
            <li> I posted 5 stars because I have been looking locally for hair accessories including this type and could not find any. I was excited to find it on Amazon.  Years ago I had used similar accessories which were great for a quick up do or other styles.  This item is an inexpensive item for casual wear. I&#x27;m still looking for some in different colors than black.</li>
            <li> Great looking and easy to use,</li>
            <li> i love these,Thank you</li>
            <li> I love this. I have medium thick hair and this actually holds it up easily.</li>
            <li> This is exactly as pictured and described.  Seems to be a good product and happy with purchase.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> A good hair essential.  Needs to be used to regularly so that it is soft and easy to place around hair.  Good for up styles, but you do need quite thick hair to make this work for a ponytail style.  All in all a good product.  I am happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> did the trick.  I was happy with the product, well made and I&#x27;ve had no problems with using it in my hair.  I wish this came in brown because I&#x27;d order another.  I was quite happy with this and recommend!</li>
            <li> Hair stick is fantastic to pin down my bun! I have super thick hair &amp; this thing lasts forever!</li>
            <li> The lacing is loose at one edge and the ball end of the stick was loose in the package on arrival. The item is okay but that is as far as I would go with my rating. i would not order another but will keep the one I have.</li>
            <li> I had a wonderful, big leather and wood hair holder in the 70s....was hoping this was similar, but it&#x27;s smaller.  It works okay, but my hair perhaps should be longer, thicker?</li>
            <li> I have been looking for one of these, since I wore one back in the seventies. The only thing you need more hair to hold it up, my hair is fine, which it wasn&#x27;t when I was in high school. It does lose its grip as I wear it through the day, I still like it though.</li>
            <li> This was a good purchase.  Item is exactly as pictured... looks hand-crafted.  The shield is heavy black leather with even stitching around the edge and the &amp;#34;pin&amp;#34; is black painted wood.  All-natural and very &amp;#34;boho&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I obtained the 3&amp;#34; size which worked fairly well-the wearer though has a mass of hair and coupled with the newness/stiffness made it a bit difficult to properly pin back the hair. Had the vendor offered a 4&amp;#34; size, that would have been perfect. It is a simple product with a nice style that does well.</li>
            <li> Wish it was larger. Otherwise, perfect</li>
