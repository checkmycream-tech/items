            <li>Has a nice smell for evening wear.  </li>
            <li>GREAT, CLEAN SCENT FOR MEN.</li>
            <li>This is a good classic fragrance and a good value.  </li>
            <li>Large size is a great deal.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t received nearly as many compliments from it</li>
            <li>I used to love BS.</li>
            <li>My mother started this gift giving :)</li>
            <li>okay though, I can use the after shave, too, but I&#x27;ll go else where for the cologne.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about the size of a flask for those of you who aren&#x27;t sure.</li>
            <li>Back in the sixties this was the best Cologne on the market.</li>
            <li>are not overpowering but refreshing.</li>
            <li>It is one of his favorite colognes.  </li>
            <li>ok seven more words....or three more one</li>
            <li>Love it and will be purchasing more when I run out.</li>
            <li>Had this been a talc powder note it could have been interesting with the moss.</li>
            <li>one that doesn&#x27;t seem as interesting as a piece sitting out in the sun.</li>
            <li>Love the glass bottle.</li>
            <li>Love the 5.7 oz bottle.</li>
            <li>Was glad to see others comments as I thought I was losing my mind.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product off and on for many years.</li>
            <li>An old standby -- smells great.</li>
            <li>They did deliver fast and the price was good.</li>
            <li>Still the best scent, after 35 years of trying other alternatives.</li>
            <li>I was very well pleased !</li>
            <li>I enjoy the the memory of he getting dress for Chruch</li>
            <li>For almost five decades it was a steadfast product and I a steadfast customer.  </li>
            <li>and he was happy when he got it and said he would use it and that&#x27;s the only reason its not getting a 1.</li>
            <li>(shall we say I&#x27;m dropping the BS and going back to PS :P).</li>
            <li>Way too sweet and reminds me of cheap colognes.</li>
            <li>At splash a clean soapy note and baby powder structure comes through and for some reason Jovan Musk came to me.</li>
            <li>Priced right!</li>
            <li>I first experienced British Sterling in the Marines in 1966.</li>
            <li>the bottle of cologne arrived and I found that the cologne had leaked during shipping and was about 20% from being full.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always believeed a good Cologne needs to compliment your personal body odor after a shower.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to hold out longer than 4 hours max,possibly lighter in output than I&#x27;d care for but not bad...</li>
            <li>This was the first fragrance that I bought for my new husband 39 years ago, and it is still my favorite cologne on him to this day!</li>
            <li>Quick shipment</li>
            <li>super been using it now for 35 years</li>
            <li>The bottle sent says new look same great scent.  </li>
            <li>It is a thinned out, cheap rip-off of a very good product.</li>
            <li>This has been my father Christmas gift for most of my adult life.</li>
            <li>worth spilled out into the box.</li>
            <li>Would say this shop is doing everything right.</li>
            <li>Wood is present but very light.</li>
            <li>Been using british sterling my entire adult life because I love the fragrance and people always come up to me and tell how good the colognes fragrance smells</li>
            <li>Great service for a hard to find cologne.</li>
            <li>The lot numbering codes are also vastly different adding more evidence that this is a misbranded product.  </li>
            <li>I have used British Sterling cologne for many years.</li>
            <li>I hAVE USED bRITISH sTERLING PRODUCTS FOR MEN FOR MANY YEARS.  </li>
            <li>I love British Sterling but this product is after shave and not he Cologne.</li>
            <li>British sterling is my favorite type of cologne.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find it in the local stores but found it on Amazon,reall many stores don&#x27;t carry this cologne and</li>
            <li>if they do the price is much higher.</li>
            <li>And exactly as described.</li>
            <li>In most stores I can only find aftershave.</li>
            <li>Those who want the real deal keep looking!</li>
            <li>I have been using British Sterling for more than a decade, and I know how it looks and how it smells.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>Yet I always get the most compliments with this lesser priced one.</li>
            <li>The creamy spice combination is so light I can barely detect it.</li>
            <li>guess I am a creature of habit and have certain scents that I feel</li>
            <li>The opening is much to large.</li>
            <li>Love it, last longer than the new brands and cheaper.</li>
            <li>This is not the real thing.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Very mossy with maybe just a touch of lilac and lavender in the moss.</li>
            <li>Very creamy yet spicy from vanilla and nutmeg.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very concentrated.</li>
            <li>Consequently, too much of the cologne dumps out each time you try to use it.</li>
            <li>It was nice to experiment with a different cologne, but I think I&#x27;ll go back to what I was using beforehand</li>
            <li>The color of the one they sent me is orange / yellow, which smells close to the original</li>
            <li>The original British sterling has strength and lasts for days.</li>
            <li>For most of my life I have used British Sterling, and no other fragrance.</li>
            <li>Seems like the original stuff to me, despite a different color.</li>
            <li>It has a nice aroma and is long lasting and soothing.</li>
            <li>I got a touch of but more or less an untouched,undusty,clean stick of wood...</li>
            <li>The ONLY thing my Dad would say he wanted for Christmas was more \\&quot;British Sterling.\\</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used British Sterling since it first came out when Spiedel first introduced it.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The cologne in the bottles I received was not green in color, as pictured on Amazon.com and in every bottle I have previously purchased; instead it was a bright yellowish-orange, and it did not smell like British Sterling.  </li>
            <li>If I recall correctly last time I bought a bottle of the original stuff in the early 90&#x27;s...</li>
            <li>working class affordable but not as cheap as other drugstore found colognes.</li>
            <li>Love this  cologne,  hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li>It is clearly after shave and not cologne.</li>
            <li>It was the one present my dad really wanted</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been useing this product since I&#x27;ve been an young man.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 60 years old now.</li>
            <li>Has a hint of the old Canoe fragrance, which I stopped liking years ago.</li>
            <li>Let me start off this review on an honest note and say if you don&#x27;t look at the cologne name and never owned the original formula...not a bad scent at all.</li>
            <li>Like several other members I have been duped and not given the genuine article I thought I had ordered.  </li>
            <li>The moss is there but not rich and colors the clean character some.</li>
            <li>Just opened the first only to find something nowhere close to the British Sterling Cologne I&#x27;ve used for over forty years.  </li>
            <li>projection,8 hours of holding easy,and a far more complex scent that British Sterling</li>
            <li>But gradually over that past year or two the cologne formula has changed, and what&#x27;s available today, although advertised as &amp;#34;New Look&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Same Scent&amp;#34;, is nowhere near the original fragrance and deep green color.  </li>
            <li>It has become hard to find my favorite cologne at any of the local stores.</li>
            <li>Of course, I thought I was getting the real thing and the only way to find out is to open the bottle.</li>
            <li>I want my old British Sterling Cologne back, please.</li>
            <li>The other unfortunate thing is that I believe DANA, the original developer of this product, is no longer in business so a lot of these are cheap Chinese knock offs, so beware.</li>
            <li>British Sterling Cologne is fairly decent in my opinion, though I feel it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>What I found is a nauseating, putrid piss yellow liquid that I would never touch bare</li>
            <li>Dana hasn&#x27;t done shoddy work with a few old-school scents they now own but British Sterling?...far from home isn&#x27;t an exaggeration.d be an IFRA crackdown on dyes...</li>

            <li> British Sterling Cologne is fairly decent in my opinion, though I feel it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>

            <li> Dana hasn&#x27;t done shoddy work with a few old-school scents they now own but British Sterling?...far from home isn&#x27;t an exaggeration.d be an IFRA crackdown on dyes...</li>

            <li> Apparently the cap to the cologne was loose and I&#x27;d say 3 oz.</li>
            <li> First he color is green (after shave) and not golden (cologne).</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t really complain about the fluid being a little lighter shade of green because that would be an IFRA crackdown on dyes...</li>
            <li> Since I use it sparingly, each bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> very thick fragrance would be the right wording for it.</li>

            <li> My only complaint was in the hot summer heat and working in the field that spice got a bit heavy to my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is one of the few places I can actually find British Sterling Cologne.  </li>
            <li> I looked around for him but only saw a little brown box at my feet.</li>
            <li> To bad most stores don&#x27;t carry it ......</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be clear that my complaint is NOT with this vendor,but rather</li>
            <li> British Sterling formula by Dana is different to say the least...</li>
            <li> Otherwise it is just what i had expected.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this is not an imitation, but the real thing that just seems different.</li>
            <li> I am a chemist and will now prove this via FTIR, HPLC and other spectrophotometric techniques.  </li>
            <li> If I walked into a drugstore and tested this formulation of British Sterling by Dana I&#x27;d say it was a slick barbershop scent.</li>
            <li> here&#x27;s the reality-this is nothing like the British Sterling cologne my uncle got me hooked on in the late 80&#x27;s...</li>
            <li> A 5 ounce bottle of COLOGNE lasts about a year and a half.</li>
            <li> handed much less put on my face.  </li>
            <li> Have to wait for recycling day, as I wouldn&#x27;t throw this product down the drain; might kill Carp!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m sad to see an old friend morph into something unrecognizable.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Like several other members I have been duped and not given the genuine article I thought I had ordered.  The bottle sent says new look same great scent.  Actually it is not the same scent.  I still have ¼ bottle that I was replacing and they don&#x27;t look or smell the same.  I am a chemist and will now prove this via FTIR, HPLC and other spectrophotometric techniques.  The lot numbering codes are also vastly different adding more evidence that this is a misbranded product.  Counterfeit drugs are illegal and so should this.</li>
            <li> I have used British Sterling cologne for many years. This is not the real thing. It is a thinned out, cheap rip-off of a very good product. There is a label underneath the bottle stating it is \\&quot;made in China with Fragrance oil made in USA\\&quot;. Even the cap came apart after opening it a few times.</li>
            <li> I hAVE USED bRITISH sTERLING PRODUCTS FOR MEN FOR MANY YEARS.  Amazon  is my dependable source.</li>
            <li> British Sterling Cologne is fairly decent in my opinion, though I feel it doesn&#x27;t last very long. I haven&#x27;t received nearly as many compliments from it like I did when I would wear Paul Sebastian (save for someone who thought I was wearing baby powder). It was nice to experiment with a different cologne, but I think I&#x27;ll go back to what I was using beforehand (shall we say I&#x27;m dropping the BS and going back to PS :P).</li>
            <li> Been using british sterling my entire adult life because I love the fragrance and people always come up to me and tell how good the colognes fragrance smells</li>
            <li> Nothing like the BS of the past. I used to love BS. but I&#x27;m turned off to it now. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Product was packed well and just as described. I was very well pleased !</li>
            <li> This has been my father Christmas gift for most of my adult life. I enjoy the the memory of he getting dress for Chruch and he would wear this. My mother started this gift giving :)</li>
            <li> I love British Sterling but this product is after shave and not he Cologne. I think the bottle is miss labeled and packaged. It is clearly after shave and not cologne. First he color is green (after shave) and not golden (cologne). Second, I can tell by the scent that it is after shave. The cologne is has a deeper and richer scent. Thanks okay though, I can use the after shave, too, but I&#x27;ll go else where for the cologne. The other unfortunate thing is that I believe DANA, the original developer of this product, is no longer in business so a lot of these are cheap Chinese knock offs, so beware. One star because the product is miss represented.</li>
            <li> The ONLY thing my Dad would say he wanted for Christmas was more \\&quot;British Sterling.\\&quot; I went to our local drug store but they only sold the smaller bottles of this \\&quot;classic\\&quot; cologne. I hit up Amazon and found the 5.7 oz. bottle! It&#x27;s about the size of a flask for those of you who aren&#x27;t sure. Well I walked outside to check the mail and it smelled like an army of 600 Dad&#x27;s were approaching! I looked around for him but only saw a little brown box at my feet. Apparently the cap to the cologne was loose and I&#x27;d say 3 oz. worth spilled out into the box. I contacted the seller and they are sending a replacement so hopefully that arrives by Christmas. Even if it doesn&#x27;t I have a great story to tell on Christmas morning!</li>
            <li> Dad loves this stuff and he couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. Found it on amazon and a very happy dad for dads day.</li>
            <li> It has become hard to find my favorite cologne at any of the local stores. Thank goodness for the internet.</li>
            <li> Amazon is the only person to have this type of cologne. British sterling is my favorite type of cologne. I was sad when my bottle ran out. I looked everywhere. Amazon was the only person to have it. So happy when I found it.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  Good price.</li>
            <li> only type i use...great</li>
            <li> An old standby -- smells great.</li>
            <li> Back in the sixties this was the best Cologne on the market. Everyone who could afford it bought it. I still like it.</li>
            <li> I started use British Sterling Cologne in 1975.  Have tried other colognes but keep coming back the British Sterling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I am a creature of habit and have certain scents that I feel are not overpowering but refreshing.</li>
            <li> Love this  cologne,  hard to find in stores.  Bought for my husband as a gift for his birthday. It is one of his favorite colognes.  Stays on all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used British Sterling since it first came out when Spiedel first introduced it.  I loved the cologne and deodorant products and their consistency of fragrance and performance.  For almost five decades it was a steadfast product and I a steadfast customer.  But gradually over that past year or two the cologne formula has changed, and what&#x27;s available today, although advertised as &amp;#34;New Look&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Same Scent&amp;#34;, is nowhere near the original fragrance and deep green color.  I guess Dana Classics felt the need to fix something that wasn&#x27;t broken.  I&#x27;m sad to see an old friend morph into something unrecognizable.  I want my old British Sterling Cologne back, please.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for almost 40 years!!  My cousin worked for Speidel back in the day who owned the brand and gave me samples.  I have been using it ever since.  Have received a few compliments on it from a few of the ladies so I stay with it.</li>
            <li> You get a lot for your money and my husband loves it</li>
            <li> Not the orginal............different smell, wrong color made in China......will not buy it again! ok seven more words....or three more one</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the picture shows the real British Sterling but the one they send me was a fake. The color of the one they sent me is orange / yellow, which smells close to the original but it only lasts for about an hour. The original British sterling has strength and lasts for days. Of course, I thought I was getting the real thing and the only way to find out is to open the bottle. Unfortunately I ordered three bottles and I feel I wasted my money on buying expensive rubbing alcohol. Look out for imitations.</li>
            <li> Has a nice smell for evening wear.  Hard to find.</li>
            <li> Great Price Great Buy</li>
            <li> Large size is a great deal.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find it in the local stores but found it on Amazon,reall many stores don&#x27;t carry this cologne and if they do the price is much higher.Love it and will be purchasing more when I run out.</li>
            <li> my grandfather loves it!</li>
            <li> Quick shipment And exactly as described.</li>
            <li> For most of my life I have used British Sterling, and no other fragrance. Since I use it sparingly, each bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This was the first fragrance that I bought for my new husband 39 years ago, and it is still my favorite cologne on him to this day!</li>
            <li> the bottle of cologne arrived and I found that the cologne had leaked during shipping and was about 20% from being full.</li>
            <li> Let me start off this review on an honest note and say if you don&#x27;t look at the cologne name and never owned the original formula...not a bad scent at all.If I walked into a drugstore and tested this formulation of British Sterling by Dana I&#x27;d say it was a slick barbershop scent.Doesn&#x27;t seem to hold out longer than 4 hours max,possibly lighter in output than I&#x27;d care for but not bad...at least it smells pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now here&#x27;s the reality-this is nothing like the British Sterling cologne my uncle got me hooked on in the late 80&#x27;s...this is a stranger to me.So what did British Sterling smell like?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very thick fragrance would be the right wording for it.Very mossy with maybe just a touch of lilac and lavender in the moss.Very creamy yet spicy from vanilla and nutmeg.Wood is present but very light.If I recall correctly last time I bought a bottle of the original stuff in the early 90&#x27;s...$24.99 I think.So yeah working class affordable but not as cheap as other drugstore found colognes.My only complaint was in the hot summer heat and working in the field that spice got a bit heavy to my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The British Sterling formula by Dana is different to say the least...&#x27;brighter&#x27; is a word that comes to mind.At splash a clean soapy note and baby powder structure comes through and for some reason Jovan Musk came to me.Had this been a talc powder note it could have been interesting with the moss.The moss is there but not rich and colors the clean character some.The creamy spice combination is so light I can barely detect it.Sandalwood I got a touch of but more or less an untouched,undusty,clean stick of wood...one that doesn&#x27;t seem as interesting as a piece sitting out in the sun.As I said earlier lighter smelling and lasts 4 hours faintly versus more projection,8 hours of holding easy,and a far more complex scent that British Sterling once was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t really complain about the fluid being a little lighter shade of green because that would be an IFRA crackdown on dyes...not Dana&#x27;s doing by any means.I was disappointed frankly because reformulations can be positive or negative.Dana hasn&#x27;t done shoddy work with a few old-school scents they now own but British Sterling?...far from home isn&#x27;t an exaggeration.d be an IFRA crackdown on dyes...not Dana&#x27;s doing by any means.I was disappointed frankly because reformulations can be positive or negative.Dana hasn&#x27;t done shoddy work with a few old-school scents they now own but British Sterling?...far from home isn&#x27;t an exaggeration.</li>
            <li> Just as good as it was when I was 17.  Love it, last longer than the new brands and cheaper.</li>
            <li> super been using it now for 35 years</li>
            <li> Bought for my dad for a birthday gift and he LOVED it.</li>
            <li> I first experienced British Sterling in the Marines in 1966. I&#x27;ll never use another brand of cologne. (Don&#x27;t expect the after shave to be as aromatic). When this container runs out, I&#x27;ll be buying another. A 5 ounce bottle of COLOGNE lasts about a year and a half. It&#x27;s very concentrated.</li>
            <li> RIP OFF Alert!  Received four 5.7oz bottles for Christmas.  Just opened the first only to find something nowhere close to the British Sterling Cologne I&#x27;ve used for over forty years.  What I found is a nauseating, putrid piss yellow liquid that I would never touch bare handed much less put on my face.  This is NOT the British Sterling any longtime user is expecting.  It should be criminal for Amazon to allow this seller online.  Where do I file a formal complaint?  No return allowed since I didn&#x27;t find the fraud until after 30 days.</li>
            <li> Great service for a hard to find cologne. Priced right! Delievered promptly to my home. Would say this shop is doing everything right.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few places I can actually find British Sterling Cologne.  In most stores I can only find aftershave.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dad for his birthday today and it looks nothing like the picture. The cologne is a pee color and it doesn&#x27;t smell like I remember. It was the one present my dad really wanted and he was happy when he got it and said he would use it and that&#x27;s the only reason its not getting a 1. It smells more like a ladys perfume then a mens cologne!! Those who want the real deal keep looking! I know I wish I had!</li>
            <li> My mom is in love with this stuff for my dad, so when he ran out this was a perfect stocking stuffer. If mom is happy dad is happy.</li>
            <li> THE SMELL OF THIS COLOGNE IS GREAT AND I USE IT ALL TIME AND WILL KEEP USEING IT EVERTIME I GO OUT</li>
            <li> Good experience. I like the scent, and the price was very good</li>
            <li> I wish I had read the reviews before ordering.  I ordered two British Sterling By Speidel For Men Cologne 5.7 Oz. on April 28, 2013.  I have been using British Sterling for more than a decade, and I know how it looks and how it smells.  The cologne in the bottles I received was not green in color, as pictured on Amazon.com and in every bottle I have previously purchased; instead it was a bright yellowish-orange, and it did not smell like British Sterling.  I am very disappointed.  I don&#x27;t know what the product is that I received, but it is not British Sterling.</li>
            <li> The only issue I had was I assumed it was a spray. Otherwise it is just what i had expected.</li>
            <li> Husband uses because I like the smell.</li>
            <li> GREAT, CLEAN SCENT FOR MEN.</li>
            <li> This is a good classic fragrance and a good value.  There has been some reviewers who say that it might be a counterfeit fragrance.  I can&#x27;t tell if it is or not.  It works for me and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The Deal of the Century!  Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been useing this product since I&#x27;ve been an young man. I&#x27;m 60 years old now. I&#x27;ve always believeed a good Cologne needs to compliment your personal body odor after a shower. I&#x27;ve tried Colognes that have been over $200.00 an Oz. Yet I always get the most compliments with this lesser priced one. The ease of ordering and shiping is second to none. I&#x27;ve never had a problem when I buy from Amazon and their associates. The product was on my porch two days earlier then perdicted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;T. Ryan</li>
            <li> This is a very good product but the bottle could use a redesign. The opening is much to large. Consequently, too much of the cologne dumps out each time you try to use it. It&#x27;s difficult to control the flow.</li>
            <li> Same cologne I&#x27;ve been using for years. To bad most stores don&#x27;t carry it ......that&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve had to order it online</li>
            <li> What a beautiful product. Smells as good as it always has. Love the glass bottle. Love the 5.7 oz bottle.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be clear that my complaint is NOT with this vendor,but rather the product itself. I have used BS aftershave for years, and this just does not smell the same. Way too sweet and reminds me of cheap colognes. Has a hint of the old Canoe fragrance, which I stopped liking years ago. Unfortunately, this is not an imitation, but the real thing that just seems different. Was glad to see others comments as I thought I was losing my mind. Have to wait for recycling day, as I wouldn&#x27;t throw this product down the drain; might kill Carp!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product off and on for many years.</li>
            <li> It is British Sterling. It is all the same. They did deliver fast and the price was good. I would suggest them.</li>
            <li> Seems like the original stuff to me, despite a different color. Still the best scent, after 35 years of trying other alternatives. My daughter doesn&#x27;t want me switch to anything else.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product was opened before I received it and as a result I am unhappy. I don&#x27;t recall seeing this detail in the selling ad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years and I still like it.It has a nice aroma and is long lasting and soothing.</li>
