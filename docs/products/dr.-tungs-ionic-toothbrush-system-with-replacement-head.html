    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I have been using my Ionic toothbrush for about two months now and I am very impressed with the results.  </li>
            <li>What a great product!    </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is awesome!  </li>
            <li>your going to be sooo very happy when you make this purchase.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been using Dr. Tungs Ionic Toothbrush for a month, my teeth are cleaner &amp; a great check-up at the dentist can be yours too!</li>
            <li>The toothbrush head is just the perfect size...</li>
            <li>A perfect gift idea as well.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for my size mouth and along with an herbal toothpaste, my periodontal problems have lessened rather than increased.</li>
            <li>How awesome is that?</li>
            <li>literally makes the plaque fall off the teeth, works best just with water, rinse your mouth and spit</li>
            <li>An excellent buy!</li>
            <li>My dentist is very impressed with my lack of plaque now!</li>
            <li>I am definately impressed and my teeth are cleaner and whiter.</li>
            <li>This is the best toothbrush I have EVER used.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is AWESOME.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I spend 5 minutes brushing my teeth and gums because it feels so good!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been to the dentist yet but am expecting a good report!</li>
            <li>Great.</li>
            <li>Another great thing about this brush is that you don&#x27;t have to charge it.  </li>
            <li>Compared with the electric brushes I used to use, my teeth are doing great.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be great to save for vacations.</li>
            <li>Do what I did and you will be so happy inside and out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy I decided to buy an ionic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>so if the ionization works as it says it will I am really happy with this product.</li>
            <li>They do a great job.</li>
            <li>I own one of the Dr. Tung tongue cleaners, another excellent product, so I was not hesitant to make the purchase.</li>
            <li>I have seen a great improvement in my gums and teeth as a result.  </li>
            <li>And, they say they say can tell I do a great job flossing.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Your teeth look great, but you need to floss.  </li>
            <li>Great works as publishes</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li>This is a great inexpensive product compared to an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li>But it seems to do the job very nicely.</li>
            <li>and the hygienist said I was doing a great job and to keep up the good work.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s that good.  </li>
            <li>For instance, one study reported no benefit from using the Ionic Toothbrush for users who already had good oral hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good value and easier to travel with than an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>You make a good \\&quot;contact\\&quot; with the brush by holding its metal activation bar on the grip.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the feeling of electric toothbrushes, so this is a good alternative for me.  </li>
            <li>Good.</li>
            <li>In the interest of full disclosure, I do not have perfect teeth.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I love the product and service great and would recommend to all--Mary Helen Barletti</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this toothbrush</li>
            <li>It is a great item, keeps my teeth very clean.</li>
            <li>One of the most effective ways to remove plaque!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I bought this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>This ionic toothbrush is the most amazing toothbrush I have ever seen!  </li>
            <li>THIS IS TRULY AN AMAZING BRUSH.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s truly amazing.  </li>
            <li>Found that it was effective as an addition to my oral hygiene routine (sonic brushing, water pik,  flossing, scraping.)  </li>
            <li>The bristles are varied lengths, so they get between the teeth nicely.  </li>
            <li>It is absolutely the perfect softness....</li>
            <li>I was shopping for an electric toothbrush, and this one seemed interesting, with all the good reviews.</li>
            <li>and it fits nicely in my purse when I decide to take it with me.</li>
            <li>I notice that my teeth feel cleaner and that this product effectively helps remove plaque.</li>
            <li>I really like it and Amazon has the best price for it.</li>
            <li>The ionic aspect it quite effective.</li>
            <li>I must say that I am fairly picky in regards to what toothbrushes I have used and even more about which toothpaste as well.  </li>
            <li>So, I took a stab at cleaning my own tartar off.  </li>
            <li>i feel a nice cleaner feeling</li>
            <li>Now the no part in states that it will kind of cure your mouth health and gums it doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>In any case, I have already gotten very positive feedback from my dentist after brushing with one of the best electric toothbrushes on the market and taking the best whole food supplements money can buy, but I am sure what my Dr Tung&#x27;s brush accomplishes will blow the hygienist&#x27;s opinion away as well.</li>
            <li>however, I&#x27;ll use it longer and see if anything changes but as of right now very good tooth brush.</li>
            <li>Its great to have an affordable and effective way to clean your teeth and maintain your dental hygiene regimen.</li>
            <li>Definitely experienced improvement in &#x27;feel&#x27; of my teeth (squeaky clean) and reduced tartar.  </li>
            <li>By far the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I haven&#x27;t noticed that this one worked any better than Dr. Collins Perio toothbrush that I&#x27;ve been using for quite a while.</li>
            <li>So far using it is really awesome</li>
            <li>She apparently liked it much better</li>
            <li>You will really like this tooth brush,it is great for removing stains,food particles,and does a great job at making your teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product which works its magic to great effect without much effort being exerted on the part of the user.</li>
            <li>Very nice, soft toothbrush which came highly recommended by Nadine Artemis in her wonderful book entitled Holistic Dental Care.</li>
            <li>and this puppy works much, much better than any of them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this toothbrush for a month now and am pleased.  </li>
            <li>When I go to the dentist in a couple of months I will know for sure if it makes a difference.</li>
            <li>If that is so make sure you stick with a trusted brand.</li>
            <li>I love how smooth my teeth feel after brushing!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t like it at all, switched to Sonicare and love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Also enjoying Dr. Tung&#x27;s [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Cleaner]]--cleaner and fresher than ever:)</li>
            <li>and I can feel the gaps between my teeth more than before.</li>
            <li>I love this thing.  </li>
            <li>My gums are healthier and I am able to go longer between dental cleanings.  </li>
            <li>but thought maybe this would do better</li>
            <li>Next, I tried it with my Ayurvedic toothpaste...and, that was even more awesome!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an interesting technology</li>
            <li>Am I glad I bought this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Two  words love it</li>
            <li>I think it does get more plaque off...</li>
            <li>I am assuming it was more plague.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>i hope it&#x27;s okay to use with</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going in for a cleaning one more time just to hear my hygienist say, &amp;#</li>
            <li>Ok, so I&#x27;ve been using the electric Oral-B toothbrush for years.  </li>
            <li>This is my second purchase and I have had the best check ups since using this brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m glad I was able to find this toothbrush again.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>After a week I was able to use an inter-dent brush that I had not been able to use before.</li>
            <li>My dentist always says I am doing a good job keeping the teeth clean and free of tartar.</li>
            <li>It is amazing watching it clean your teeth.</li>
            <li>Lots of clever people in the world and this is a must have imo, for great dental health.</li>
            <li>It is the best toothbrush particularly for children &#x27;&#x27;cuz kids tend to not brush their teeth very well!</li>
            <li>This was amazing for me from the very first use.  </li>
            <li>Dr Tung&#x27;s toothbrush caused my mouth to water...and, my teeth felt really clean!  </li>
            <li>My teeth felt squeaky clean, like when I get done at the dentist!  </li>
            <li>My teeth felt squeaky clean, like when I get done at the dentist!  </li>
            <li>Once I started using the product again, within a week I noticed a positive difference!!!  </li>
            <li>For your own sake stop over-analyzing and just get one right now.</li>
            <li>The handle is nice to hold, the overall design streamlined and attractive, and it&#x27;s easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is the best $20 something dollar that I&#x27;ve ever spent!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and eficient.</li>
            <li>I found this toothbrush easy to use, gets into all the cracks and crevices of my teeth.</li>
            <li>After using this for a week or more I tried my Sonicare again and my teeth felt clean again,</li>
            <li>My teeth feel really clean after using this, and mostly all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy on the gums, too.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s strong antibacterial/remineralization benefits</li>
            <li>Even if I eat something as strong smelling as Kimchee and curry, if I brush my teeth with this toothbrush, the smell is gone.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t explain how it does that, but it&#x27;s pretty amazing.  </li>
            <li>I would have rated this much higher as it does the job quite well however in order to replace the battery i will have to take the toothbrush apart to see what kind of battery it needs and whether or not it will be replaceable, though the manufacturer says it&#x27;s not replaceable</li>
            <li>It is fine.  </li>
            <li>Just a very gentle brushing at a 45 degree angle, making sure you get the gums as well, makes your mouth feel very clean</li>
            <li>I use this for more than 20 years, I just bought a new one, great technology, really</li>
            <li>However the light on my brush quit working after 3 days.</li>
            <li>The light is suppose to be an indicator that the process is working.</li>
            <li>I am also pleased at how fresh my breath is after each use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is important to note though</li>
            <li>cheap added bit of health insurance.</li>
            <li>I use dental implements at home, mirror, scaler, gum massager and this toothbrush is a welcome addition to my daily</li>
            <li>so I am going to see which one that was and switch and see if I have any better success with it.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is so fantastic.</li>
            <li>Then your teeth are amazingly smooth</li>
            <li>The effect of the ionic toothbrush leaves your teeth feeling super clean even without flossing!</li>
            <li>BUT this ionic toothbrush gently removes plaque -- even under my gum line!!!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; stuff that well, but this things leaves my mouth all fresh!</li>
            <li>Ok, first I will admit that I bought this toothbrush by mistake.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m very pleased with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Since I used 2 new products together that may be the reason I find it so effective.</li>
            <li>It gets my teeth so clean that it feels like I&#x27;ve just had a visit to the dentist</li>
            <li>teeth have never felt so clean.</li>
            <li>Makes my teeth feel and look sooo clean.</li>
            <li>Keeps the baseline of your teeth with crowns exceptionally clean.</li>
            <li>This method allows me to use the ionic toothbrush to get my teeth really clean while protecting my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Dang does this clean</li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li>My Teeth feel so clean.  </li>
            <li>My dental hygienist even commented on how clean my teeth and gums were - now THAT&#x27;S  a compliment.</li>
            <li>After about 3 days or so, your teeth will be so clean you won&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li>This product cleans your teeth better than any other type of toothbrush and does a good job cleaning your tongue too.</li>
            <li>this toothbrush is amazing although I do think it can cause tooth pain for sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush head could be a bit beefier and stiffer, but I&#x27;ve adjusted and brush a bit more gently</li>
            <li>My teeth and whole mouth feel cleaner and my gums do not bleed any more.  </li>
            <li>My mouth sure feels much cleaner however.  </li>
            <li>It is in my opinion not a viable substitute for good old-fashioned brushing and flossing, but it has its place in overall dental care.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much lighter and more pack-able than my electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly, my teeth look and feel like they&#x27;ve been professionally cleaned.</li>
            <li>Every time I brush my teeth with the Ionic toothbrush, my teeth feel so smooth, like right after a dentist cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I also always have fresh clean breath.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok, dont know if it works better than standard toothbrush yet</li>
            <li>Packaged well, came quickly, and as described.</li>
            <li>my teeth are super duper</li>
            <li>super clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On Sunday, Sep 5th 2010, I use the ionic toothbrush for the very first time (without toothpaste or water).</li>
            <li>Overall I am very pleased with this product and have bought as gifts for family and spouse.  </li>
            <li>It does the job perfectly without being too hard on my teeth and gums, and my teeth are cleaner than they&#x27;ve ever been!</li>
            <li>Even a dry brushing (sans paste, baking soda, etc...) makes for nice smooth teeth.  </li>
            <li>, I need to brush very lightly with a soft bristle brush.</li>
            <li>I go twice a year for a cleaning and they pick around a little and say what a great job I have done..</li>
            <li>Really does a fantastic job of cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really worth the money you spend.</li>
            <li>but now it&#x27;s fun to brush and immediately feel and see the results.    </li>
            <li>and I would recommend trying it because it is worth seeing if it makes a difference.  </li>
            <li>My gums and breath feel fresher and stay fresh all day.</li>
            <li>worth the money&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I also can not say that I like the way you have to make sure your finger is touching the metal &amp;#34;tab&amp;#34; or plate and is always wet while you are using it.</li>
            <li>My curiosity was peaked, and I found Dr. Tung&#x27;s ionic toothbrush and the Natural Dentist brand Peppermint Sage Healthy Teeth and Gums Fluoride-Free toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are super clean, and my gums are better than they have been in a long time.</li>
            <li>Dr. Lung&#x27;s) I will say my teeth have never been cleaner except right after a cleaning.</li>
            <li>price was right</li>
            <li>From the hype that I read, and the reviews I have seen, I should be seeing and feeling a difference right now</li>
            <li>But the button is not in the right place.</li>
            <li>It really does clean fairly well, but I didn&#x27;t notice any miracle lightening effects or super-clean feeling as described by other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So you can easily upgrade yours with the new heads.</li>
            <li>Finally I got my IONIC toothbrush, I was skeptic about it, but now I have tested on my own and I can tell that you can feel a difference since the first time.</li>
            <li>there isn&#x27;t really much if anything to clean.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel so clean and so much cleaner than using a sonicare brush.</li>
            <li>With rebate, this outstanding toothbrush only cost me about $50 and delivers far better cleaning for my teeth than did Dr. Tung&#x27;s Ionic Toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other key tools of great dental health are a good tongue scrapper, oil pulling with salt and essential oils, and a water pick.</li>
            <li>I could easily feel significant amounts of plaque that had accumulated on them in that short time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However I liked the results so much, this is the only toothbrush I use.</li>
            <li>The price is quite reasonable, and this toothbrush certainly more than compares to my old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This toothbrush makes my teeth white, clean and so strong.</li>
            <li>had to stop using TOTAL toothpaste, which is great and gives me the same feeling, because it has triclosan in it</li>
            <li>The price of the toothbrush may have been higher anyway if the battery was indeed replaceable and would not be worth the risk for the company however, it will have me looking for a better brand in the future when it comes time to replace the bristle heads that came with the toothbrush</li>
            <li>You need to wet your hands to make for better conductivity (don&#x27;t try this with your hairdryer, please!).</li>
            <li>The fact that my teeth feel so clean and tend to stay with the clean feeling longer throughout the day (this part was not expected because in all the research I have done on the Soladey type toothbrush, I have not read this to be a benefit -</li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean, smooth and look white.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take up any more space than a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Went in for a teeth cleaning and the tech was amazed that my teeth were in such good condition - barely any plague.  </li>
            <li>Different packaging than what was pictured, but I am enjoying my Ionic Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I now consider the Dr. Tung&#x27;s toothbrush an essential tool in my arsenal to keep my teeth healthy.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t take a whole 2 min of brushing either!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying these Ionic brushes for a couple of years because they work much, much better than regular brushes and electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>that we had  used for several years and it was doing ( Ok I thought )  </li>
            <li>First, I tried Dr. Tung&#x27;s ionic toothbrush with no toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Needless to say i am very impressed by the technology and</li>
            <li>;)      </li>
            <li>I noticed a difference from the first time using this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see what my dentist has to say in a couple more months when I go to my regular 6 month appointment.  </li>
            <li>I bought my first one thinking that it was some type of hype and probably wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I add just a tiny smidgen, more for the taste than anything.</li>
            <li>The first couple of times I used the Dr. Tungs Toothbrush it stung and tingled a bit...</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>really healthier teeth are included with the price.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li>But let me back up and share that I have a history of at best once a year dental visits that usually go like this.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning kit got here first.  </li>
            <li>Well, the toothpaste has glycerin as the first ingredient.  </li>
            <li>First the yes i&#x27;ve been using this brush over a month now</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why these aren&#x27;t more widely known about here in the States, but they should be, there would be a lot less tooth decay and a lot more shiny, healthy teeth!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was surprised how clean my teeth felt with just the use of water.  </li>
            <li>This seems to not only be good at helping prevent the build up of plaque, but over time seems to help reduce existing plaque, especially when used in conjunction with an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I did as much research as possible to make sure this wasn&#x27;t some quack product.</li>
            <li>handle is wrapped with a metal band that is connected to the positive pole of the battery.  </li>
            <li>So really, try it without paste first.</li>
            <li>This ionic toothbrush really does work to give me that \\&quot;clean mouth feeling\\&quot; after a professional tooth cleaning.</li>
            <li>The discomfort did go away after I stopped using it, but the next trip to the dentist wasn&#x27;t as easy.  </li>
            <li>I did try to believe that by just placing my wet finger over the little metal plate on the brush handle magic ions would clean my teeth and make them all better.</li>
            <li>B000OKR02C Smart Floss 30 yards]] and [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s inexspensive and smart.  </li>
            <li>I think the positive reviews I read from others on Amazon influenced me to the point of wanting to see fast results in regards to the appearance of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>The new Japanese model is available in FOUR colors, EIGHT replacement head shapes, TWO bristle firmness, and even a Tongue Cleaner head too!</li>
            <li>The IONIC TOOTHBRUSH features an ultra-fine bristle that is very soft and comfortable on sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read many reviews and finally decided to purchase this toothbrush for my 9 yr old son!</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t warp the bristles too much.  </li>
            <li>I had to spit out when there is too much saliva.</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really notice a difference</li>
            <li>You can check the battery life by pressing the end of the handle and a red light flashes to let you know it&#x27;s still got \\&quot;juice\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any real benefit to this.</li>
            <li>feel much cleaner after using an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My gums are healthy and pink.  </li>
            <li>B00064JGBO Stainless Steel Tongue</li>
            <li>I like this toothbrush so much, that I have recommended it to friends and family.</li>
            <li>Three out of six really like it.</li>
            <li>I just got it in the mail and used it once, but just after one use, my teeth feels so much cleaner</li>
            <li>I believe it really works and have always wanted another one.</li>
            <li>For myself this toothbrush really works.  </li>
            <li>While I&#x27;ve only used this for a few weeks, I can already see how much better the Dr. Tung&#x27;s brush is compared to my electric toothbrush for which I paid 8 times more.</li>
            <li>haha)</li>
            <li>So, you really can use it without toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Just feel it is a gimmick to spend too much for a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It does not so much \\&quot;brush your teeth\\&quot;</li>
            <li>As per the products claim, my teeth really did feel cleaner to the tongue.</li>
            <li>I also noticed a distinct cleaning action on gum surfaces that results in a cleaner tasting mouth.</li>
            <li>I really like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I really did try.</li>
            <li>I really hope this helps someone as I struggled with gum and teeth problems.  </li>
            <li>After much research I found this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I had an area of gum that wasn&#x27;t healing very well after a root canal.  </li>
            <li>I switched from my electric toothbrush to this ironic one when I read that the ionic toothbrush helped to remove plaque at a much faster rate.  </li>
            <li>It really reduces plaque drastically.</li>
            <li>My mom got it for me when I had braces and it really helped keep my teeth</li>
            <li>I am running my tongue over my teeth and they feel so smooth, even in the back of them.  </li>
            <li>I am running my tongue over my teeth and they feel so smooth, even in the back of them.  </li>
            <li>We are buying them for our whole family.</li>
            <li>I own a few sonic-care electric toothbrushes and have written reviews about them on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It says it takes several uses before you can feel a big difference and to be honest</li>
            <li>I have been using Sonicare for a few years and before that I used the old Rotadent which I LOVED.</li>
            <li>After a short while I could tell the difference in how clean my teeth felt, and my dental health really improved according to my hygienist.  </li>
            <li>I was able to scrape off about 50% of the build up, but the other 50% stubbornly clung to my teeth.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean ALL THE TIME, as if I just brushed them.</li>
            <li>I feel extra clean now.  </li>
            <li>The IONIC TOOTHBRUSH at first glance appears to be either a great idea or a laughable dose of snake oil for the techno-gulible.</li>
            <li>For the last five years now I have used this toothbrush and there is nothing to clean when I go to the dentist.</li>
            <li>I would also like to mention that when you first use the toothbrush it will make your teeth feel sensitive and you will probably experience pain.</li>
            <li>For anyone who questions if that current is even happening or if it&#x27;s strong enough to have an effect, it IS strong enough for me to feel it.</li>
            <li>I really like my new toothbrush.</li>
            <li>A typical wireless router signal carries over 70,000 times more power.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s an odd statement to make I know, but I love the feeling after I brush my teeth</li>
            <li>For me, Dr. Tung&#x27;s Ionic Toothbrush failed to clean my teeth nearly as well as good electric toothbrushes from Interplak, Oral-B, Waterpik or Sonicare.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel ok immediately after brushing with a regular toothbrush, but they definitely were cleaner and felt cleaner longer with the ionic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I just have to go on faith that it actually loosens the plaque more than regular brushing.  </li>
            <li>Then I purchased a high speed power toothbrush and abandoned this one as it was getting older</li>
            <li>But even with Sensodyne, my teeth can feel a certain current (especially in the more sensitive prone spots on my teeth)</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I have to be honest, there was not enough evidence for me to recommend this as an alternative to any other Ionic brush out there.</li>
            <li>RED]] when it first came out years ago in Japan cos&#x27; having mini solar panels on my toothbrush handle is so gadget-cool!  </li>
            <li>I always hear how little plaque and how healthy my mouth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve reduced my cleaning visits to once a year because (with also changing my eating habits) I noticed in recent visits the hygienist really doesn&#x27;t have very much to do - virtually no plaque -</li>
            <li>Though a little toothpaste won&#x27;t hurt any from time to time especially upon first usage it almost feels like tin foil after brushing my teeth which is probably because i never go to the dentist, but besides my 3 star rating, i give 5 stars to the technological effort put into this toothbrush and is better than those battery powered ones that really don&#x27;t do much of anything but use up energy.</li>
            <li>Dr. Tung&#x27;s Ionic Toothbrush looked intriguing and promotional material claimed to back up its efficacy with clinical studies, so I ordered one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can use the sensitive toothpaste with this to help keep your teeth from hurting too much.</li>
            <li>A few more notes-</li>
            <li>after I brush for more than a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>Firstly about this listing, thumbnail shows the current US model but the listing&#x27;s main image shows an older yellow-box model, so which one is it?  </li>
            <li>The very first time I used it I was somewhat surprised to say the least at how smooth and clean my teeth felt from such a soft brush and no toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Brand new and non working battery.</li>
            <li>I used this toothbrush w/ Restore toothpaste which was also new to me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using the new Sensodyne ProNamel</li>
            <li>Earthority.com carries the new model!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>THE NEW MODEL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only that, but there was hardly any bleeding, which for me was just as surprising.  </li>
            <li>Not only that, but there was hardly any bleeding, which for me was just as surprising.  </li>
            <li>I do notice some sensitivities issues but at present not very bad.  </li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, my sensitive gum nerve is not bothering me near as much, after using this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I do not like the bristles as they are very soft and flimsey.  </li>
            <li>The ionic bristles are very soft</li>
            <li>more plaque farms, no more food particles stuck in between teeth or under bridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, my teeth felt different the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>The thing I noticed about it is that it keeps my mouth feeling fresh all day long.  </li>
            <li>After I brushed, I used my dental tools again to try for that last 50%, and sure enough it ALL came off.  </li>
            <li>After I brushed, I used my dental tools again to try for that last 50%, and sure enough it ALL came off.  </li>
            <li>The first three times I used it all sorts of white material came out of my mouth.</li>
            <li>At my six month checkup my dentist advised that my teeth were clean, so it was due to Dr tung&#x27;s toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Luckily, heads for the new models are backward-compatible with the old models.  </li>
            <li>My dentist confirmed that my teeth have much less plaque.</li>
            <li>When you brush with a hyG toothbrush, a constant flow of positive ions (+) from the lithium power source temporarily reverses your teeth?s polarity.</li>
            <li>About the only positive things I can say</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth anymore only after it and crest toothpaste or Crest Complete Extra Whitening With Tartar Protection Toothpaste - Clean Mint .....</li>
            <li>The long and short bristles help to get between the teeth and clean the surface as well.</li>
            <li>I like to be able to choose between medium and hard bristle, and this is soft</li>
            <li>Also I have a slight space between my front teeth and the bristles gently clean there.</li>
            <li>They are not straight, very dingy (from age, not beverages as I do not drink much of anything but water).</li>
            <li>Almost immediately I could detect that my teeth were not being cleaned nearly as well as with electric toothbrushes (including brushes from Interplak, Oral-B, Waterpik and Sonicare).  </li>
            <li>B007VXJK6O Oral-B Smartseries 5000 Professional Care Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]].  </li>
            <li>brush is a soft brush where I am use to medium, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be a problem with how well it cleans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but using a toothpaste for sensitive teeth cured that for me.</li>
            <li>attribute whatever cleaning action</li>
            <li>The brush heads are soft and it is well</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t see much difference between this and a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I have never used the brush with toothpaste, so I attribute the cleaning action to the ionic effect.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even use toothpaste (and I use pricey paste for sensitive teeth).  </li>
            <li>I was surprised to find that it seemed to help my teeth feel and look cleaner during the day.  </li>
            <li>It is working well so far.</li>
            <li>but it has for me)is enough to have me here buying some for the whole family.</li>
            <li>I ordered a dental cleaning tool kit, the Natural Dentist toothpaste, and the Dr. Tung&#x27;s ionic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Then the Natural Dentist toothpaste got here.  </li>
            <li>I just used it, and I am completely stunned.  </li>
            <li>All I can attribute that lack of bleeding to is the Natural Dentist toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>to the lack of bleeding, I plan to continue with the Natural Dentist toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>All I can attribute that lack of bleeding to is the Natural Dentist toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>to the lack of bleeding, I plan to continue with the Natural Dentist toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>It is also soft on my gums as I brush aggressively and started noticing my gum line receeding because of this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is a big improvement over my standard toothbrush and well worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li>This is worth less as a main cleaning tool.</li>
            <li>The head of the toothbrush is small and the neck is slim, so it is easy to reach all areas in my mouth.</li>
            <li>The first time I used the Dr. Tung&#x27;s I got a little too excited and brushed too hard causing light bleeding.</li>
            <li>Now, I can expect that clean teeth feeling everyday.</li>
            <li>An ordinary LED pocket flashlight uses several million times more electrical power than Dr. Tung&#x27;s Ionic Toothbrush delivers for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First, I used it on teeth that hadn&#x27;t been brushed since last night (and it is afternoon).  </li>
            <li>but it is really strong, so I only use a little bit.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle, as opposed to any other type of electric brush) and seems to offer enhanced cleaning action.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to warn those with sensitive teeth that this toothbrush, despite having extra soft bristles, exacerbates the problem of sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend instead the Soladay ionic brush as seems higher quality &amp; don&#x27;t have to wet tour fingers and keep them on a metal strip to work.</li>
            <li>Anyways, after I scraped, I decided to brush my teeth with my regular toothbrush with the Natural Dentist toothpaste, and after I rinsed, WOW!  </li>
            <li>Anyways, after I scraped, I decided to brush my teeth with my regular toothbrush with the Natural Dentist toothpaste, and after I rinsed, WOW!  </li>
            <li>This imposes a resistance of several more million ohms, bringing the total brushing current down to well under one microamp and the electric power to under one microwatt.  </li>
            <li>The battery life is estimated to last one year (you get two brush heads with the toothbrush), after which you discard and buy a new brush.</li>
            <li>Dentist had less plaque to clean during my last cleaning!</li>
            <li>and I told her at least ten years or more</li>
            <li>The styling recalls American made clinical instruments of the sixties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristle arrangement is unusual, with interspersed long, soft nylon strands standing over shorter, sturdier bristles.  </li>
            <li>So, if you need to avoidtraditional scrubbing for sensitive gums recovering from periodontal disease or other inflamation, THE IONIC TOOTHBRUSH may very well be the answer.</li>
            <li>toothbrush is very different from a regular one; its head is small and its bristles are fine and soft -</li>
            <li>Perhaps I have not used it long enough to really make a difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a bit surprised actually that Amazon didn&#x27;t recommend this brush to me sooner.</li>
            <li>and i recommend you avoid doing that, especially for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, if I can keep using it, I&#x27;ll try to be objective about figuring out how well the plaque is diminished vs. how it was with my old tooth brush.</li>
            <li>so well I bare the discomfort.</li>
            <li>Between the bristles (I think they&#x27;re extra soft and made to go in between teeth/gums well) and the \\&quot;ionic stuff\\&quot;, something is working.</li>
            <li>I use it with a holistic dental program that involves essential oils and natural tooth pastes.</li>
            <li>I recently decided to look into natural dental care stuff.  </li>
            <li>Moreover, while the principle of electrostatic manipulation of plaque might indeed lead to better cleaning, the science behind its implementation in the Ionic Toothbrush is specious.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth and gums and it did hurt to use the ionic toothbrush with water only, so I applied the sensitive tooth/gum toothpaste first and then keep rinsing and brushing until I get down to water only.</li>
            <li>With the other brand, blackish bacterial buildup can be seen visually within weeks (onto the same head protecting cap) and my bathroom is very well-lit by natural sunlight too.  </li>
            <li>therefore I am giving this item a 4 STAR rating because its claim for the brush&#x27;s enhanced action cannot actually be proven objectively.    </li>
            <li>After using twice daily for several days I can definitely tell a major reduction of plaque particularly at the back of the 3 middle lower teeth where I&#x27;ve always had a sandpaper feel to my tongue except after dental cleaning.</li>
            <li>I had my regular dental appointment (3 times a year) on Sep 9th for general cleaning.</li>
            <li>Plus my teeth feel a whole lot smoother than using any other regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>and I am willing to go a few months to see.</li>
            <li>After using it twice a day for several days, my teeth, which are usually not too sensitive thanks to Sensodyne toothpaste, suddenly became extremely sensitive to hot and cold.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush  gets your teeth so much cleaner than a typical toothbrush</li>
            <li>First, it has a smaller asian brush head than the typical american toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It may come to pass that after I use this long enough my teeth will become too sensitive to handle it.  </li>
            <li>With this toothbrush, I never saw any mold/bacterial buildup ever, I credit this to its negative ion generation which has a mild sanitizing effect.  </li>
            <li>The problem for me is that I cannot tell by using it for a few weeks now if it is making a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot give it a higher rating because I simply cannot tell.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are not long lasting.  </li>
            <li>I had hardly any tarter on my teeth,this tooth brush really works!!</li>

            <li> and the hygienist said I was doing a great job and to keep up the good work.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s that good.  </li>
            <li> For instance, one study reported no benefit from using the Ionic Toothbrush for users who already had good oral hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good value and easier to travel with than an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> You make a good \\&quot;contact\\&quot; with the brush by holding its metal activation bar on the grip.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the feeling of electric toothbrushes, so this is a good alternative for me.  </li>
            <li> Good.</li>
            <li> In the interest of full disclosure, I do not have perfect teeth.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased with the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I love the product and service great and would recommend to all--Mary Helen Barletti</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this toothbrush</li>
            <li> It is a great item, keeps my teeth very clean.</li>
            <li> One of the most effective ways to remove plaque!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> This ionic toothbrush is the most amazing toothbrush I have ever seen!  </li>
            <li> THIS IS TRULY AN AMAZING BRUSH.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s truly amazing.  </li>
            <li> Found that it was effective as an addition to my oral hygiene routine (sonic brushing, water pik,  flossing, scraping.)  </li>
            <li> The bristles are varied lengths, so they get between the teeth nicely.  </li>
            <li> It is absolutely the perfect softness....</li>
            <li> I was shopping for an electric toothbrush, and this one seemed interesting, with all the good reviews.</li>
            <li> and it fits nicely in my purse when I decide to take it with me.</li>
            <li> I notice that my teeth feel cleaner and that this product effectively helps remove plaque.</li>
            <li> I really like it and Amazon has the best price for it.</li>
            <li> The ionic aspect it quite effective.</li>
            <li> I must say that I am fairly picky in regards to what toothbrushes I have used and even more about which toothpaste as well.  </li>
            <li> So, I took a stab at cleaning my own tartar off.  </li>
            <li> i feel a nice cleaner feeling</li>
            <li> Now the no part in states that it will kind of cure your mouth health and gums it doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> In any case, I have already gotten very positive feedback from my dentist after brushing with one of the best electric toothbrushes on the market and taking the best whole food supplements money can buy, but I am sure what my Dr Tung&#x27;s brush accomplishes will blow the hygienist&#x27;s opinion away as well.</li>
            <li> however, I&#x27;ll use it longer and see if anything changes but as of right now very good tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Its great to have an affordable and effective way to clean your teeth and maintain your dental hygiene regimen.</li>
            <li> Definitely experienced improvement in &#x27;feel&#x27; of my teeth (squeaky clean) and reduced tartar.  </li>
            <li> By far the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I haven&#x27;t noticed that this one worked any better than Dr. Collins Perio toothbrush that I&#x27;ve been using for quite a while.</li>
            <li> So far using it is really awesome</li>
            <li> She apparently liked it much better</li>
            <li> You will really like this tooth brush,it is great for removing stains,food particles,and does a great job at making your teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product which works its magic to great effect without much effort being exerted on the part of the user.</li>
            <li> Very nice, soft toothbrush which came highly recommended by Nadine Artemis in her wonderful book entitled Holistic Dental Care.</li>
            <li> and this puppy works much, much better than any of them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this toothbrush for a month now and am pleased.  </li>
            <li> When I go to the dentist in a couple of months I will know for sure if it makes a difference.</li>
            <li> If that is so make sure you stick with a trusted brand.</li>
            <li> I love how smooth my teeth feel after brushing!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it at all, switched to Sonicare and love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Also enjoying Dr. Tung&#x27;s [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Cleaner]]--cleaner and fresher than ever:)</li>
            <li> and I can feel the gaps between my teeth more than before.</li>
            <li> I love this thing.  </li>
            <li> My gums are healthier and I am able to go longer between dental cleanings.  </li>
            <li> but thought maybe this would do better</li>
            <li> Next, I tried it with my Ayurvedic toothpaste...and, that was even more awesome!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an interesting technology</li>
            <li> Am I glad I bought this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Two  words love it</li>
            <li> I think it does get more plaque off...</li>
            <li> I am assuming it was more plague.  </li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> i hope it&#x27;s okay to use with</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going in for a cleaning one more time just to hear my hygienist say, &amp;#</li>
            <li> Ok, so I&#x27;ve been using the electric Oral-B toothbrush for years.  </li>
            <li> This is my second purchase and I have had the best check ups since using this brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I was able to find this toothbrush again.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> After a week I was able to use an inter-dent brush that I had not been able to use before.</li>
            <li> My dentist always says I am doing a good job keeping the teeth clean and free of tartar.</li>
            <li> It is amazing watching it clean your teeth.</li>
            <li> Lots of clever people in the world and this is a must have imo, for great dental health.</li>
            <li> It is the best toothbrush particularly for children &#x27;&#x27;cuz kids tend to not brush their teeth very well!</li>
            <li> This was amazing for me from the very first use.  </li>
            <li> Dr Tung&#x27;s toothbrush caused my mouth to water...and, my teeth felt really clean!  </li>
            <li> My teeth felt squeaky clean, like when I get done at the dentist!  </li>
            <li> My teeth felt squeaky clean, like when I get done at the dentist!  </li>
            <li> Once I started using the product again, within a week I noticed a positive difference!!!  </li>
            <li> For your own sake stop over-analyzing and just get one right now.</li>
            <li> The handle is nice to hold, the overall design streamlined and attractive, and it&#x27;s easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is the best $20 something dollar that I&#x27;ve ever spent!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and eficient.</li>
            <li> I found this toothbrush easy to use, gets into all the cracks and crevices of my teeth.</li>
            <li> After using this for a week or more I tried my Sonicare again and my teeth felt clean again,</li>
            <li> My teeth feel really clean after using this, and mostly all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy on the gums, too.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s strong antibacterial/remineralization benefits</li>
            <li> Even if I eat something as strong smelling as Kimchee and curry, if I brush my teeth with this toothbrush, the smell is gone.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t explain how it does that, but it&#x27;s pretty amazing.  </li>
            <li> I would have rated this much higher as it does the job quite well however in order to replace the battery i will have to take the toothbrush apart to see what kind of battery it needs and whether or not it will be replaceable, though the manufacturer says it&#x27;s not replaceable</li>
            <li> It is fine.  </li>
            <li> Just a very gentle brushing at a 45 degree angle, making sure you get the gums as well, makes your mouth feel very clean</li>
            <li> I use this for more than 20 years, I just bought a new one, great technology, really</li>
            <li> However the light on my brush quit working after 3 days.</li>
            <li> The light is suppose to be an indicator that the process is working.</li>
            <li> I am also pleased at how fresh my breath is after each use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is important to note though</li>
            <li> cheap added bit of health insurance.</li>
            <li> I use dental implements at home, mirror, scaler, gum massager and this toothbrush is a welcome addition to my daily</li>
            <li> so I am going to see which one that was and switch and see if I have any better success with it.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush is so fantastic.</li>
            <li> Then your teeth are amazingly smooth</li>
            <li> The effect of the ionic toothbrush leaves your teeth feeling super clean even without flossing!</li>
            <li> BUT this ionic toothbrush gently removes plaque -- even under my gum line!!!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; stuff that well, but this things leaves my mouth all fresh!</li>
            <li> Ok, first I will admit that I bought this toothbrush by mistake.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m very pleased with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Since I used 2 new products together that may be the reason I find it so effective.</li>
            <li> It gets my teeth so clean that it feels like I&#x27;ve just had a visit to the dentist</li>
            <li> teeth have never felt so clean.</li>
            <li> Makes my teeth feel and look sooo clean.</li>
            <li> Keeps the baseline of your teeth with crowns exceptionally clean.</li>
            <li> This method allows me to use the ionic toothbrush to get my teeth really clean while protecting my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dang does this clean</li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li> My Teeth feel so clean.  </li>
            <li> My dental hygienist even commented on how clean my teeth and gums were - now THAT&#x27;S  a compliment.</li>
            <li> After about 3 days or so, your teeth will be so clean you won&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li> This product cleans your teeth better than any other type of toothbrush and does a good job cleaning your tongue too.</li>
            <li> this toothbrush is amazing although I do think it can cause tooth pain for sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush head could be a bit beefier and stiffer, but I&#x27;ve adjusted and brush a bit more gently</li>
            <li> My teeth and whole mouth feel cleaner and my gums do not bleed any more.  </li>
            <li> My mouth sure feels much cleaner however.  </li>
            <li> It is in my opinion not a viable substitute for good old-fashioned brushing and flossing, but it has its place in overall dental care.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much lighter and more pack-able than my electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Honestly, my teeth look and feel like they&#x27;ve been professionally cleaned.</li>
            <li> Every time I brush my teeth with the Ionic toothbrush, my teeth feel so smooth, like right after a dentist cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I also always have fresh clean breath.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok, dont know if it works better than standard toothbrush yet</li>
            <li> Packaged well, came quickly, and as described.</li>
            <li> my teeth are super duper</li>
            <li> super clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On Sunday, Sep 5th 2010, I use the ionic toothbrush for the very first time (without toothpaste or water).</li>
            <li> Overall I am very pleased with this product and have bought as gifts for family and spouse.  </li>
            <li> It does the job perfectly without being too hard on my teeth and gums, and my teeth are cleaner than they&#x27;ve ever been!</li>
            <li> Even a dry brushing (sans paste, baking soda, etc...) makes for nice smooth teeth.  </li>
            <li> , I need to brush very lightly with a soft bristle brush.</li>
            <li> I go twice a year for a cleaning and they pick around a little and say what a great job I have done..</li>
            <li> Really does a fantastic job of cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really worth the money you spend.</li>
            <li> but now it&#x27;s fun to brush and immediately feel and see the results.    </li>
            <li> and I would recommend trying it because it is worth seeing if it makes a difference.  </li>
            <li> My gums and breath feel fresher and stay fresh all day.</li>
            <li> worth the money&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I also can not say that I like the way you have to make sure your finger is touching the metal &amp;#34;tab&amp;#34; or plate and is always wet while you are using it.</li>
            <li> My curiosity was peaked, and I found Dr. Tung&#x27;s ionic toothbrush and the Natural Dentist brand Peppermint Sage Healthy Teeth and Gums Fluoride-Free toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are super clean, and my gums are better than they have been in a long time.</li>
            <li> Dr. Lung&#x27;s) I will say my teeth have never been cleaner except right after a cleaning.</li>
            <li> price was right</li>
            <li> From the hype that I read, and the reviews I have seen, I should be seeing and feeling a difference right now</li>
            <li> But the button is not in the right place.</li>
            <li> It really does clean fairly well, but I didn&#x27;t notice any miracle lightening effects or super-clean feeling as described by other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So you can easily upgrade yours with the new heads.</li>
            <li> Finally I got my IONIC toothbrush, I was skeptic about it, but now I have tested on my own and I can tell that you can feel a difference since the first time.</li>
            <li> there isn&#x27;t really much if anything to clean.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean and so much cleaner than using a sonicare brush.</li>
            <li> With rebate, this outstanding toothbrush only cost me about $50 and delivers far better cleaning for my teeth than did Dr. Tung&#x27;s Ionic Toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other key tools of great dental health are a good tongue scrapper, oil pulling with salt and essential oils, and a water pick.</li>
            <li> I could easily feel significant amounts of plaque that had accumulated on them in that short time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However I liked the results so much, this is the only toothbrush I use.</li>
            <li> The price is quite reasonable, and this toothbrush certainly more than compares to my old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This toothbrush makes my teeth white, clean and so strong.</li>
            <li> had to stop using TOTAL toothpaste, which is great and gives me the same feeling, because it has triclosan in it</li>
            <li> The price of the toothbrush may have been higher anyway if the battery was indeed replaceable and would not be worth the risk for the company however, it will have me looking for a better brand in the future when it comes time to replace the bristle heads that came with the toothbrush</li>
            <li> You need to wet your hands to make for better conductivity (don&#x27;t try this with your hairdryer, please!).</li>
            <li> The fact that my teeth feel so clean and tend to stay with the clean feeling longer throughout the day (this part was not expected because in all the research I have done on the Soladey type toothbrush, I have not read this to be a benefit -</li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean, smooth and look white.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take up any more space than a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Went in for a teeth cleaning and the tech was amazed that my teeth were in such good condition - barely any plague.  </li>
            <li> Different packaging than what was pictured, but I am enjoying my Ionic Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I now consider the Dr. Tung&#x27;s toothbrush an essential tool in my arsenal to keep my teeth healthy.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t take a whole 2 min of brushing either!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these Ionic brushes for a couple of years because they work much, much better than regular brushes and electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> that we had  used for several years and it was doing ( Ok I thought )  </li>
            <li> First, I tried Dr. Tung&#x27;s ionic toothbrush with no toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say i am very impressed by the technology and</li>
            <li> ;)      </li>
            <li> I noticed a difference from the first time using this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see what my dentist has to say in a couple more months when I go to my regular 6 month appointment.  </li>
            <li> I bought my first one thinking that it was some type of hype and probably wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I add just a tiny smidgen, more for the taste than anything.</li>
            <li> The first couple of times I used the Dr. Tungs Toothbrush it stung and tingled a bit...</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> really healthier teeth are included with the price.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> But let me back up and share that I have a history of at best once a year dental visits that usually go like this.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning kit got here first.  </li>
            <li> Well, the toothpaste has glycerin as the first ingredient.  </li>
            <li> First the yes i&#x27;ve been using this brush over a month now</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why these aren&#x27;t more widely known about here in the States, but they should be, there would be a lot less tooth decay and a lot more shiny, healthy teeth!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was surprised how clean my teeth felt with just the use of water.  </li>
            <li> This seems to not only be good at helping prevent the build up of plaque, but over time seems to help reduce existing plaque, especially when used in conjunction with an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I did as much research as possible to make sure this wasn&#x27;t some quack product.</li>
            <li> handle is wrapped with a metal band that is connected to the positive pole of the battery.  </li>
            <li> So really, try it without paste first.</li>
            <li> This ionic toothbrush really does work to give me that \\&quot;clean mouth feeling\\&quot; after a professional tooth cleaning.</li>
            <li> The discomfort did go away after I stopped using it, but the next trip to the dentist wasn&#x27;t as easy.  </li>
            <li> I did try to believe that by just placing my wet finger over the little metal plate on the brush handle magic ions would clean my teeth and make them all better.</li>
            <li> B000OKR02C Smart Floss 30 yards]] and [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s inexspensive and smart.  </li>
            <li> I think the positive reviews I read from others on Amazon influenced me to the point of wanting to see fast results in regards to the appearance of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> The new Japanese model is available in FOUR colors, EIGHT replacement head shapes, TWO bristle firmness, and even a Tongue Cleaner head too!</li>

            <li> I believe it really works and have always wanted another one.</li>
            <li> For myself this toothbrush really works.  </li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve only used this for a few weeks, I can already see how much better the Dr. Tung&#x27;s brush is compared to my electric toothbrush for which I paid 8 times more.</li>
            <li> haha)</li>
            <li> So, you really can use it without toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Just feel it is a gimmick to spend too much for a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It does not so much \\&quot;brush your teeth\\&quot;</li>
            <li> As per the products claim, my teeth really did feel cleaner to the tongue.</li>
            <li> I also noticed a distinct cleaning action on gum surfaces that results in a cleaner tasting mouth.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I really did try.</li>
            <li> I really hope this helps someone as I struggled with gum and teeth problems.  </li>
            <li> After much research I found this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I had an area of gum that wasn&#x27;t healing very well after a root canal.  </li>
            <li> I switched from my electric toothbrush to this ironic one when I read that the ionic toothbrush helped to remove plaque at a much faster rate.  </li>
            <li> It really reduces plaque drastically.</li>
            <li> My mom got it for me when I had braces and it really helped keep my teeth</li>
            <li> I am running my tongue over my teeth and they feel so smooth, even in the back of them.  </li>
            <li> I am running my tongue over my teeth and they feel so smooth, even in the back of them.  </li>
            <li> We are buying them for our whole family.</li>
            <li> I own a few sonic-care electric toothbrushes and have written reviews about them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It says it takes several uses before you can feel a big difference and to be honest</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare for a few years and before that I used the old Rotadent which I LOVED.</li>
            <li> After a short while I could tell the difference in how clean my teeth felt, and my dental health really improved according to my hygienist.  </li>
            <li> I was able to scrape off about 50% of the build up, but the other 50% stubbornly clung to my teeth.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean ALL THE TIME, as if I just brushed them.</li>
            <li> I feel extra clean now.  </li>
            <li> The IONIC TOOTHBRUSH at first glance appears to be either a great idea or a laughable dose of snake oil for the techno-gulible.</li>
            <li> For the last five years now I have used this toothbrush and there is nothing to clean when I go to the dentist.</li>
            <li> I would also like to mention that when you first use the toothbrush it will make your teeth feel sensitive and you will probably experience pain.</li>
            <li> For anyone who questions if that current is even happening or if it&#x27;s strong enough to have an effect, it IS strong enough for me to feel it.</li>
            <li> I really like my new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> A typical wireless router signal carries over 70,000 times more power.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s an odd statement to make I know, but I love the feeling after I brush my teeth</li>
            <li> For me, Dr. Tung&#x27;s Ionic Toothbrush failed to clean my teeth nearly as well as good electric toothbrushes from Interplak, Oral-B, Waterpik or Sonicare.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel ok immediately after brushing with a regular toothbrush, but they definitely were cleaner and felt cleaner longer with the ionic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I just have to go on faith that it actually loosens the plaque more than regular brushing.  </li>
            <li> Then I purchased a high speed power toothbrush and abandoned this one as it was getting older</li>
            <li> But even with Sensodyne, my teeth can feel a certain current (especially in the more sensitive prone spots on my teeth)</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I have to be honest, there was not enough evidence for me to recommend this as an alternative to any other Ionic brush out there.</li>
            <li> RED]] when it first came out years ago in Japan cos&#x27; having mini solar panels on my toothbrush handle is so gadget-cool!  </li>
            <li> I always hear how little plaque and how healthy my mouth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve reduced my cleaning visits to once a year because (with also changing my eating habits) I noticed in recent visits the hygienist really doesn&#x27;t have very much to do - virtually no plaque -</li>
            <li> Though a little toothpaste won&#x27;t hurt any from time to time especially upon first usage it almost feels like tin foil after brushing my teeth which is probably because i never go to the dentist, but besides my 3 star rating, i give 5 stars to the technological effort put into this toothbrush and is better than those battery powered ones that really don&#x27;t do much of anything but use up energy.</li>
            <li> Dr. Tung&#x27;s Ionic Toothbrush looked intriguing and promotional material claimed to back up its efficacy with clinical studies, so I ordered one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can use the sensitive toothpaste with this to help keep your teeth from hurting too much.</li>
            <li> A few more notes-</li>
            <li> after I brush for more than a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> Firstly about this listing, thumbnail shows the current US model but the listing&#x27;s main image shows an older yellow-box model, so which one is it?  </li>
            <li> The very first time I used it I was somewhat surprised to say the least at how smooth and clean my teeth felt from such a soft brush and no toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Brand new and non working battery.</li>
            <li> I used this toothbrush w/ Restore toothpaste which was also new to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using the new Sensodyne ProNamel</li>
            <li> Earthority.com carries the new model!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> THE NEW MODEL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not only that, but there was hardly any bleeding, which for me was just as surprising.  </li>
            <li> Not only that, but there was hardly any bleeding, which for me was just as surprising.  </li>
            <li> I do notice some sensitivities issues but at present not very bad.  </li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, my sensitive gum nerve is not bothering me near as much, after using this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I do not like the bristles as they are very soft and flimsey.  </li>
            <li> The ionic bristles are very soft</li>
            <li> more plaque farms, no more food particles stuck in between teeth or under bridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , my teeth felt different the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> The thing I noticed about it is that it keeps my mouth feeling fresh all day long.  </li>
            <li> After I brushed, I used my dental tools again to try for that last 50%, and sure enough it ALL came off.  </li>
            <li> After I brushed, I used my dental tools again to try for that last 50%, and sure enough it ALL came off.  </li>
            <li> The first three times I used it all sorts of white material came out of my mouth.</li>
            <li> At my six month checkup my dentist advised that my teeth were clean, so it was due to Dr tung&#x27;s toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Luckily, heads for the new models are backward-compatible with the old models.  </li>
            <li> My dentist confirmed that my teeth have much less plaque.</li>
            <li> When you brush with a hyG toothbrush, a constant flow of positive ions (+) from the lithium power source temporarily reverses your teeth?s polarity.</li>
            <li> About the only positive things I can say</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth anymore only after it and crest toothpaste or Crest Complete Extra Whitening With Tartar Protection Toothpaste - Clean Mint .....</li>
            <li> The long and short bristles help to get between the teeth and clean the surface as well.</li>
            <li> I like to be able to choose between medium and hard bristle, and this is soft</li>
            <li> Also I have a slight space between my front teeth and the bristles gently clean there.</li>
            <li> They are not straight, very dingy (from age, not beverages as I do not drink much of anything but water).</li>
            <li> Almost immediately I could detect that my teeth were not being cleaned nearly as well as with electric toothbrushes (including brushes from Interplak, Oral-B, Waterpik and Sonicare).  </li>
            <li> B007VXJK6O Oral-B Smartseries 5000 Professional Care Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]].  </li>
            <li> brush is a soft brush where I am use to medium, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be a problem with how well it cleans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but using a toothpaste for sensitive teeth cured that for me.</li>
            <li> attribute whatever cleaning action</li>
            <li> The brush heads are soft and it is well</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see much difference between this and a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have never used the brush with toothpaste, so I attribute the cleaning action to the ionic effect.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even use toothpaste (and I use pricey paste for sensitive teeth).  </li>
            <li> I was surprised to find that it seemed to help my teeth feel and look cleaner during the day.  </li>
            <li> It is working well so far.</li>
            <li> but it has for me)is enough to have me here buying some for the whole family.</li>
            <li> I ordered a dental cleaning tool kit, the Natural Dentist toothpaste, and the Dr. Tung&#x27;s ionic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Then the Natural Dentist toothpaste got here.  </li>
            <li> I just used it, and I am completely stunned.  </li>
            <li> All I can attribute that lack of bleeding to is the Natural Dentist toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> to the lack of bleeding, I plan to continue with the Natural Dentist toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> All I can attribute that lack of bleeding to is the Natural Dentist toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> to the lack of bleeding, I plan to continue with the Natural Dentist toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> It is also soft on my gums as I brush aggressively and started noticing my gum line receeding because of this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is a big improvement over my standard toothbrush and well worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This is worth less as a main cleaning tool.</li>
            <li> The head of the toothbrush is small and the neck is slim, so it is easy to reach all areas in my mouth.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the Dr. Tung&#x27;s I got a little too excited and brushed too hard causing light bleeding.</li>
            <li> Now, I can expect that clean teeth feeling everyday.</li>
            <li> An ordinary LED pocket flashlight uses several million times more electrical power than Dr. Tung&#x27;s Ionic Toothbrush delivers for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First, I used it on teeth that hadn&#x27;t been brushed since last night (and it is afternoon).  </li>
            <li> but it is really strong, so I only use a little bit.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle, as opposed to any other type of electric brush) and seems to offer enhanced cleaning action.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to warn those with sensitive teeth that this toothbrush, despite having extra soft bristles, exacerbates the problem of sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend instead the Soladay ionic brush as seems higher quality &amp; don&#x27;t have to wet tour fingers and keep them on a metal strip to work.</li>
            <li> Anyways, after I scraped, I decided to brush my teeth with my regular toothbrush with the Natural Dentist toothpaste, and after I rinsed, WOW!  </li>
            <li> Anyways, after I scraped, I decided to brush my teeth with my regular toothbrush with the Natural Dentist toothpaste, and after I rinsed, WOW!  </li>
            <li> This imposes a resistance of several more million ohms, bringing the total brushing current down to well under one microamp and the electric power to under one microwatt.  </li>
            <li> The battery life is estimated to last one year (you get two brush heads with the toothbrush), after which you discard and buy a new brush.</li>
            <li> Dentist had less plaque to clean during my last cleaning!</li>
            <li> and I told her at least ten years or more</li>
            <li> The styling recalls American made clinical instruments of the sixties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristle arrangement is unusual, with interspersed long, soft nylon strands standing over shorter, sturdier bristles.  </li>
            <li> So, if you need to avoidtraditional scrubbing for sensitive gums recovering from periodontal disease or other inflamation, THE IONIC TOOTHBRUSH may very well be the answer.</li>
            <li> toothbrush is very different from a regular one; its head is small and its bristles are fine and soft -</li>
            <li> Perhaps I have not used it long enough to really make a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit surprised actually that Amazon didn&#x27;t recommend this brush to me sooner.</li>
            <li> and i recommend you avoid doing that, especially for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, if I can keep using it, I&#x27;ll try to be objective about figuring out how well the plaque is diminished vs. how it was with my old tooth brush.</li>
            <li> so well I bare the discomfort.</li>
            <li> Between the bristles (I think they&#x27;re extra soft and made to go in between teeth/gums well) and the \\&quot;ionic stuff\\&quot;, something is working.</li>
            <li> I use it with a holistic dental program that involves essential oils and natural tooth pastes.</li>
            <li> I recently decided to look into natural dental care stuff.  </li>
            <li> Moreover, while the principle of electrostatic manipulation of plaque might indeed lead to better cleaning, the science behind its implementation in the Ionic Toothbrush is specious.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and gums and it did hurt to use the ionic toothbrush with water only, so I applied the sensitive tooth/gum toothpaste first and then keep rinsing and brushing until I get down to water only.</li>
            <li> With the other brand, blackish bacterial buildup can be seen visually within weeks (onto the same head protecting cap) and my bathroom is very well-lit by natural sunlight too.  </li>
            <li> therefore I am giving this item a 4 STAR rating because its claim for the brush&#x27;s enhanced action cannot actually be proven objectively.    </li>
            <li> After using twice daily for several days I can definitely tell a major reduction of plaque particularly at the back of the 3 middle lower teeth where I&#x27;ve always had a sandpaper feel to my tongue except after dental cleaning.</li>
            <li> I had my regular dental appointment (3 times a year) on Sep 9th for general cleaning.</li>
            <li> Plus my teeth feel a whole lot smoother than using any other regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> and I am willing to go a few months to see.</li>
            <li> After using it twice a day for several days, my teeth, which are usually not too sensitive thanks to Sensodyne toothpaste, suddenly became extremely sensitive to hot and cold.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush  gets your teeth so much cleaner than a typical toothbrush</li>
            <li> First, it has a smaller asian brush head than the typical american toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It may come to pass that after I use this long enough my teeth will become too sensitive to handle it.  </li>
            <li> With this toothbrush, I never saw any mold/bacterial buildup ever, I credit this to its negative ion generation which has a mild sanitizing effect.  </li>
            <li> The problem for me is that I cannot tell by using it for a few weeks now if it is making a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot give it a higher rating because I simply cannot tell.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are not long lasting.  </li>
            <li> I had hardly any tarter on my teeth,this tooth brush really works!!</li>
            <li> I felt a slight, but distinct soreness as I brushed down there in that spot.  </li>
            <li> I felt a slight, but distinct soreness as I brushed down there in that spot.  </li>
            <li> It sounds weird but it has left my mouth feeling very clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I have two crooked bottom teeth that have been impossible to clean at the back but the first time I used this brush, the stains were gone.  </li>
            <li> My tongue, my teeth, my gums -- this toothbrush has amazingly soft bristles that work extremely well.  </li>
            <li> If you want to be lazy before falling in bed, and that is a lazy time after all, I just wet the brush and do a quick scrub knowing it still cleans really well without &#x27;all that effort&#x27; of opening the toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> There is no doubt that there is a real current though, as my teeth can feel it if I brush long enough.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth and always brush with Sensodyne - it only takes a few days of brushing with any other toothpaste before my teeth become intolerably sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Dyna-Dental&#x27;s new hyG Ionic Action toothbrush temporarily reverses polarity of the tooth surface from negative (-) to positive (+), drawing plaque towards the negatively charged hyG toothbrush head.   </li>
            <li> /&gt;The Japanese-made toothbrush is approximately the size and weight of a normal, high quality manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The brush will not last very long.</li>
            <li> However I gave a 4.5 as the brush does not last very long</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m keeping this brush exclusively for dry brushing ONLY.</li>
            <li> My teeth became sensitive to cold liquids the next day (too clean?</li>
            <li> The Ionic toothbrush works on the principle that every element in nature has a positive or negative charge.</li>
            <li> That?s why dust sticks to your coffee table and why plaque, which has a positive charge (+), clings stubbornly to your negatively charged (-) teeth.   </li>
            <li> , I use after I brush my tooth with tootpaste, just touch the tooth with the brush for the plaque to get loose, you will feel a big difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In summary, I detected no better performance from Dr. Tung&#x27;s Ionic Toothbrush than what one would expect from a normal, manual toothbrush costing far less.  </li>
            <li> I do use it only once a day and use a regular toothbrush for the other brushing(s)</li>
            <li> Whether that current is loosening plaque is an unknown, but studies I read seem to indicate it is.  </li>
            <li> This is a puzzling product: You use it like a regular toothbrush, but you have to remember to keep your wet finger or thumb on the metal strip on the handle.  </li>
            <li> To use this toothbrush, wet your fingers and touch the silver band around the middle of toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The claims the author made intrigued me, and the idea behind the way it works seemed that it would be worth a try.  </li>
            <li> As I brushed, I didn&#x27;t feel anything except down in my lower middle teeth where all the bleeding had happened about a week ago,  </li>
            <li> As I brushed, I didn&#x27;t feel anything except down in my lower middle teeth where all the bleeding had happened about a week ago,  </li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s my experience- due to extensive dental surgery</li>
            <li> The battery level can be checked by depressing a button on the handle which will light up a red LED if the battery is still charged.&lt;br</li>
            <li> putting too much toothpaste on the brush will render the ionic action useless.</li>
            <li> You wont need to apply much pressure while  brushing because the ionic part of this brush removes the film that is left behind on you teeth after eating.</li>
            <li> It has a fancy long term cell battery in the handle, but there is no real sense</li>
            <li> There is a very slight metallic taste during brushing, but it it subtle and not unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and it helped get rid of the plaque and tiny yellow spots/stains between my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I started using this recently and found that I still felt a little film on my teeth when I was done.</li>
            <li> The brush is soft, yet I don&#x27;t have to push hard on the brush to feel produce results.  </li>
            <li> She said my gums were starting to recede especially around my crowns because I may be brushing too hard.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, this assumes direct contact from my mouth with the negatively charged metal rod, which never occurs.  </li>
            <li> And my gums look so pink</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since getting on to the proper dental care bandwagon a few years ago after reading &amp;#34;Cure tooth decay&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> that at this time, I would still buy it again because I really do not know yet</li>
            <li> Is there any real science behind its claims?</li>
            <li> It has a metal band around the handle which you wet and keep your fingers on (or wet your fingers)</li>
            <li> : I sometimes forget to keep my wet digit on the metal strip.</li>
            <li> I really do not have any idea if this brush is doing anything or not.  </li>
            <li> If you use it correctly touch the metal band have it wet and no toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I will not live without this toothbrush!!</li>
            <li> Maybe there is something to this ionic technology, but its not ENOUGH to whiten teeth and help prevent cavities (a small cavity I had got</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical at first, but decided to take the risk anyways.</li>
            <li> A 3-volt potential difference across this load will result in a current of only 3 microamps for a power consumption rate of a mere 9 microwatts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> is that the gunk, once lifted from your teeth, will now stick to the brush and not to other teeth.    </li>
            <li> I prefer smaller brushes so I can get in the back of the wisdom teeth, which is difficult with a larger chunk of plastic.</li>
            <li> Due to the tartar coming off, I plan on using this ionic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Due to the tartar coming off, I plan on using this ionic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It came with very minimal instructions.</li>
            <li> My Oral-B Professional toothbrush was growing weak after four years of use, so I began searching for a replacement.  </li>
            <li> Was amazed this little gadget really did something dramatic.</li>
            <li> so I wish it was a little harder</li>
            <li> I use a Young Living Thieves one, Jason&#x27;s Vanillamint, and Primal Tough Teeth tooth powder.</li>
            <li> (you still need to brush up and down, etc)</li>
            <li> slightly bigger).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just started using this toothbrush less than 2 weeks ago</li>
            <li> I am also using less toothpaste, about 1/3 of what I used before.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Given the exceedingly low voltage (electrostatic voltages that cause paper to cling to a balloon are on the order of thousands of volts) and the minuscule electric power delivery, it is difficult to see any potential for efficacy.  </li>
            <li> Plus, the advantages of less plaque&lt;br</li>
            <li> I discontinue using any products that leave a film or leave my teeth not totally clean.  </li>
            <li> The little info insert that came with the toothbrush said that the ions destabilize plaque.</li>
            <li> I had then would tell me how little plaque my teeth had.....</li>
            <li> Little to no plaque after brushing, that&#x27;s what I was going for and the Dr. Tung&#x27;s brush delivers.</li>
            <li> But it is a neat little toothbrush, it does the brushing job</li>
            <li> and i noticed a difference in my mouth health and gums a little bit and every time i use the brush</li>
            <li> and I thought it was contributing to a little tooth pain I was having.  </li>
            <li> , you have to be careful not to brush too hard.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> If I had the time and money I&#x27;d buy a few thousand and pass them out on the streets.  </li>
            <li> - so looks like I wasted 40 bucks</li>
            <li> Not comfortable on bridges.</li>
            <li> After using it for a few months, when I went to the dentist, it was the easiest, shortest cleaning I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> Apparently the battery is too complicated to replace as it is sealed in ultra waterproof tight.  </li>
            <li> This tells you how lil&#x27; negative ions (if any) the other brand generates.  </li>
            <li> Brushing also became unbearably painful, all of which subsided as soon as I went back to using my regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The documentation that comes with this toothbrush is a little confusing.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Dr. Tungs ionic toothbrush for about 5 yrs my gums bleed very little to not at all since using this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Well, I haven&#x27;t been to the dentist in at least a year, so you can imagine my build up was pretty bad.  </li>
            <li> I have always had painful gums and my mouth produces so much plaque.  </li>
            <li> I agree, it is no better than an ordinary manual toothbrush at all.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Rather, a small hole exists in the stem close to the brush head.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a resistance of approximately 1 million ohms between my wet hand and my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Small price to pay I suppose.</li>
            <li> but the brush head seems kinda small for a brush, though i wonder if the ionic portion of the toothbrush takes care of all that.</li>
            <li> It cleans plaque left behind by the hygienist!</li>
            <li> Pros: the brush head size is small, and it fits everywhere in my small mouth.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist was shocked at the fact that I had almost no plaque compared to my normal heavy amount.</li>
            <li> I had one in the past.  </li>
            <li> I have a really hard time finding that.  </li>
            <li> The Ionic Toothbrush beats that Soladey-3 any day, hard proof:  </li>
            <li> That use to be hard to do before I owned this product, but now it is a breeze.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t look that hard to accomplish.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t need to brush hard either</li>
            <li> What effect besides feeling it, hard to say.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to push hard when using the toothbrush</li>
            <li> the reviews on this toothbrush were helpful, including the bad reviews that stated not to use this brush if you have sensitive teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> The rod is connected to the negative pole of the 3V battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used this toothbrush for at least four years, maybe longer.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if this is a negative too</li>
            <li> Try using it for at least a month or two before giving it up.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t mean it can&#x27;t be replaced.</li>
            <li> So I got the book, Holistic Dental Care, by Nadine Artemis, where she recommended an ionic toothbrush and complained that regular toothpaste is actually bad for your teeth.  </li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a little uncomfortable but it works</li>
            <li> When I found out how bad commercial toothpastes are for your teeth as well as, toothpastes that contain glycerin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s TOXIC industrial waste!!!</li>
            <li> I just got tired of it and did a lot of research and</li>
            <li> So, I don&#x27;t have bad teeth, but I always get chided on the bad tartar that builds up behind my lower middle teeth, which when I do floss is unmovable until dental visits.  </li>
            <li> , sometimes, if I angle the brush the wrong way, it irritates my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The company unfortunately would not issue a refund.  </li>
            <li> For a mere $20, I recommend the IONIC TOOTHBRUSH as an inexpensive electronic toy that may or may not work as claimed.</li>
            <li> A visit to my hygienist this year made me realize I&#x27;ve been using the wrong toothbrush for years.  </li>
            <li> I  was completely skeptical but my girlfriend asked me to just give a try.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical, but decided to try it.</li>
            <li> and she was shocked.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when it arrived</li>
            <li> Crap.</li>
            <li> I hated going to the dentist.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t taste awful, it didn&#x27;t taste as minty as I like, it seemed</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok, dont know if it works better than standard toothbrush yet</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Tried to get it to work and it didn&#x27;t. Battery tester showed red. Brand new and non working battery. Crap.</li>
            <li> Have used these for years and like...that&#x27;s why I keep buying.</li>
            <li> In using the tooth brush I find my teeth feel cleaner after using compared to reg brush.  I do not like the bristles as they are very soft and flimsey.  The brush will not last very long.</li>
            <li> Great. Easy to use and eficient.</li>
            <li> By far the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;ve had several generations of sonicares, brawns, etc. and this puppy works much, much better than any of them.  If I had the time and money I&#x27;d buy a few thousand and pass them out on the streets.  Yes, it&#x27;s that good.  For your own sake stop over-analyzing and just get one right now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this toothbrush for a month now and am pleased.  The toothbrush head could be a bit beefier and stiffer, but I&#x27;ve adjusted and brush a bit more gently so I don&#x27;t warp the bristles too much.  My teeth feel cleaner.  When I go to the dentist in a couple of months I will know for sure if it makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I got a ProClean IONIC toothbrush.(Not Dr. Lung&#x27;s) I will say my teeth have never been cleaner except right after a cleaning.I didn&#x27;t use any toothpaste ,just water. However the light on my brush quit working after 3 days. The light is suppose to be an indicator that the process is working. So?? If that is so make sure you stick with a trusted brand. I would get another brush but not the brand I got.</li>
            <li> I love how smooth my teeth feel after brushing!</li>
            <li> I have been using my Ionic toothbrush for about two months now and I am very impressed with the results.  My teeth and whole mouth feel cleaner and my gums do not bleed any more.  I am also pleased at how fresh my breath is after each use.  This is a big improvement over my standard toothbrush and well worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> On Sunday, Sep 5th 2010, I use the ionic toothbrush for the very first time (without toothpaste or water). As I brushed, the amount of saliva in my mouth increased. I had to spit out when there is too much saliva. As the saliva flowed out, I can feel bits and pieces of plaques over my lips. The second time I use it was on Wednesday, Sep 8th.    I had my regular dental appointment (3 times a year) on Sep 9th for general cleaning. My dentist confirmed that my teeth have much less plaque. What a great product!    Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it at all, switched to Sonicare and love it</li>
            <li> Finally I got my IONIC toothbrush, I was skeptic about it, but now I have tested on my own and I can tell that you can feel a difference since the first time. Go ahead and give it a try!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical, but decided to try it. I own a few sonic-care electric toothbrushes and have written reviews about them on Amazon. The ionic bristles are very soft so I had to monitor my brushing as I have a tendency to want to scrub my teeth. I used this toothbrush w/ Restore toothpaste which was also new to me. After using twice daily for several days I can definitely tell a major reduction of plaque particularly at the back of the 3 middle lower teeth where I&#x27;ve always had a sandpaper feel to my tongue except after dental cleaning. Also I have a slight space between my front teeth and the bristles gently clean there. Since I used 2 new products together that may be the reason I find it so effective.</li>
            <li> I agree, it is no better than an ordinary manual toothbrush at all. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really notice a difference</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is awesome!  It gets my teeth so clean that it feels like I&#x27;ve just had a visit to the dentist every time I brush.  I used to have a Sonicar toothbrush and was planning to get another one.  I decided to research \\&quot;ionic toothbrushes\\&quot; online and found Dr. Tung&#x27;s toothbrush for $19 and decided to give it a try (the Sonicare costs $90).  Another great thing about this brush is that you don&#x27;t have to charge it.  It doesn&#x27;t take up any more space than a regular toothbrush.  You can check the battery life by pressing the end of the handle and a red light flashes to let you know it&#x27;s still got \\&quot;juice\\&quot;.  The battery life is estimated to last one year (you get two brush heads with the toothbrush), after which you discard and buy a new brush. Apparently the battery is too complicated to replace as it is sealed in ultra waterproof tight.  Overall I am very pleased with this product and have bought as gifts for family and spouse.  Every one loves it!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any real benefit to this. I was using this with toothpaste and my teeth did get a shade or two browner (as opposed to using electric tooth brush from sonicare).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, sometimes, if I angle the brush the wrong way, it irritates my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel much cleaner after using an electric toothbrush. Maybe there is something to this ionic technology, but its not ENOUGH to whiten teeth and help prevent cavities (a small cavity I had got slightly bigger).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m keeping this brush exclusively for dry brushing ONLY. This is worth less as a main cleaning tool.</li>
            <li> I just started using this toothbrush less than 2 weeks ago and already I can tell a difference! My teeth feel clean ALL THE TIME, as if I just brushed them. I was really skeptical at first, but decided to take the risk anyways. I&#x27;m so glad I gave it a try. I am also using less toothpaste, about 1/3 of what I used before. This toothbrush is the best $20 something dollar that I&#x27;ve ever spent!</li>
            <li> Definitely experienced improvement in &#x27;feel&#x27; of my teeth (squeaky clean) and reduced tartar.  Found that it was effective as an addition to my oral hygiene routine (sonic brushing, water pik,  flossing, scraping.)  Did not eliminate any step of the routine.</li>
            <li> My Oral-B Professional toothbrush was growing weak after four years of use, so I began searching for a replacement.  Dr. Tung&#x27;s Ionic Toothbrush looked intriguing and promotional material claimed to back up its efficacy with clinical studies, so I ordered one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Japanese-made toothbrush is approximately the size and weight of a normal, high quality manual toothbrush.  The styling recalls American made clinical instruments of the sixties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristle arrangement is unusual, with interspersed long, soft nylon strands standing over shorter, sturdier bristles.  The brush head can be replaced.  The toothbrush comes with one spare brush head and one already mounted on the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ionic Toothbrush has a 3V battery embedded in the handle.  The battery is not replaceable but is supposed to last several years.  The battery level can be checked by depressing a button on the handle which will light up a red LED if the battery is still charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is wrapped with a metal band that is connected to the positive pole of the battery.  The toothbrush head is not charged.  Rather, a small hole exists in the stem close to the brush head.  This hole exposes the metal mounting rod for the brush head.  The rod is connected to the negative pole of the 3V battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a resistance of approximately 1 million ohms between my wet hand and my mouth.  A 3-volt potential difference across this load will result in a current of only 3 microamps for a power consumption rate of a mere 9 microwatts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this assumes direct contact from my mouth with the negatively charged metal rod, which never occurs.  Instead, electricity has to flow through saliva for a distance of several millimeters to reach mouth tissue.  This imposes a resistance of several more million ohms, bringing the total brushing current down to well under one microamp and the electric power to under one microwatt.  In comparison, there are about three microwatts of power impinging upon every square meter of the Earth&#x27;s surface from cosmic microwave background radiation left over from the Big Bang.  A quartz wristwatch consumes about one microwatt of power.  A typical wireless router signal carries over 70,000 times more power.  An ordinary LED pocket flashlight uses several million times more electrical power than Dr. Tung&#x27;s Ionic Toothbrush delivers for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the exceedingly low voltage (electrostatic voltages that cause paper to cling to a balloon are on the order of thousands of volts) and the minuscule electric power delivery, it is difficult to see any potential for efficacy.  Indeed, if you study some of the research backing the Ionic Toothbrush, you will find issues.  For instance, one study reported no benefit from using the Ionic Toothbrush for users who already had good oral hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite my growing skepticism, I brushed my teeth with Dr. Tung&#x27;s Ionic Toothbrush for a period of ten days.  Almost immediately I could detect that my teeth were not being cleaned nearly as well as with electric toothbrushes (including brushes from Interplak, Oral-B, Waterpik and Sonicare).  After a week using Dr. Tung&#x27;s Ionic Toothbrush, by simply running my tongue against my teeth I could easily feel significant amounts of plaque that had accumulated on them in that short time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consequently, I ordered from Amazon the [[ASIN:B007VXJK6O Oral-B Smartseries 5000 Professional Care Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]].  With rebate, this outstanding toothbrush only cost me about $50 and delivers far better cleaning for my teeth than did Dr. Tung&#x27;s Ionic Toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I detected no better performance from Dr. Tung&#x27;s Ionic Toothbrush than what one would expect from a normal, manual toothbrush costing far less.  Moreover, while the principle of electrostatic manipulation of plaque might indeed lead to better cleaning, the science behind its implementation in the Ionic Toothbrush is specious.  For me, Dr. Tung&#x27;s Ionic Toothbrush failed to clean my teeth nearly as well as good electric toothbrushes from Interplak, Oral-B, Waterpik or Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to warn those with sensitive teeth that this toothbrush, despite having extra soft bristles, exacerbates the problem of sensitive teeth.  After using it twice a day for several days, my teeth, which are usually not too sensitive thanks to Sensodyne toothpaste, suddenly became extremely sensitive to hot and cold.  Brushing also became unbearably painful, all of which subsided as soon as I went back to using my regular toothbrush.  The company unfortunately would not issue a refund.  If there had been a warning on the packaging regarding this issue, I would not have purchased the product.  Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> oh my gosh...  your going to be sooo very happy when you make this purchase.  i&#x27;ve been using Dr. Tungs Ionic Toothbrush for a month, my teeth are cleaner &amp; a great check-up at the dentist can be yours too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this toothbrush for over 3 years.  I have replaced the brush head when it is worn out.  I hadn&#x27;t seen my dentist for over 4 years.  Went in for a teeth cleaning and the tech was amazed that my teeth were in such good condition - barely any plague.  My gums are healthy and pink.  Compared with the electric brushes I used to use, my teeth are doing great.</li>
            <li> I feel extra clean now.  My tongue, my teeth, my gums -- this toothbrush has amazingly soft bristles that work extremely well.  I don&#x27;t understand \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; stuff that well, but this things leaves my mouth all fresh!</li>
            <li> At my six month checkup my dentist advised that my teeth were clean, so it was due to Dr tung&#x27;s toothbrush.  However I gave a 4.5 as the brush does not last very long, you have to be careful not to brush too hard.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toothbrush.  Just a very gentle brushing at a 45 degree angle, making sure you get the gums as well, makes your mouth feel very clean and you do get all that sticky gunk off the teeth (which I didn&#x27;t realize was there until it was gone).  The bristles are varied lengths, so they get between the teeth nicely.  I use with just water, a salt water solution, or sometimes a drop of hydrogen peroxide/baking soda. It works well with all.  The handle is nice to hold, the overall design streamlined and attractive, and it&#x27;s easy to keep clean. Sometimes I spend 5 minutes brushing my teeth and gums because it feels so good!</li>
            <li> Different packaging than what was pictured, but I am enjoying my Ionic Toothbrush.  Even a dry brushing (sans paste, baking soda, etc...) makes for nice smooth teeth.  Also enjoying Dr. Tung&#x27;s [[ASIN:B000OKR02C Smart Floss 30 yards]] and [[ASIN:B00064JGBO Stainless Steel Tongue Cleaner]]--cleaner and fresher than ever:)</li>
            <li> This seems to not only be good at helping prevent the build up of plaque, but over time seems to help reduce existing plaque, especially when used in conjunction with an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> While on vacation I forgot my Sonicare toothbrush, so purchased this one. I thought it would be great to save for vacations. However I liked the results so much, this is the only toothbrush I use. The little info insert that came with the toothbrush said that the ions destabilize plaque. It must be so!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth have never felt so clean. Except after a dental polishing. Now, I can expect that clean teeth feeling everyday. I floss twice a day, and I try to take pod care of my teeth. I found this toothbrush easy to use, gets into all the cracks and crevices of my teeth. I like this toothbrush so much, that I have recommended it to friends and family. The price is quite reasonable, and this toothbrush certainly more than compares to my old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended. prisrob 08-18-13</li>
            <li> You will really like this tooth brush,it is great for removing stains,food particles,and does a great job at making your teeth feel clean.You wont need to apply much pressure while  brushing because the ionic part of this brush removes the film that is left behind on you teeth after eating.The long and short bristles help to get between the teeth and clean the surface as well. It&#x27;s really worth the money you spend.</li>
            <li> I really like my new toothbrush. I have been trying to get my children to try this brush. Three out of six really like it.</li>
            <li> I just got it in the mail and used it once, but just after one use, my teeth feels so much cleaner and I can feel the gaps between my teeth more than before. It says it takes several uses before you can feel a big difference and to be honest, I can&#x27;t wait to brush my teeth again. That&#x27;s an odd statement to make I know, but I love the feeling after I brush my teeth and yeah... I can&#x27;t wait to brush again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is a soft brush where I am use to medium, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be a problem with how well it cleans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I must mention is when I brushed my tongue, it tastes like metal for some reason. It&#x27;s been over an hour and I still can taste metal in my mouth. Small price to pay I suppose.</li>
            <li> Makes my teeth feel and look sooo clean. And my gums look so pink</li>
            <li> I used to have an ionic toothbrush years ago and my dental hygienist I had then would tell me how little plaque my teeth had.....now it&#x27;s been years since I lost my ionic toothbrush.  My teeth feel ok immediately after brushing with a regular toothbrush, but they definitely were cleaner and felt cleaner longer with the ionic toothbrush.  I believe it really works and have always wanted another one.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush makes my teeth white, clean and so strong. I don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth anymore only after it and crest toothpaste or Crest Complete Extra Whitening With Tartar Protection Toothpaste - Clean Mint ..... Do what I did and you will be so happy inside and out.</li>
            <li> For myself this toothbrush really works.  I actually threw out my electric toothbrush.  The is the second Ionic brush I have bought.  It is a great item, keeps my teeth very clean.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve only used this for a few weeks, I can already see how much better the Dr. Tung&#x27;s brush is compared to my electric toothbrush for which I paid 8 times more. The first time I used the Dr. Tung&#x27;s I got a little too excited and brushed too hard causing light bleeding. After that, I had no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since getting on to the proper dental care bandwagon a few years ago after reading &amp;#34;Cure tooth decay&amp;#34; (Ramiel Nagel) I now consider the Dr. Tung&#x27;s toothbrush an essential tool in my arsenal to keep my teeth healthy. I&#x27;m a bit surprised actually that Amazon didn&#x27;t recommend this brush to me sooner. In any case, I have already gotten very positive feedback from my dentist after brushing with one of the best electric toothbrushes on the market and taking the best whole food supplements money can buy, but I am sure what my Dr Tung&#x27;s brush accomplishes will blow the hygienist&#x27;s opinion away as well. Little to no plaque after brushing, that&#x27;s what I was going for and the Dr. Tung&#x27;s brush delivers. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The head of the toothbrush is small and the neck is slim, so it is easy to reach all areas in my mouth. I find the bristles medium-soft. This ionic toothbrush really does work to give me that \\&quot;clean mouth feeling\\&quot; after a professional tooth cleaning. Before, brushing teeth was a chore but now it&#x27;s fun to brush and immediately feel and see the results.    I&#x27;m really happy I decided to buy an ionic toothbrush. I did as much research as possible to make sure this wasn&#x27;t some quack product. My teeth became sensitive to cold liquids the next day (too clean? haha) but using a toothpaste for sensitive teeth cured that for me. I&#x27;m using the new Sensodyne ProNamel and I do recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this thing.  The toothbrush head is just the perfect size...I have a really hard time finding that.  It is absolutely the perfect softness....which is another thing I can never find...so if the ionization works as it says it will I am really happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product which works its magic to great effect without much effort being exerted on the part of the user.</li>
            <li> Seems gimicky .. don&#x27;t see any difference between using a fine/soft brush.</li>
            <li> THIS IS TRULY AN AMAZING BRUSH. EITHER WITH OR WITHOUT TOOTHPASTE IT WHITENS TEETH WHITER THAN THEY HAVE EVER BEEN. THIS IS A MUST FOR EVERY BATHROOM.</li>
            <li> I use this for more than 20 years, I just bought a new one, great technology, really works.&lt;br /&gt;You just have to use properly, as indicated, I use after I brush my tooth with tootpaste, just touch the tooth with the brush for the plaque to get loose, you will feel a big difference.</li>
            <li> Firstly about this listing, thumbnail shows the current US model but the listing&#x27;s main image shows an older yellow-box model, so which one is it?  I have been using the current US model for 6 years now, I also imported the [[ASIN:B000FQRKS4 Soladey-3 Ionic SOLAR Toothbrush! One of the most effective ways to remove plaque! INCLUDED is 1 brush and 4 replacement heads. RED]] when it first came out years ago in Japan cos&#x27; having mini solar panels on my toothbrush handle is so gadget-cool!  The Ionic Toothbrush beats that Soladey-3 any day, hard proof:  With this toothbrush, I never saw any mold/bacterial buildup ever, I credit this to its negative ion generation which has a mild sanitizing effect.  With the other brand, blackish bacterial buildup can be seen visually within weeks (onto the same head protecting cap) and my bathroom is very well-lit by natural sunlight too.  This tells you how lil&#x27; negative ions (if any) the other brand generates.  The solar panel is so gimmicky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to this one, I give it only 4 stars for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  A newer model (called Ion Power Kiss You) has been out in Japan for almost 1.5 years now, yet it&#x27;s still not exported to the US.  UPDATE:  Earthority.com carries the new model!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)  The new Japanese model is available in FOUR colors, EIGHT replacement head shapes, TWO bristle firmness, and even a Tongue Cleaner head too! I WANT THE NEW MODEL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, heads for the new models are backward-compatible with the old models.  So you can easily upgrade yours with the new heads.</li>
            <li> The only toothbrush I&#x27;ll use now.  I use to use an Oral B electric tooth brush.  My gums are healthier and I am able to go longer between dental cleanings.  I think the peppermint neem toothpaste I use also helps, it&#x27;s by Theraneem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Dr. Tung&#x27;s toothbrushes for years. They do a great job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read many reviews and finally decided to purchase this toothbrush for my 9 yr old son! It is the best toothbrush particularly for children &#x27;&#x27;cuz kids tend to not brush their teeth very well! The effect of the ionic toothbrush leaves your teeth feeling super clean even without flossing! My son&#x27;s teeth even look cleaner then I&#x27;ve ever seen them and it doesn&#x27;t take a whole 2 min of brushing either! I would recommend all parents to buy an ionic toothbrush for their kids! A perfect gift idea as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these Ionic brushes for a couple of years because they work much, much better than regular brushes and electric toothbrushes. I&#x27;ve reduced my cleaning visits to once a year because (with also changing my eating habits) I noticed in recent visits the hygienist really doesn&#x27;t have very much to do - virtually no plaque - they sort of fumble around trying to kill time. NOTE TO EVERYBODY - STOP POISONING YOURSELVES WITH FLUORIDE - It&#x27;s TOXIC industrial waste!!! Google &amp;#34;fluoride deception&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the toothbrush.  Makes my teeth feel as if I&#x27;ve just had them cleaned at the dentist.  Would purchase again!</li>
            <li> Ok, first I will admit that I bought this toothbrush by mistake. I was shopping for an electric toothbrush, and this one seemed interesting, with all the good reviews. I was disappointed when it arrived and I discovered it wasn&#x27;t an electric toothbrush after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush is very different from a regular one; its head is small and its bristles are fine and soft - which is an advantage! It really does clean fairly well, but I didn&#x27;t notice any miracle lightening effects or super-clean feeling as described by other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I attribute whatever cleaning action this brush does, to the very-fine bristles rather than any ionic currents. And for a basic, fine-bristled toothbrush, this is overpriced.</li>
            <li> Not enough time passed by to make conclusion.  But seems that it is doing the job.  Would recommend to my friends</li>
            <li> Packaged well, came quickly, and as described. This product still is working, all I have to do is order head replacements from time to time. This product cleans your teeth better than any other type of toothbrush and does a good job cleaning your tongue too. Keeps the baseline of your teeth with crowns exceptionally clean. My dentist always says I am doing a good job keeping the teeth clean and free of tartar. That use to be hard to do before I owned this product, but now it is a breeze.</li>
            <li> After reading about all the benefits of brushing with ionic toothbrush, I decided to give it a try. Honestly, I haven&#x27;t noticed that this one worked any better than Dr. Collins Perio toothbrush that I&#x27;ve been using for quite a while. But it is a neat little toothbrush, it does the brushing job well and it fits nicely in my purse when I decide to take it with me.</li>
            <li> My husband and I had the oral B electric toothbrush  that we had  used for several years and it was doing ( Ok I thought )  but thought maybe this would do better well I have been using this for a week now and I am starting to see plaque build up on the back of my bottom teeth where there was none before with my electric toothbrush  - so looks like I wasted 40 bucks - I&#x27;m going back to an electric toothbrush but this time I ordered the Phillips dual handles</li>
            <li> I have been using this tooth brush for about 10 years and I just went to get my teeth cleaned and she asked me when was the last time I had my teeth cleaned and I told her at least ten years or more and she was shocked. I had hardly any tarter on my teeth,this tooth brush really works!! LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this inexpensive &amp;#34;ionic&amp;#34; toothbrush and compared it to my much more expensive &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; re-chargeable toothbrush.  First, I tried Dr. Tung&#x27;s ionic toothbrush with no toothpaste.  Dr Tung&#x27;s toothbrush caused my mouth to water...and, my teeth felt really clean!  So, you really can use it without toothpaste.  Next, I tried it with my Ayurvedic toothpaste...and, that was even more awesome!  Also, this toothbrush does not cause my gum nerve to hurt, like my sonic toothbrush.  As a matter of fact, my sensitive gum nerve is not bothering me near as much, after using this toothbrush.  I&#x27;ve used Dr. Tung&#x27;s toothbrush for over 3 weeks and I&#x27;ve never been tempted to go back to my sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Very nice, soft toothbrush which came highly recommended by Nadine Artemis in her wonderful book entitled Holistic Dental Care.</li>
            <li> I love the product and service great and would recommend to all--Mary Helen Barletti</li>
            <li> I am using it and I simply cannot tell if it works or is just a fancy regular toothbrush.  It is fine.  The brush heads are soft and it is well designed.&lt;br /&gt;The price was right and I would recommend trying it because it is worth seeing if it makes a difference.  The problem for me is that I cannot tell by using it for a few weeks now if it is making a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot give it a higher rating because I simply cannot tell.  From the hype that I read, and the reviews I have seen, I should be seeing and feeling a difference right now and I am not.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it is me.  I plan on revisiting this review but for me, for now, it is a 3 star product.&lt;br /&gt;It is important to note though that at this time, I would still buy it again because I really do not know yet if it is making a difference and I am willing to go a few months to see.</li>
            <li> I notice that my teeth feel cleaner and that this product effectively helps remove plaque. It&#x27;s a good value and easier to travel with than an electric toothbrush. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Definitely feel the difference when using it...Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I like to be able to choose between medium and hard bristle, and this is soft so I wish it was a little harder</li>
            <li> It actually works.  I was hesitant to believe but it&#x27;s like the plaque is just leaving my mouth.  I do notice some sensitivities issues but at present not very bad.  My mouth sure feels much cleaner however.  The sonic toothbrushes don&#x27;t do anything like what this brush does, but they claim to.  It&#x27;s an interesting technology however, I&#x27;ll use it longer and see if anything changes but as of right now very good tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see much difference between this and a regular toothbrush. Just feel it is a gimmick to spend too much for a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have to be honest, there was not enough evidence for me to recommend this as an alternative to any other Ionic brush out there. The bristles are not long lasting.  Wish I could give this a better review, unfortunately I cannot.  The reason it is getting three starts because it was not a total write off-and by no means is this a &amp;#34;revolution&amp;#34; in dental care.</li>
            <li> I have used this toothbrush for at least four years, maybe longer. It is perfect for my size mouth and along with an herbal toothpaste, my periodontal problems have lessened rather than increased.</li>
            <li> I would have rated this much higher as it does the job quite well however in order to replace the battery i will have to take the toothbrush apart to see what kind of battery it needs and whether or not it will be replaceable, though the manufacturer says it&#x27;s not replaceable it doesn&#x27;t mean it can&#x27;t be replaced. Of course there is no cover or some place to unscrew the cover to get to it you would have to physically try to take the toothbrush apart to get to the battery but it doesn&#x27;t look that hard to accomplish. The price of the toothbrush may have been higher anyway if the battery was indeed replaceable and would not be worth the risk for the company however, it will have me looking for a better brand in the future when it comes time to replace the bristle heads that came with the toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if this is a negative too but the brush head seems kinda small for a brush, though i wonder if the ionic portion of the toothbrush takes care of all that. So far using it is really awesome and my teeth have never been cleaner! I found out about this toothbrush in an article from The Venus Project online magazine. Needless to say i am very impressed by the technology and this toothbrush is definitely a winner. You don&#x27;t even need toothpaste! How awesome is that? Though a little toothpaste won&#x27;t hurt any from time to time especially upon first usage it almost feels like tin foil after brushing my teeth which is probably because i never go to the dentist, but besides my 3 star rating, i give 5 stars to the technological effort put into this toothbrush and is better than those battery powered ones that really don&#x27;t do much of anything but use up energy. This is a technological improvement to the toothbrush! You won&#x27;t need to brush hard either and i recommend you avoid doing that, especially for sensitive teeth. You can use the sensitive toothpaste with this to help keep your teeth from hurting too much.</li>
            <li> The IONIC TOOTHBRUSH at first glance appears to be either a great idea or a laughable dose of snake oil for the techno-gulible. Is there any real science behind its claims? Read on.    Ionically- charged particles can be attracted to a surface of another surface by using an electronic charge. You make a good \\&quot;contact\\&quot; with the brush by holding its metal activation bar on the grip. You need to wet your hands to make for better conductivity (don&#x27;t try this with your hairdryer, please!). By completing the circuit, the toothbrush itself becomes a gunk magnet. It does not so much \\&quot;brush your teeth\\&quot; (you still need to brush up and down, etc) but the gunk comes off easier because of the electric change. Another was of looking at this is that the gunk, once lifted from your teeth, will now stick to the brush and not to other teeth.    A few more notes- Don&#x27;t think you use this brush as a mini dust magnet. The gunk has to be in your mouth and the circuit is completed only by holding the brush and applying the bristles to your teeth. To answer the unspoken question of the day, NO, this \\&quot;current\\&quot; can not hurt you, nor can it be used as a substitute for electro shock therapy. ;)      So, does it actually work? Here&#x27;s my experience- due to extensive dental surgery, I need to brush very lightly with a soft bristle brush. The IONIC TOOTHBRUSH features an ultra-fine bristle that is very soft and comfortable on sensitive gums. I would recommend this brush on that feature alone-- but here&#x27;s where the bell and whistle comes in. As per the products claim, my teeth really did feel cleaner to the tongue. I also noticed a distinct cleaning action on gum surfaces that results in a cleaner tasting mouth. I have never used the brush with toothpaste, so I attribute the cleaning action to the ionic effect. I am not a testing lab-- therefore I am giving this item a 4 STAR rating because its claim for the brush&#x27;s enhanced action cannot actually be proven objectively.    So, if you need to avoidtraditional scrubbing for sensitive gums recovering from periodontal disease or other inflamation, THE IONIC TOOTHBRUSH may very well be the answer. It is very gentle, as opposed to any other type of electric brush) and seems to offer enhanced cleaning action. It is in my opinion not a viable substitute for good old-fashioned brushing and flossing, but it has its place in overall dental care. There is even a nifty amber LED that lights to indicate that you fully charged and loaded.    For a mere $20, I recommend the IONIC TOOTHBRUSH as an inexpensive electronic toy that may or may not work as claimed. However, when you consider the thousands of dollars you&#x27;ll spend on dentistry in a lifetime, THE IONIC TOOTHBRUSH seems to be a dirt cheap added bit of health insurance.</li>
            <li> literally makes the plaque fall off the teeth, works best just with water, rinse your mouth and spit and you will see all the plaque come out.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush. It cleans plaque left behind by the hygienist! It is amazing watching it clean your teeth. I use dental implements at home, mirror, scaler, gum massager and this toothbrush is a welcome addition to my daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned two generations of electric sonic toothbrushes and I could not afford to upgrade or buy replacement heads. When I saw this Ionic Toothbrush system on Amazon and read the reviews, I was amazed at the price and since it was affordable, I decided to try it out.  I own one of the Dr. Tung tongue cleaners, another excellent product, so I was not hesitant to make the purchase. Am I glad I bought this toothbrush. My teeth look cleaner than ever. My gums and breath feel fresher and stay fresh all day. I cannot wait to go back to my dentist and let them see the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the reviews on this toothbrush were helpful, including the bad reviews that stated not to use this brush if you have sensitive teeth and gums. I have sensitive teeth and gums and it did hurt to use the ionic toothbrush with water only, so I applied the sensitive tooth/gum toothpaste first and then keep rinsing and brushing until I get down to water only. This method allows me to use the ionic toothbrush to get my teeth really clean while protecting my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish I had known about this brush sooner! Its great to have an affordable and effective way to clean your teeth and maintain your dental hygiene regimen.</li>
            <li> Two  words love it&lt;br /&gt;I have the ionic toothbrush  for 2 weeks now&lt;br /&gt;Every time  I would brush my teeth when I finished brushing my teeth they would be whiter and cleaner&lt;br /&gt;I have had all the electric tooth brushes from sonic  care and from oral B  THEY CAN&#x27;t even come close to the way the ionic tooth brush&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth the money&lt;br /&gt;  GET ONE NOW</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare for a few years and before that I used the old Rotadent which I LOVED. I started using this recently and found that I still felt a little film on my teeth when I was done. I rotate out my different toothpastes. I use a Young Living Thieves one, Jason&#x27;s Vanillamint, and Primal Tough Teeth tooth powder. After using this for a week or more I tried my Sonicare again and my teeth felt clean again, so now I like to alternate. The bristles are soft.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it has made a differnece</li>
            <li> I would recommend instead the Soladay ionic brush as seems higher quality &amp; don&#x27;t have to wet tour fingers and keep them on a metal strip to work.</li>
            <li> Dang does this clean well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more plaque farms, no more food particles stuck in between teeth or under bridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before tis toothbrush there was alway junk somewhere even after flossing now my teeth are super duper clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flossing is faster too after using this brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for a week.  It&#x27;s truly amazing.  I haven&#x27;t hadmoney togo tothe dentistbut this is so helpful. My teeth are super clean, and my gums are better than they have been in a long time. I&#x27;m so glad I bought this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I just have to go on faith that it actually loosens the plaque more than regular brushing.  There is no doubt that there is a real current though, as my teeth can feel it if I brush long enough.  I have very sensitive teeth and always brush with Sensodyne - it only takes a few days of brushing with any other toothpaste before my teeth become intolerably sensitive.  But even with Sensodyne, my teeth can feel a certain current (especially in the more sensitive prone spots on my teeth) after I brush for more than a few minutes.  Whether that current is loosening plaque is an unknown, but studies I read seem to indicate it is.  For anyone who questions if that current is even happening or if it&#x27;s strong enough to have an effect, it IS strong enough for me to feel it. What effect besides feeling it, hard to say.  It may come to pass that after I use this long enough my teeth will become too sensitive to handle it.  Otherwise, if I can keep using it, I&#x27;ll try to be objective about figuring out how well the plaque is diminished vs. how it was with my old tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this toothbrush and I have shared the information with others. Looking forward to next dental appt.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this does anything.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth so it&#x27;s a little uncomfortable but it works so well I bare the discomfort. I would still recommend it regardless.</li>
            <li> I think it does get more plaque off...</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s working because I can feel the effects when brushing. Plus my teeth feel a whole lot smoother than using any other regular toothbrush. An excellent buy!</li>
            <li> I did try to believe that by just placing my wet finger over the little metal plate on the brush handle magic ions would clean my teeth and make them all better. I really did try. Finally though the silliness of it all just got to me and I got a Sonicare. Now I don&#x27;t have to pretend and it is doing wonders for my teeth and gums. Seriously. If I could give it 0 stars I would.</li>
            <li> I have been using Dr. Tungs ionic toothbrush for about 5 yrs my gums bleed very little to not at all since using this toothbrush.  I would also like to mention that when you first use the toothbrush it will make your teeth feel sensitive and you will probably experience pain. but over time the pain will go away as your gums get healthier.  Try using it for at least a month or two before giving it up. This toothbrush  gets your teeth so much cleaner than a typical toothbrush so, I only have to brush once a day.  I was surprised how clean my teeth felt with just the use of water.  When I found out how bad commercial toothpastes are for your teeth as well as, toothpastes that contain glycerin.  I decided to  use uncle Harry&#x27;s Spearmint toothpaste for it&#x27;s strong antibacterial/remineralization benefits but it is really strong, so I only use a little bit. I have seen a great improvement in my gums and teeth as a result.  I also always have fresh clean breath.  I really hope this helps someone as I struggled with gum and teeth problems.  for a while, it seemed like I always needed fillings.  I just got tired of it and did a lot of research and my teeth are a lot healthier for it!</li>
            <li> This might seem pricey for a toothbrush but it is worth every penny. It has a metal band around the handle which you wet and keep your fingers on (or wet your fingers) This explanation is taken from the ionicbrush.com website :  The Ionic toothbrush works on the principle that every element in nature has a positive or negative charge. This is called polarity. When the polarities are opposite, the two elements cling together. That?s why dust sticks to your coffee table and why plaque, which has a positive charge (+), clings stubbornly to your negatively charged (-) teeth.   Dyna-Dental&#x27;s new hyG Ionic Action toothbrush temporarily reverses polarity of the tooth surface from negative (-) to positive (+), drawing plaque towards the negatively charged hyG toothbrush head.   When you brush with a hyG toothbrush, a constant flow of positive ions (+) from the lithium power source temporarily reverses your teeth?s polarity. This makes your teeth reject plaque, even in areas that aren?t touched by hyG?s bristles.   I know this..I have always been fussy about my teeth. I have a goal of have all my teeth in my head when I die.  Hey, you have to have goals! My teeth were white.  BUT.. after using this toothbrush they are even whiter!  While brushing yellow was on my toothbrush.. what the heck?? From where? I have white teeth. Guess not!  I am assuming it was more plague.  For the last five years now I have used this toothbrush and there is nothing to clean when I go to the dentist. I go twice a year for a cleaning and they pick around a little and say what a great job I have done.. there isn&#x27;t really much if anything to clean.  Two thumbs up there! And, they say they say can tell I do a great job flossing. (not). If you want to be lazy before falling in bed, and that is a lazy time after all, I just wet the brush and do a quick scrub knowing it still cleans really well without &#x27;all that effort&#x27; of opening the toothpaste.  I will not live without this toothbrush!!</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference from the first time using this toothbrush.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what my dentist has to say in a couple more months when I go to my regular 6 month appointment.  You don&#x27;t have to push hard when using the toothbrush my mouth and teeth don&#x27;t feel like it has a lot of plaque anymore!  After using at bedtime I feel like I don&#x27;t have morning breathe my mouth feels cleaner for longer period of time!</li>
            <li> My teeth feel really clean after using this, and mostly all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to stop using TOTAL toothpaste, which is great and gives me the same feeling, because it has triclosan in it and I was told it blocks thyroid hormones a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the refills.</li>
            <li> This is a puzzling product: You use it like a regular toothbrush, but you have to remember to keep your wet finger or thumb on the metal strip on the handle.  It has a fancy long term cell battery in the handle, but there is no real sense that it does anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet, my teeth felt different the first time I used it.  I didn&#x27;t even use toothpaste (and I use pricey paste for sensitive teeth).  Pros: the brush head size is small, and it fits everywhere in my small mouth. The brush is soft, yet I don&#x27;t have to push hard on the brush to feel produce results.  My teeth feel clean. It&#x27;s easy on the gums, too.  It&#x27;s much lighter and more pack-able than my electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I sometimes forget to keep my wet digit on the metal strip. The documentation that comes with this toothbrush is a little confusing.  But it seems to do the job very nicely.</li>
            <li> Since I purchased this, I can never go back to the $2 toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Every time I brush my teeth with the Ionic toothbrush, my teeth feel so smooth, like right after a dentist cleaning.  I love this brush.</li>
            <li> I bought this two months before my 6 month hygienist appt.  My gum measurements went from 7s to 4s in just 2 months.  Now my hygienist is looking into getting these for her patients.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get it to work.</li>
            <li> I have purchased these for everyone in our famiy.  Really does a fantastic job of cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li> Not comfortable on bridges.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush was recommended to me years ago. I bought my first one thinking that it was some type of hype and probably wouldn&#x27;t work. I was surprised to find that it seemed to help my teeth feel and look cleaner during the day.  I don&#x27;t like the feeling of electric toothbrushes, so this is a good alternative for me.  To use this toothbrush, wet your fingers and touch the silver band around the middle of toothbrush. There is a very slight metallic taste during brushing, but it it subtle and not unpleasant.  I find that using this toothbrush keeps my teeth from attracting plaque during the day.</li>
            <li> i use this when i don&#x27;t have or want to use my sonicare toothbrush.  it&#x27;s inexspensive and smart.  i hope it&#x27;s okay to use with metal fillings cause i have some... i like the consept.</li>
            <li> Dentist had less plaque to clean during my last cleaning!</li>
            <li> I have used Dr Tung&#x27;s Ionic Toothbrush for years. I really like it and Amazon has the best price for it. Will order from them again.</li>
            <li> This was amazing for me from the very first use.  I have two crooked bottom teeth that have been impossible to clean at the back but the first time I used this brush, the stains were gone.  I&#x27;m going in for a cleaning one more time just to hear my hygienist say, &amp;#34;What are you using!?&amp;#34;  Honestly, my teeth look and feel like they&#x27;ve been professionally cleaned.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this toothbrush.  The thing I noticed about it is that it keeps my mouth feeling fresh all day long.  Even if I eat something as strong smelling as Kimchee and curry, if I brush my teeth with this toothbrush, the smell is gone.  I can&#x27;t explain how it does that, but it&#x27;s pretty amazing.  It&#x27;s something I would recommend to my friends and family.  Definitely a 5 star.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Ok, so I&#x27;ve been using the electric Oral-B toothbrush for years.  A visit to my hygienist this year made me realize I&#x27;ve been using the wrong toothbrush for years.  She said my gums were starting to recede especially around my crowns because I may be brushing too hard.  After much research I found this toothbrush.  It has done wonders.  A month after using it, I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in the appearance of my gums.  Mind you, it forewarns you to brush properly.  Between the bristles (I think they&#x27;re extra soft and made to go in between teeth/gums well) and the \\&quot;ionic stuff\\&quot;, something is working. Try it-I&#x27;m buying another one for my husband.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for about 10 years, since my dentist recommended it.  After a short while I could tell the difference in how clean my teeth felt, and my dental health really improved according to my hygienist.  For a variety of reasons, I neglected to get my teeth cleaned for about 5 years, and when I went back it only took 45 minutes and the hygienist said I was doing a great job and to keep up the good work.  My gums no longer bleed, ever, even when I floss or get my teeth cleaned, which was not the case before I started using this toothbrush.  I&#x27;m on my third one of these, so they last quite a while.</li>
            <li> It Reversed plaque build up.  My Teeth feel so clean.  I hated going to the dentist.  Dental cleanings are rarely necessary now!!</li>
            <li> This ionic toothbrush is the most amazing toothbrush I have ever seen!  I have always had painful gums and my mouth produces so much plaque.  Going to the dentist for scaling required novacaine.  The electric brushes damaged my gums and caused sore areas that got infected.  BUT this ionic toothbrush gently removes plaque -- even under my gum line!!!  My teeth shine and even squeak when they are cleaned with this brush.  I no longer have a plaque problem!  This brush is a Godsend.  It uses no electricity either. My dentist is very impressed with my lack of plaque now!</li>
            <li> After stopping using total toothpaste for a short time, my teeth became off white almost yellow. After about two weeks of using this brush my teeth were cleaner and whiter. My teeth are even cleaner in the morning when I wake up. I&#x60;m using crest 3D until my teeth are really white and then I&#x60;m going back to total.</li>
            <li> I quite like this toothbrush. First, it has a smaller asian brush head than the typical american toothbrush. (For some reason, I found this to be the case when purchasing toothbrushes in China or Japan.) I prefer smaller brushes so I can get in the back of the wisdom teeth, which is difficult with a larger chunk of plastic. Anyhow, kudos to this brush on size alone. The ionic aspect it quite effective. It definitely seems to reduce plaque, based on feedback from my hygienist. Combined with regular flossing, I think this is the cleanest you can get your teeth at home. Also, note on usage... putting too much toothpaste on the brush will render the ionic action useless. If you look at the hole in the handle of the brush, this is where the ions gather. If this gets blocked up with toothpaste slobber, then it won&#x27;t work. So really, try it without paste first. I add just a tiny smidgen, more for the taste than anything.</li>
            <li> I had an area of gum that wasn&#x27;t healing very well after a root canal.  The first couple of times I used the Dr. Tungs Toothbrush it stung and tingled a bit...and then it healed up withing a couple of days.  That&#x27;s after 6 weeks of not healing.  I am definately impressed and my teeth are cleaner and whiter.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I  was completely skeptical but my girlfriend asked me to just give a try.&lt;br /&gt;If you want white teeth, this is for you. Plus, the advantages of less plaque&lt;br /&gt;and really healthier teeth are included with the price.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> It came with very minimal instructions. I haven&#x27;t seen any difference in this toothbrush vs any others. Also found the same thing cheaper on another site.</li>
            <li> I really do not have any idea if this brush is doing anything or not.  Perhaps I have not used it long enough to really make a difference. I think the positive reviews I read from others on Amazon influenced me to the point of wanting to see fast results in regards to the appearance of my teeth.  In the interest of full disclosure, I do not have perfect teeth.  They are not straight, very dingy (from age, not beverages as I do not drink much of anything but water). They seem to be somewhat translucent, and plaque seems to attach itself to them at lightning speed!  About the only positive things I can say is I have had no tooth decay for well over 50 years.  I switched from my electric toothbrush to this ironic one when I read that the ionic toothbrush helped to remove plaque at a much faster rate.  It has only been a couple of weeks but I have used it 3 and even 4 times a day since, but see no difference. I also can not say that I like the way you have to make sure your finger is touching the metal &amp;#34;tab&amp;#34; or plate and is always wet while you are using it. I guess if I thought the brush was doing something, then I would not think that was a big deal.  Another reviewer also made that comment and said she switched to another brand that did not require you to do this.  She apparently liked it much better so I am going to see which one that was and switch and see if I have any better success with it.  Again, it may just be that you need to use it for several weeks or months before you will see anything. I just wish there was someway to tell if anything is actually happening while you are brushing.</li>
            <li> Good. But the button is not in the right place. Hope to adjust it.</li>
            <li> This is the best toothbrush I have EVER used. It does the job perfectly without being too hard on my teeth and gums, and my teeth are cleaner than they&#x27;ve ever been! My dental hygienist even commented on how clean my teeth and gums were - now THAT&#x27;S  a compliment. I don&#x27;t know why these aren&#x27;t more widely known about here in the States, but they should be, there would be a lot less tooth decay and a lot more shiny, healthy teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and try one of these toothbrushes. After about 3 days or so, your teeth will be so clean you won&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is so fantastic. This is my second purchase and I have had the best check ups since using this brush. It really reduces plaque drastically. My hygienist could not believe it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed no difference</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is AWESOME. Who knew. It sounds weird but it has left my mouth feeling very clean and refreshed. I use it with a holistic dental program that involves essential oils and natural tooth pastes. It is working well so far.</li>
            <li> I had one of these when I was younger. My mom got it for me when I had braces and it really helped keep my teeth super clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I was able to find this toothbrush again. The design has been updated since my last brush, but it works as I remembered it. My teeth feel so clean and so much cleaner than using a sonicare brush.</li>
            <li> I heard about the Soladey type tooth brush in a recent book I read (topic was cancer prevention and health).  The claims the author made intrigued me, and the idea behind the way it works seemed that it would be worth a try.  I must say that I am fairly picky in regards to what toothbrushes I have used and even more about which toothpaste as well.  I discontinue using any products that leave a film or leave my teeth not totally clean.  The very first time I used it I was somewhat surprised to say the least at how smooth and clean my teeth felt from such a soft brush and no toothpaste.  The fact that my teeth feel so clean and tend to stay with the clean feeling longer throughout the day (this part was not expected because in all the research I have done on the Soladey type toothbrush, I have not read this to be a benefit - but it has for me)is enough to have me here buying some for the whole family.</li>
            <li> I received a Dr. Tung&#x27;s toothbrush and 1 replacement head.  The package has directions and FAQs.  But let me back up and share that I have a history of at best once a year dental visits that usually go like this.  &amp;#34;Your teeth look great, but you need to floss.  You have a lot of tartar build up.&amp;#34;  So, I don&#x27;t have bad teeth, but I always get chided on the bad tartar that builds up behind my lower middle teeth, which when I do floss is unmovable until dental visits.  Well, I haven&#x27;t been to the dentist in at least a year, so you can imagine my build up was pretty bad.  I recently decided to look into natural dental care stuff.  So I got the book, Holistic Dental Care, by Nadine Artemis, where she recommended an ionic toothbrush and complained that regular toothpaste is actually bad for your teeth.  My curiosity was peaked, and I found Dr. Tung&#x27;s ionic toothbrush and the Natural Dentist brand Peppermint Sage Healthy Teeth and Gums Fluoride-Free toothpaste.  I ordered a dental cleaning tool kit, the Natural Dentist toothpaste, and the Dr. Tung&#x27;s ionic toothbrush.  The cleaning kit got here first.  So, I took a stab at cleaning my own tartar off.  As with any time I floss, my gums bled a lot at the slightest poke and prod.  I was able to scrape off about 50% of the build up, but the other 50% stubbornly clung to my teeth.  My bleeding gums begged me to give up, so I did.  Then the Natural Dentist toothpaste got here.  I have been using that for about 5 days or so.  No big comment here.  It didn&#x27;t taste awful, it didn&#x27;t taste as minty as I like, it seemed okay I guess.  At that point until today, the verdict was still out on the toothpaste, especially as I read in my book that I shouldn&#x27;t put glycerin on my teeth because it prevents them from remineralizing.  Well, the toothpaste has glycerin as the first ingredient.  Go figure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I just got this Dr. Tung&#x27;s toothbrush.  I just used it, and I am completely stunned.  First, I used it on teeth that hadn&#x27;t been brushed since last night (and it is afternoon).  I didn&#x27;t use any toothpaste at all, just water.  As I brushed, I didn&#x27;t feel anything except down in my lower middle teeth where all the bleeding had happened about a week ago,  I felt a slight, but distinct soreness as I brushed down there in that spot.  I was hoping to see the rest of that 50% of tartar just fall off, but it didn&#x27;t.  I was starting to feel like I had been had by reviews and gimicky talk.  After I brushed, I used my dental tools again to try for that last 50%, and sure enough it ALL came off.  Not only that, but there was hardly any bleeding, which for me was just as surprising.  All I can attribute that lack of bleeding to is the Natural Dentist toothpaste.  I don&#x27;t remember reading anything in ionic stuff about no bleeding.  Anyways, after I scraped, I decided to brush my teeth with my regular toothbrush with the Natural Dentist toothpaste, and after I rinsed, WOW!  My teeth felt squeaky clean, like when I get done at the dentist!  I cannot believe it.  I am running my tongue over my teeth and they feel so smooth, even in the back of them.  I will probably be ordering these for Christmas presents this year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the lack of bleeding, I plan to continue with the Natural Dentist toothpaste.  Due to the tartar coming off, I plan on using this ionic toothbrush.  I hope others have similar experiences.dn&#x27;t been brushed since last night (and it is afternoon).

            <li> I started using it 10 days before my semi-annual cleaning.  The first three times I used it all sorts of white material came out of my mouth. After a week I was able to use an inter-dent brush that I had not been able to use before. My dental hygienist was shocked at the fact that I had almost no plaque compared to my normal heavy amount. We are buying them for our whole family.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m very pleased with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been an adherent of Ionic Toothbrushes for 6-7 years and would not use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;Although I seldom see a dentist I always hear how little plaque and how healthy my mouth is.&lt;br /&gt;I attribute this 1005 to the Ionic Toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Lots of clever people in the world and this is a must have imo, for great dental health. Other key tools of great dental health are a good tongue scrapper, oil pulling with salt and essential oils, and a water pick.</li>
            <li> Does it do what it says it does yes and no. First the yes i&#x27;ve been using this brush over a month now and i noticed a difference in my mouth health and gums a little bit and every time i use the brush i feel a nice cleaner feeling and you can sometimes see some toxins come out in your gums. Now the no part in states that it will kind of cure your mouth health and gums it doesn&#x27;t but it does help your mouth overall health. So that&#x27;s why it gets a 3 star rating.</li>
            <li> Was amazed this little gadget really did something dramatic. If you use it correctly touch the metal band have it wet and no toothpaste. Then your teeth are amazingly smooth it feels like you have had them cleaned.</li>
            <li> Great works as publishes</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been to the dentist yet but am expecting a good report!</li>
            <li> this toothbrush is amazing although I do think it can cause tooth pain for sensitive teeth.  I had one in the past.  After using it for a few months, when I went to the dentist, it was the easiest, shortest cleaning I&#x27;ve ever had.  The hygienist said there was almost no tartar.  Then I purchased a high speed power toothbrush and abandoned this one as it was getting older and I thought it was contributing to a little tooth pain I was having.  The discomfort did go away after I stopped using it, but the next trip to the dentist wasn&#x27;t as easy.  I put two and two together that it was the ionic toothbrush and purchased another.  I do use it only once a day and use a regular toothbrush for the other brushing(s) so it doesn&#x27;t cause the tooth pain again.  It&#x27;s a great product and I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it works.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and it helped get rid of the plaque and tiny yellow spots/stains between my teeth.  It is also soft on my gums as I brush aggressively and started noticing my gum line receeding because of this.&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using this toothbrus for about 6 months and noticed that the plaque build up returned.  Once I started using the product again, within a week I noticed a positive difference!!!  My teeth feel clean, smooth and look white.  This is a great inexpensive product compared to an electric toothbrush.  5 Stars!</li>
