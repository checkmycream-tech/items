            <li>I just love the smell and it immediately makes me feel good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall: DAZZLE is &#x27;nice&#x27; and is pleasant and easy to wear.</li>
            <li>You can be older and still smell delicious!!  </li>
            <li>This is a scent best used for special occasions or a special date night.</li>
            <li>Best part is that it doesn&#x27;t leave a lingering smell trail that most cheap perfumes do.&lt;br /&gt;It smells sweet but not sickeningly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have all of Paris Hilton fragrances .. not my favorite but its nice ...</li>
            <li>The scent starts off with a fun fruity blend of mostly cherry with my skin chemistry and then mellows out into a beautiful bouquet of flowers.</li>
            <li>Love love LOVE this perfume!</li>
            <li>I love its smell.</li>
            <li>satisfied with the purchase and delivery</li>

            <li>I wanted to love this</li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE the perfume.</li>
            <li>I love the Dazzle perfume by Paris.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t LOVE it...</li>
            <li>love it just wath</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This perfume smells like sexy cotton candy.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance I have received many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>Is very nice smell, very feminine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sweet smell,its a nice scent</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best fragrance I&#x27;ve bought in a long time.</li>
            <li>but once it settles has a nice sweet musky software scent.</li>
            <li>really nice smell worth every dollar</li>
            <li>This is a NICE sweet, not a bubble gum kid sweet.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is a bit strong in the beginning</li>
            <li>I love sweet perfumes.  </li>
            <li>It goes from wayyy too sweet (a strong syrupy cherry smell) to musk very quickly.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s feminine and has a light muskiness to it.  </li>
            <li>The smell is light</li>
            <li>and you get it fast love it :)</li>
            <li>Right now this is my favorite PH perfume-</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s true that DAZZLE isn&#x27;t in the slightest bit original, but it wears well</li>
            <li>just right!</li>
            <li>and she really like the way it smells :-)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so sweet, like berry Starburst or something.</li>
            <li>it smells fresh and light ,,,, fruity</li>
            <li>I Love the fragrance, but I really wanted a gift set.</li>
            <li>and it does not wear off quickly as one would think.  </li>
            <li>The scent tends to fade too quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very classy, with a hint of sexy and sweet.  </li>
            <li>This is my fourth bottle and once again I can say that Paris has brought a delicious perfume, essentially a sweet fragrance that lasts a long time in your skin.</li>
            <li>It is a cross of a nice sweet fruit and a hint of vanilla.</li>
            <li>, I would recommend this to any one who likes to smell wonderful and fresh all day...very long lasting perfume..</li>
            <li>I love every scent I have from Paris Hilton so far.</li>
            <li>Really nice overall musk/sweet w/ a hit of cherry.  </li>
            <li>, she needs to smell more like an old lady.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>I love the perfume, I can still smell it the next day.</li>
            <li>, I have about 150 samples of different perfumes of all types, and this one is up at the top.  </li>
            <li>I have always loved cotton candy perfumes, but as I got older I stopped wearing them because they are too childish in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>Aside from a breeze of orange blossom, violet and honeysuckle, none of them are strong enough to stand out from the fruits and vanilla.</li>
            <li>HAHA</li>
            <li>Fast shipping..</li>
            <li>I also liked Fantasy by Brittany Spears and Florence by Tocca to name a few.</li>
            <li>This has a nice scent that is long lasting.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday for work and have got many compliments.</li>
            <li>It has a sweet smell that lasts all day long.</li>
            <li>I also LOVE Siren but only because I feel that it smells like sunshine in a bottle and is very versatile, DAZZLLE is extremely feminine</li>
            <li>I decided to try this new perfume because I had wore the others of Paris Hilton.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why people think that once you are older you have to smell old.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong but not mild either.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really cute bottle, and it does last a long time with on 1 spray, 4 hours later</li>
            <li>and I can still smell it clearly.  </li>
            <li>I would probably wear this on a day outside while wearing a sun dress, because it&#x27;s very girly.  </li>
            <li>The peach is the strongest fruit note on me and gives the fragrance a soft, fuzzy feel.</li>

            <li> Long lasting</li>
            <li> all came to my entire satisfaction, I can recommend widely to make their purchases hereby, all my products came to my entire satisfaction</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s strange.</li>
            <li> Pink lady apple, maraschino cherry and peach nectar, violet petals, pink calypso orchid, orange blossom, vanilla, pink champagne, white patchouli and musk.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not so other people can go, &amp;#34;gee</li>
            <li> I have to be in a certain weird mood to want to wear this perfume.</li>
            <li> and it isn&#x27;t invasive to other people; I wear perfume for me, and am not comfortable with it invading other peoples space.</li>
            <li> The grapes [champagne] give DAZZLE another shot of fizzy energy and the patchouli tones down the sweetness, so that the blend isn&#x27;t linear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is definitely a fruity perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no strong indication between the heart notes and the base, thanks to the constant trickle of peach, cherry and vanilla.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll mainly stick to wearing it on &#x27;casual&#x27; days, but you could get away with wearing it to work if you wanted to.</li>
            <li> duh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in late 30&#x27;s, and I&#x27;ll wear this.  </li>
            <li> SORRY NO WHERE I GET MY PERFUME ...</li>
            <li> Silly.  </li>

            <li> LOOOOOOOOVE THIS PERFUME!! SMELLS AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS!! AND THE PRICE IS AWESOME</li>
            <li> I decided to try this new perfume because I had wore the others of Paris Hilton. I never smelled it before, I just bought it without any recommendation or review. You wouldn&#x27;t be desappointed if you get it. It has a sweet smell that lasts all day long. So, go for it!!!</li>
            <li> Really nice overall musk/sweet w/ a hit of cherry.  I love sweet perfumes.  This is a NICE sweet, not a bubble gum kid sweet.  I&#x27;m in late 30&#x27;s, and I&#x27;ll wear this.  I don&#x27;t know why people think that once you are older you have to smell old.  Silly.  You can be older and still smell delicious!!  I wear scents for MYSELF.  Not so other people can go, &amp;#34;gee, she needs to smell more like an old lady.&amp;#34;  Pfff.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I have about 150 samples of different perfumes of all types, and this one is up at the top.  I also liked Fantasy by Brittany Spears and Florence by Tocca to name a few.</li>
            <li> I love the Dazzle perfume by Paris.</li>
            <li> A wonderful scent and it does not wear off quickly as one would think.  Body chemistry determines how a scent smells on you. It is a cross of a nice sweet fruit and a hint of vanilla.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really cute bottle, and it does last a long time with on 1 spray, 4 hours later and I can still smell it clearly.  I think it&#x27;s feminine and has a light muskiness to it.  I would probably wear this on a day outside while wearing a sun dress, because it&#x27;s very girly.  I also LOVE Siren but only because I feel that it smells like sunshine in a bottle and is very versatile, DAZZLLE is extremely feminine and I like a lot, but I don&#x27;t LOVE it...</li>
            <li> love it just wath I was looking for let me told you something this is a great offer and you get it fast love it :)</li>
            <li> Smell Great and Love The Price</li>
            <li> great product, I am very glad to have him, is the best and original, thanks for the sale</li>
            <li> This has a nice scent that is long lasting.</li>
            <li> Love it. It&#x27;s so sweet, like berry Starburst or something. I just love the smell and it immediately makes me feel good. The bottle is also beautiful. I can&#x27;t believe what a good deal I got on it too- lots of perfume for the price, and GOOD perfume. Right now this is my favorite PH perfume- and I also have Passport to Paris, Tease, and Can Can.</li>
            <li> This smells like cotton candy on me. The scent tends to fade too quickly.</li>
            <li> really nice smell worth every dollar, I would recommend this to any one who likes to smell wonderful and fresh all day...very long lasting perfume..</li>
            <li> This is my forth bottle from Paris&#x27;s line and I have to say I absolutely love it! The scent starts off with a fun fruity blend of mostly cherry with my skin chemistry and then mellows out into a beautiful bouquet of flowers. Love love LOVE this perfume! And not to mention the bottle is gorgeous! Defiantly will be buying this one again!</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Paris Hiltons frangances. This is my fourth bottle and once again I can say that Paris has brought a delicious perfume, essentially a sweet fragrance that lasts a long time in your skin. The bottle design is beautiful, very feminine and great for the cost of the perfume. I&#x27;m not against celebrities perfumes since what matters is not whether the bottle says Paris Hilton or Prada but the product itself and Dazzle is actually good and feels divine over my skin. Definitely would buy it again.</li>
            <li> EXQUISITE THE SMELL OF PERFUME. CHARM ME. LO would buy. EXCELLENT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I have all of Paris Hilton fragrances .. not my favorite but its nice ... it smells fresh and light ,,,, fruity I guess..not as flowery as the others,,, I do prefer flowery fragrances</li>
            <li> I Love the fragrance, but I really wanted a gift set. So let me knowl when you have a gift set.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells like sexy cotton candy. I love it. It&#x27;s the best fragrance I&#x27;ve bought in a long time.</li>
            <li> good what a doll face</li>
            <li> This has a cotton candy type of smell.  I have always loved cotton candy perfumes, but as I got older I stopped wearing them because they are too childish in my opinion.  But this doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling like a child.  The smell is light and I love it</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance I have received many compliments on it. It&#x27;s sweet smelling and the bottle is very beautiful.</li>
            <li> The peach is the strongest fruit note on me and gives the fragrance a soft, fuzzy feel. The cherry and apple gives the quieter fruit a bit of bite and energy, whilst the powdery vanilla is present through all of the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The floral notes used in DAZZLE remain watery and in the background. Aside from a breeze of orange blossom, violet and honeysuckle, none of them are strong enough to stand out from the fruits and vanilla. This is definitely a fruity perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no strong indication between the heart notes and the base, thanks to the constant trickle of peach, cherry and vanilla. The grapes [champagne] give DAZZLE another shot of fizzy energy and the patchouli tones down the sweetness, so that the blend isn&#x27;t linear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent notes: Pink lady apple, maraschino cherry and peach nectar, violet petals, pink calypso orchid, orange blossom, vanilla, pink champagne, white patchouli and musk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: DAZZLE is &#x27;nice&#x27; and is pleasant and easy to wear. I&#x27;ll mainly stick to wearing it on &#x27;casual&#x27; days, but you could get away with wearing it to work if you wanted to. Who cares if the bottle says &#x27;Paris Hilton&#x27; or &#x27;Robert Piguet&#x27;? If the juice is something you like, then that is all that matters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s true that DAZZLE isn&#x27;t in the slightest bit original, but it wears well and it isn&#x27;t invasive to other people; I wear perfume for me, and am not comfortable with it invading other peoples space.</li>
            <li> Nice aroma, good price, recommend</li>
            <li> The fragrance is a bit strong in the beginning but once it settles has a nice sweet musky software scent. Long lasting</li>
            <li> I must say, I&#x27;m not a fan of celebrity perfumes, but. I&#x27;m obsess with this one...</li>
