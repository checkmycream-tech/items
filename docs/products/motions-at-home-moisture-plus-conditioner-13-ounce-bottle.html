    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Excellent when using just a dab as a hair dress, too.</li>
            <li>so am not the best judge, but found it inoffensive)</li>
            <li>Very good item.</li>
            <li>ordered this for my son and I am relatively happy with it.</li>
            <li>But even I agree that conditioning the hair every now and then is still a good idea</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, let&#x27;s talk about the good points.</li>
            <li>Good as advertised.</li>
            <li>With shorter hair than most people, I don&#x27;t have any great need for conditioner.</li>
            <li>Beyond that, it has a great smell and smooth texture.</li>
            <li>instructions asked to keep it in the hair under a cap for 3-5 minutes, which is already kind of a hassle, but I did it.</li>
            <li>I really liked using this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>For one, the scent isn&#x27;t that nice or memorable.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell and felt as though it rinsed cleanly from my hair leaving it shiny &amp; healthier looking.  </li>
            <li>I would&#x27;ve tolerated the smell, but there were more problems with the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend this product and will be buying more when this supply runs out.</li>
            <li>When curls need moisture or an extra bit of TLC, this is wonderful stuff.</li>
            <li>could feel oil on my fingers after touching my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>but there are many chemical ingredients as with most conditioners, too</li>
            <li>The smell is okay</li>
            <li>I was not any more fond of this conditioner than I was of the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>but you rather expect more of that with a conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Her hair is nice and smooth and shiny now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I prefer a more fragranced product.</li>
            <li>Mostly I obtained these as a practical joke , presenting her with a dozen or so products at one time.&lt;br /&gt;Turns out</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t rinse out well with ANY amount of water, which may be a good thing if your hair is very dry.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is incredibly strong.</li>
            <li>I liked it the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>For those that need a lot of conditioning, this would be great for occasional use, but probably not every day.</li>
            <li>imagine this could be a great hair conditioner for somebody else but not for me.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps for the proper person, this conditioner would work wonders.</li>
            <li>This is a great, simple to use hair conditioning product.</li>
            <li>Recently, I started using this conditioner and it was like getting from good to better.  </li>
            <li>Overall, though, it is a good product for him and keeps his hair healthy and clean.  </li>
            <li>Great to have no more static!</li>
            <li>My hair loves it too much for me to ignore the fact that I have soft, shiny, silky hair - beautiful to both see and touch.</li>
            <li>Feels rich and luxurious.</li>
            <li>First off make sure you have a shower cap, because the directions call for one.  </li>
            <li>Though I am not a \\&quot;woman of color\\&quot;, I used this conditioner on my dry, colored hair and found it to be very effective in reducing the effects of winter.</li>
            <li>Taking a deep breath, and preparing myself for a good case of helmet head, I followed the instructions (opting for closer to three minutes).</li>
            <li>/&gt;It may be a good conditioner for it&#x27;s intended purpose, but if you&#x27;re thinking of trying it for color treated hair in lieu of a standard conditioner for that hair issue, I do not recommend trying it as I made the mistake of doing.</li>
            <li>Quick note re: ingredients.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll switch into long term testing and see if its still considered good when the bottle is gone.</li>
            <li>A good conditioner, really for special hair types, but overall a useful item</li>
            <li>This Motions at Home conditioner is good for very dry hair, like mine gets after I color it.</li>
            <li>My hair looks healthy and shiny after I use it, but it feels like it doesn&#x27;t completely rinse out.</li>
            <li>It also leaves a coating on the hair that doesn&#x27;t rinse out right away.</li>
            <li>But it leaves my hair looking dry, and full of static electricity.</li>
            <li>Soft, smooth, silky, shiny.</li>
            <li>Overall it just OK in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Lastly, the scent of this conditioner is okay.</li>
            <li>It has proven itself an average product for me, but it may work better on those with thicker, fuller hair who condition more frequently.</li>
            <li>You, Moisturizing Cleanser, 8 Ounce]] and can report positive results.</li>
            <li>My wet hair was easy to comb through and didn&#x27;t feel dry or greasy, just a nice balance.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately</li>
            <li>When I first used this conditioner it didn&#x27;t work very well since my hair was very damaged.</li>
            <li>As in, I had already taken my allergy meds and ended up having to WASH this out of my hair because it smelled so strong 13 hours later</li>
            <li>The experience was very disappointing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the way my hair looks using this product.</li>
            <li>conditioner seems to work well (temporarily) when used as a treatment and really slathered on.</li>
            <li>and it left my not-particularly-dry hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>and I can never have too much moisture in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t care much for the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>product seems to work really well for her.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway the conditioner works really well for her after a couple weeks of use.  </li>
            <li>While this product reduced frizz and the conditioner worked really well, if she used it every time she washed her hair it would leave it feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner worked very well on my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Leaves my wife&#x27;s hair very shiny and silky to the touch&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>Works well on curly hair-it really is fuller and livelier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After getting my hair back to normal however, this conditioner works OK on my fine dry hair.</li>
            <li>My regular Pantene works far better.</li>
            <li>It is good and thick and moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li>The difference is noticeable and in this regard, the product works as well as most other conditioners.</li>
            <li>Since using this product (for about a week now), I&#x27;ve noticed a significant reduction in daily hair loss.</li>
            <li>-oh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But upon toweling my hair dry and running a brush through it, wow, very light and silky, as well as shiny and manageable yet still with plenty of body.</li>
            <li>You can tell, after the hair is dry, that there is still some conditioner present, but your hair looks good and feels soft, so I suppose it doesn&#x27;t matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit strong going on, but not so after my hair is dry.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t figure out how \\&quot;I would know\\&quot;, she has subsequently utilized more in the product line and is looking better than ever---at least hair-wise (jab)</li>
            <li>You will find your hair to be more managable and you will have to put less effort into styling.</li>
            <li>I tried again, making sure to use less conditioner this time around.</li>
            <li>The third time I used an even smaller amount and make sure to thoroughly rinse my hair for about 5 minutes</li>
            <li>That was positive, although I didn&#x27;t feel it was completely washed out--</li>
            <li>It has proven itself an average product for me, but it may work better on those with thicker, fuller hair who condition more frequently.o condition a few times per month regardless.</li>
            <li>But my hair actually looks as full as before while still feeling soft, so the product scores points in this</li>
            <li>and my hair felt flatter against my head than normal.</li>
            <li>While I suspect that this was formulated for \\&quot;ethnic\\&quot; hair, I thought it may do a superior job of conditioning my color treated, bleached and blow dried hair which is in the long</li>
            <li>After too many days of use, my hair can look heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li>My hair is, predictably, flat and plastered to my head, but a quick sweep of my hand and it bounces right back to its just-washed style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The end result left my hair pretty smooth but nothing more or less than other conditioners that i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It has a slightly lemony scent, but not too strong.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Adding softness and moisture are very important, but this conditioner comes in short in other areas.</li>
            <li>After there is enough on,and it feels like it is worked through pretty well</li>
            <li>So, this is good for the occasional use but definitely not for everyday use.</li>
            <li>little goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;Great for dry fly away hair&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;Alaska is extremely dry in the winter-dry climate, plus indoor heating can really wreak havoc with one&#x27;s tresses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great to have a simple, easy to use,  rich conditioning  creme to improve the limp and lackluster winter hair.</li>
            <li>Overall, I think this is a fine conditioner for dry or damaged hair.</li>
            <li>When rinsing it out, I found that it doesn&#x27;t rinse clean like other conditioners I&#x27;ve used, leaving my hair soft and silky</li>
            <li>This product does succeed at adding moisture to the hair and it does make it feel soft.</li>
            <li>, it is combed through with a widetooth comb (adding more as needed),and then put a shower cap over it for at least 10 minutes or so, while he finishes up his shower.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not all natural.</li>
            <li>I even expience hair band coming off my pony tail, because hair is so soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>B0072XRJ20 Motions Naturally</li>
            <li>Have an age old friend who is \\&quot;all about the hair\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Motions at Home Moisture Plus Conditioner satisfies my minimal needs, but it isn&#x27;t the greatest conditioning product I have ever used due to its bland scent, lack of shine, and other concerns.</li>
            <li>Motions at Home Moisture Plus Conditioner satisfies my minimal needs, but it isn&#x27;t the greatest conditioning product I have ever used due to its bland scent, lack of shine, and other concerns.</li>
            <li>but I am not sure if it is really that much better than other conditioners you can buy off the shelf.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer plus conditioner has a pleasant enough salon smell, however, if anything, I would say, it over conditions and is difficult to get rid of,</li>
            <li>Other conditioners have similar staying power, but it seems a little more intense with this product.</li>
            <li>For a few hours my hair looked and felt great, unfortunately this was very short-lived.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I cannot say how well this performs on hair that is naturally coarse and dry in texture, I can attest that it was not formulated for hair that it normally smooth but otherwise dry by color treating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While others have complained about the smell, I didn&#x27;t find it overly strong or offensive.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is thick, but works into the hair fairly easily.</li>
            <li>My hair has some shine and is very smooth, less flyaway, and my natural curl has a little bounce to it.</li>
            <li>I had to brush them with a wet brush for a while there; that&#x27;s how much it thinned my hair.  </li>
            <li>This left my hair feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>and I am game to try most any type of conditioner, just to see how it will perform.</li>
            <li>conditioner is a little thicker than others and it takes a little more time to spread around and work into the hair.</li>
            <li>and I will try their other products very soon.  </li>
            <li>The results were relatively manageable hair that was dull and somewhat dry with some flyaways on top.</li>
            <li>residue - like it never totally rinses out, but it is much easier to comb through and the ends do not look as rough, crinkled, crunchy, etc.</li>
            <li>I know that&#x27;s not uncommon, but I prefer a more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; feeling personally</li>
            <li>The conditioner itself is very thick and easy to work in and rinse out.  </li>
            <li>My hair was not flat or greasy after using it.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> While I suspect that this was formulated for \\&quot;ethnic\\&quot; hair, I thought it may do a superior job of conditioning my color treated, bleached and blow dried hair which is in the long</li>
            <li> After too many days of use, my hair can look heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li> My hair is, predictably, flat and plastered to my head, but a quick sweep of my hand and it bounces right back to its just-washed style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The end result left my hair pretty smooth but nothing more or less than other conditioners that i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It has a slightly lemony scent, but not too strong.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Adding softness and moisture are very important, but this conditioner comes in short in other areas.</li>
            <li> After there is enough on,and it feels like it is worked through pretty well</li>
            <li> So, this is good for the occasional use but definitely not for everyday use.</li>
            <li> little goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;Great for dry fly away hair&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;Alaska is extremely dry in the winter-dry climate, plus indoor heating can really wreak havoc with one&#x27;s tresses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great to have a simple, easy to use,  rich conditioning  creme to improve the limp and lackluster winter hair.</li>
            <li> Overall, I think this is a fine conditioner for dry or damaged hair.</li>
            <li> When rinsing it out, I found that it doesn&#x27;t rinse clean like other conditioners I&#x27;ve used, leaving my hair soft and silky</li>
            <li> This product does succeed at adding moisture to the hair and it does make it feel soft.</li>
            <li> , it is combed through with a widetooth comb (adding more as needed),and then put a shower cap over it for at least 10 minutes or so, while he finishes up his shower.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not all natural.</li>
            <li> I even expience hair band coming off my pony tail, because hair is so soft and silky.  </li>

            <li> Motions at Home Moisture Plus Conditioner satisfies my minimal needs, but it isn&#x27;t the greatest conditioning product I have ever used due to its bland scent, lack of shine, and other concerns.</li>
            <li> Motions at Home Moisture Plus Conditioner satisfies my minimal needs, but it isn&#x27;t the greatest conditioning product I have ever used due to its bland scent, lack of shine, and other concerns.</li>
            <li> but I am not sure if it is really that much better than other conditioners you can buy off the shelf.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer plus conditioner has a pleasant enough salon smell, however, if anything, I would say, it over conditions and is difficult to get rid of,</li>
            <li> Other conditioners have similar staying power, but it seems a little more intense with this product.</li>
            <li> For a few hours my hair looked and felt great, unfortunately this was very short-lived.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I cannot say how well this performs on hair that is naturally coarse and dry in texture, I can attest that it was not formulated for hair that it normally smooth but otherwise dry by color treating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While others have complained about the smell, I didn&#x27;t find it overly strong or offensive.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is thick, but works into the hair fairly easily.</li>
            <li> My hair has some shine and is very smooth, less flyaway, and my natural curl has a little bounce to it.</li>
            <li> I had to brush them with a wet brush for a while there; that&#x27;s how much it thinned my hair.  </li>
            <li> This left my hair feeling soft.  </li>
            <li> and I am game to try most any type of conditioner, just to see how it will perform.</li>
            <li> conditioner is a little thicker than others and it takes a little more time to spread around and work into the hair.</li>
            <li> and I will try their other products very soon.  </li>
            <li> The results were relatively manageable hair that was dull and somewhat dry with some flyaways on top.</li>
            <li> residue - like it never totally rinses out, but it is much easier to comb through and the ends do not look as rough, crinkled, crunchy, etc.</li>
            <li> I know that&#x27;s not uncommon, but I prefer a more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; feeling personally</li>
            <li> The conditioner itself is very thick and easy to work in and rinse out.  </li>
            <li> My hair was not flat or greasy after using it.</li>
            <li> Most of the time, it is in braids since it is so thick  - he just doesn&#x27;t have the patience or time to deal with it or care for it everyday to leave it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a heavy conditioner and you don&#x27;t need to use very much to get the effect if your hair is dry.</li>
            <li> Again, my hair was flat and lifeless.</li>
            <li> I find it is too heavy for me to use near my scalp; I only use it on the ends.</li>
            <li> Once your hair is washed, conditioned and dried it is very, very soft.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Silcone Based product - never completely rinses out of hair</li>
            <li> My daughter has long dry hair that has a lot of split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had this issue with other conditioners and I was worried that Motions at Home would be the same.</li>
            <li> My hair felt a bit softer initially, but there wasn&#x27;t a drastic difference between this and other products that are cheaper.</li>
            <li> It is not overpowering; so if you use shampoo that is a different brand, it will not overpower whatever other brand you are using.  </li>
            <li> There seems to be nothing that adds moisture so that the hair doesn&#x27;t feel so dry and crunchy.</li>
            <li> With cheaper store-bought brands like Suave and store generics, this is even worse, so at least the conditioner did better than those.</li>
            <li> The consistency was thick and creamy and left my hair feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Of course, one must keep in mind that my hair is short, thinning, and a mixture of dark and gray.</li>
            <li> tried the conditioner a few more times and got the same disappointing results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After going over the other reivews, I agree that this product might be more helpful for thicker, coarser hair in need of desperate conditioning.</li>
            <li> my hair was only slightly less</li>
            <li> I can see where it wouldn&#x27;t be for everyone, but if your hair has been processed or is very dry it will suck up the moisturizing ingredients.</li>
            <li> In my opinion it&#x27;s not very pleasant and reminded me of the old hair products my grandmother used on my hair when I was a child.</li>
            <li> so it isn&#x27;t as rough looking.</li>
            <li> It was roughly comparable to Dove, which is sort of in the middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It left my hair feeling heavy and waxy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling very heavy and not soft at all.</li>
            <li> My wife has long hair, and usually washed her hair only ever other day.  </li>
            <li> It is a strong formula, and we found it unpleasant to use even in</li>
            <li> It blends into hair with ease and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> only drawback for me is that it has very little scent</li>
            <li> I was quite skeptical when I first tried this product.</li>
            <li> you use this, plan on adding an after-shower conditioner, lotion, or other add-on to bring shine and moisture into your hair.</li>
            <li> Never satisfied with the way it looks , I obtained several Motions At Home products for her.</li>
            <li> conditioner took a long time to come out and the results were pretty disappointing.</li>
            <li> His hair is very thick, very coarse, very dry and very long.</li>
            <li> My hair is sort of between traditionally black and white hair, and it tends to get frizzy and difficult to manage, so I have to flat iron it and not let moisture get to it, or it reverts back to that frizzy</li>
            <li> My only complaint is its scent.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t usually rinse my hair that long).</li>
            <li> conditioning needs for my hair are minimal, but I do like to condition a few times per month regardless.</li>
            <li> wife and I did not like the thick residue that is left and the feel to our hair.  </li>
            <li> But my son&#x27;s hair is also thick (even though I keep it very short) and it takes awhile to wash it all out of his hair.</li>
            <li> Another thing I like is that the product doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair and make it look like I just got out of bed.</li>
            <li> all the frizz calmed down.</li>
            <li> I might give the rest away, or pour it down the sink.</li>

            <li> He looses a lot less hair when combing it out now.</li>
            <li> Because this product is so thick, you only need a small amount of it, which means it lasts quite awhile.</li>
            <li> I noticed that I had to use quite a bit of product since this has little or no lathering to it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It isn&#x27;t repairing the hair, but it does make it easier to comb out and adds a little bit of protection and moisture to the ends</li>
            <li> I was disappointed at the length of time that my hair felt clean.</li>
            <li> an added bonus, I&#x27;ve always had trouble with my hair falling out in little bits every day.</li>
            <li> B000YZGPKU Motions At Home Moisture Plus Conditioner, 13-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)]] is a little too heavy for my hair.</li>

            <li> I am not sure how often I will do this treatment, but I have been using it about once or twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives your hair a greasy feeling in usage and its a very heavy type of conditioner which i didnt like.</li>
            <li> It is hard to place it, but I would almost say it has the ocean type of fragrance.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I liked it the first time I used it.  My shoulder-length colored hair was manageable and softer the next day.  By the next night though, my head felt greasy and the third night was quite bad.  Also, when I stopped using the product, my hair started getting a bit wild--strands all over the place.  I had to brush them with a wet brush for a while there; that&#x27;s how much it thinned my hair.  So, this is good for the occasional use but definitely not for everyday use.</li>
            <li> With shorter hair than most people, I don&#x27;t have any great need for conditioner. But even I agree that conditioning the hair every now and then is still a good idea and I am game to try most any type of conditioner, just to see how it will perform. Curiosity is what led me to try this conditioner brand and now that I have used it a few times, my feelings are mixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, let&#x27;s talk about the good points. This product does succeed at adding moisture to the hair and it does make it feel soft. The difference is noticeable and in this regard, the product works as well as most other conditioners. Another thing I like is that the product doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair and make it look like I just got out of bed. I have had this issue with other conditioners and I was worried that Motions at Home would be the same. But my hair actually looks as full as before while still feeling soft, so the product scores points in this area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adding softness and moisture are very important, but this conditioner comes in short in other areas. For one, the scent isn&#x27;t that nice or memorable. It doesn&#x27;t get your attention the way some hair care products do and, in fact, the scent reminds me of a bar of soap. Another issue I have with this product is that it doesn&#x27;t add the shine it promises. Of course, one must keep in mind that my hair is short, thinning, and a mixture of dark and gray. For others, the shine may come through but it didn&#x27;t for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner is a little thicker than others and it takes a little more time to spread around and work into the hair. It also leaves a coating on the hair that doesn&#x27;t rinse out right away. Other conditioners have similar staying power, but it seems a little more intense with this product. You can tell, after the hair is dry, that there is still some conditioner present, but your hair looks good and feels soft, so I suppose it doesn&#x27;t matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My conditioning needs for my hair are minimal, but I do like to condition a few times per month regardless. Motions at Home Moisture Plus Conditioner satisfies my minimal needs, but it isn&#x27;t the greatest conditioning product I have ever used due to its bland scent, lack of shine, and other concerns. It has proven itself an average product for me, but it may work better on those with thicker, fuller hair who condition more frequently.o condition a few times per month regardless.

            <li> This Motions at Home Moisture Plus Conditioner has got to be one of the worst conditioners that I&#x27;ve ever used. The conditioner smelled horrible and was very unpleasant in the shower. I would&#x27;ve tolerated the smell, but there were more problems with the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner took a long time to come out and the results were pretty disappointing. The conditioner did not work as a conditioner at all. It left my hair feeling very heavy and not soft at all. The experience was very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the conditioner a few more times and got the same disappointing results. I won&#x27;t be using this conditioner again. It&#x27;s debatable as to whether or not this even qualifies as a conditioner at all. I do not recommend to anyone. I would give it zero stars if I could.</li>
            <li> I was quite skeptical when I first tried this product. Upon squeezing it out of the bottle, I found it to be thick and heavy, almost sticky. The instructions say to use an \\&quot;ample\\&quot; amount and leave it on for three to five minutes. Taking a deep breath, and preparing myself for a good case of helmet head, I followed the instructions (opting for closer to three minutes). When rinsing it out, I found that it doesn&#x27;t rinse clean like other conditioners I&#x27;ve used, leaving my hair soft and silky - rather, it left my hair feeling sticky and matted. Uh-oh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But upon toweling my hair dry and running a brush through it, wow, very light and silky, as well as shiny and manageable yet still with plenty of body. I really like the way my hair looks using this product. The ultimate test is when I arrive to work and take off my hat. My hair is, predictably, flat and plastered to my head, but a quick sweep of my hand and it bounces right back to its just-washed style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an added bonus, I&#x27;ve always had trouble with my hair falling out in little bits every day. Since using this product (for about a week now), I&#x27;ve noticed a significant reduction in daily hair loss. I recommend this product and will be buying more when this supply runs out.</li>
            <li> While others have complained about the smell, I didn&#x27;t find it overly strong or offensive. I noticed that I had to use quite a bit of product since this has little or no lathering to it. My hair felt a bit softer initially, but there wasn&#x27;t a drastic difference between this and other products that are cheaper. What I didn&#x27;t like about this product was that my skin felt greasy by the end of the day (forehead and temples). I was disappointed at the length of time that my hair felt clean. Also (for me, this wasn&#x27;t a problem but for others it may be), this product reduces hair volume quite a bit and my hair felt flatter against my head than normal. If this is a desired result, then you may like the product quite a lot.</li>
            <li> My husband has been relaxing his hair for about 8 years. His hair is very thick, very coarse, very dry and very long. Finding products that work well for him is very hard. There seems to be nothing that adds moisture so that the hair doesn&#x27;t feel so dry and crunchy. Most of the time, it is in braids since it is so thick  - he just doesn&#x27;t have the patience or time to deal with it or care for it everyday to leave it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner seems to work well (temporarily) when used as a treatment and really slathered on. We put it on, let it set for a few minutes while trying to work through with fingers. After there is enough on,and it feels like it is worked through pretty well, it is combed through with a widetooth comb (adding more as needed),and then put a shower cap over it for at least 10 minutes or so, while he finishes up his shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When rinsed out, it does seem like there is residue - like it never totally rinses out, but it is much easier to comb through and the ends do not look as rough, crinkled, crunchy, etc. He looses a lot less hair when combing it out now. It seems to coat the hair instead of being absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t repairing the hair, but it does make it easier to comb out and adds a little bit of protection and moisture to the ends so it isn&#x27;t as rough looking.</li>
            <li> My hair is sort of between traditionally black and white hair, and it tends to get frizzy and difficult to manage, so I have to flat iron it and not let moisture get to it, or it reverts back to that frizzy state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions asked to keep it in the hair under a cap for 3-5 minutes, which is already kind of a hassle, but I did it. The results? Somewhat unimpressive. After using a Motions brand cleanser, which over-dried my hair, this conditioner failed to add back that lost moisture. The results were relatively manageable hair that was dull and somewhat dry with some flyaways on top. With cheaper store-bought brands like Suave and store generics, this is even worse, so at least the conditioner did better than those. It did not, however, do as well as salon brands I&#x27;ve used. It was roughly comparable to Dove, which is sort of in the middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use this, plan on adding an after-shower conditioner, lotion, or other add-on to bring shine and moisture into your hair.</li>
            <li> Motions does it again. When curls need moisture or an extra bit of TLC, this is wonderful stuff. I used it with a heat cap and all the frizz calmed down. Feels rich and luxurious. Excellent when using just a dab as a hair dress, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this several times, hoping it might work. But it leaves my hair looking dry, and full of static electricity. A really lousy detangler also. I might give the rest away, or pour it down the sink. My regular Pantene works far better.</li>
            <li> While I suspect that this was formulated for \\&quot;ethnic\\&quot; hair, I thought it may do a superior job of conditioning my color treated, bleached and blow dried hair which is in the long range.&lt;br /&gt;While I cannot say how well this performs on hair that is naturally coarse and dry in texture, I can attest that it was not formulated for hair that it normally smooth but otherwise dry by color treating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It left my hair feeling heavy and waxy.&lt;br /&gt;I could feel oil on my fingers after touching my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t rinse out well with ANY amount of water, which may be a good thing if your hair is very dry.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is incredibly strong. As in, I had already taken my allergy meds and ended up having to WASH this out of my hair because it smelled so strong 13 hours later that I feared my reaction after sleeping on it all night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may be a good conditioner for it&#x27;s intended purpose, but if you&#x27;re thinking of trying it for color treated hair in lieu of a standard conditioner for that hair issue, I do not recommend trying it as I made the mistake of doing.</li>
            <li> Quick note re: ingredients. The description mentions avocado oil and honey but there are many chemical ingredients as with most conditioners, too, it&#x27;s not all natural. The smell is okay (I like unscented things so am not the best judge, but found it inoffensive) and it left my not-particularly-dry hair smooth and shiny. That was positive, although I didn&#x27;t feel it was completely washed out--I know that&#x27;s not uncommon, but I prefer a more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; feeling personally so my bias that way is why there are 3 stars rather than 4.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer plus conditioner has a pleasant enough salon smell, however, if anything, I would say, it over conditions and is difficult to get rid of, once used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife and I did not like the thick residue that is left and the feel to our hair.  It is a strong formula, and we found it unpleasant to use even in small quantities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After going over the other reivews, I agree that this product might be more helpful for thicker, coarser hair in need of desperate conditioning.</li>
            <li> .....or you&#x27;ll never get it all out of your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this for my son and I am relatively happy with it. It is good and thick and moisturizes very well. But my son&#x27;s hair is also thick (even though I keep it very short) and it takes awhile to wash it all out of his hair. Overall, though, it is a good product for him and keeps his hair healthy and clean.  Because this product is so thick, you only need a small amount of it, which means it lasts quite awhile.</li>
            <li> It is only recently that I became exposed to the Motions at Home line of hair products. I started with using the hair mask which I use to this day once a week and leave in my hair overnight to moisturize my hair. Recently, I started using this conditioner and it was like getting from good to better.  Conditioner has avocado oil and honey that gives hair lots of moisture.  I color my hair and I can never have too much moisture in my hair.  But in addition to that this conditioner also has silk protein ingredient.  Once your hair is washed, conditioned and dried it is very, very soft.  I even expience hair band coming off my pony tail, because hair is so soft and silky.  When I excersize, I now use head band so I can keep my hair in once place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conditioner has very thick composition and the fragrance is sublime.  It is hard to place it, but I would almost say it has the ocean type of fragrance.  It is not overpowering; so if you use shampoo that is a different brand, it will not overpower whatever other brand you are using.  In any case, I am really starting to like this line and I will try their other products very soon.  My hair loves it too much for me to ignore the fact that I have soft, shiny, silky hair - beautiful to both see and touch.</li>
            <li> I just finished posting a review for the shampoo made by the same folks as this conditioner.  I was not any more fond of this conditioner than I was of the shampoo.  This product, when dispensed from the bottle also comes out thick and gel-like but you rather expect more of that with a conditioner.  This was masque like and rather difficult to rinse from your hair.  I also didn&#x27;t care much for the fragrance.  I personally like a lighter shampoo and conditioner than what is offered in this line of products.  If you feel the same way I suggest you don&#x27;t purchase this one.</li>
            <li> Good as advertised. Can notice the difference in my hair. Makes my hair softer and shinier. Very good item. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> My daughter has long dry hair that has a lot of split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product seems to work really well for her.  Her hair is nice and smooth and shiny now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is a bit too short so she got to be the lab rat.  Ha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway the conditioner works really well for her after a couple weeks of use.  We&#x27;ll switch into long term testing and see if its still considered good when the bottle is gone.</li>
            <li> My wife has long hair, and usually washed her hair only ever other day.  While this product reduced frizz and the conditioner worked really well, if she used it every time she washed her hair it would leave it feeling greasy.  It&#x27;s like putting lotion into your hair.  For those that need a lot of conditioning, this would be great for occasional use, but probably not every day.</li>
            <li> Soft, smooth, silky, shiny. All these things are part of the formula of this conditioner. Beyond that, it has a great smell and smooth texture. It blends into hair with ease and a little goes a long way. You will find your hair to be more managable and you will have to put less effort into styling. Sometimes a product just doing what it claims to do is enough. This is one o those times.</li>
            <li> This conditioner worked very well on my hair. The consistency was thick and creamy and left my hair feeling soft and moisturized. My only complaint is its scent. In my opinion it&#x27;s not very pleasant and reminded me of the old hair products my grandmother used on my hair when I was a child.</li>
            <li> A good conditioner, really for special hair types, but overall a useful item</li>
            <li> The [[ASIN:B000YZGPKU Motions At Home Moisture Plus Conditioner, 13-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)]] is a little too heavy for my hair. My hair is a little coarse and thick. But when I used this conditioner, my hair looked like I had never washed it. I tried again, making sure to use less conditioner this time around. Again, my hair was flat and lifeless. The third time I used an even smaller amount and make sure to thoroughly rinse my hair for about 5 minutes (I don&#x27;t usually rinse my hair that long). The result - my hair was only slightly less lifeless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I imagine this could be a great hair conditioner for somebody else but not for me.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps for the proper person, this conditioner would work wonders. But with my stubborn hair, it just didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;Your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for about a month now. Overall it just OK in my opinion. It gives your hair a greasy feeling in usage and its a very heavy type of conditioner which i didnt like. It is scented with something but it doesnt last after shower and isnt obtrusive while showering so no worries there. The end result left my hair pretty smooth but nothing more or less than other conditioners that i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> First off make sure you have a shower cap, because the directions call for one.  You are supposed to put the shower cap on after applying and leave in for three to five minutes.  The conditioner itself is very thick and easy to work in and rinse out.  My hear does feel healthier after every use but I am not sure if it is really that much better than other conditioners you can buy off the shelf.</li>
            <li> Though I am not a \\&quot;woman of color\\&quot;, I used this conditioner on my dry, colored hair and found it to be very effective in reducing the effects of winter. I paired it with the [[ASIN:B0072XRJ20 Motions Naturally You, Moisturizing Cleanser, 8 Ounce]] and can report positive results. My hair has some shine and is very smooth, less flyaway, and my natural curl has a little bounce to it. It is a heavy conditioner and you don&#x27;t need to use very much to get the effect if your hair is dry. I can see where it wouldn&#x27;t be for everyone, but if your hair has been processed or is very dry it will suck up the moisturizing ingredients. My hair was not flat or greasy after using it. I am not sure how often I will do this treatment, but I have been using it about once or twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback for me is that it has very little scent and I prefer a more fragranced product.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my wife&#x27;s hair very shiny and silky to the touch&lt;br /&gt;Nice scent&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;Great for dry fly away hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Silcone Based product - never completely rinses out of hair&lt;br /&gt;Stings eyes if you get into eyes&lt;br /&gt;Very costly, compared to similar products on the shelf&lt;br /&gt;Be prepared to spend some extra time trying to rinse and remove from hands - leaves a bleach like feeling on hands.</li>
            <li> I really liked using this conditioner.  It has a pleasant smell and felt as though it rinsed cleanly from my hair leaving it shiny &amp; healthier looking.  My wet hair was easy to comb through and didn&#x27;t feel dry or greasy, just a nice balance.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately this blissful look was short lived.  Within a few hours, my hair looked dirty with a dulling color.  For a few hours my hair looked and felt great, unfortunately this was very short-lived.</li>
            <li> Have an age old friend who is \\&quot;all about the hair\\&quot;. Never satisfied with the way it looks , I obtained several Motions At Home products for her. Mostly I obtained these as a practical joke , presenting her with a dozen or so products at one time.&lt;br /&gt;Turns out she is ecstatic with the results! Couldn&#x27;t figure out how \\&quot;I would know\\&quot;, she has subsequently utilized more in the product line and is looking better than ever---at least hair-wise (jab)</li>
            <li> This is a great, simple to use hair conditioning product. Works well on curly hair-it really is fuller and livelier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alaska is extremely dry in the winter-dry climate, plus indoor heating can really wreak havoc with one&#x27;s tresses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great to have a simple, easy to use,  rich conditioning  creme to improve the limp and lackluster winter hair. Great to have no more static!</li>
            <li> I used this after shampooing with Motions moisturizing cleanser.  This left my hair feeling soft.  It has a slightly lemony scent, but not too strong.  I like that and will use this product again.</li>
            <li> When I first used this conditioner it didn&#x27;t work very well since my hair was very damaged. So I&#x27;d not recommend this product if your hair feels like straw. After getting my hair back to normal however, this conditioner works OK on my fine dry hair. It does add some shine to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
            <li> This Motions at Home conditioner is good for very dry hair, like mine gets after I color it. The conditioner is thick, but works into the hair fairly easily. I find it is too heavy for me to use near my scalp; I only use it on the ends. My hair looks healthy and shiny after I use it, but it feels like it doesn&#x27;t completely rinse out. After too many days of use, my hair can look heavy and greasy. That is why I alternate with another conditioner that&#x27;s a bit lighter for my hair. Lastly, the scent of this conditioner is okay. It&#x27;s a bit strong going on, but not so after my hair is dry. Overall, I think this is a fine conditioner for dry or damaged hair.</li>
