            <li>One of her girl friends had been using the Biore Acne Clearing Scrub, and getting good results although slower.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product.  </li>
            <li>The texture of it feels really good.</li>
            <li>It feels good.</li>
            <li>It seems that one thing all the experts agree on is, it&#x27;s important to use exfoliation to keep skin cell turnover at its best.</li>
            <li>Oil-Free Scrub is a good way to get that done.</li>
            <li>We are very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>The smell of this product is very refreshing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and ... just amazing</li>

            <li>It has a pleasant orange smell and it is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>It rinses clean and it has a pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>Olay Fresh Effects Acne Control Scrub Salicylic Acid Acne and Blackhead Treatment has done a great job for me.</li>
            <li>Nice and refreshing.</li>
            <li>However, I still remain in search of a more effective blackhead remover at an affordable price.</li>
            <li>I really liked the most</li>
            <li>The combination of a stronger salicylic acid concentration plus a milder scrubbing action makes it best for my needs.</li>
            <li>The Olay Fresh Effects Acne Control Scrub is a great acne control face wash/scrub.  </li>
            <li>This is fair trade off for having an acne free complexion.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very light, so you&#x27;re not overpowered by perfume every time you use it.</li>
            <li>My forehead broke out even more, and began to itch as well.  </li>
            <li>product manages to exfoliate while also producing a satisfying foam</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really love this.</li>
            <li>but I wish it would create more of a lather when using it.  </li>
            <li>I think I will stick with the products I already use as I think they do a better job of removing oil from my skin.</li>
            <li>I love the Olay brand its a name I trust.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There’s also a notable difference in the coarseness of the scrub.</li>
            <li>I prefer lighter scrubs, so Olay is the better choice.</li>
            <li>If you’re a fan of more rigorous scrubbing, Biore would be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really love this face</li>
            <li>It made their faces feel clean and fresh, and none of us experienced drying.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling very clean.</li>
            <li>This product uses salicylic acid along with a really nice mild fruity fragrance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to use it longer to get the full benefit but after several days, I am really impressed and intend on using and purchasing more.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t an aggressive scrub, but if used regularly seems ideal for getting rid of blemishes and blackheads.</li>
            <li>But as far as the quality of this Olay product it appears to be great, does what it claims to do, smells nice and provides a more gentle scrub.  </li>
            <li>This Olay product smells nice and seems to be more gentle scrubbing than the Biore product.  </li>
            <li>All three of them liked it very much.</li>
            <li>This is a very gentle feeling scrub because the particles for scrubbing are very fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been excellent for removing dead skin that is known to clog up pores.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great face wash for anyone who has acne or is trying to prevent it.</li>
            <li>However, as a cleanser, I did experience that my skin seemed absolutely free of cosmetics and oil without any irritation.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic (citrus) and feels rich as you wash with</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this product as my nightly face wash because it scrubs away everything of the day and leaves my skin feeling clean and relaxed as I relax into bed.</li>
            <li>It actually works pretty brilliantly.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the cleansing power, it leaves my face nice and soft and fresh.  </li>
            <li>does leave you clean and fresh though!</li>
            <li>cleanser has luxurious foam when used with a complexion brush and leaves your face squeaky clean without drying it</li>
            <li>I get on them a lot about keeping their faces clean.</li>
            <li>Just clean.</li>
            <li>I use a light moisturizer each day and it was still adequate after using the scrub.</li>
            <li>This is great for acne control but it will tend to leave your face dry.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet smelling but not over the top.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s too much plastic in our environment already without adding more in a face scrub.</li>
            <li>I also like that it really lathers up and leaves your face feeling very clean.  </li>
            <li>Olay Fresh Effects Acne Control Scrub works well, leaving my face feeling clean.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fresh, sudsy and leaves my skin feeling clean and oil-free.</li>
            <li>The scent is quite mild but pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a variety of acne control products with salicylic acid (Aveeno, Biore, drug store brands), and I think, with one reservation, that this is my new favorite product.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and even with the microbeads, it is gentle.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive, and my dermatologist diagnosed it as acne rosacea many years ago.  </li>
            <li>If you are very sensitive to the effects of salicylic acid (it can cause redness and irritation), the Biore may be the better choice.</li>
            <li>I first fell in love with the new look!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this facial scrub just for the exfoliating and liked it.</li>
            <li>I have a 17 year old grand daughter with pimples.  </li>
            <li>But, honestly, there aren&#x27;t enough beads in this product to make a difference in its effectiveness.</li>
            <li>Olay Fresh Effects</li>
            <li>This cleaner has a nice clean smell and I like the texture, but as far as preventing real breakouts, not to much.</li>
            <li>Perfect product for initial blackheads, it cleared away my blackheads after few washes.</li>
            <li>This wonderfully fresh smelling acne control scrub is an excellent exfoliant for removing dry, dead skin.</li>
            <li>The Olay has a very mild scrubbing action; the Biore is more aggressive and takes several rinses before I feel like all the scrubbing particles are gone.</li>
            <li>This formula is most definitely non-greasy.  </li>
            <li>it is the exact consistency of honey.</li>
            <li>My teen daughters love this scrub.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried MANY different cleansers - from Proactiv to the Clarisonic skin system to Cetaphil and the cheaper St. Ives line.</li>
            <li>I would have preferred something a bit more aggressive as an exfoliator that I can actually feel working as I use it.</li>
            <li>Ok, so I use Olay products on a daily basis to cleanse my face.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have acne this would be a great cleaner, or if you just get minor breakouts from time to time, but if you need something to really prevent severe breakouts, you might want to go with a different product.</li>
            <li>It contains green tea leaf extract (camellia sinensis) and some Pro-vitamin B5 which are popular in skin care products right now.  </li>
            <li>But this exfoliates gently and has left my skin feeling fresh, free from dryness and unwanted skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had good results with the promotional samples in the past.</li>
            <li>Jumped at the chance to add this full size to my skin care collection to remedy mature acne, sluggish skin turnover and clogged pores.</li>
            <li>But my face came away clean, not overly tight or dry, and best yet, no filmy residue left behind!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Certainly organic materials like sugar or ground up nutshells could be used instead.</li>
            <li>could dry out the skin very easily--be sure to moisturize.</li>
            <li>not too much lather.  </li>
            <li>I really believe it makes me look for refreshed and awakened as well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>She is almost 100% pimple free at this time (1 week later).  </li>
            <li>I really like the scent of this</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll be switching to this face wash, and I&#x27;d highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>When I wear my hair in my face too much</li>
            <li>They just love the scent, and they also love the way it cleans and exfoliates  without irritating their skin.</li>
            <li>When you first squeeze this acne scrub out, you will be surprised-</li>
            <li>A little bit of this stuff goes a long way and it lathers nicely!</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s different is the gentle exfoliating beads with a fresh non-medicinal scent in a soothing,helpful formulation.</li>
            <li>The main difference between the two is the concentration of salicylic acid and the coarseness of the scrub.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;In essence, I would absolutely add Olay Fresh Effects to my rotation of cleansing products, and definitely recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li>Biore is only 1% salicylic acid whereas this Olay Fresh Effects Acne Control Scrub is twice that at 2%.  </li>
            <li>Clearasil Oil-Free Daily Face Wash. It cleanses my skin, controls break-outs better than the Olay product, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like the Olay Face Wash does.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m African American and it works just fine by the way...</li>
            <li>smells of Mandarin Orange and Green tea is super yummy!</li>
            <li>However, it does ok as a body cleaner/ shower gel with a little extra kick.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin, so I still need help with adult acne.  </li>
            <li>I like that, but fragrance sensitive folks will want to avoid this</li>
            <li>14 yr old boy) to give a try.</li>
            <li>My skin is naturally oily</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin I recommend this Olay product over Biore.  </li>
            <li>The fresh aromas of mandarin orange and green tea are very pleasing and leave me feeling refreshed.  </li>
            <li>I have only used it a few times but it really leaves your skin clean.  </li>
            <li>My only criticism is the scent is a little strong for my taste.</li>
            <li>The high price degrades overall value in my view</li>
            <li>they were too few and too far between, so I really didn&#x27;t feel much scrubbing action.</li>
            <li>But then I asked three of my teen grandkids (16 yr old girl, 13 yr old girl and</li>
            <li>I was surprised by its scrubbing action considering it did not feel gritty like some cleansers.</li>
            <li>Well, unlike many other scrubs in similar packaging, this product is less abrasive in the scrubbing action.</li>
            <li>Similar to the Nutragena product I&#x27;ve used which is a &amp;#34;grapefruit&amp;#34; scented version of their clear skin product.  </li>
            <li>ALL agree that exfoliation is the key to having clear skin with fewer problem areas.</li>
            <li>The microbeads -- tiny bits of plastic -- wash down the drain, and go right through the filters at water treatment plants.</li>
            <li>was that the scent was mild and not overwhelming in the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It took very little effort but it left my skin feeling and looking clean.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Best yet -- it really does help you control acne type issues and other dermatitis breakouts -- I breakout in hives from hair</li>
            <li>reasonably priced when compared to other \\&quot;acne\\&quot; products.</li>
            <li>Other than that the price is on the high side for face wash</li>
            <li>My 27 year old daughter and I both tried this product and &amp;#34;bravo!&amp;#34;  I have very dry skin.  </li>

            <li> This wonderfully fresh smelling acne control scrub is an excellent exfoliant for removing dry, dead skin.</li>
            <li> The Olay has a very mild scrubbing action; the Biore is more aggressive and takes several rinses before I feel like all the scrubbing particles are gone.</li>
            <li> This formula is most definitely non-greasy.  </li>
            <li> it is the exact consistency of honey.</li>
            <li> My teen daughters love this scrub.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried MANY different cleansers - from Proactiv to the Clarisonic skin system to Cetaphil and the cheaper St. Ives line.</li>
            <li> I would have preferred something a bit more aggressive as an exfoliator that I can actually feel working as I use it.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I use Olay products on a daily basis to cleanse my face.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have acne this would be a great cleaner, or if you just get minor breakouts from time to time, but if you need something to really prevent severe breakouts, you might want to go with a different product.</li>
            <li> It contains green tea leaf extract (camellia sinensis) and some Pro-vitamin B5 which are popular in skin care products right now.  </li>
            <li> But this exfoliates gently and has left my skin feeling fresh, free from dryness and unwanted skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had good results with the promotional samples in the past.</li>
            <li> Jumped at the chance to add this full size to my skin care collection to remedy mature acne, sluggish skin turnover and clogged pores.</li>
            <li> But my face came away clean, not overly tight or dry, and best yet, no filmy residue left behind!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Certainly organic materials like sugar or ground up nutshells could be used instead.</li>
            <li> could dry out the skin very easily--be sure to moisturize.</li>
            <li> not too much lather.  </li>
            <li> I really believe it makes me look for refreshed and awakened as well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> She is almost 100% pimple free at this time (1 week later).  </li>
            <li> I really like the scent of this</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll be switching to this face wash, and I&#x27;d highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> When I wear my hair in my face too much</li>
            <li> They just love the scent, and they also love the way it cleans and exfoliates  without irritating their skin.</li>
            <li> When you first squeeze this acne scrub out, you will be surprised-</li>
            <li> A little bit of this stuff goes a long way and it lathers nicely!</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s different is the gentle exfoliating beads with a fresh non-medicinal scent in a soothing,helpful formulation.</li>
            <li> The main difference between the two is the concentration of salicylic acid and the coarseness of the scrub.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;In essence, I would absolutely add Olay Fresh Effects to my rotation of cleansing products, and definitely recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> Biore is only 1% salicylic acid whereas this Olay Fresh Effects Acne Control Scrub is twice that at 2%.  </li>
            <li> Clearasil Oil-Free Daily Face Wash. It cleanses my skin, controls break-outs better than the Olay product, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like the Olay Face Wash does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American and it works just fine by the way...</li>
            <li> smells of Mandarin Orange and Green tea is super yummy!</li>
            <li> However, it does ok as a body cleaner/ shower gel with a little extra kick.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, so I still need help with adult acne.  </li>
            <li> I like that, but fragrance sensitive folks will want to avoid this</li>

            <li> My skin is naturally oily</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin I recommend this Olay product over Biore.  </li>
            <li> The fresh aromas of mandarin orange and green tea are very pleasing and leave me feeling refreshed.  </li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times but it really leaves your skin clean.  </li>
            <li> My only criticism is the scent is a little strong for my taste.</li>
            <li> The high price degrades overall value in my view</li>
            <li> they were too few and too far between, so I really didn&#x27;t feel much scrubbing action.</li>
            <li> But then I asked three of my teen grandkids (16 yr old girl, 13 yr old girl and</li>
            <li> I was surprised by its scrubbing action considering it did not feel gritty like some cleansers.</li>
            <li> Well, unlike many other scrubs in similar packaging, this product is less abrasive in the scrubbing action.</li>
            <li> Similar to the Nutragena product I&#x27;ve used which is a &amp;#34;grapefruit&amp;#34; scented version of their clear skin product.  </li>
            <li> ALL agree that exfoliation is the key to having clear skin with fewer problem areas.</li>
            <li> The microbeads -- tiny bits of plastic -- wash down the drain, and go right through the filters at water treatment plants.</li>
            <li> was that the scent was mild and not overwhelming in the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took very little effort but it left my skin feeling and looking clean.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Best yet -- it really does help you control acne type issues and other dermatitis breakouts -- I breakout in hives from hair</li>
            <li> reasonably priced when compared to other \\&quot;acne\\&quot; products.</li>
            <li> Other than that the price is on the high side for face wash</li>
            <li> My 27 year old daughter and I both tried this product and &amp;#34;bravo!&amp;#34;  I have very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other facial scrubs I&#x27;ve used, Olay Fresh Effects has very little in the way of gritty particles.</li>
            <li> It has micro beads in it that create a small amount of &amp;#34;scratchy feel&amp;#34; but not enough to really have any signifiant scrubbing effect for me.  </li>
            <li> and I typically tend to stay away from such product since my skin is on the sensitive side.</li>
            <li> I tried to switch to just using it and my face was breaking out worse than with my previous cleaner (Clean &amp; Clear...).</li>
            <li> In other words this Olay product is currently 3 times more expensive than the Biore product.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels less oily, but this has not dried out my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It lathers a bit &#x27;foamy&#x27; for my personal liking, but I believe the foaming action is intended to carry away the dead skin removed by the exfoliating microbeads.  </li>
            <li> Overall a helpful product, but expect to continue to have to use other products like Oxy in combination with this.</li>
            <li> Also unlike other facial scrubs I&#x27;ve used, this does not leave my skin feeling drier (or oilier).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dry skin; I felt my face was tighter after, though.</li>
            <li> I typically imagine gritty pastes when I think of exfoliating</li>
            <li> Within a few days of starting to use it there was a noticeable change to her face.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s up to you to decide if this is a plus or minus for you.</li>
            <li> I have definitely noticed smoother skin and less acne patches; but, unfortunately, I have NOT noticed a significant improvement in small blackheads.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I do knock off 1 star on this Olay product however due to the price.  </li>
            <li> Other reviewers like the scent, but</li>
            <li> only complaint was the scrubbies that were supposed to be there-</li>
            <li> I typically sway toward citrus</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel that typical tingle/burn of the Salicylic Acid, so if you like that</li>

            <li> I normally use the Neutrogena Grapefruit scrub, but it is so expensive.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been using it for a few weeks, but we haven&#x27;t noticed an improvement in her blackhead problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Regretfully, I used only this product, four days as directed, and my skin was worse.  </li>
            <li> I was worried it would leave a film or clog my pores worse than if I had just left them alone, but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The exfoliating element is not overly harsh, either.</li>
            <li> The product feels a little abrasive and tended to dry his skin out a little, but not to the point of being overly irritating.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s advertised as a \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; but there&#x27;s very little scrub to this product as opposed to some of the St. Ives and Aveeno products.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used this product I was a bit disappointed because I assumed it had somehow separated in the tube.</li>
            <li> Another reviewer complained about the microbeads.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a variety of acne control products with salicylic acid (Aveeno, Biore, drug store brands), and I think, with one reservation, that this is my new favorite product.  It feels good on my skin; not too much lather.  It rinses clean and it has a pleasant scent.  It contains green tea leaf extract (camellia sinensis) and some Pro-vitamin B5 which are popular in skin care products right now.  I have combination skin, so I still need help with adult acne.  My skin feels less oily, but this has not dried out my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does contain fragrance: mandarin orange, which lingers.  I like that, but fragrance sensitive folks will want to avoid this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s advertised as a \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; but there&#x27;s very little scrub to this product as opposed to some of the St. Ives and Aveeno products.  The manufacturer says that it contains microbeads and the ingredients list does include oxidized polyethylene.  There are concerns about how polyethelenes affect the environment. That&#x27;s my only reservation against buying this product in the future.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this facial scrub just for the exfoliating and liked it. But then I asked three of my teen grandkids (16 yr old girl, 13 yr old girl and 14 yr old boy) to give a try. All three of them liked it very much. It made their faces feel clean and fresh, and none of us experienced drying. We all recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Olay Fresh Effects Acne Control Scrub Salicylic Acid Acne and Blackhead Treatment has done a great job for me. My skin is naturally oily so I&#x27;m a fan that this skincare product is oil-free. It&#x27;s a scrub and I typically tend to stay away from such product since my skin is on the sensitive side. But this exfoliates gently and has left my skin feeling fresh, free from dryness and unwanted skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smells of Mandarin Orange and Green tea is super yummy! I typically sway toward citrus smells in my beauty products and this one is excellent. Since it&#x27;s citrus instead of florally, it could be used for both women and men. It&#x27;s sweet smelling but not over the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product as directed. Once in the morning and again in the evening. I&#x27;ve noticed my breakouts haven&#x27;t been appearing and what was already there has cleared up! It&#x27;s been excellent for removing dead skin that is known to clog up pores. A little bit of this stuff goes a long way and it lathers nicely! I really believe it makes me look for refreshed and awakened as well. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Nice and refreshing. My daughter has been using it for a few weeks, but we haven&#x27;t noticed an improvement in her blackhead problem.&lt;br /&gt;It does leave you clean and fresh though!</li>
            <li> I have a 17 year old grand daughter with pimples.  She loves this product.  Within a few days of starting to use it there was a noticeable change to her face.  She is almost 100% pimple free at this time (1 week later).  One of her girl friends had been using the Biore Acne Clearing Scrub, and getting good results although slower.  I have had similar results. Biore is only 1% salicylic acid whereas this Olay Fresh Effects Acne Control Scrub is twice that at 2%.  This Olay product smells nice and seems to be more gentle scrubbing than the Biore product.  I do knock off 1 star on this Olay product however due to the price.  The current listed price for this 5 ounce Olay product is $17.95.  The current listed price for the 4.5 ounce Biore Acne Clearing Scrub with only 1% salicylic acid instead of the 2% contained in this Olay product is $5.39.  In other words this Olay product is currently 3 times more expensive than the Biore product.  The high price degrades overall value in my view so I give 4 stars instead of 5.  But as far as the quality of this Olay product it appears to be great, does what it claims to do, smells nice and provides a more gentle scrub.  If you have sensitive skin I recommend this Olay product over Biore.  Likewise if you need a stronger concentration of salicylic acid, this Olay product contains twice the concentration of Biore Acne Clearing Scrub.  We prefer this Olay product.</li>
            <li> This is a very gentle feeling scrub because the particles for scrubbing are very fine. It smells really nice without being overpowering. It leaves my skin feeling very clean.</li>
            <li> This wonderfully fresh smelling acne control scrub is an excellent exfoliant for removing dry, dead skin. I have definitely noticed smoother skin and less acne patches; but, unfortunately, I have NOT noticed a significant improvement in small blackheads.  This formula is most definitely non-greasy.  It lathers a bit &#x27;foamy&#x27; for my personal liking, but I believe the foaming action is intended to carry away the dead skin removed by the exfoliating microbeads.  The fresh aromas of mandarin orange and green tea are very pleasing and leave me feeling refreshed.  As an exfoliant and acne control, I recommend this product.  However, I still remain in search of a more effective blackhead remover at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> My 27 year old daughter and I both tried this product and &amp;#34;bravo!&amp;#34;  I have very dry skin.  She has oily skin.  It worked well on both skin types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best yet -- it really does help you control acne type issues and other dermatitis breakouts -- I breakout in hives from hair products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really liked the most was that the scent was mild and not overwhelming in the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay is a go-to brand for me.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive, and my dermatologist diagnosed it as acne rosacea many years ago.  Regretfully, I used only this product, four days as directed, and my skin was worse.  My forehead broke out even more, and began to itch as well.  There must be some ingredient in the product to which my skin reacts.  Based upon my experience, I cannot recommend it.</li>
            <li> This cleaner has a nice clean smell and I like the texture, but as far as preventing real breakouts, not to much. I tried to switch to just using it and my face was breaking out worse than with my previous cleaner (Clean &amp; Clear...). However, it does ok as a body cleaner/ shower gel with a little extra kick. If you don&#x27;t have acne this would be a great cleaner, or if you just get minor breakouts from time to time, but if you need something to really prevent severe breakouts, you might want to go with a different product.</li>
            <li> I normally use the Neutrogena Grapefruit scrub, but it is so expensive. I bought this to see what I thought and I like it. It&#x27;s got a great scent but it doesn&#x27;t scrub as well as the Neutrogena. For the price though, it is a great alternative.</li>
            <li> Nobody should use this product. The microbeads -- tiny bits of plastic -- wash down the drain, and go right through the filters at water treatment plants. They end up in the water system -- streams, lakes, the ocean -- as pollution. And you don&#x27;t need them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please stop buying products that contain microbeads. They serve no good purpose.</li>
            <li> Very nice face scrub.  helps to control oil and acne.  I really like the scent of this, it smells great.  I also like that it really lathers up and leaves your face feeling very clean.  A little goes a long way.  This is a good product.  Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Do you offer Olay total effects for the sun? with spf30? facial lotion.</li>
            <li> I think I would buy this for the scent alone. It makes cleaning your face a pleasure. You might even want to use it yourself and not turn it over to the resident big-foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser has luxurious foam when used with a complexion brush and leaves your face squeaky clean without drying it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very reasonably priced when compared to other \\&quot;acne\\&quot; products.</li>
            <li> When you first squeeze this acne scrub out, you will be surprised- it is the exact consistency of honey. I was worried it would leave a film or clog my pores worse than if I had just left them alone, but it doesn&#x27;t. It actually works pretty brilliantly. I didn&#x27;t feel that typical tingle/burn of the Salicylic Acid, so if you like that (I typically do), you might not like this product. But my face came away clean, not overly tight or dry, and best yet, no filmy residue left behind!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint was the scrubbies that were supposed to be there- they were too few and too far between, so I really didn&#x27;t feel much scrubbing action. That was a bummer. Otherwise, great product!</li>
            <li> This facial scrub is fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;I have acne, so I&#x27;m always fearful when trying a new product because it either causes a horrible breakout, or dries my skin so bad it flakes. This product did neither!&lt;br /&gt;It did scrub away the dirt, oil, and makeup of the day. It left my skin feeling soft and smooth. The scent is very light, so you&#x27;re not overpowered by perfume every time you use it. The exfoliating element is not overly harsh, either. You can feel it scrubbing, but not scratching, your skin. I enjoy using this product as my nightly face wash because it scrubs away everything of the day and leaves my skin feeling clean and relaxed as I relax into bed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this product. Other reviewers like the scent, but I think it smells like chemicals. Another reviewer complained about the microbeads. If they are indeed plastic, I&#x27;m against them as well. There&#x27;s too much plastic in our environment already without adding more in a face scrub. Certainly organic materials like sugar or ground up nutshells could be used instead. But, honestly, there aren&#x27;t enough beads in this product to make a difference in its effectiveness. This Face Wash dries out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My go to Salicylic acid product is Clearasil Oil-Free Daily Face Wash. It cleanses my skin, controls break-outs better than the Olay product, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like the Olay Face Wash does. I recommend the Clearasil Face Wash over the Olay Face Wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had good results with the promotional samples in the past. Jumped at the chance to add this full size to my skin care collection to remedy mature acne, sluggish skin turnover and clogged pores. It contains the standard 2% salicylic acid recommended to penetrate the pores where acne takes root. What&#x27;s different is the gentle exfoliating beads with a fresh non-medicinal scent in a soothing,helpful formulation.</li>
            <li> I typically imagine gritty pastes when I think of exfoliating scrubs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product manages to exfoliate while also producing a satisfying foam and ... just amazing scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really love this.</li>
            <li> My teen daughters love this scrub. They just love the scent, and they also love the way it cleans and exfoliates  without irritating their skin. We are very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Similar to the Nutragena product I&#x27;ve used which is a &amp;#34;grapefruit&amp;#34; scented version of their clear skin product.  This product has a pleasant scent but I wish it would create more of a lather when using it.  It has micro beads in it that create a small amount of &amp;#34;scratchy feel&amp;#34; but not enough to really have any signifiant scrubbing effect for me.  I think I will stick with the products I already use as I think they do a better job of removing oil from my skin.</li>
            <li> The smell of this product is very refreshing. I have 1 teenager and 1 preteen. I get on them a lot about keeping their faces clean. One of my kids gets horrible blackheads on the nose. She used this product for 12 days. The blackheads on the nose were gone after 4 days and have not come back!</li>
            <li> This Olay product has definitely helped our son&#x27;s stubborn acne by reducing it, but did not eliminate it.  The product feels a little abrasive and tended to dry his skin out a little, but not to the point of being overly irritating.  Scent is acceptable for a teenage boy.  Overall a helpful product, but expect to continue to have to use other products like Oxy in combination with this.</li>
            <li> Unlike other facial scrubs I&#x27;ve used, Olay Fresh Effects has very little in the way of gritty particles. It has the texture of a thin gel.  Also unlike other facial scrubs I&#x27;ve used, this does not leave my skin feeling drier (or oilier). Just clean. The scent is positively addictive. I&#x27;ll keep using it!</li>
            <li> Olay Fresh Effects Acne Control Scrub works well, leaving my face feeling clean. It smells fantastic (citrus) and feels rich as you wash with it.&lt;br /&gt;It could dry out the skin very easily--be sure to moisturize. I don&#x27;t have dry skin; I felt my face was tighter after, though. The formula needs to be aggressive to cut through dirt and oils on the skin and fight acne. I use a light moisturizer each day and it was still adequate after using the scrub.</li>
            <li> A great cleaner that doesn&#x27;t feel like it is stripping my face.  I love the smell and the cleansing power, it leaves my face nice and soft and fresh.  I love the Olay brand its a name I trust.  Jesus&#x27; Blessings and Peace</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff. I have only used it a few times but it really leaves your skin clean.  It is easy to use and even with the microbeads, it is gentle. I&#x27;ll have to use it longer to get the full benefit but after several days, I am really impressed and intend on using and purchasing more. My only criticism is the scent is a little strong for my taste. We are a jumble of scents already, soap, shampoo, deodorant, fabric softener....I don&#x27;t need another scent. But it is tolerable because it works so well.</li>
            <li> I’ve been using the Biore Acne Clearing Scrub and have been happy with it. After using the Olay, however, I’ll be switching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both work basically the same way, incorporating salicylic acid into a soap-based scrub. Both lather well and have a pleasing scent (although I have a slight preference for the Olay – smells a bit nicer to me). The main difference between the two is the concentration of salicylic acid and the coarseness of the scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Olay has a 2% concentration; the Biore has 1%. If you are very sensitive to the effects of salicylic acid (it can cause redness and irritation), the Biore may be the better choice. For me, however, 2% works well, and is the same concentration in the non-scrub washes I’ve used. So for me, the advantage goes to Olay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s also a notable difference in the coarseness of the scrub. The Olay has a very mild scrubbing action; the Biore is more aggressive and takes several rinses before I feel like all the scrubbing particles are gone. I prefer lighter scrubs, so Olay is the better choice. If you’re a fan of more rigorous scrubbing, Biore would be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both are five star products but for me, my preference is for the Olay. The combination of a stronger salicylic acid concentration plus a milder scrubbing action makes it best for my needs.</li>
            <li> This product uses salicylic acid along with a really nice mild fruity fragrance. The texture of it feels really good. It isn&#x27;t an aggressive scrub, but if used regularly seems ideal for getting rid of blemishes and blackheads. It feels good. It works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been obsessing about skin care product ingredients recently. I&#x27;ve read everything I can get my hands on about which ingredients work.  It seems that one thing all the experts agree on is, it&#x27;s important to use exfoliation to keep skin cell turnover at its best. One source said that the cells turn over every 30 days or so and get slower as we age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They ALL agree that exfoliation is the key to having clear skin with fewer problem areas. Olay Fresh Effects Oil-Free Scrub is a good way to get that done.</li>
            <li> I really love this face wash - it&#x27;s fresh, sudsy and leaves my skin feeling clean and oil-free. I&#x27;ve tried MANY different cleansers - from Proactiv to the Clarisonic skin system to Cetaphil and the cheaper St. Ives line. For reference, I experience mild-medium breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Up until now, I&#x27;d say that Proactiv was my favorite wash, and this scrub is the closest I&#x27;ve ever come to a similar feeling without the expensive price. When I do breakout, the wash seems to seriously reduce the life and size of the blemish. I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be switching to this face wash, and I&#x27;d highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The Olay Fresh Effects Acne Control Scrub is a great acne control face wash/scrub.  It has a pleasant orange smell and it is easy to apply.  I was surprised by its scrubbing action considering it did not feel gritty like some cleansers. It took very little effort but it left my skin feeling and looking clean.  One downside to this cleanser is that it contains Salicylic Acid.  This is great for acne control but it will tend to leave your face dry.  This is fair trade off for having an acne free complexion.  Other than that the price is on the high side for face wash but it is not exorbitant like some of the newer products out there.  Overall this is a great face wash for anyone who has acne or is trying to prevent it.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product I was a bit disappointed because I assumed it had somehow separated in the tube. Where were the scrubbing beads, I wondered... Well, unlike many other scrubs in similar packaging, this product is less abrasive in the scrubbing action. It&#x27;s up to you to decide if this is a plus or minus for you. I would have preferred something a bit more aggressive as an exfoliator that I can actually feel working as I use it. However, as a cleanser, I did experience that my skin seemed absolutely free of cosmetics and oil without any irritation. The scent is quite mild but pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In essence, I would absolutely add Olay Fresh Effects to my rotation of cleansing products, and definitely recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> OMG!!! Can you see in LOVE!!!??? I first fell in love with the new look! Then when I got it home and used it, I was in 7th heaven! Ok, so I use Olay products on a daily basis to cleanse my face. When I wear my hair in my face too much it breaks my chin/cheeks out something horrible and I HATE it! So I ran out of my Olay acne cleanser and when I went on here to reup, I saw this and ordered it. I promise within 3 days my face has cleared up! I put it on my face before I shower and when I get out, I wash it off. I do this nightly until my face clears up... I&#x27;m African American and it works just fine by the way...</li>
            <li> Perfect product for initial blackheads, it cleared away my blackheads after few washes.</li>
