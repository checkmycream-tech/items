            <li>I feel it would also be a great choice for anyone wanting to venture out into the liquid eyeliner world.</li>

            <li>I am pleased to say this one does and has a very good brush with it as well.</li>
            <li>The brush isn&#x27;t the best quality, but I guess it&#x27;s considered &amp;#34;free.&amp;#34; The product goes on relatively smoothly.</li>
            <li>I read a lot of good reviews on this eye liner.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m good all day and night unless I forget i&#x27;m wearing it and rub my eyes.</li>

            <li>love it, very happy :)</li>
            <li>I used to buy Bobbi Brown and spend more money than I needed to cause this is a great dupe</li>
            <li>And I am very pleased with this liner.</li>
            <li>so I can easily make beautiful line and</li>
            <li>I wish there were more colors!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>I love this eye liner!</li>
            <li>Boy am i glad i did!</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>but anyways when I woke it was pretty much perfect!!!</li>
            <li>I love and swear by this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I have difficulty achieving a nice even line wjth liquid liner, so the gel seemed very appealing.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li>much better than mac!</li>
            <li>I love the texture!</li>
            <li>So easy to apply with the great brush included.</li>
            <li>Great product - easy to apply and stays on all day without shedding.</li>
            <li>The color is rich and beautiful.</li>
            <li>I goes on very smoothly, and lasts all day surprisingly.</li>
            <li>Very nice brush, easy to handle.</li>
            <li>the brush it comes with is amazing</li>
            <li>This eyeliner is amazing..</li>
            <li>It goes on nice</li>
            <li>or if the weather will be really warm.</li>
            <li>I was using the e.l.f creme eyeliner for about 6 months and loving it, than i realized it was drying out and</li>
            <li>Tossed the pot in the trash but kept the brush -- it&#x27;s surprisingly nice.</li>
            <li>Honestly I was in a hurry and thought I was ordering the infallible pencil..</li>
            <li>I use my own elf eyeliner brush which does the trick.</li>
            <li>It has good pigmentation, is easy to apply and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Although i do like this eyeliner and will continue to use it for my top line, i can&#x27;t give it 5stars because when used on my bottom waterline it does tend to run after about an hour, but lasts for my top line without running all day!</li>
            <li>Oh my gosh this product is by far the best liner I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>I love that it comes with its own brush</li>
            <li>but this guy makes is so easy to apply and forgiving!  </li>
            <li>Its a great color/consistency, and has an awesome little liner brush included..</li>
            <li>My first gel eyeliner as well, so great for beginners I believe.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>I believe a better brush would provide a better result.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Worth the price, I didn&#x27;t want to spend more than 10$</li>
            <li>more could you want from a liner?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve resisted using eyeliner for lo, these many years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m liking this product better than the pencils and felt-tip marker liners that I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is eyeliner is fabulous!  </li>
            <li>more color choices.</li>
            <li>I love it and will be buying another one soon.  </li>
            <li>It’s cheap!</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS LINER.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>

            <li>I was most pleased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite eye liner.</li>
            <li>The Actual Application Brush Is PERFECT For The Texture Of This Gel Eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I like the elf cream liner better.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This is cheaper than the $30 eyeliners I use and much better.</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner</li>
            <li>I had been using $30 YSL gel liner and this is just so much better.</li>
            <li>I love love his eyeliner, I like buying lorel products, and have no regret buying this liner, will buy more</li>
            <li>I love eyeliner in a pot.  </li>
            <li>It will stay put and not move for the entire day...plus the brush is awesome too</li>
            <li>Love it love.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This is so much better than MAC.</li>
            <li>I love them to death.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>just fell in love with this gel eye liner.  </li>
            <li>I have used most of high-end product, but it was the most satisfying gel liner ever!&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I LOVE this liner.</li>
            <li>So glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just gonna buy this for my entire life! :D</li>
            <li>love love love</li>
            <li>I love the brush that comes with it, but the liner does not stay as well as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li>Love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>the cap on the brush makes it better than its competitors</li>
            <li>So glad I found this</li>
            <li>Woks okay, but still smears.  </li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>More affordable than Bobbi Brown and stays on just as well.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more like charcoal and doesn&#x27;t have the &#x27;punch&#x27; that I like.</li>
            <li>and I love the brush that comes with it :))</li>
            <li>I have soooo many issues with my eyelids being.... sweaty?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to wear liner like this all day without it creasing and transferring to the top part of the lid.</li>
            <li>but I do :)</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty amazing!</li>
            <li>Love this gel as an eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Then I &#x27;try&#x27; to add a smoky line vaguely on top, but I found covergirl pencil work better for that.</li>
            <li>Love this product..</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still pretty good</li>
            <li>The brush is pretty good unless you just prefer an angled brush or something.</li>
            <li>Even though it isn&#x27;t as smooth as when I first opened the package, it hasn&#x27;t started balling up as I apply it so that&#x27;s a good sign.  </li>
            <li>, This Is OUTSTANDING , It Applied Smooth And Lasted For About 5 1/2 - 6 Hours Without Needing To Be Touched Up</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it four stars is because the brush isn&#x27;t ideal.</li>
            <li>This is excellent quality, very pigmented, and the brush is easy to use + high quality for the price</li>
            <li>The brush that comes with it is easy to handle and gives you a more precise line.</li>
            <li>The brush is perfect and performs better than both of the angled brushes I had been using previously.  </li>
            <li>Infallible Lacquer Eyeliner is just the right kind of eyeliner</li>
            <li>On the other hand, I find that it works best when used on the waterline.</li>
            <li>But, overall, good product!</li>
            <li>easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;lasts</li>
            <li>br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t smudge easily</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not waterproof, and it does smudge easy--</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different types and brands of eyeliner and never been completely happy with them.  </li>
            <li>However, its also fairly easy to take off too with makeup remover.</li>
            <li>but it smeared easily after a couple hours.  </li>
            <li>Comes off easily with eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li>Although it is easy to apply I find that it&#x27;s not as pigmented as I&#x27;d like and wears off easily when used as a winged liner.</li>
            <li>Wrinkles come along on their own without any help from me, thank you very much.</li>
            <li>I was originally using MAC fluid liner, but I noticed after three months that the formula wasn&#x27;t very good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to control the amount of gel on the brush and easy to precisely apply it around the eye.</li>
            <li>If not then the brush it comes with works just fine.</li>
            <li>Stays all day, goes on smooth and easy.</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite eye liner... ever!</li>
            <li>Easy to get hang of after a few uses for the perfect cat eye!</li>
            <li>Lasts all day &amp; night &amp; looks great for the entire time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>on ultra smooth and DARK!&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how smooth this liner is.  </li>
            <li>Great product, second time buying it.</li>
            <li>The brush that came with the liner is also fantastic.</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a great gel liner.</li>
            <li>really  smooth  </li>
            <li>Its great as a regular eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t always find it in my local drugstores, so I was happy to find it at Amazon.</li>
            <li>I am overall happy with this product and would probably purchase it again.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and it does not smear or wear off..  </li>
            <li>Overall though, it&#x27;s good :)</li>
            <li>Anyways the next day I tried it out and it is amazing!</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner so much!</li>
            <li>I actually like it better than the Bobbi Brown and Mac eyeliner! :)</li>
            <li>I use this for the top of my eyelid to make a cat eye look and it never fails.</li>
            <li>Brush works well if you clean it thoroughly after every use.</li>
            <li>Way better than Bobbi Brown and much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I bought three later (for my sisters to gift them and they loved it as well)</li>
            <li>It lasts a full work-day</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a different gel liner that wasn&#x27;t as good as this one.</li>
            <li>It stays true to what it says on the package.</li>
            <li>The color is true to its’ word.</li>
            <li>I like that its a full size brush</li>
            <li>The only thing I do suggest is you invest in a good angle brush (I use the one from mac) if you plan on doing cat/wing eyes.</li>
            <li>Its fast and thats why i love it, one line and done</li>
            <li>Its pigmented and gives such good shape to the eye</li>
            <li>I am so glad I finally tried this gel liner it is absolutely the best on the market and makes eyeliner fun and easy with total control</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s easy to put on and keep on, it&#x27;s not difficult to wash it off.</li>
            <li>,this without doubt is the BEST EYELINER EVER, really black,smooth,u just need a little bit and just one time and u will have the blackless line</li>
            <li>This liner is super super smooth&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>The gel sets fairly quickly but you do need to give it a minute</li>
            <li>Dries quickly &amp; lasts all day.</li>
            <li>, it was SO easy to put on and have it look good IE straight and solid not patchy or unstraight.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and great little brush!</li>
            <li>They have a little bit of a metallic shine, but the colors are still beautiful.</li>
            <li>I have tried many of the gel eyeliners, as they seem to be the new fad  in eyeliner.</li>
            <li>It goes on so easily and you can really control the line thickness.</li>
            <li>it just perfect it last long and doesnt smude the brush</li>
            <li>I really like this eyeliner as it is easy to apply and stays all day.</li>
            <li>and I was ready for a dinner date !!</li>
            <li>aND I really can&#x27;t tell a difference between this and the one from mac expect the price !!</li>
            <li>The little brush may not have a fancy handle, but the shape of the natural bristles is perfect for applying the gel.</li>
            <li>This liner goes on so smooth and is very pigmented.</li>
            <li>The gel hasn&#x27;t gone dry and the brush is amazing but needs to be clean every now and then.</li>
            <li>last long,too!&lt;br /&gt;the brush that coomes with it is also nice</li>
            <li>IT WAS WORTH</li>
            <li>I bought this eyeliner just for fun and see how it works</li>
            <li>Highly pigmented, this product goes on quick and smooth and lasts even the longest days.  </li>
            <li>It glides on so smoothly, and stays on pretty much all day.</li>
            <li>I have a whole drawer full of the Bobbi Brown gel liners</li>
            <li>packaging is a cute little glass jar with a shiny gold top.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new eye liner and so I browsing all over the web for a cheap drugstore one.</li>
            <li>is the first time I am trying this type of eyeliner.</li>
            <li>love this and don&#x27;t have the same problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I usually only use my Tarte gel eyeliner, but I think this is so much better.</li>
            <li>I actually do think this is a better formula.  </li>
            <li>Most do not last for 12 hours.  </li>
            <li>I would only recommend they add more colors</li>
            <li>Product Came On Exact Estimated Delivery Date.</li>
            <li>I tried this gel liner for the first time ever</li>
            <li>, I actually like Maybelline&#x27;s brush better, though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty color</li>
            <li>Maybe next time I will make sure I buy waterproof eyeliners.</li>
            <li>yes I recommend this product for people who wants it to stay all day, it doesn&#x27;t smudges at all !</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>I love this goes on smooth, dark, and stays all day.</li>
            <li>Plus : Very durable!</li>
            <li>I was looking for a very reliable eyeliner and this is it!</li>
            <li>This is the first gel liner I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>exactly what i thought it was maybe even blacker ad</li>
            <li>I instantly fell in love with this liner after the first stroke.</li>
            <li>I like the line thin and the brush was just brilliant in that matter.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad that all gel liners are not created equal.</li>
            <li>I have oily eye-lids, so I always apply a primer first.</li>
            <li>find it works better in short strokes from underneath the lash line upwards to fill in the eyelash line.</li>
            <li>Took a few practice attempts to get a good wing, but now it is a breeze.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super smooth and pigmented, so easy to spread, but they don&#x27;t smudge once they&#x27;ve had a few minutes to set.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why I picked this up the other day, but it is hands down the best gel liner I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>so you get a new one every time you buy more, although honestly I think it will take me 5 years of super thick cat eyes to go through this all!</li>
            <li>, it is soooo creamy, and the brush is amazing, i use it every time over my other eyeliner brushes.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s black eye pencils are my favorite, so I was excited to try out this gel liner.</li>
            <li>Because It Has A Multitude Of Positive Reviews.</li>
            <li>After two weeks of daily use the consistency has remained smooth and completely clump free.</li>
            <li>For a few dollars extra, this is a great formula, and you actually get a bit more product.  </li>
            <li>only downside is it&#x27;s a little more work to take it off, but not an issue for the most perfect sharp black wings you can achieve.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have this in black as well as bronze and they&#x27;re both the best gel eyeliners I&#x27;ve tried, including Elf, Wet n Wild, Revlon, and Maybelline.</li>
            <li>Both very well made.</li>
            <li>Absolutely recommend this baby.</li>
            <li>whole day for me, no smudges or wear off</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have much time to put on makeup when you have kids.  </li>
            <li>Also, the container is much nicer looking.  </li>
            <li>Formula &amp; color are fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was fast, real product.</li>
            <li>I do winged eyeliner daily and it always comes out precise when I use this.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the brush that this liner comes with, but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li>I don’t know if it really stays on for 24 hours because well I don’t wear makeup for 24 hours straight.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>It is really smooth to draw on the lid, but on me it didn&#x27;t last all day and gave me racoon eyes.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s smoother but it doesn&#x27;t really glide on.</li>
            <li>It is very pigmented and glides on with no skipping or dragging on the lid.  </li>
            <li>Like my eyes hurt after rubbing them so much.  </li>
            <li>eyeliner pencil from Loreal for a whiel now as I have been very into these smudged eyeliner looks, but I have been looking to &amp;#34;clean</li>
            <li>Fast shipping &amp; as described.</li>
            <li>Its goes on like a dream and is very pigmented.</li>
            <li>And so much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting the formula to be as smooth or for it to last eight hours even without some type of eye shadow primer.</li>
            <li>and I paid too much for it.</li>
            <li>So with that in mind, I am very picky with what I use.</li>
            <li>Very long-lasting.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Better than expected!</li>
            <li>Starting each application with a clean brush will keep the gel from turning rancid or causing eye or skin infections.</li>
            <li>I bought this eyeliner as a last resort and quickly discovered I like both the gel and the brush better than I ever expected.</li>
            <li>The brush is not soft but rigid enough to give you a nice line.</li>
            <li>I do have to practice a bit more with this because it&#x27;s hard to line my eyes quickly with this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s dark black, stays on my waterline and lash line beautifully and doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li>I wish it were more of a dark taupe.</li>
            <li>So easy to apply, stays all day, stays pretty black for hours.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;e so skilled, you can line in one swipe and it is totally black.</li>
            <li>Clumsy-hands when it comes to winged liner but even I could do a decent wing with it.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>It is hard to get the hang of if you aren&#x27;t used to putting on eyeliner this way, but I have been practicing and I love this liner!</li>
            <li>I definitely know for sure it stays on for 12 hours with it still looking the same since I putted it on.</li>
            <li>I Chose This Particular Brand</li>
            <li>This is a decent eyeliner.</li>
            <li>The first day I used this, I applied it at 6:30 am, and when I got home at 9:00 pm, it looked exactly the same as it did in the morning, no fading, streaking, or anything.  </li>
            <li>Vivid black and pretty easy to apply</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Lasts a long time (9-10 months) if you clean the brush after using.</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner better than Bobbi Brown or any other eyeliner I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li>I have oily skin and have trouble with liner staying put when I do my winged eyeliner look, but this lasts for hours and hours by itself and even longer with a primer underneath and translucent setting powder on top.  </li>
            <li>I love the blakest black!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice deep black that lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>so i set out to find a new gel liner.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;) Goes on my eyes just as smooth as the expensive brands and stays put.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for cheap but very high quality and REALLY BLACK eyeliner, this is it!</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, easy to control, no smudges, and it really last a long time.</li>
            <li>The enclosed brush is pretty good and firm, but I usually use a slant-tip brush instead.</li>
            <li>Really nice product - a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I was a big huge fan of the maybelline formula, but it was getting a bit dry, so I decided to buy this one.  </li>
            <li>can combat this by using a primer but in the morning I really would prefer something that works and doesn&#x27;t require an extra step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really does last all day.&lt;br /&gt;Goes</li>
            <li>Also Came Completely Intact, And Sealed.</li>
            <li>The brush is a bit too soft for my preference</li>
            <li>It also made my eyes very irritated, which isn&#x27;t necessarily the fault of the product, but I thought it might be helpful if you&#x27;re considering this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>but I have blue green eyes a hunter green would be great.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m so surprised with the results.</li>
            <li>It goes on as thin, or as thick, as you desire, and best of all....</li>
            <li>Love the brush - depending on the way you hold it, you can get the thinnest line or as thick as you want.  </li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t usually happen to me, but it works good if u set it with a black eye shadow</li>
            <li>but i feel like it will last a long time because you really dont need much at all.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super black.</li>
            <li>but the handle isnt too long so you can get really close to the mirror if need be.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented and waterproof, stays creamy for a very long time.</li>
            <li>In Comparison To Other Higher Priced Products Ive Used</li>
            <li>very black eyeliner, goes on smooth, I wish I had knew about this product earlier</li>
            <li>One thing I recommend, to avoid the black line you get under your eyebrow, apply some black eye shadow on top of the liner.</li>
            <li>lets me  get a thin line i gotta say i love it its one of my fav eye prodouct</li>
            <li>I used to use MAC but those pots were bigger and the gel was stiffer and much too dry.</li>
            <li>I think this one is a little better for a few reasons -</li>
            <li>Kind of hard to take off with eye makeup remover, so it&#x27;s not my everyday eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I spend wayyy too much money on expensive cosmetics at sephora and very rarely ever buy drugstore brands...</li>
            <li>Full disclosure: I typically only line my upper lid and usually put some shadow over to reduce shine.</li>
            <li>Goes on thick, and last pretty much all day, well actually the only area I have to touch up is around the corners of my eyelids,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>While this creates a dark, rich line, I have oily lids and it tends to run about half way through the day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>this is such a deep dark black, it is one of the most pigmented black gel liners i have ever used.</li>
            <li>This is OK liner, but hard to use and messy.</li>
            <li>I like super precision when applying and the brush makes it hard for me to apply thin, clean lines.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use very much of it; I imagine the little pot will last me a very long time.</li>

            <li> Boy am i glad i did!</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  </li>

            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li> much better than mac!</li>
            <li> I love the texture!</li>
            <li> So easy to apply with the great brush included.</li>
            <li> Great product - easy to apply and stays on all day without shedding.</li>
            <li> The color is rich and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I goes on very smoothly, and lasts all day surprisingly.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush, easy to handle.</li>
            <li> the brush it comes with is amazing</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is amazing..</li>
            <li> It goes on nice</li>
            <li> or if the weather will be really warm.</li>
            <li> I was using the e.l.f creme eyeliner for about 6 months and loving it, than i realized it was drying out and</li>
            <li> Tossed the pot in the trash but kept the brush -- it&#x27;s surprisingly nice.</li>
            <li> Honestly I was in a hurry and thought I was ordering the infallible pencil..</li>
            <li> I use my own elf eyeliner brush which does the trick.</li>
            <li> It has good pigmentation, is easy to apply and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Although i do like this eyeliner and will continue to use it for my top line, i can&#x27;t give it 5stars because when used on my bottom waterline it does tend to run after about an hour, but lasts for my top line without running all day!</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh this product is by far the best liner I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> I love that it comes with its own brush</li>
            <li> but this guy makes is so easy to apply and forgiving!  </li>
            <li> Its a great color/consistency, and has an awesome little liner brush included..</li>
            <li> My first gel eyeliner as well, so great for beginners I believe.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> I believe a better brush would provide a better result.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Worth the price, I didn&#x27;t want to spend more than 10$</li>
            <li> more could you want from a liner?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve resisted using eyeliner for lo, these many years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m liking this product better than the pencils and felt-tip marker liners that I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is eyeliner is fabulous!  </li>
            <li> more color choices.</li>
            <li> I love it and will be buying another one soon.  </li>

            <li> Woks okay, but still smears.  </li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> More affordable than Bobbi Brown and stays on just as well.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more like charcoal and doesn&#x27;t have the &#x27;punch&#x27; that I like.</li>
            <li> and I love the brush that comes with it :))</li>
            <li> I have soooo many issues with my eyelids being.... sweaty?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to wear liner like this all day without it creasing and transferring to the top part of the lid.</li>
            <li> but I do :)</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty amazing!</li>
            <li> Love this gel as an eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Then I &#x27;try&#x27; to add a smoky line vaguely on top, but I found covergirl pencil work better for that.</li>
            <li> Love this product..</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still pretty good</li>
            <li> The brush is pretty good unless you just prefer an angled brush or something.</li>
            <li> Even though it isn&#x27;t as smooth as when I first opened the package, it hasn&#x27;t started balling up as I apply it so that&#x27;s a good sign.  </li>
            <li> , This Is OUTSTANDING , It Applied Smooth And Lasted For About 5 1/2 - 6 Hours Without Needing To Be Touched Up</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it four stars is because the brush isn&#x27;t ideal.</li>
            <li> This is excellent quality, very pigmented, and the brush is easy to use + high quality for the price</li>
            <li> The brush that comes with it is easy to handle and gives you a more precise line.</li>
            <li> The brush is perfect and performs better than both of the angled brushes I had been using previously.  </li>
            <li> Infallible Lacquer Eyeliner is just the right kind of eyeliner</li>
            <li> On the other hand, I find that it works best when used on the waterline.</li>
            <li> But, overall, good product!</li>
            <li> easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;lasts</li>
            <li> br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t smudge easily</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not waterproof, and it does smudge easy--</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different types and brands of eyeliner and never been completely happy with them.  </li>
            <li> However, its also fairly easy to take off too with makeup remover.</li>
            <li> but it smeared easily after a couple hours.  </li>
            <li> Comes off easily with eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Although it is easy to apply I find that it&#x27;s not as pigmented as I&#x27;d like and wears off easily when used as a winged liner.</li>
            <li> Wrinkles come along on their own without any help from me, thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I was originally using MAC fluid liner, but I noticed after three months that the formula wasn&#x27;t very good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to control the amount of gel on the brush and easy to precisely apply it around the eye.</li>
            <li> If not then the brush it comes with works just fine.</li>
            <li> Stays all day, goes on smooth and easy.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite eye liner... ever!</li>
            <li> Easy to get hang of after a few uses for the perfect cat eye!</li>
            <li> Lasts all day &amp; night &amp; looks great for the entire time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> on ultra smooth and DARK!&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how smooth this liner is.  </li>
            <li> Great product, second time buying it.</li>
            <li> The brush that came with the liner is also fantastic.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a great gel liner.</li>
            <li> really  smooth  </li>
            <li> Its great as a regular eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t always find it in my local drugstores, so I was happy to find it at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am overall happy with this product and would probably purchase it again.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and it does not smear or wear off..  </li>
            <li> Overall though, it&#x27;s good :)</li>
            <li> Anyways the next day I tried it out and it is amazing!</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner so much!</li>
            <li> I actually like it better than the Bobbi Brown and Mac eyeliner! :)</li>
            <li> I use this for the top of my eyelid to make a cat eye look and it never fails.</li>
            <li> Brush works well if you clean it thoroughly after every use.</li>
            <li> Way better than Bobbi Brown and much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I bought three later (for my sisters to gift them and they loved it as well)</li>
            <li> It lasts a full work-day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a different gel liner that wasn&#x27;t as good as this one.</li>
            <li> It stays true to what it says on the package.</li>
            <li> The color is true to its’ word.</li>
            <li> I like that its a full size brush</li>
            <li> The only thing I do suggest is you invest in a good angle brush (I use the one from mac) if you plan on doing cat/wing eyes.</li>
            <li> Its fast and thats why i love it, one line and done</li>
            <li> Its pigmented and gives such good shape to the eye</li>
            <li> I am so glad I finally tried this gel liner it is absolutely the best on the market and makes eyeliner fun and easy with total control</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s easy to put on and keep on, it&#x27;s not difficult to wash it off.</li>
            <li> ,this without doubt is the BEST EYELINER EVER, really black,smooth,u just need a little bit and just one time and u will have the blackless line</li>
            <li> This liner is super super smooth&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> The gel sets fairly quickly but you do need to give it a minute</li>
            <li> Dries quickly &amp; lasts all day.</li>
            <li> , it was SO easy to put on and have it look good IE straight and solid not patchy or unstraight.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and great little brush!</li>
            <li> They have a little bit of a metallic shine, but the colors are still beautiful.</li>
            <li> I have tried many of the gel eyeliners, as they seem to be the new fad  in eyeliner.</li>
            <li> It goes on so easily and you can really control the line thickness.</li>
            <li> it just perfect it last long and doesnt smude the brush</li>
            <li> I really like this eyeliner as it is easy to apply and stays all day.</li>
            <li> and I was ready for a dinner date !!</li>
            <li> aND I really can&#x27;t tell a difference between this and the one from mac expect the price !!</li>
            <li> The little brush may not have a fancy handle, but the shape of the natural bristles is perfect for applying the gel.</li>
            <li> This liner goes on so smooth and is very pigmented.</li>
            <li> The gel hasn&#x27;t gone dry and the brush is amazing but needs to be clean every now and then.</li>
            <li> last long,too!&lt;br /&gt;the brush that coomes with it is also nice</li>
            <li> IT WAS WORTH</li>
            <li> I bought this eyeliner just for fun and see how it works</li>
            <li> Highly pigmented, this product goes on quick and smooth and lasts even the longest days.  </li>
            <li> It glides on so smoothly, and stays on pretty much all day.</li>
            <li> I have a whole drawer full of the Bobbi Brown gel liners</li>
            <li> packaging is a cute little glass jar with a shiny gold top.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new eye liner and so I browsing all over the web for a cheap drugstore one.</li>
            <li> is the first time I am trying this type of eyeliner.</li>
            <li> love this and don&#x27;t have the same problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually only use my Tarte gel eyeliner, but I think this is so much better.</li>
            <li> I actually do think this is a better formula.  </li>
            <li> Most do not last for 12 hours.  </li>
            <li> I would only recommend they add more colors</li>
            <li> Product Came On Exact Estimated Delivery Date.</li>
            <li> I tried this gel liner for the first time ever</li>
            <li> , I actually like Maybelline&#x27;s brush better, though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty color</li>
            <li> Maybe next time I will make sure I buy waterproof eyeliners.</li>
            <li> yes I recommend this product for people who wants it to stay all day, it doesn&#x27;t smudges at all !</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> I love this goes on smooth, dark, and stays all day.</li>
            <li> Plus : Very durable!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a very reliable eyeliner and this is it!</li>
            <li> This is the first gel liner I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> exactly what i thought it was maybe even blacker ad</li>
            <li> I instantly fell in love with this liner after the first stroke.</li>
            <li> I like the line thin and the brush was just brilliant in that matter.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad that all gel liners are not created equal.</li>
            <li> I have oily eye-lids, so I always apply a primer first.</li>
            <li> find it works better in short strokes from underneath the lash line upwards to fill in the eyelash line.</li>
            <li> Took a few practice attempts to get a good wing, but now it is a breeze.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super smooth and pigmented, so easy to spread, but they don&#x27;t smudge once they&#x27;ve had a few minutes to set.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I picked this up the other day, but it is hands down the best gel liner I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> so you get a new one every time you buy more, although honestly I think it will take me 5 years of super thick cat eyes to go through this all!</li>
            <li> , it is soooo creamy, and the brush is amazing, i use it every time over my other eyeliner brushes.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s black eye pencils are my favorite, so I was excited to try out this gel liner.</li>
            <li> Because It Has A Multitude Of Positive Reviews.</li>
            <li> After two weeks of daily use the consistency has remained smooth and completely clump free.</li>
            <li> For a few dollars extra, this is a great formula, and you actually get a bit more product.  </li>
            <li> only downside is it&#x27;s a little more work to take it off, but not an issue for the most perfect sharp black wings you can achieve.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have this in black as well as bronze and they&#x27;re both the best gel eyeliners I&#x27;ve tried, including Elf, Wet n Wild, Revlon, and Maybelline.</li>
            <li> Both very well made.</li>
            <li> Absolutely recommend this baby.</li>
            <li> whole day for me, no smudges or wear off</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have much time to put on makeup when you have kids.  </li>
            <li> Also, the container is much nicer looking.  </li>
            <li> Formula &amp; color are fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was fast, real product.</li>
            <li> I do winged eyeliner daily and it always comes out precise when I use this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the brush that this liner comes with, but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> I don’t know if it really stays on for 24 hours because well I don’t wear makeup for 24 hours straight.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> It is really smooth to draw on the lid, but on me it didn&#x27;t last all day and gave me racoon eyes.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s smoother but it doesn&#x27;t really glide on.</li>
            <li> It is very pigmented and glides on with no skipping or dragging on the lid.  </li>
            <li> Like my eyes hurt after rubbing them so much.  </li>
            <li> eyeliner pencil from Loreal for a whiel now as I have been very into these smudged eyeliner looks, but I have been looking to &amp;#34;clean</li>
            <li> Fast shipping &amp; as described.</li>
            <li> Its goes on like a dream and is very pigmented.</li>
            <li> And so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting the formula to be as smooth or for it to last eight hours even without some type of eye shadow primer.</li>
            <li> and I paid too much for it.</li>
            <li> So with that in mind, I am very picky with what I use.</li>
            <li> Very long-lasting.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Better than expected!</li>
            <li> Starting each application with a clean brush will keep the gel from turning rancid or causing eye or skin infections.</li>
            <li> I bought this eyeliner as a last resort and quickly discovered I like both the gel and the brush better than I ever expected.</li>
            <li> The brush is not soft but rigid enough to give you a nice line.</li>
            <li> I do have to practice a bit more with this because it&#x27;s hard to line my eyes quickly with this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dark black, stays on my waterline and lash line beautifully and doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li> I wish it were more of a dark taupe.</li>
            <li> So easy to apply, stays all day, stays pretty black for hours.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;e so skilled, you can line in one swipe and it is totally black.</li>
            <li> Clumsy-hands when it comes to winged liner but even I could do a decent wing with it.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> It is hard to get the hang of if you aren&#x27;t used to putting on eyeliner this way, but I have been practicing and I love this liner!</li>
            <li> I definitely know for sure it stays on for 12 hours with it still looking the same since I putted it on.</li>
            <li> I Chose This Particular Brand</li>
            <li> This is a decent eyeliner.</li>
            <li> The first day I used this, I applied it at 6:30 am, and when I got home at 9:00 pm, it looked exactly the same as it did in the morning, no fading, streaking, or anything.  </li>
            <li> Vivid black and pretty easy to apply</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time (9-10 months) if you clean the brush after using.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner better than Bobbi Brown or any other eyeliner I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> I have oily skin and have trouble with liner staying put when I do my winged eyeliner look, but this lasts for hours and hours by itself and even longer with a primer underneath and translucent setting powder on top.  </li>
            <li> I love the blakest black!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice deep black that lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> so i set out to find a new gel liner.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;) Goes on my eyes just as smooth as the expensive brands and stays put.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for cheap but very high quality and REALLY BLACK eyeliner, this is it!</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, easy to control, no smudges, and it really last a long time.</li>
            <li> The enclosed brush is pretty good and firm, but I usually use a slant-tip brush instead.</li>
            <li> Really nice product - a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I was a big huge fan of the maybelline formula, but it was getting a bit dry, so I decided to buy this one.  </li>
            <li> can combat this by using a primer but in the morning I really would prefer something that works and doesn&#x27;t require an extra step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really does last all day.&lt;br /&gt;Goes</li>
            <li> Also Came Completely Intact, And Sealed.</li>
            <li> The brush is a bit too soft for my preference</li>
            <li> It also made my eyes very irritated, which isn&#x27;t necessarily the fault of the product, but I thought it might be helpful if you&#x27;re considering this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> but I have blue green eyes a hunter green would be great.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m so surprised with the results.</li>
            <li> It goes on as thin, or as thick, as you desire, and best of all....</li>
            <li> Love the brush - depending on the way you hold it, you can get the thinnest line or as thick as you want.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t usually happen to me, but it works good if u set it with a black eye shadow</li>
            <li> but i feel like it will last a long time because you really dont need much at all.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s super black.</li>
            <li> but the handle isnt too long so you can get really close to the mirror if need be.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented and waterproof, stays creamy for a very long time.</li>
            <li> In Comparison To Other Higher Priced Products Ive Used</li>
            <li> very black eyeliner, goes on smooth, I wish I had knew about this product earlier</li>
            <li> One thing I recommend, to avoid the black line you get under your eyebrow, apply some black eye shadow on top of the liner.</li>
            <li> lets me  get a thin line i gotta say i love it its one of my fav eye prodouct</li>
            <li> I used to use MAC but those pots were bigger and the gel was stiffer and much too dry.</li>
            <li> I think this one is a little better for a few reasons -</li>
            <li> Kind of hard to take off with eye makeup remover, so it&#x27;s not my everyday eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I spend wayyy too much money on expensive cosmetics at sephora and very rarely ever buy drugstore brands...</li>
            <li> Full disclosure: I typically only line my upper lid and usually put some shadow over to reduce shine.</li>
            <li> Goes on thick, and last pretty much all day, well actually the only area I have to touch up is around the corners of my eyelids,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> While this creates a dark, rich line, I have oily lids and it tends to run about half way through the day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> this is such a deep dark black, it is one of the most pigmented black gel liners i have ever used.</li>
            <li> This is OK liner, but hard to use and messy.</li>
            <li> I like super precision when applying and the brush makes it hard for me to apply thin, clean lines.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use very much of it; I imagine the little pot will last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> I can draw a very thin line, barely touching the skin of the outer eye.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last all day but long enough.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much more pigmented, a bit smoother, it lasts a bit longer, and is less irritating to my eyes.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;ll last you a long while.</li>
            <li> Long lasting!</li>
            <li> It seems to last a long time without smudging.</li>
            <li> After looking for an eyliner that would actually last long on my eyes</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly, lasts all day (which actually gets annoying when wanting to take it off at night) but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> The gel would be dry and cracked and totally unuseable after 2 months.</li>
            <li> A Long Way</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not completely liquid but not completely a stick.</li>
            <li> Lasted long, however it smudges a lot during the day.</li>
            <li> I use it for my waterline and it stays all day long.</li>
            <li> However, I was very hesitant to spend $30 on a product at Sephora when I knew I would only get a few uses with it before it dried up on me.</li>
            <li> I have spent well over $27.00 on eyeliner that didn&#x27;t work &amp; last as long as this one.</li>
            <li> A small drop or two is all you need to clean it; rinse the brush with cold or hot water, pat dry with a paper towel or disposable cotton pad before storing.</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;ve used this for almost 4 months now, and the liner did dry out quite a bit.  </li>
            <li> NONE OF THAT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on, and once it&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li> and I know you are supposed to change them out every three to six months, but the eye liner hasn&#x27;t started to separate or become dry.</li>
            <li> And you are able to make a thin line or a thick line with the brush.</li>
            <li> however, I use it every single day and it has yet to crack/smudge/drag or do anything else to ruin the look.  </li>
            <li> I keep a small squirt bottle of oily mascara remover near the sink for cleaning the brush.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry up like some other gel liners</li>
            <li> I was using regular gel eyeliner before getting this and it always smudged a few hours into the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used two others that were *harder</li>
            <li> This product caused no irritation for me, and was the color I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> I have used this everyday since I bought it last week</li>
            <li> After three pots of the MAC, I went back to liquid, because the MAC gel liner was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Whether you&#x27;re an everyday eyeliner wearer, or just use it on occasion, I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Stays put all day but the brush it comes with is too wide for the thinner style I prefer.</li>
            <li> I only used it once on my top lid and seemed to smudge off on my lid (which I hate )</li>
            <li> But lately, I&#x27;ve found that the eye shadow is rubbing off on my upper eyelids and giving me dark circles above my eyes.</li>
            <li> The jar looks small but since you really only use a dab for each application, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Just like all other reviews say.</li>
            <li> Put this immediately after bath and then do other morning chores like drinking coffee, breakfast, packing bag for school/office.</li>
            <li> I bought this liner hoping it would NOT smear,smudge or run like other liners I have bought.</li>
            <li> Will have to continue my search and spend more money. :(</li>
            <li> The brush works as well as the other brush I have.  </li>
            <li> Other eyeliners I&#x27;ve tried either smudge or flake off.  </li>
            <li> It lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t smears or disappears like other eyeliners.</li>
            <li> Takes a little time to dry, its almost waterproof after you let it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t dried out for me at all after a few months of daily use.</li>
            <li> I have such a hard time trying to get my eyeliners to stay because I have oily eyelids.</li>
            <li> Tje only downside is how hard it is to get off</li>
            <li> I bought this liner in dark slate</li>
            <li> My last gel eyeliner purchase was Maybelline, but it was a dull and smudgy black.</li>
            <li> but you can still smudge it a little so that it doesn&#x27;t form such a hard line.</li>
            <li> Holy grail eyeliner darker than Mac black track</li>
            <li> The slate gray color looks almost black on my skin.</li>
            <li> I got the shade Blackest Black.</li>
            <li> It is really black.</li>
            <li> All I did was slightly touch up(because</li>
            <li> Also the container looks small but a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my eyelids got itchy and a bit swollen after I applied above my upper lashes.</li>
            <li> buy the black, and although I&#x27;ve also ordered the mauve -</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little less smudgy.  </li>
            <li> need a little time to</li>
            <li> This is a little jar</li>
            <li> Is That A Little Goes</li>
            <li> Putting silica power over it helped a little.  </li>
            <li> The reason why I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it smears a little in the lower lash line.</li>
            <li> The bristles are firm but the tip is flexible and the brush has a well-formed chisel tip.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it will stay creamy for a few months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update</li>
            <li> At almost 4 months or everyday use, I&#x27;m about 3/4 of the way finished with this.  </li>
            <li> It separates causing an uneven application of the eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Maybe a few times a month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using pencils for so long that typically smudge and are just plain outdated.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s extremely black and stays put all day!</li>
            <li> Usually it melts a little bit on the corners of my eyes but</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use a primer or base on my eyelid it will transfer just after application, so try not to look way up within the first few minutes of applying.  </li>
            <li> The brush that comes with it is the same as the Maybelline, and fairly useless for my cat eye look.  </li>
            <li> No more pencil eyeliner for me</li>
            <li> Love the eye liner, but the brush is awful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s usually coming off by the time I get home from work.</li>
            <li> usually just something here or there to throw in my purse for touch ups.  </li>
            <li> My eyeliner hasn&#x27;t melted away like the pencil stuff usually does by noon</li>
            <li> Eyeliners usually still get smudgy at the end of the day, but this one didn&#x27;t smudge almost at all.</li>
            <li> I can not imagine ever again paying for my usual department store brand now that I have discovered this product.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not that hard to apply; however, if you do not wash that little brush they give you every time you use it, then it gets hard and is not usable anymore.</li>
            <li> The brush that&#x27;s included is VERY hard to use (especially for a first-time user), I would recommend using a small angled brush, because the rounded edge of this brush facilitates mistakes and makes it difficult to follow your lashline.</li>
            <li> or you could end up with a hard to remove line where you don&#x27;t want it.</li>
            <li> It is also is extremely hard to remove...</li>
            <li> I am extremely clumsy at applying eyeliner and can never apply like they show in Youtube videos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I never liked the idea of pulling on the skin around the eyes to apply my makeup.</li>
            <li> Well at least a couple years anways...</li>
            <li> That was my only disappointment.</li>
            <li> I just got it today, its very pigmented, though I hate the part when i had to remove it from my eyelid.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable!</li>
            <li> it is unbelievable!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if mine was defective, but it was very thick, almost like a putty, and did not apply evenly.</li>
            <li> Instead, I&#x27;d use black eye shadow and a very thin brush.</li>
            <li> brush comes with it and can be manipulated for a thin or thick line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you like thin lines I wouldn&#x27;t suggest buying this product.</li>
            <li> recommend this to all my gal pals who are tired of liquid but don&#x27;t want to go to a pencil.</li>
            <li> I was tired of the raccoon eye look</li>
            <li> $$$ well spent you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> thought using a brush to apply liner was going to be crazy difficult and messy.</li>
            <li> problem is, you can&#x27;t use it on the bottom, it looks too weird.</li>
            <li> I will admit, I was skeptical when trying this one, but not after one use.</li>
            <li> SAD DAY.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical of drug store products because I do believe you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had anything like this happen before, so it was quite a disappointment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very difficult to find a product that lasts all day on your waterline.</li>
            <li> “no, it’s eye liner” and he said “oh, my bad, I knew it had to do something with liner though”.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, but it&#x27;s a bit annoying trying to get the eyeliner off my contacts at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Oh my gosh this product is by far the best liner I&#x27;ve owned. The pot is so cute and the brush is perfect. Both very well made. I&#x27;m no expert at lining my eyes, I still screw up a lot but this guy makes is so easy to apply and forgiving!  I&#x27;ll be going through a lot of these! Absolutely recommend this baby.</li>
            <li> The brush isn&#x27;t the best quality, but I guess it&#x27;s considered &amp;#34;free.&amp;#34; The product goes on relatively smoothly. I believe a better brush would provide a better result.</li>
            <li> This is the best gel eye liner. Way better than Bobbi Brown and much cheaper. This lasts all day, while the Bobbi Brown has faded or flaked off by the end of the day. I have a whole drawer full of the Bobbi Brown gel liners and I never use them now b/c I only use this. I wish there were more colors!</li>
            <li> easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;lasts whole day for me, no smudges or wear off</li>
            <li> This is my #1 go to eyeliner. So easy to apply with the great brush included. I was using regular gel eyeliner before getting this and it always smudged a few hours into the day. This goes on and stays on and looks great while doing it. The brush is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Although i do like this eyeliner and will continue to use it for my top line, i can&#x27;t give it 5stars because when used on my bottom waterline it does tend to run after about an hour, but lasts for my top line without running all day!</li>
            <li> My holy grail eye product, will not try another. Does transfer a bit on upper lid and may smear in corners of eyes, but I just keep track of it. Very nice brush, easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Works great. Stays on for a while. Wouldn&#x27;t suggest to people with watery eyes though.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I finally tried this gel liner it is absolutely the best on the market and makes eyeliner fun and easy with total control the brush it comes with is amazing Holy grail eyeliner darker than Mac black track😍😍😍👍👍👍</li>
            <li> Its amazing! Just like all other reviews say. I am extremely clumsy at applying eyeliner and can never apply like they show in Youtube videos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time I am trying this type of eyeliner. Doesn&#x27;t smudge, if you let it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick Tip: Put this immediately after bath and then do other morning chores like drinking coffee, breakfast, packing bag for school/office. Takes a little time to dry, its almost waterproof after you let it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth the price, I didn&#x27;t want to spend more than 10$ so if thats&#x27;s your price budget then I would definitely recommend you to go for it! I bought three later (for my sisters to gift them and they loved it as well)</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have much time to put on makeup when you have kids.  I can just swipe this on and it&#x27;s done!</li>
            <li> While this creates a dark, rich line, I have oily lids and it tends to run about half way through the day.&lt;br /&gt;I can combat this by using a primer but in the morning I really would prefer something that works and doesn&#x27;t require an extra step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other people I know (who don&#x27;t have oily lids) love this and don&#x27;t have the same problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other Comments:&lt;br /&gt;Easy application&lt;br /&gt;Smooth gel consistency--I&#x27;ve used two others that were *harder* for some reason&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t smudge easily</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this product is for me. I did not like the formula or the consistency of the gel.</li>
            <li> 1) This liner is super super smooth&lt;br /&gt;2) It is ultra pigmented.&lt;br /&gt;3) The brush that comes with it is easy to handle and gives you a more precise line. I am Ms.Clumsy-hands when it comes to winged liner but even I could do a decent wing with it.&lt;br /&gt;4) It does not budge throughout the day. No smudging, no fading.&lt;br /&gt;5) It does not put a hole in your wallet.&lt;br /&gt;What more could you want from a liner?</li>
            <li> The blackest gel eyeliner i have come across!  Took a few practice attempts to get a good wing, but now it is a breeze.  Lasts all day.  If I don&#x27;t use a primer or base on my eyelid it will transfer just after application, so try not to look way up within the first few minutes of applying.  Really nice product - a little goes a long way.  It hasn&#x27;t dried out for me at all after a few months of daily use.</li>
            <li> I have spent well over $27.00 on eyeliner that didn&#x27;t work &amp; last as long as this one. Lasts all day &amp; night &amp; looks great for the entire time.&lt;br /&gt;The problem is, you can&#x27;t use it on the bottom, it looks too weird.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve resisted using eyeliner for lo, these many years. I never liked the idea of pulling on the skin around the eyes to apply my makeup. Wrinkles come along on their own without any help from me, thank you very much. Instead, I&#x27;d use black eye shadow and a very thin brush. It&#x27;s worked well all these years. But lately, I&#x27;ve found that the eye shadow is rubbing off on my upper eyelids and giving me dark circles above my eyes. I did a lot of research into eyeliners before buying this gel. I love it! Where has it been all my life?!? I can draw a very thin line, barely touching the skin of the outer eye. It stays on all day, except the days I swim laps and need to reapply my makeup. You don&#x27;t need to use very much of it; I imagine the little pot will last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> I usually only use my Tarte gel eyeliner, but I think this is so much better. It goes on nice and it&#x27;s super black. I love this eyeliner so much! It&#x27;s not waterproof, and it does smudge easy-- so don&#x27;t run your eyes!</li>
            <li> I bought this after my beauty guru, Carli Bybel, had done a video showing how she applies this product. Its a great color/consistency, and has an awesome little liner brush included.. It is hard to get the hang of if you aren&#x27;t used to putting on eyeliner this way, but I have been practicing and I love this liner!</li>
            <li> I bought this eyeliner as a last resort and quickly discovered I like both the gel and the brush better than I ever expected. The little brush may not have a fancy handle, but the shape of the natural bristles is perfect for applying the gel. It&#x27;s easy to control the amount of gel on the brush and easy to precisely apply it around the eye. The bristles are firm but the tip is flexible and the brush has a well-formed chisel tip. It&#x27;s the best tightline brush I&#x27;ve ever found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought using a brush to apply liner was going to be crazy difficult and messy. Instead it&#x27;s just the opposite. I&#x27;m liking this product better than the pencils and felt-tip marker liners that I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel wears well on my eyes, staying on 6 to 8 hours. The slate gray color looks almost black on my skin. I wish it were more of a dark taupe.</li>
            <li> This is eyeliner is fabulous!  I love it!  It&#x27;s seldom that I find a product especially beauty product that I would recommend to every person I know and the entire freaking internet but this is one of them.  I have tried so many different types and brands of eyeliner and never been completely happy with them.  This one is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have to hold it over a lighter or sharpen it.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t give me raccoon eyes after 2 hours.  Really does last all day.&lt;br /&gt;Goes on ultra smooth and DARK!&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply.  It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m painting on my face! &amp;#60;3&lt;br /&gt;Great for vintage cat eyes.&lt;br /&gt;The brush comes with it and can be manipulated for a thin or thick line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Does need a little time to dry.&lt;br /&gt;Might need to set it with a shadow of similar color.&lt;br /&gt;Need more color choices.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how smooth this liner is.  I was a big huge fan of the maybelline formula, but it was getting a bit dry, so I decided to buy this one.  I actually do think this is a better formula.  It&#x27;s a nice deep black that lasts all day.  It didn&#x27;t crack or fade.  Also, the container is much nicer looking.  The brush that comes with it is the same as the Maybelline, and fairly useless for my cat eye look.  I don&#x27;t know if it will be the same after it dries out a bit, but I will definitely update.  For a few dollars extra, this is a great formula, and you actually get a bit more product.  Hopefully it will stay creamy for a few months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update: I&#x27;ve used this for almost 4 months now, and the liner did dry out quite a bit.  however, I use it every single day and it has yet to crack/smudge/drag or do anything else to ruin the look.  I love it and will be buying another one soon.  At almost 4 months or everyday use, I&#x27;m about 3/4 of the way finished with this.  Even though it isn&#x27;t as smooth as when I first opened the package, it hasn&#x27;t started balling up as I apply it so that&#x27;s a good sign.  Once it does start to ball up or collect on my eyelid, I will buy another pot.</li>
            <li> Formula &amp; color are fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was fast, real product.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best eyeliners I&#x27;ve used for the price. I do winged eyeliner daily and it always comes out precise when I use this. It lasts a full work-day and I only need to reapply it if I plan to go out after work.</li>
            <li> Great product, second time buying it. Last all day. No more pencil eyeliner for me</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and great little brush! Does not smudge or come off! Price performance, very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this eye liner! I goes on very smoothly, and lasts all day surprisingly. I&#x27;ve tried a different gel liner that wasn&#x27;t as good as this one. It went on &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34;, and did not stay one for even an hour. I will admit, I was skeptical when trying this one, but not after one use. I don&#x27;t really like the brush that this liner comes with, but that&#x27;s just me. I use just a regular eye liner brush that I already had. One thing I recommend, to avoid the black line you get under your eyebrow, apply some black eye shadow on top of the liner. This product caused no irritation for me, and was the color I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new eye liner and so I browsing all over the web for a cheap drugstore one. I read a lot of good reviews on this eye liner. I got mine at Walmart for $6.97. I got the shade Blackest Black. A very short story as I was paying for this, the cashier was like “you’re buying lip liner” and I said (giggling) “no, it’s eye liner” and he said “oh, my bad, I knew it had to do something with liner though”. Anyways the next day I tried it out and it is amazing! It stays true to what it says on the package. The color is true to its’ word. It is really black. It goes on smoothly, easy to control, no smudges, and it really last a long time. I don’t know if it really stays on for 24 hours because well I don’t wear makeup for 24 hours straight. I definitely know for sure it stays on for 12 hours with it still looking the same since I putted it on. It does come with a brush. And you are able to make a thin line or a thick line with the brush. I highly recommend this! It’s cheap! Unbelievable!</li>
            <li> This is such a bargain buy. I used to buy Bobbi Brown and spend more money than I needed to cause this is a great dupe &#x3D;) Goes on my eyes just as smooth as the expensive brands and stays put.</li>
            <li> Love it. I actually like it better than the Bobbi Brown and Mac eyeliner! :)</li>
            <li> creamy formula lasts all day. won&#x27;t flake and get into your eyes. not waterproof but i can wear these during working out without any issues.</li>
            <li> Great product - easy to apply and stays on all day without shedding.</li>
            <li> I bought this liner in dark slate I have hazel eyes so that color makes my eyes stand out. I bought this liner hoping it would NOT smear,smudge or run like other liners I have bought. This liner did NOT fade,run, smudge or smear I wore it for 24 hours and it lasted through 110 degree heat and humity. The brush that came with the liner is also fantastic. I LOVE THIS LINER. THANKS L&#x27;Oreal!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this. Once its on, it stays on all day. However, its also fairly easy to take off too with makeup remover. I would recommend this to someone who knows how to apply this type of eyeliner, cause once its on, its on</li>
            <li> this is such a deep dark black, it is one of the most pigmented black gel liners i have ever used. it lasts all day, it is so deep and pigmented, it is soooo creamy, and the brush is amazing, i use it every time over my other eyeliner brushes. great creamy eyeliner, never smudged on me it is perfection.</li>
            <li> This is a solid product. The jar looks small but since you really only use a dab for each application, a little goes a long way. I love that it comes with a brush. The brush is not soft but rigid enough to give you a nice line. The gel sets fairly quickly but you do need to give it a minute or you could end up with a hard to remove line where you don&#x27;t want it. I recommend using an eye primer especially if you have oily lids or if the weather will be really warm.</li>
            <li> I was using the e.l.f creme eyeliner for about 6 months and loving it, than i realized it was drying out and no longer working for me so i set out to find a new gel liner. I had orginally set out to find maybelline&#x27;s eye studio gel liner because i heard such rave reviews about it but walmart was sold out at the time. I was in dire need of eyeliner and this loreal 24h gel liner had caught my eye. I figured i would give it a shot. Boy am i glad i did! I love this stuff. The brush it comes with is perfect size. I like that its a full size brush but the handle isnt too long so you can get really close to the mirror if need be. This liner goes on so smooth and is very pigmented. This is a little jar but i feel like it will last a long time because you really dont need much at all. The staying power is great. Usually it melts a little bit on the corners of my eyes but with this it stayed put. It look great at 9:00 at night as it did at 7:30 in the morning when i put it on. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a great gel liner.</li>
            <li> I have tried many of the gel eyeliners, as they seem to be the new fad  in eyeliner. Most do not last for 12 hours.  I am pleased to say this one does and has a very good brush with it as well. I was most pleased.</li>
            <li> Lasts all day and there is no need to reapply (though I do sometimes) It&#x27;s very difficult to find a product that lasts all day on your waterline. I will DEFINITELY be buying again!!</li>
            <li> Best eyeliner ever!&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase this until I chroke!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It stays on ALL DAY and has a great brush for super perfect line!!!!!! Best eyeliner ever</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this eyeliner. It goes on so easily and you can really control the line thickness. I would only recommend they add more colors</li>
            <li> I am impressed by the brush. very good and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite eye liner. It stays all day, it is easy to apply, the brush is the perfect size, and the price is tolerable.</li>
            <li> Product Came On Exact Estimated Delivery Date. Also Came Completely Intact, And Sealed. The Actual Application Brush Is PERFECT For The Texture Of This Gel Eyeliner. I Chose This Particular Brand Because It Has A Multitude Of Positive Reviews. In Comparison To Other Higher Priced Products Ive Used , This Is OUTSTANDING , It Applied Smooth And Lasted For About 5 1/2 - 6 Hours Without Needing To Be Touched Up And Without Any  Smudging , Smearing Or Running. The Best Part I Have To Say Is That A Little Goes A Long Way And Its So Compact And You Can Vurtualy Take It With You In Any Purse Or Makeup Bag.</li>
            <li> Love the eye liner, but the brush is awful. It separates causing an uneven application of the eyeliner. Doesn&#x27;t last all day but long enough.</li>
            <li> It is really smooth to draw on the lid, but on me it didn&#x27;t last all day and gave me racoon eyes.  Putting silica power over it helped a little.  I like the elf cream liner better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using pencils for so long that typically smudge and are just plain outdated. I tried this gel liner for the first time ever and I absolutely love it! I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. It shapes my eye perfectly and it&#x27;s so easy to do winged liner and it doesn&#x27;t budge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying this out after having gone through Maybelline&#x27;s gel liner. I think this one is a little better for a few reasons - it&#x27;s much more pigmented, a bit smoother, it lasts a bit longer, and is less irritating to my eyes. I don&#x27;t find it a lot easier to apply, though - it&#x27;s smoother but it doesn&#x27;t really glide on. The brush is a bit too soft for my preference but it&#x27;s still pretty good, I actually like Maybelline&#x27;s brush better, though.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Only eyeliner I will ever use. The only thing I do suggest is you invest in a good angle brush (I use the one from mac) if you plan on doing cat/wing eyes. If not then the brush it comes with works just fine. It is smudge proof!!!!! I put it on 7am went about my day running errands and even came home and TOOK A NAP !!( yes a nap during the day ...your thinking who has time for that but thats what happens when the kids are at grandma&#x27;s  ..lol) but anyways when I woke it was pretty much perfect!!! All I did was slightly touch up(because my eye shadow had come over not my liner ! ) and I was ready for a dinner date !! I&#x27;ll list some pictures the  picture with the one eye close up is after a nap!! Also the container looks small but a little goes a long way! It doesn&#x27;t dry up like some other gel liners aND I really can&#x27;t tell a difference between this and the one from mac expect the price !! $$$ well spent you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> For anyone who likes liquid liner, this is a great liner to use. I feel it would also be a great choice for anyone wanting to venture out into the liquid eyeliner world. It&#x27;s not completely liquid but not completely a stick. It&#x27;s a pretty color and it&#x27;s not that hard to apply; however, if you do not wash that little brush they give you every time you use it, then it gets hard and is not usable anymore. Also, I would say 24 hour wear is stretching it. It&#x27;s usually coming off by the time I get home from work.</li>
            <li> Love it. I have hooded eyes and have issues with eyeliners smudging, smearing or wearing off quickly-but this? NONE OF THAT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on, and once it&#x27;s dry i&#x27;m good all day and night unless I forget i&#x27;m wearing it and rub my eyes. And even then the damage to it is minimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve worn it for over 9 hours and never had any issues with irritation and such-but if you don&#x27;t take it off before bed, be prepared to fight with it in the morning!</li>
            <li> This is the BEST!! 💜&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;Oreal Paris Infallible Lacquer Eyeliner is just the right kind of eyeliner I&#x27;ve been looking for! It goes on perfectly with the brush it comes with 💄💋 I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s black eye pencils are my favorite, so I was excited to try out this gel liner. Unfortunately, my eyelids got itchy and a bit swollen after I applied above my upper lashes. The product packaging was intact, and the product didn&#x27;t appear to be outside of any expiration date. Tossed the pot in the trash but kept the brush -- it&#x27;s surprisingly nice. I&#x27;ve never had anything like this happen before, so it was quite a disappointment. SAD DAY.</li>
            <li> very black eyeliner, goes on smooth, I wish I had knew about this product earlier and I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Perfect!  I love this eyeliner better than Bobbi Brown or any other eyeliner I have used in the past.  This is cheaper than the $30 eyeliners I use and much better.</li>
            <li> Its fast and thats why i love it, one line and done&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive been using similar eyeliners for about 5 years and this one for a year and it dosnet dissapoint, except that its never at walmart (out of stock always) so i ordered it frm here</li>
            <li> i thought it would be lasting but it smeared easily after a couple hours.  Maybe next time I will make sure I buy waterproof eyeliners.</li>
            <li> Lasted long, however it smudges a lot during the day. I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s the cause of the heat. Overall though, it&#x27;s good :)</li>
            <li> I would give this product 5 stars, but whenever I use this, it tends to flake off on my contacts. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, but it&#x27;s a bit annoying trying to get the eyeliner off my contacts at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s extremely black and stays put all day! I have such a hard time trying to get my eyeliners to stay because I have oily eyelids. I do have to practice a bit more with this because it&#x27;s hard to line my eyes quickly with this product.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner I just got it today, its very pigmented, though I hate the part when i had to remove it from my eyelid. I would deff repurchase it. yes I recommend this product for people who wants it to stay all day, it doesn&#x27;t smudges at all !</li>
            <li> I have bought this gel liner last year and there is still A LOT left. I use this for the top of my eyelid to make a cat eye look and it never fails. It stays on all day. It doesn&#x27;t work well for the bottom waterline or lash line but I don&#x27;t put it there anyways. The gel hasn&#x27;t gone dry and the brush is amazing but needs to be clean every now and then. I recommend this product for anyone who loves to do the \\&quot;cat eye\\&quot; or \\&quot;winged\\&quot; liner.</li>
            <li> This is OK liner, but hard to use and messy. It tends to look like crayon. I prefer the liquid liner.</li>
            <li> Even with this I still suck at gel liner. The product is great but the brush could be thinner.</li>
            <li> work awesome. Dries quickly &amp; lasts all day. Comes off easily with eye makeup remover. Easy to get hang of after a few uses for the perfect cat eye!</li>
            <li> Loved the way it went on and lasted all day! Tje only downside is how hard it is to get off</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if mine was defective, but it was very thick, almost like a putty, and did not apply evenly. It also made my eyes very irritated, which isn&#x27;t necessarily the fault of the product, but I thought it might be helpful if you&#x27;re considering this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> This is a decent eyeliner. Although it is easy to apply I find that it&#x27;s not as pigmented as I&#x27;d like and wears off easily when used as a winged liner. On the other hand, I find that it works best when used on the waterline.</li>
            <li> I spend wayyy too much money on expensive cosmetics at sephora and very rarely ever buy drugstore brands... usually just something here or there to throw in my purse for touch ups.  I don&#x27;t know why I picked this up the other day, but it is hands down the best gel liner I have ever used.  I had been using $30 YSL gel liner and this is just so much better. It is very pigmented and glides on with no skipping or dragging on the lid.  I have oily skin and have trouble with liner staying put when I do my winged eyeliner look, but this lasts for hours and hours by itself and even longer with a primer underneath and translucent setting powder on top.  The brush is perfect and performs better than both of the angled brushes I had been using previously.  I have used this everyday since I bought it last week and I am incredibly happy with it.</li>
            <li> I love love his eyeliner, I like buying lorel products, and have no regret buying this liner, will buy more</li>
            <li> I like super precision when applying and the brush makes it hard for me to apply thin, clean lines.  It is also is extremely hard to remove... Like my eyes hurt after rubbing them so much.  If you like thin lines I wouldn&#x27;t suggest buying this product.</li>
            <li> I love eyeliner in a pot.  This goes on well and comes with the brush for application.  I wish it was a little less smudgy.  But, overall, good product!</li>
            <li> I love and swear by this stuff!</li>
            <li> Very pigmented and waterproof, stays creamy for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite eye liner... ever! It goes on as thin, or as thick, as you desire, and best of all.... it stays put and doesn&#x27;t smear off as the day goes on. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The only eyeliner I use. So easy to apply, stays all day, stays pretty black for hours.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is it&#x27;s a little more work to take it off, but not an issue for the most perfect sharp black wings you can achieve.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to all my gal pals who are tired of liquid but don&#x27;t want to go to a pencil. This is the perfect inbetween.</li>
            <li> staying power of this product is amazing! All day baby!</li>
            <li> This gel liner from L\\&quot;oreal does not SMUDGE AT ALL!!!&lt;br /&gt;I put it on 6:00am in the morning to go the work, than I head to school, by the time I get home around 11:00pm - the eyeliner did not move one bit. It will stay put and not move for the entire day...plus the brush is awesome too</li>
            <li> Love it! Love it love. I have been using the &amp;#34;fat&amp;#34; eyeliner pencil from Loreal for a whiel now as I have been very into these smudged eyeliner looks, but I have been looking to &amp;#34;clean up my act&amp;#34; a bit and try gel liner. I used to use liquid which can be SO touchy I tell you.... This however is awesome. My eyeliner hasn&#x27;t melted away like the pencil stuff usually does by noon, it was SO easy to put on and have it look good IE straight and solid not patchy or unstraight. I love that it comes with its own brush so you get a new one every time you buy more, although honestly I think it will take me 5 years of super thick cat eyes to go through this all! Well at least a couple years anways...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it, very happy :)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Fast shipping &amp; as described.</li>
            <li> Excellent gel liner. I used to use MAC but those pots were bigger and the gel was stiffer and much too dry. The gel would be dry and cracked and totally unuseable after 2 months. After three pots of the MAC, I went back to liquid, because the MAC gel liner was a waste of money. Then I found this L&#x27;Oreal product. It&#x27;s so good!!! Its goes on like a dream and is very pigmented. If you&#x27;e so skilled, you can line in one swipe and it is totally black. This is so much better than MAC. And so much cheaper. The brush that it comes with is excellent too. No need to buy a separate brush (which you have to do with all the department store brands).</li>
            <li> I have this in black as well as bronze and they&#x27;re both the best gel eyeliners I&#x27;ve tried, including Elf, Wet n Wild, Revlon, and Maybelline. They&#x27;re super smooth and pigmented, so easy to spread, but they don&#x27;t smudge once they&#x27;ve had a few minutes to set. They have a little bit of a metallic shine, but the colors are still beautiful. The brush is pretty good unless you just prefer an angled brush or something. I&#x27;ve had mine for months and they&#x27;re not even close to drying up. I love them to death.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is a cute little glass jar with a shiny gold top. Because it&#x27;s so pigmented, you don&#x27;t have to apply a lot at once, so it&#x27;ll last you a long while.</li>
            <li> Hi!!&lt;br /&gt;I just fell in love with this gel eye liner.  I have used most of high-end product, but it was the most satisfying gel liner ever!&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s really  smooth  so I can easily make beautiful line and last long,too!&lt;br /&gt;the brush that coomes with it is also nice but, I don&#x27;t think it will last long.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll only keep buying this from now on. ;)</li>
            <li> I have to say i had my doubts about this eyeliner,cause i was a big fan of the Maybelline one,but a YouTube Guru was talking about it and i said WTH i will give it a try and let me tell u IT WAS WORTH IT ,this without doubt is the BEST EYELINER EVER, really black,smooth,u just need a little bit and just one time and u will have the blackless line ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this liner. It&#x27;s a liquid but you can still smudge it a little so that it doesn&#x27;t form such a hard line. I will definitely buy more. Note: I didn&#x27;t use the brush that came with it. I have an angled eyeliner brush.</li>
            <li> Its great as a regular eyeliner. But I bought it specifically because it was supposed to be &amp;#34;lacquered&amp;#34; and shiny. And it isn&#x27;t at all. It is...matte. I have a million of those already. That was my only disappointment. Will have to continue my search and spend more money. :(</li>
            <li> The first day I used this, I applied it at 6:30 am, and when I got home at 9:00 pm, it looked exactly the same as it did in the morning, no fading, streaking, or anything.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  The brush works as well as the other brush I have.  The color is rich and beautiful.</li>
            <li> This is the only eyeliner I&#x27;ve found that stays on all day.  I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve tested it for 24 hours, but it has lasted 18 hours for me.  Other eyeliners I&#x27;ve tried either smudge or flake off.  I can&#x27;t always find it in my local drugstores, so I was happy to find it at Amazon.</li>
            <li> The best gel liner!  I use it for my waterline and it stays all day long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really blackout it transfer under my eye after a few hours. This doesn&#x27;t usually happen to me, but it works good if u set it with a black eye shadow</li>
            <li> I love this goes on smooth, dark, and stays all day.</li>
            <li> I was originally using MAC fluid liner, but I noticed after three months that the formula wasn&#x27;t very good. It was separating and it clumped a lot. So I wanted to try a cheaper version and I went with Loreal since I couldn&#x27;t get the Maybelline version. I have to admit that I am impressed. I wasn&#x27;t expecting the formula to be as smooth or for it to last eight hours even without some type of eye shadow primer. I have had it for about four months and I know you are supposed to change them out every three to six months, but the eye liner hasn&#x27;t started to separate or become dry. I am overall happy with this product and would probably purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly, lasts all day (which actually gets annoying when wanting to take it off at night) but totally worth it. So glad I bought it. My first gel eyeliner as well, so great for beginners I believe.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for cheap but very high quality and REALLY BLACK eyeliner, this is it! Plus : Very durable!</li>
            <li> Love it but I have blue green eyes a hunter green would be great. I use it on my inner eye lid and this works well because it doesn&#x27;t flack</li>
            <li> It is a really good product. I was looking for a very reliable eyeliner and this is it! It lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t smears or disappears like other eyeliners. I used to wear revlon color stay (pencil) and after a couple of hours this is what would happen. The L&#x27;Oreal eyeliner doesn&#x27;t disappear. I am very happy with this purchase and I recommend the product. The reason why I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it smears a little in the lower lash line.</li>
            <li> I was tired of the raccoon eye look I would have mid day when using a pencil liner. So with a coupon in hand I decided to give loreal&#x27;s gel liner a try. I have difficulty achieving a nice even line wjth liquid liner, so the gel seemed very appealing. And I am very pleased with this liner. I have no problems controlling the precision of application. My eyes look awesome with loreal&#x27;s illuminating mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical of drug store products because I do believe you get what you pay for. However, I was very hesitant to spend $30 on a product at Sephora when I knew I would only get a few uses with it before it dried up on me. I decided to take a chance and I&#x27;m so glad I did! This is excellent quality, very pigmented, and the brush is easy to use + high quality for the price you&#x27;re paying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you&#x27;re an everyday eyeliner wearer, or just use it on occasion, I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Very cool eyeliner!! I&#x27;ve never - until now - used a gel liner, but it&#x27;s very easy to apply, and the result is great! The brush is very good quality; although it doesn&#x27;t seem that way at first, it&#x27;s a perfect thickness.</li>
            <li> This product is the best one!!!! I bought Stilla eyeliner but it didn&#x27;t work and I paid too much for it. I bought this eyeliner just for fun and see how it works but I&#x27;m so surprised with the results. I&#x27;m just gonna buy this for my entire life! :D</li>
            <li> Honestly I was in a hurry and thought I was ordering the infallible pencil..but when it came as a brush  - I tried it and now am wondering why in the world I never tried it before - AWESOME, no smudging, stays all day!</li>
            <li> Highly pigmented, this product goes on quick and smooth and lasts even the longest days.  Love the brush - depending on the way you hold it, you can get the thinnest line or as thick as you want.  Great for summer heat.</li>
            <li> Best eyeliner ever!! Lasts all day!</li>
            <li> much better than mac! love love love</li>
            <li> PERFECT. Long lasting! JUST PERFECT!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use makeup often. Maybe a few times a month. So with that in mind, I am very picky with what I use. I really love this eyeliner, it&#x27;s the best. Stays all day, goes on smooth and easy. I would totally recommend this eyeliner!</li>
            <li> This is the first gel liner I&#x27;ve used. I love the brush that comes with it, but the liner does not stay as well as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> Very long-lasting. Kind of hard to take off with eye makeup remover, so it&#x27;s not my everyday eyeliner. Takes a while to get used to putting on eyeliner with a brush. The brush that&#x27;s included is VERY hard to use (especially for a first-time user), I would recommend using a small angled brush, because the rounded edge of this brush facilitates mistakes and makes it difficult to follow your lashline.</li>
            <li> Love this eyeliner. It seems to last a long time without smudging. The only thing I don&#x27;t care for is the brush but I already had one that I like from Sigma.</li>
            <li> exactly what i thought it was maybe even blacker ad the cap on the brush makes it better than its competitors</li>
            <li> What can I say.. I instantly fell in love with this liner after the first stroke. I like the line thin and the brush was just brilliant in that matter. Thank you amazon for stocking this amazon product on subscribe n save. Its pigmented and gives such good shape to the eye it is unbelievable! So glad I found this</li>
            <li> After looking for an eyliner that would actually last long on my eyes i came across this one and it just perfect it last long and doesnt smude the brush lets me  get a thin line i gotta say i love it its one of my fav eye prodouct</li>
            <li> Woks okay, but still smears.  Brush works well if you clean it thoroughly after every use.</li>
            <li> Best eyeliner ive tried..&lt;br /&gt;Would have been a 5star but it starts smudging after a couple hours..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a beauty guru, but I have worn makeup for a while...&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the best gel eyeliners that I&#x27;ve ever used. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner.  More affordable than Bobbi Brown and stays on just as well.  I have purchased this product several times to keep in stock.&lt;br /&gt;I buy the black, and although I&#x27;ve also ordered the mauve - it&#x27;s more like charcoal and doesn&#x27;t have the &#x27;punch&#x27; that I like.</li>
            <li> I use this for my upper waterline. It says all day no smudging and no transfer and I love the brush that comes with it :))</li>
            <li> I have soooo many issues with my eyelids being.... sweaty? and any eyeshadow and eyeliners seem to always crease - EXCEPT THIS STUFF! I&#x27;ve never been able to wear liner like this all day without it creasing and transferring to the top part of the lid. Although it&#x27;s easy to put on and keep on, it&#x27;s not difficult to wash it off.</li>
            <li> Literally stayed on 24 hours and through a shower. Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t know that but I do :)</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner. It&#x27;s dark black, stays on my waterline and lash line beautifully and doesn&#x27;t smudge. The enclosed brush is pretty good and firm, but I usually use a slant-tip brush instead. I was initially scared to open the package but I&#x27;m glad that all gel liners are not created equal. My last gel eyeliner purchase was Maybelline, but it was a dull and smudgy black.</li>
            <li> It glides on so smoothly, and stays on pretty much all day. I have oily eye-lids, so I always apply a primer first. Eyeliners usually still get smudgy at the end of the day, but this one didn&#x27;t smudge almost at all.</li>
            <li> I love the blakest black! this is the only one I use on my under eye because it glides on so well . I only used it once on my top lid and seemed to smudge off on my lid (which I hate ) but for the under eye it doesn&#x27;t cause the same problem and It doesn&#x27;t cause an irritation to my eye.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is amazing.. It goes on smooth and it does not smear or wear off..  It&#x27;s pretty amazing!</li>
            <li> This product is a total steal. It has good pigmentation, is easy to apply and lasts all day. It does not smudge or transfer to my crease. After two weeks of daily use the consistency has remained smooth and completely clump free. I can not imagine ever again paying for my usual department store brand now that I have discovered this product. Full disclosure: I typically only line my upper lid and usually put some shadow over to reduce shine. I have applied to my upper water line and did not have any running or transfer to my lower line.</li>
            <li> Love this gel as an eyeliner. Lasts a long time (9-10 months) if you clean the brush after using. I keep a small squirt bottle of oily mascara remover near the sink for cleaning the brush. A small drop or two is all you need to clean it; rinse the brush with cold or hot water, pat dry with a paper towel or disposable cotton pad before storing. Starting each application with a clean brush will keep the gel from turning rancid or causing eye or skin infections.</li>
            <li> I love the texture! It&#x27;s so creamy. And the brush is great!</li>
            <li> Goes on thick, and last pretty much all day, well actually the only area I have to touch up is around the corners of my eyelids,&lt;br /&gt;and really only bother if I&#x27;m leaving the house.. there are different ways you can apply gel liner, I can&#x27;t apply it like a liquid in a line,&lt;br /&gt;I find it works better in short strokes from underneath the lash line upwards to fill in the eyelash line. Then I &#x27;try&#x27; to add a smoky line vaguely on top, but I found covergirl pencil work better for that. Love this product.. its the one I plan on sticking too. and it the jar seems to last forever.</li>
            <li> Better than expected!</li>
            <li> Great buy! Vivid black and pretty easy to apply</li>
            <li> Stays put all day but the brush it comes with is too wide for the thinner style I prefer.</li>
            <li> I love this soooooo much my favorite liner ever!!!!</li>
            <li> I like it but I stick to liquid eye liner</li>
            <li> I really like this eyeliner as it is easy to apply and stays all day. The only reason I gave it four stars is because the brush isn&#x27;t ideal. I use my own elf eyeliner brush which does the trick.</li>
