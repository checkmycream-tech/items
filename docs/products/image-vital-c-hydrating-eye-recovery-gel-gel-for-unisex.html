            <li>Very happy with how it wakes up my 55 year old eyes.</li>
            <li>It did not sting my eyes and was very light not sticky.</li>
            <li>Gel has a nice cooling feel, and applies easily without leaving any residue.</li>
            <li>Love the product...until Image changed the packaging.</li>
            <li>Instead of the serum dispensing out of the top, it squeezes out the sides at the bottom of the pump.</li>

            <li>I use all the image c products and love them all.</li>
            <li>I love the Image products and use many of them</li>
            <li>and so I thought I would love their eye gel as well.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this product but do not like the cap on the one I received.</li>
            <li>I always receive comments on how healthy my skin looks.  </li>
            <li>I love this line of skin care.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more translucent than creamy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen a significant change!</li>
            <li>Worth the price!!</li>
            <li>It;s pricey but is absorbs well and makeup applies over top easily.</li>
            <li>This offers great moisture</li>
            <li>It smelled great and I appreciate the natural ingredients</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Image products, including Vital C Hydrating Eye Recovery Gel for almost a year now and am extremely happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Awesome, I have been using this along with other image products for 2 years now and can see a difference with my skin.</li>
            <li>Emollient eye cream, user-friendly formulation, easy to dispense</li>
            <li>I can only assume it&#x27;s making me beautiful</li>
            <li>and I start to see some improvement on the fine lines under my eyes.</li>
            <li>Excellent product for getting rid of dark circles under your eyes!</li>
            <li>I have used many eye creams over the years from high end professional to drig store brands, all in search of a great eye cream.  </li>
            <li>Soft , nice and creamy ,easy to apply serum.&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li>The eye gel is perfect for the daytime, as it&#x27;s not too rich (as I find many eye creams can be for daytime) but definitely hydrating enough to lessen the dryness and crepey tendencies that have started creeping in since turning the corner of 40.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll have to wait and see what kind of results I get, but I do love how hydrating it is and how my skin felt when I woke up this morning from using it last night.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sensitive to a lot of facial products, but this product line has been great!</li>
            <li>I have used this product for over a year now and have gotten many positive comments on</li>
            <li>Just discovered the Vital C skincare line which I love and can&#x27;t believe what a difference it makes!  </li>
            <li>Is it doing anything special?  </li>
            <li>The top is now slanted and requires a certain method and point of pushing but then does not release any lotion.  </li>
            <li>I am a women in my late 60&#x27;s and my skin looks great!</li>
            <li>I have loved this brand for years now and was paying twice the price at a local spa until I found it on here.</li>
            <li>Any explanation of this discrepancy would be most appreciated</li>
            <li>First, shipper shipped very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Product was as described and shipped quickly</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t buy it again - even though I love most Image Skin Care Products and ONLY use that brand.</li>
            <li>Item was exactly as described!</li>
            <li>but this product actually dried the skin around my eyes and increased fine lines!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the $150 eye creams and this is still my favorite and offers some tightening when you apply.</li>
            <li>Image Vital C is my favorite eye gel on the market, for the money.  </li>
            <li>and that I&#x27;d be looking really old without using it:).</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use it on a regular basis to notice how effective it was</li>
            <li>but I do believe the product is worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>At this pric  point it is worth every penny#</li>
            <li>eye look fresh , healthy and skin is so soft after using this product .you will noticed the result in 2 weeks of using it .</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>This is not as my darting as I had hoped, but it&#x27;s all right.</li>
            <li>I dont hav  deep set wrinkles, I have under eye puffiness and thisnhas made an amazing difference, so much thtt my husband noticed!  </li>
            <li>This eye creme maybe be great for younger individuals but at my age I need something a little more moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>If the product were available with the normal hole in it to allow the lotion to be squeezed out, I would buy it.</li>
            <li>Really keeps the fine lines at bay and helps with eye puffiness, particular during pollen season.</li>
            <li>Caused area around eyes to feel really tight, but it did a really good job of delivering the benefits to my surrounding eye area.</li>
            <li>Actually, cheaper products better</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it does anything different or better than my Clinique.</li>
            <li>The items may be great for others but these products left my face extremely dry with scars on my face.  </li>
            <li>I have very, very sensitive eyes and the Gel is right on.</li>
            <li>Fast service.</li>
            <li>Very hydrating for under the eye and not greasy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy but provides much needed moisture for our CO climate.  </li>
            <li>yet it did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>This eye cream really brightens the eyes and diminishes lines.</li>
            <li>Really did not see much of a result.</li>
            <li>I recommend the whole line of this skin product.</li>
            <li>This eye cream seems to work very well.</li>
            <li>I originally heard of this product from my dermatologist, but the they want over double the price!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Seemed different than when I bought in salon- just did not seem new and fresh-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to say it&#x27;s made me look younger, no miracle working going on here, but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to, moisturize, and helps with make up under the eye area if applied right before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had 3 tubes of the new pump dispenser and two of them didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>also cant live without.</li>
            <li>I am having to shop for a new product altogether now.</li>
            <li>Live vital c</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without my vital c eye gel.</li>
            <li>I now have to see a dermatologist to help clear.</li>
            <li>So far seems to be working.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it has never bothered me.</li>
            <li>Vendor so far hasn&#x27;t been responsive to exchanging the product.</li>
            <li>I have been using Vital C products for almost a year now.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t notice any improvement so far.</li>
            <li>This was my first purchase of the Eye Gel as I use and love the same in the facial cleanser, I find that using plain Vaseline on my upper lids at night, keep them clear without redness, so I will probably toss this product.</li>
            <li>While it is not a &amp;#34;wrinkle&amp;#34; cure, it does, however, help with the small, fine wrinkles around the eye/smile area.  </li>
            <li>After having used IMAX eye creams for the past few years and loving them, I now am researching for a product that will come out of the container and that works well.</li>
            <li>I use this eye gel and the vital C vitamin ACE serum during the day, and the combination makes my aging, slightly dry, acne-prone skin incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t see much difference when using it compared to other eye products.</li>
            <li>It helps to reduce the dark circles that I have lived with my whole life.</li>
            <li>Helps diminish the dark circles under the eyes, as well as really minimizes puffiness.</li>
            <li>It wastes too much for the price!</li>

            <li> Love the product...until Image changed the packaging. I&#x27;ve had 3 tubes of the new pump dispenser and two of them didn&#x27;t work. Instead of the serum dispensing out of the top, it squeezes out the sides at the bottom of the pump. I&#x27;m not buying it again until they change the dispenser. It wastes too much for the price!</li>
            <li> Fast service. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating for under the eye and not greasy.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, very moisturizing for the eye area. I&#x27;m not going to say it&#x27;s made me look younger, no miracle working going on here, but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to, moisturize, and helps with make up under the eye area if applied right before.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for getting rid of dark circles under your eyes!</li>
            <li> Like the product but the container with pump did not release all the gel.  Had to cut it open when I thought it was empty and found at least 2 oz. left inside.</li>
            <li> So far seems to be working.</li>
            <li> also cant live without.</li>
            <li> I love the product. I do not like the tube it comes out of. I use it for a about 10 times then after that it does not squirt out anything so I have to take the scissors to cut the end off  and scoop it out into a empty container. This was the second bottle I had to do this with</li>
            <li> LOVE the Image products! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a year now and have gotten many positive comments on well my skin looks. It is expensive but worth the money.I am a women in my late 60&#x27;s and my skin looks great!</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my facial therapist. I have used it for almost 3 months and I start to see some improvement on the fine lines under my eyes. I love it.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and these products are wonderful! My fave looks great.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product - soothing and smoothing the skin.</li>
            <li> Lightweight formula that reduces puffy morning eyes! Love it!</li>
            <li> Actually, cheaper products better</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream.  It&#x27;s not greasy but provides much needed moisture for our CO climate.  Just a small drop is needed very night.</li>
            <li> Awesome, I have been using this along with other image products for 2 years now and can see a difference with my skin.</li>
            <li> I have loved this brand for years now and was paying twice the price at a local spa until I found it on here. Absolutely love their products. I am 35 and I am looking for wrinkle preventative but yet I still break out if I use something to oily or thick. This offers great moisture plus I don&#x27;t break out. I use the eye cream plus the face moisturizer and serum. I&#x27;ve had the $150 eye creams and this is still my favorite and offers some tightening when you apply.</li>
            <li> Love it. I have sensitive skin and it has never bothered me. I use all the image c products and love them all.</li>
            <li> Seemed different than when I bought in salon- just did not seem new and fresh- seemed like maybe a salon was going to trash it and sold it to Amazon.  I would expect prices to be cheaper rather than the same saify buying in salon and it was not</li>
            <li> I use morning and night, already seeing results.</li>
            <li> I was highly disappointed in this product. It smelled great and I appreciate the natural ingredients yet it did absolutely nothing. I purchased one for a gift and one for me, and we were both disappointed in the results. We both have other products from this line that we like.</li>
            <li> Image Vital C is my favorite eye gel on the market, for the money.  Probably better would be Arbonne, but I cannot always afford it!  Very happy with how it wakes up my 55 year old eyes.</li>
            <li> Emollient eye cream, user-friendly formulation, easy to dispense</li>
            <li> Caused area around eyes to feel really tight, but it did a really good job of delivering the benefits to my surrounding eye area. They looked refreshed.</li>
            <li> This eye cream really brightens the eyes and diminishes lines. Pleasant orange scent. I&#x27;ve seen a significant change! It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> I originally heard of this product from my dermatologist, but the they want over double the price!  I have used this product of over three years and love it!  It smells great and keeps my face looking hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li> Really did not see much of a result.</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase of the Eye Gel as I use and love the same in the facial cleanser, I find that using plain Vaseline on my upper lids at night, keep them clear without redness, so I will probably toss this product.</li>
            <li> First, shipper shipped very quickly.  No complaints there.  I love the Image products and use many of them and so I thought I would love their eye gel as well.  Have to say, I didn&#x27;t see much difference when using it compared to other eye products.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I see an improvement in the dark circles under my eyes. It helps to reduce the dark circles that I have lived with my whole life.</li>
            <li> I just started using this so I&#x27;ll have to wait and see what kind of results I get, but I do love how hydrating it is and how my skin felt when I woke up this morning from using it last night.</li>
            <li> This product has been recommended by an esthetician I&#x27;ve been seeing for years.  I can only assume it&#x27;s making me beautiful and that I&#x27;d be looking really old without using it:).</li>
            <li> Love this product but do not like the cap on the one I received. It is hard to get any out and if you squeeze too hard it blows the cap off.</li>
            <li> Soothing, hydrating, smells good.</li>
            <li> This cream works fantastically on me skin. I keep buying it since a while and I will continue to do that!</li>
            <li> Do not but this product from discount cosmetics .  Their products are expired.</li>
            <li> Just discovered the Vital C skincare line which I love and can&#x27;t believe what a difference it makes!  However, not a fan of the eye recovery gel.  I don&#x27;t think it does anything different or better than my Clinique.</li>
            <li> Live vital c but this product actually dried the skin around my eyes and increased fine lines!!!</li>
            <li> The product is great but the container has changed and it is quite problematic! The product would not come out, I had to take it apart and now it won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years. Manufacturers changed packaging and its faulty. Vendor so far hasn&#x27;t been responsive to exchanging the product. It&#x27;s unusable in its current packaging.</li>
            <li> The product does have a soothing feeling and non-greasy.  I have dark circles and hoped the product would reduce or eliminate them.  I didn&#x27;t use it on a regular basis to notice how effective it was but I do believe the product is worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Loved the eye cream. It moisturized the eye area without being greasy. Would recommend it for people who need hydration but not extra oil.</li>
            <li> I like the eye gel. It does help hydrate around the eyes. Is it doing anything special?  The only problem with this product is that the pump did not work properly and I have to put my finger in the tube to get the product out.</li>
            <li> I have used many eye creams over the years from high end professional to drig store brands, all in search of a great eye cream.  I may have found it  I hsve been using this for just over a week and its great  I dont hav  deep set wrinkles, I have under eye puffiness and thisnhas made an amazing difference, so much thtt my husband noticed!  At this pric  point it is worth every penny#</li>
            <li> I have been using Vital C products for almost a year now.  The eye recovery gel is amazing.  Helps diminish the dark circles under the eyes, as well as really minimizes puffiness. While it is not a &amp;#34;wrinkle&amp;#34; cure, it does, however, help with the small, fine wrinkles around the eye/smile area.  I use this every morning and night.  Believe me, , , A little dab will certainly do ya &amp; this little tube will last.</li>
            <li> Been using Image skin care products for a while now. This eye gel is amazing. Really keeps the fine lines at bay and helps with eye puffiness, particular during pollen season.</li>
            <li> Good Products work well</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!  Item was exactly as described!</li>
            <li> Great eye cream and so refreshing to put on!</li>
            <li> I use this eye gel and the vital C vitamin ACE serum during the day, and the combination makes my aging, slightly dry, acne-prone skin incredibly soft. The eye gel is perfect for the daytime, as it&#x27;s not too rich (as I find many eye creams can be for daytime) but definitely hydrating enough to lessen the dryness and crepey tendencies that have started creeping in since turning the corner of 40.</li>
            <li> Soft , nice and creamy ,easy to apply serum.&lt;br /&gt;Your eye look fresh , healthy and skin is so soft after using this product .you will noticed the result in 2 weeks of using it .</li>
            <li> I use all of Image product line.  I always receive comments on how healthy my skin looks.  I recommend the whole line of this skin product.</li>
            <li> I love this line of skin care. This eye cream seems to work very well. I might try a different one in the line next time, but I did like it.</li>
            <li> Thought it would be creamier. It&#x27;s more translucent than creamy. Haven&#x27;t notice any improvement so far. Only time will tell.</li>
            <li> This gel is awesome for the area around my eyes....&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had a &amp;#34;young&amp;#34; outlook on life, but now&lt;br /&gt;the mirror says I have one too!!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my esthetician and it&#x27;s awesome!!  I use it morning and night!  I use it under my eyes and between my brows - neck too!!  Worth the price!!</li>
            <li> I am very confused by my recent purchase of Vital C hydrating eye recovery gel.The box states it has Vitamin K in it, it is also listed under ingredients on the box. After a closer look I discovered the box listed a completely different list than the list which was printed on the tube. This has neverhappened before with any other image productI have purchased. My question is which is the correct list of ingredients?There are a lot of great peptides that are listed on the box but not on the tube. Has this happened to anyone else? Any explanation of this discrepancy would be most appreciated</li>
            <li> The items may be great for others but these products left my face extremely dry with scars on my face.  I now have to see a dermatologist to help clear.</li>
            <li> This eye creme maybe be great for younger individuals but at my age I need something a little more moisturizing.  I love the Image products, however, I just bought the wrong one for me.</li>
            <li> Product was as described and shipped quickly</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without my vital c eye gel. It&#x27;s cooling and does not promote puffiness.  Smooths fine lines and is great under concealer.</li>
            <li> Got product on time, great stuff</li>
            <li> have used it prior so I knew what I was getting.  Hopefully will order this product again when I am finished</li>
            <li> Gel has a nice cooling feel, and applies easily without leaving any residue. Can&#x27;t tell how effective it&#x27;s been at reducing puffiness, but seems to help somewhat. I&#x27;ve used Oil of Olay and Neutrogena eye gels in the past. This is as good as they are.</li>
            <li> I love this product, the supplier is great</li>
            <li> been using this product over a month, i&#x27;m not sure if it really works for me. I don&#x27;t see any difference all:( I do feel a tingling sensation around my eyes from the firming ingredient in there but overall it did not make my eyes brighter(still dark circles)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Image products, including Vital C Hydrating Eye Recovery Gel for almost a year now and am extremely happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using quite a few of the image Vital C products. This is not as my darting as I had hoped, but it&#x27;s all right.</li>
            <li> I have very, very sensitive eyes and the Gel is right on. It did not sting my eyes and was very light not sticky. I would definitely order this product again.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying this eye gel - I hate it. My eyes feel dry and I don&#x27;t&#x27; feel like it does what it is supposed to do.I won&#x27;t buy it again - even though I love most Image Skin Care Products and ONLY use that brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to a lot of facial products, but this product line has been great!</li>
            <li> I have dark circles and this stuff helps.  It;s pricey but is absorbs well and makeup applies over top easily.</li>
            <li> Products new dispenser design is defective which makes the product basically worthless. The top is now slanted and requires a certain method and point of pushing but then does not release any lotion.  After having used IMAX eye creams for the past few years and loving them, I now am researching for a product that will come out of the container and that works well. Lotion does not usually come out after several tries, usually taking 5 minutes or longer to get a scant amount to go under eyes. Frustrating and after various different techniques to get container to dispense it does not. It was a good product but is worthless being inaccessible. I am having to shop for a new product altogether now.If the product were available with the normal hole in it to allow the lotion to be squeezed out, I would buy it.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Image products are quality products.</li>
