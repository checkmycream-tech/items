            <li>These are amazing</li>
            <li>The quality of the hair is fabulous and I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Amazing for those days</li>
            <li>I use reagular hair supplys on the hair and it still is amazing.</li>
            <li>You can curl, straighten, use product and do just about anything that you would do with your own hair.</li>
            <li>Makes a nice additional to add volume to your hair.</li>
            <li>Use your own judgment, though.</li>
            <li>For the most part i loved them while they lasted.</li>
            <li>i woul say these are quite nice as well.</li>
            <li>so that was a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>honestly i would never recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li>really liked the look and feel of these</li>
            <li>I thought ordering this would be a nice change on my wallet</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t pay any more, but they look good.</li>
            <li>and these are so much nicer and so great for the prince!!</li>
            <li>I feel more confident and they look great.</li>
            <li>I really liked these extensions.</li>
            <li>im kind of scared wearing them out of the house</li>
            <li>i love them they are a good look to have</li>
            <li>i really liked the hair</li>
            <li>I liked the product.</li>
            <li>Shipped quick, they are beautiful</li>
            <li>She liked them &amp; said they were easy to use!</li>
            <li>It came in very quick, and I was suprised with how good the condition of the hair was.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super happy .</li>
            <li>Alright, so I have shoulder length hair and was wondering if I could get extensions for cheap, but still have them look good.</li>
            <li>The color is perfect and the hair is soft.</li>
            <li>They came more than a week of the estimated delivery time and they were very soft and the perfect color and length.</li>
            <li>The hair is also very fine.</li>
            <li>I wish they were thicker but they really are awesome and cheap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Probably more suitable for girls with thinner</li>
            <li>This was my first evet pair of extensions and I can&#x27;t say that they&#x27;re all that great.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m pretty happy</li>
            <li>The color is pretty and the extensions are a great value for the buck.</li>
            <li>Thinner than I had anticipated, which would be ok on someone like me who has very fine hair.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very comfortable an</li>
            <li>They were very nice the first week but</li>
            <li>They matched my hair perfectly , they were soft and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>its okay for a quick fix when you don&#x27;t have the money for the good stuff</li>
            <li>I bought extentions for the first time and these are super easy to use, the color and texture is perfect.</li>
            <li>I would buy these again :)</li>
            <li>and I was able to curl it.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>Love love love them.....</li>
            <li>just placed an order for more  :)</li>
            <li>They took awhile to deliver, but since they came from overseas I guess it took the appropriate time.?</li>
            <li>I love mine</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m so satisfied with them</li>
            <li>Bought a better make and threw these in the trash.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more if needed.</li>
            <li>Love the product</li>
            <li>all in all not a terrible product</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are wonderful quality and definitely do not have a lot of hairs falling out.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>and it was okay,</li>
            <li>So I noticed MOST RATINGS ARE A 3 MEANING</li>
            <li>I read all of the reviews before purchasing this item, so I made sure to order 2 sets.</li>
            <li>I would get two or go with 120g!!! :-)</li>
            <li>Makes my hair look 10 times fully and better.</li>
            <li>I love the extensions.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>and I would buy again :)</li>
            <li>and they were a lot better.</li>
            <li>Well, These extensions got me prepared to want better ones.</li>
            <li>I just wish there was more hair.</li>
            <li>love them no one can tell I have them in&lt;br</li>
            <li>and i love that i can curl or straighten them</li>
            <li>and i just love them.</li>
            <li>Love my hair extensions need to buy some more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say if you buy 2 packs you&#x27;d be ok.</li>
            <li>But u get what u pay for :)</li>
            <li>Plus you get more extensions.</li>
            <li>so you get more bang for your buck per strand/clip.</li>
            <li>Also the customer support is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to a friend :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK when I have it curled</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll buy better ones</li>
            <li>love the length.</li>
            <li>it helps to have unwashed hair &amp; tease your roots when using them :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;d be better to just go to some from a beauty supply place.</li>
            <li>i love um</li>
            <li>Ok so I haven&#x27;t opened them yet.</li>
            <li>For my daughter and her love of hair extensions, Daddy will gift what she has picked out in advance via Amazon and then forward link to email to buy the correct birthday gift.-)</li>
            <li>They were cheap too !</li>
            <li>I read in the reviews to get more than 1, and I ordered 2.&lt;br /&gt;Cons.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m planning on wearing them to prom as well :)</li>
            <li>I feel like a lot of people don&#x27;t understand that with most extensions you need two packs.</li>
            <li>I love it, I dont even feel them.</li>
            <li>more like 10&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>The color is more of a #4 than a #2.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you condition it, after you dye it.  </li>
            <li>I will buy more from this seller.</li>
            <li>Also it has to many clips with no hair....</li>
            <li>The more you buy the better.</li>
            <li>If they make it to 6 months, I&#x27;ll buy another set for sure:)</li>
            <li>I absolutely love them, and wear them almost every day.  </li>
            <li>I think that product was okay just because I used it one time.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>The color is perfect and I can curl them, straighten them, and they look totally natural!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would deffenly recommend it :)</li>
            <li>Shipped fast and color was prefect!!!!</li>
            <li>Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Long, fast shipping, true to color, good price, good to wear for a wedding, occasion or something along those lines&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this product is definitely ideally for super pin straight hair.</li>
            <li>The seller had good communication willing to return which is why I&#x27;m giving some stars...</li>
            <li>Great for straight / fine hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with them they&#x27;re the right length, and color</li>
            <li>are good extensions, although they only look good curly because my hairs thicker.</li>
            <li>Yes it is about 75% human hair, but it is very good hair.  </li>
            <li>soft and a great length</li>
            <li>but overall with two sets, they look beautiful and i like them :)</li>
            <li>However, they were very inexpensive and look good on.</li>
            <li>they tangle so easily and the hair falls out.</li>
            <li>So easy to clip on.</li>
            <li>Good starter extensions, cheap, fast shipping, but not the quality I wanted.</li>
            <li>And she even said how easy they are to work</li>
            <li>Yes there is only 70g of hair, it&#x27;s great for giving you that fullness and body that most want.</li>
            <li>So I put them in easily</li>
            <li>lol :)  overall  </li>
            <li>They never got knotty and were really easy to take out when I was done using them.</li>
            <li>They Looked Beautiful at First, then its like they stopped being like real hair like they was synthetic</li>
            <li>Easy to put in and clips didn&#x27;t get tangled in my hair while taking out.</li>
            <li>Easy to style, put in and even dye.</li>
            <li>they fried way to easily and the clips broke on almost all of them.</li>
            <li>These clip-ons are pretty nice.  </li>
            <li>perfect color , dark brown matches my priginal hair color.</li>
            <li>But these ones will be nice at first</li>
            <li>A fair price considering it was real soft shiney hair.</li>
            <li>When I was looking for extensions, I purposefully searched for some with reviews complaining about thinness because my hair is so fine.</li>
            <li>, so they work just fine.</li>
            <li>then it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>on.&lt;br /&gt;I think the picture looks a little darker than they are, and I was prepared to dye my hair one shade darker, but they match excellently.</li>
            <li>Like many others said it is a good idea to buy two sets because the hair is fine, but even after buying two its still much cheaper than buying real hair extensions anywhere else.</li>
            <li>Great for if you want to add extra length to your hair</li>
            <li>These extentions I used just about everyday they are excellent !!</li>
            <li>I ordered also they curl nicely and look real.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a light brown</li>
            <li>They are great especially for the price.</li>
            <li>The extra clips were great too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great way to change up my short hair anytime I want!</li>
            <li>the hair does great when worn on occasions (1/4 wks a month) and can last up to 4months...</li>
            <li>Real hair looks amazing. . .</li>
            <li>They are cheaply sewn together.</li>
            <li>They are cheap.</li>
            <li>The clips are secure &amp; extras are provided, as well.  </li>
            <li>smooth</li>
            <li>then that it was fabulous</li>
            <li>BUT if you buy two sets like i did and you double them up as you layer them into your head, and it makes your hair much thicker, they blend perfectly, and you even add some length.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more if need be from this company!!</li>
            <li>Looks beautiful and natural, east to maintain, doesn&#x27;t get tangled fast.</li>
            <li>They look natural and very healthy</li>
            <li>I was so excited for these extensions to come in when I ordered them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty pleased with mine.</li>
            <li>But for fifty dollars for two packs totally worth it!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much! :)</li>
            <li>So when I ordered these I was sooo excited.</li>
            <li>I got them out and was excited to put them in.</li>
            <li>BUT for the price you pay it is well worth it!</li>
            <li>Ok, I&#x27;ll say the pros first.</li>
            <li>Lets start with the good  first : Super fast delivery.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re obviously not the greatest quality in hair extension land, but for the price, you certainly canNOT go wrong &amp; they look wonderful! :)</li>
            <li>Overall the hair extensions are amazing, I love them.</li>
            <li>kind of stringy, really made for super straight hair, wasn&#x27;t really able to curl but still used them.</li>
            <li>and I received a medium brown but product is amazing perfect for people who have thin hair like me, the hair is really remy</li>
            <li>They are the exact same color of my hair and look so great</li>
            <li>want full quality.</li>
            <li>they look better (real) curled or crimped.</li>
            <li>good quality hair but not enough BUY TWO.</li>
            <li>Only con: The extensions took a good two weeks to come in.</li>
            <li>She said that&#x27;s the true test.</li>
            <li>Good thing I only paid 20 dollars for them.</li>
            <li>The hair is really nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>Such a good deal for $20.</li>
            <li>also there is too many clips for your hair and the tracks are very noticable.</li>
            <li>My hair does feel full on my head but the ends of the extensions suck.</li>
            <li>Feels like real hair will be buying more.</li>
            <li>All my clips have stayed in place, but it is good to know that they sent extra clips just in case.  </li>
            <li>I received these hair extensions early which is always nice.</li>
            <li>I read countless reviews on these extensions and just wanted to believe all the good things I read about them.</li>
            <li>The hair is not as full as the picture makes it appear.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair Full</li>
            <li>instead pf saying full extensions</li>
            <li>it was a exact match to my daughters hair easy to put in and take out</li>
            <li>The delivery is always quick and on time with Amazon.</li>
            <li>I got lucky, they just make my hair look highlighted.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s definitely worth spending the extra cash to get good ones instead of these rip-offs.</li>
            <li>Lucky for me</li>
            <li>I received my extensions yesterday and yes they did get to me fairly quick</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this product, I will definitely be purchasing from them again.</li>
            <li>The hair came in really quick.</li>
            <li>I just reordered another color very nice fills in nicely if you have thin hair</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>Also, keep in mind that the natural hair in these extensions is very fine.</li>
            <li>I am new at extensions when I fully figure them out and become a pro all the better.</li>
            <li>Also Dark brown #2 is more of a light brown with slightly redish tent (which matched my hair perfectly).</li>
            <li>These extensions look real and clip in easily.  </li>
            <li>I have never used clip-in extensions before, but these are so gentle on my scalp and easy to put in</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>I can be ready in 10 minutes!!  </li>
            <li>I found myself checking my head constantly (I do have very fine straight hair, in the inanimate objects defense) to see if they were sliding out and most of the time they were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do got to say that these extensions are great if you need a little length and thickness.</li>
            <li>I use them everyday, i straighten them n curl them and looks great either way</li>
            <li>Perfect for someone with thin hair trying to add length and volume.  </li>
            <li>but I think its worth what you pay for.</li>
            <li>So, for what I paid they are worth it</li>
            <li>Good but not what I expected.</li>
            <li>For the amount I payed it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Overall, I really enjoy them :)</li>
            <li>Well worth my money and beyond.  </li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and delivered exactly what was promised in the description for the hair extensions.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping also!</li>
            <li>And also weren&#x27;t the right color.</li>
            <li>And also weren&#x27;t the right length.</li>
            <li>The hair coloring is right.</li>
            <li>I have dark brown hair with very blonde highlights and when placed correctly the extensions match perfectly!</li>
            <li>If you have really short hair, I would recommend getting more packs if you want the ends to look full.  </li>
            <li>it looses life very easily, even with proper care (within 2 months).</li>
            <li>Make sure you inspect them and clean them before styling, I got a bit of glue on my flat iron.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll treat it like my own hair and just wash / condition / air dry as needed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i highly recommend these if you want good, long hair!</li>
            <li>Definitely would recommend if you&#x27;re willing to try clip ins for the first time! :)</li>
            <li>True to length, very easy to apply, &amp; blends extremely well with my shoulder-length hair.  </li>
            <li>It was super fast shipping, and at first the delivery was supposed to be tomorrow</li>
            <li>Very fast.</li>
            <li>It looks very natural!!!</li>
            <li>would rate this seller higher then 5 stars if I could!!!!!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most of the clips fell off, and I had to sew them back in.</li>
            <li>I would need double the amount of hair, but the problem is there would be too many clips for the amount of hair.</li>
            <li>It was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Overall, I would buy some more.</li>
            <li>Have no problems using hot tools on them.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>This was my first time using clip ins</li>
            <li>but they definitely inspired me to purchase a better brand.</li>
            <li>Matches exactly to mine</li>
            <li>they are the first extensions I buy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly my colour and</li>
            <li>DO NOT buy these, i&#x27;d sure like my money back.</li>
            <li>The color looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend them!!</li>
            <li>I put these in and my whole attitude changed!</li>
            <li>First off I ordered them in the end of January</li>
            <li>so those who plan on buying something from this seller rethink your decision because you will most likely not get anything after all .  !</li>
            <li>Did not feel like real hair!  </li>
            <li>Like ot alot, I got exactly what the description says.</li>
            <li>This is my first time wearing extensions and</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: 3 months later...</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>The shipping was fast!  </li>
            <li>but you&#x27;d need a few packs to make it look good.</li>
            <li>Only downside is although it does give your hair more volume, don&#x27;t expect to much.</li>
            <li>I wash them every 2-3 days that I wear them, and they are still super silky and soft!</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>They also get very stringy looking after the first wash, so you have to brush them, A LOT, for them to look real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also they shipp pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Ordering 2 may suffice and you may be able to pull off the long hair.</li>
            <li>I just had to go back and buy another pack to they looked more realistic.</li>
            <li>, i didnt expect them to be here as soon as they were, seriously took 3 to 4 days not bad at all, such a good product for so cheap, thanks</li>
            <li>when you see 7 pcs you think it would be good enough for one set, and would give u the long hair you want</li>
            <li>I usually blend them with the other extensions I have and when blended they look great!</li>
            <li>This was a very great buy, I had to buy two pack because my hair is super short and thick so one pack was not enough.</li>
            <li>Hair is noting to mess with, order right, invest in better quality.</li>
            <li>They are great if you have thin hair like I do.</li>
            <li>Everyone thinks its my real hair</li>
            <li>I just received the product today, is very thinn hair</li>
            <li>I was very displeased.</li>
            <li>I have another set of extensions that are real hair</li>
            <li>I would say that you should buy two packs if you want to add hair to your whole head.&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li>Aside from the fact I do not believe they are entirely real hair, because when I straigntened them some hairs shriveled up like it was plastic.</li>
            <li>Over all u shld be very cautious buying these, they are not as they seem.</li>
            <li>The clips have the silicone strip and stay put very well.</li>
            <li>and they don&#x27;t shed much</li>
            <li>i bought some cheaper ones that are made of real hair too for $5 here on amazon</li>
            <li>not as much length as i was expecting since they are 18&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very upset.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>i just dont like how they get tangled so much.</li>
            <li>I Really Thought Twice About Ordering These Extensions ...</li>
            <li>So let me start off that I don&#x27;t go out of my way to review much of anything.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for $20.</li>
            <li>They are much thicker than the ones from Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>, totally doesn&#x27;t fit the description they give.</li>
            <li>Way too much auburn/redishness in this for my hair which had none of that.  </li>
            <li>It was only 50 bucks for two packs and free shipping</li>
            <li>There are others out there that are MUCH thicker</li>
            <li>I requested a refund and it was very prompt.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Both hair clips were real hair extensions &amp; both came in time.</li>
            <li>Real hair,</li>
            <li>The ends are very sparce, i had to cut off an inch so</li>
            <li>i am very upset</li>
            <li>The package came quite fast, faster than I thought they would.</li>
            <li>regret the purchase, wishing I had spent more money for quality hair.</li>
            <li>They shipped in fast which is another plus.</li>
            <li>This is great for people who have thin hair with no volume, I have alot of hair</li>
            <li>I really like mine</li>
            <li>I was very concerned about the price and whether or not this hair would be a waist of money.  </li>
            <li>Also, the color is very deceiving.  </li>
            <li>They are real hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;clips are difficult/painful, very thin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, the clips really pull at your hair so I don&#x27;t recommend wearing them often.</li>
            <li>These hair extensions are really made up of thinned hair.</li>
            <li>So I blended as much as I could</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t look like much, but when you put them in, it truly does give you a lot of length and volume.</li>
            <li>But when you clip them in, they really are not thin at all.</li>
            <li>the description never how much hair it was.</li>
            <li>it doesnt because this hair is so thin that the 7 pcs look like literally one thread of my hair lol</li>
            <li>I saw negative reviews and good reviews</li>
            <li>The hair is thin and very realistic in the fact that it comes with its very own split ends.</li>
            <li>they stopped blending with my own hair, and they got stiff and stuff..</li>
            <li>They were super thin and dangly at the bottom, luckily my hair is more on the thinner side</li>
            <li>I also tried flat ironing and everything went smoothly.</li>
            <li>The hair is pretty soft!</li>
            <li>It feels real and looks real, but it super thin and kind of spacey.</li>
            <li>Regardless I would still use the hair and it blends in just fine (although not as long as I was led to believe).</li>
            <li>The color is good and it looks nice, but my 16-yo daughter was a litte disappointed.</li>
            <li>Looks very natural, because it is not bone straight you can make it blend very well.  </li>
            <li>I purchased a dark brown, as was labeled on the package upon delivery, however it was more of a light/medium brown color with reddish tones and did not match my haircolor.</li>
            <li>I read many reviews, bot bad and good about this hair.  </li>
            <li>They clearly don&#x27;t know much about hair extensions and how much they go for.</li>
            <li>2 packs of hair was more than enough for me to cover my entire head.  </li>
            <li>i was very surprised when i got these by how much hair truly came with.</li>
            <li>They seemed thin (which they kind of are) and i worried they wouldn&#x27;t look right.</li>
            <li>I would recommend buying some heat resistant high quality synthetic extensions instead though.</li>
            <li>I had really high hopes for these.</li>
            <li>Wow!!</li>
            <li>I expected the quality to be average due to the cost but to my surprise the extensions were an excellent quality.</li>
            <li>I rated this a 2 because the hair is soft and real looking.</li>
            <li>If you want a more fuller look you should order a few packs of these or order the 100 grams.</li>
            <li>I just use normal shampoo and conditioner on it, but you can get extension-made stuff if preferred.</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t get them more use then a few days</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s normal</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know what these people who wrote the negative comments were expecting?</li>
            <li>wish i would of looked into it more before i wasted my money.</li>
            <li>its so thin, that i dont think it would look good on anyone&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>they were thin but they look good shorter.</li>
            <li>Do  NOT buy these if u have shorter hair trying to make it look long, it might b ok just used for a little bit of a filler but just don&#x27;t expect much!!</li>
            <li>They Are The Right Color &amp;&amp; They ARE REAL Human Hair !</li>
            <li>and you can notice them easily , don&#x27;t buy them , there not worth it</li>
            <li>I contatced the seller to see if they would send me a new package.</li>
            <li>They last longer, look eay nicer and you get more bang for your buck, but if you want something inexpensive for minimal wear</li>
            <li>The hair is very soft.</li>
            <li>Its very soft and silky.</li>
            <li>The quality of the hair itself is very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I got light brown hair instead of dark brown hair.</li>
            <li>i was so excited to get my extentions, i had order them in the brown color and my surprise was that i got a totally diffrent color, igot hash blonde!!!!</li>
            <li>I brought dark brown alittle too light not a problem</li>
            <li>I have thin hair, so having an exta umph just makes me feel very confident.</li>
            <li>They are the exact color I needed and add enough volume to the hair.</li>
            <li>However, each piece was not as full as we expected.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this set for those seeking a bit of extra volume in certain areas.</li>
            <li>Very few people would be able to use these extensions...</li>
            <li>They naturally have a little bit of a wave to it, which is fine for me, but maybe not for someone else.</li>
            <li>PLZ make the CLIP little smaller &amp; more stronger.</li>
            <li>lol since im afraid they will be noticeable</li>
            <li>My daughter was surprised that the color and quality was what she was looking for</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>and they are so soft</li>
            <li>The only downside is that I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s real hair</li>
            <li>and they return back to being straight</li>
            <li>Do not waste your time or money making this purchase.</li>
            <li>These hair extensions were a bit lighter than my natural hair color</li>
            <li>I only straighten them when absolutely nessacery.</li>
            <li>The hair is soft and curls well.</li>
            <li>suggest washing it every week with shampoo only, be gentle when you brush them&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They are very similar to Sallys Beauty Supply ones, maybe just a bit thinner but not by much.</li>
            <li>I had extensions in as it was much thinner than my actual hair.</li>
            <li>I ordered abHair Real In Remy Human Hair Extensions as well &amp;</li>
            <li>Color is natural medium to darker brown.</li>
            <li>But then I started layering the pieces in my hair, and WOW, what a difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve dyed them to my hair color, and also have brought them to my hair dresser, to clip in and cut my hair to make them look natural.</li>
            <li>so i was surprised</li>
            <li>natural</li>
            <li>I now stand by ordering the more expensive brands in hair because they are really worth it.</li>
            <li>Because my hair is thin, 1 pack was good enough.  </li>
            <li>way too thin, couldn&#x27;t even make it look like my own hair.</li>
            <li>at this point, i&#x27;d rather just buy good quality expensive ones.</li>
            <li>So if thick look is what you are looking for you may need more than just the 7 pieces.</li>
            <li>Its nice hair just really thin</li>
            <li>but they did not blend with my natural hair, especially since my main area of concern was the clips being visible.</li>
            <li>Super super thin</li>
            <li>The top of the extensions have a decent amount of hair but as you get toward the bottom, it becomes horrifically thin.</li>
            <li>And matched my own hair identically, even down to the small high lights threw out it.</li>
            <li>Terrific high lights in my natural hair.</li>
            <li>The main thing it was human hair</li>
            <li>Ordered Dark Brown - After waiting weeks I received ... light red???</li>
            <li>THEY THINK THEY ARE OKAY NOT GOOD.</li>
            <li>I can say that the hair is not thick enough for my hair, however I knew that from the reviews, so i ordered 2 packs of hair.  </li>
            <li>They do straighten...but be careful how hot your straightener is...</li>
            <li>I tried to dye it because the color was not dark brown.</li>
            <li>They are exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>It had a dead head lice bug in the hair, and the hair was full of split ends.</li>
            <li>Hair is very fine, silky thin hair.</li>
            <li>Dry Shampoo and gentle combing.</li>
            <li>but this the extensions my hair looks fuller and comes down right below my chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Earlier Then Expected , I Give This Product 5 Stars Because They Are The Right Length ..</li>
            <li>The color was not a very dark brown.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased when my shipment was in 3 weeks before the due date, yes many will complain they are a little thin</li>
            <li>The hair is clearly synthetic, I could tell the second I touched it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used one so far.</li>
            <li>Dark brown was more of a dark reddish blonde.</li>
            <li>The hair was thin and a lighter color than the description, but was able to blend with my hair and received a lot of compliments.  </li>
            <li>Thin hair on the ends OK for price but not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>I wont say that I have seen worse, but I&#x27;m sure there is.</li>
            <li>Okay, so like everyone else has mentioned, they are thin.</li>
            <li>with time i noticed their kind of flat and have manyyyyy split ends it makes my hair look messy and uneven....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently a cosmetology student and thought they would be fun to mess around with.</li>
            <li>For someone with really think hair, this helped but if you&#x27;re looking for extreme volume, this is prob not for you.</li>
            <li>so I would have to order two instead of one but other than that I dyed it and straight iron it</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want to put too much hair on your head, because it will be too thick and not look real.  </li>
            <li>They come in several separate little pieces which make them seem skimpy but they look great once in the hair and because they come in such small pieces, the weight is so little that you barely know you have them in.</li>
            <li>did order a second set I am going to cut to make them blend better because my hair is so short and thin.</li>
            <li>Shipping took a little long but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Other then that the hair was decent for the price.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product, it was very fast shipping and the extensions came with a few extra clips.  </li>
            <li>The hair is thin and breaks easily.</li>
            <li>Although, I did trim them just a little, they didn&#x27;t need much.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so little hair that there is no possible way it would ever look real on ANYONE.</li>

            <li> Amazing for those days</li>
            <li> I use reagular hair supplys on the hair and it still is amazing.</li>
            <li> You can curl, straighten, use product and do just about anything that you would do with your own hair.</li>
            <li> Makes a nice additional to add volume to your hair.</li>
            <li> Use your own judgment, though.</li>
            <li> For the most part i loved them while they lasted.</li>
            <li> i woul say these are quite nice as well.</li>
            <li> so that was a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> honestly i would never recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> really liked the look and feel of these</li>
            <li> I thought ordering this would be a nice change on my wallet</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t pay any more, but they look good.</li>
            <li> and these are so much nicer and so great for the prince!!</li>
            <li> I feel more confident and they look great.</li>
            <li> I really liked these extensions.</li>
            <li> im kind of scared wearing them out of the house</li>
            <li> i love them they are a good look to have</li>
            <li> i really liked the hair</li>
            <li> I liked the product.</li>
            <li> Shipped quick, they are beautiful</li>
            <li> She liked them &amp; said they were easy to use!</li>
            <li> It came in very quick, and I was suprised with how good the condition of the hair was.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super happy .</li>
            <li> Alright, so I have shoulder length hair and was wondering if I could get extensions for cheap, but still have them look good.</li>
            <li> The color is perfect and the hair is soft.</li>
            <li> They came more than a week of the estimated delivery time and they were very soft and the perfect color and length.</li>
            <li> The hair is also very fine.</li>
            <li> I wish they were thicker but they really are awesome and cheap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Probably more suitable for girls with thinner</li>
            <li> This was my first evet pair of extensions and I can&#x27;t say that they&#x27;re all that great.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m pretty happy</li>
            <li> The color is pretty and the extensions are a great value for the buck.</li>
            <li> Thinner than I had anticipated, which would be ok on someone like me who has very fine hair.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very comfortable an</li>
            <li> They were very nice the first week but</li>
            <li> They matched my hair perfectly , they were soft and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> its okay for a quick fix when you don&#x27;t have the money for the good stuff</li>
            <li> I bought extentions for the first time and these are super easy to use, the color and texture is perfect.</li>
            <li> I would buy these again :)</li>
            <li> and I was able to curl it.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> Love love love them.....</li>
            <li> just placed an order for more  :)</li>
            <li> They took awhile to deliver, but since they came from overseas I guess it took the appropriate time.?</li>
            <li> I love mine</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m so satisfied with them</li>
            <li> Bought a better make and threw these in the trash.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more if needed.</li>
            <li> Love the product</li>
            <li> all in all not a terrible product</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are wonderful quality and definitely do not have a lot of hairs falling out.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> and it was okay,</li>
            <li> So I noticed MOST RATINGS ARE A 3 MEANING</li>
            <li> I read all of the reviews before purchasing this item, so I made sure to order 2 sets.</li>
            <li> I would get two or go with 120g!!! :-)</li>
            <li> Makes my hair look 10 times fully and better.</li>
            <li> I love the extensions.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> and I would buy again :)</li>
            <li> and they were a lot better.</li>
            <li> Well, These extensions got me prepared to want better ones.</li>
            <li> I just wish there was more hair.</li>
            <li> love them no one can tell I have them in&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i love that i can curl or straighten them</li>
            <li> and i just love them.</li>
            <li> Love my hair extensions need to buy some more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say if you buy 2 packs you&#x27;d be ok.</li>
            <li> But u get what u pay for :)</li>
            <li> Plus you get more extensions.</li>
            <li> so you get more bang for your buck per strand/clip.</li>
            <li> Also the customer support is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to a friend :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK when I have it curled</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy better ones</li>
            <li> love the length.</li>
            <li> it helps to have unwashed hair &amp; tease your roots when using them :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;d be better to just go to some from a beauty supply place.</li>
            <li> i love um</li>
            <li> Ok so I haven&#x27;t opened them yet.</li>
            <li> For my daughter and her love of hair extensions, Daddy will gift what she has picked out in advance via Amazon and then forward link to email to buy the correct birthday gift.-)</li>
            <li> They were cheap too !</li>
            <li> I read in the reviews to get more than 1, and I ordered 2.&lt;br /&gt;Cons.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning on wearing them to prom as well :)</li>
            <li> I feel like a lot of people don&#x27;t understand that with most extensions you need two packs.</li>
            <li> I love it, I dont even feel them.</li>
            <li> more like 10&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> The color is more of a #4 than a #2.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure you condition it, after you dye it.  </li>
            <li> I will buy more from this seller.</li>
            <li> Also it has to many clips with no hair....</li>
            <li> The more you buy the better.</li>
            <li> If they make it to 6 months, I&#x27;ll buy another set for sure:)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love them, and wear them almost every day.  </li>
            <li> I think that product was okay just because I used it one time.</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> The color is perfect and I can curl them, straighten them, and they look totally natural!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would deffenly recommend it :)</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and color was prefect!!!!</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Long, fast shipping, true to color, good price, good to wear for a wedding, occasion or something along those lines&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this product is definitely ideally for super pin straight hair.</li>
            <li> The seller had good communication willing to return which is why I&#x27;m giving some stars...</li>
            <li> Great for straight / fine hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with them they&#x27;re the right length, and color</li>
            <li> are good extensions, although they only look good curly because my hairs thicker.</li>
            <li> Yes it is about 75% human hair, but it is very good hair.  </li>
            <li> soft and a great length</li>
            <li> but overall with two sets, they look beautiful and i like them :)</li>
            <li> However, they were very inexpensive and look good on.</li>
            <li> they tangle so easily and the hair falls out.</li>
            <li> So easy to clip on.</li>
            <li> Good starter extensions, cheap, fast shipping, but not the quality I wanted.</li>
            <li> And she even said how easy they are to work</li>
            <li> Yes there is only 70g of hair, it&#x27;s great for giving you that fullness and body that most want.</li>
            <li> So I put them in easily</li>
            <li> lol :)  overall  </li>
            <li> They never got knotty and were really easy to take out when I was done using them.</li>
            <li> They Looked Beautiful at First, then its like they stopped being like real hair like they was synthetic</li>
            <li> Easy to put in and clips didn&#x27;t get tangled in my hair while taking out.</li>
            <li> Easy to style, put in and even dye.</li>
            <li> they fried way to easily and the clips broke on almost all of them.</li>
            <li> These clip-ons are pretty nice.  </li>
            <li> perfect color , dark brown matches my priginal hair color.</li>
            <li> But these ones will be nice at first</li>
            <li> A fair price considering it was real soft shiney hair.</li>
            <li> When I was looking for extensions, I purposefully searched for some with reviews complaining about thinness because my hair is so fine.</li>
            <li> , so they work just fine.</li>
            <li> then it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> on.&lt;br /&gt;I think the picture looks a little darker than they are, and I was prepared to dye my hair one shade darker, but they match excellently.</li>
            <li> Like many others said it is a good idea to buy two sets because the hair is fine, but even after buying two its still much cheaper than buying real hair extensions anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Great for if you want to add extra length to your hair</li>
            <li> These extentions I used just about everyday they are excellent !!</li>
            <li> I ordered also they curl nicely and look real.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a light brown</li>
            <li> They are great especially for the price.</li>
            <li> The extra clips were great too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great way to change up my short hair anytime I want!</li>
            <li> the hair does great when worn on occasions (1/4 wks a month) and can last up to 4months...</li>
            <li> Real hair looks amazing. . .</li>
            <li> They are cheaply sewn together.</li>
            <li> They are cheap.</li>
            <li> The clips are secure &amp; extras are provided, as well.  </li>
            <li> smooth</li>
            <li> then that it was fabulous</li>
            <li> BUT if you buy two sets like i did and you double them up as you layer them into your head, and it makes your hair much thicker, they blend perfectly, and you even add some length.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more if need be from this company!!</li>
            <li> Looks beautiful and natural, east to maintain, doesn&#x27;t get tangled fast.</li>
            <li> They look natural and very healthy</li>
            <li> I was so excited for these extensions to come in when I ordered them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty pleased with mine.</li>
            <li> But for fifty dollars for two packs totally worth it!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much! :)</li>
            <li> So when I ordered these I was sooo excited.</li>
            <li> I got them out and was excited to put them in.</li>
            <li> BUT for the price you pay it is well worth it!</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;ll say the pros first.</li>
            <li> Lets start with the good  first : Super fast delivery.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re obviously not the greatest quality in hair extension land, but for the price, you certainly canNOT go wrong &amp; they look wonderful! :)</li>
            <li> Overall the hair extensions are amazing, I love them.</li>
            <li> kind of stringy, really made for super straight hair, wasn&#x27;t really able to curl but still used them.</li>
            <li> and I received a medium brown but product is amazing perfect for people who have thin hair like me, the hair is really remy</li>
            <li> They are the exact same color of my hair and look so great</li>
            <li> want full quality.</li>
            <li> they look better (real) curled or crimped.</li>
            <li> good quality hair but not enough BUY TWO.</li>
            <li> Only con: The extensions took a good two weeks to come in.</li>
            <li> She said that&#x27;s the true test.</li>
            <li> Good thing I only paid 20 dollars for them.</li>
            <li> The hair is really nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> Such a good deal for $20.</li>
            <li> also there is too many clips for your hair and the tracks are very noticable.</li>
            <li> My hair does feel full on my head but the ends of the extensions suck.</li>
            <li> Feels like real hair will be buying more.</li>
            <li> All my clips have stayed in place, but it is good to know that they sent extra clips just in case.  </li>
            <li> I received these hair extensions early which is always nice.</li>
            <li> I read countless reviews on these extensions and just wanted to believe all the good things I read about them.</li>
            <li> The hair is not as full as the picture makes it appear.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair Full</li>
            <li> instead pf saying full extensions</li>
            <li> it was a exact match to my daughters hair easy to put in and take out</li>
            <li> The delivery is always quick and on time with Amazon.</li>
            <li> I got lucky, they just make my hair look highlighted.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s definitely worth spending the extra cash to get good ones instead of these rip-offs.</li>
            <li> Lucky for me</li>
            <li> I received my extensions yesterday and yes they did get to me fairly quick</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this product, I will definitely be purchasing from them again.</li>
            <li> The hair came in really quick.</li>
            <li> I just reordered another color very nice fills in nicely if you have thin hair</li>
            <li> Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> Also, keep in mind that the natural hair in these extensions is very fine.</li>
            <li> I am new at extensions when I fully figure them out and become a pro all the better.</li>
            <li> Also Dark brown #2 is more of a light brown with slightly redish tent (which matched my hair perfectly).</li>
            <li> These extensions look real and clip in easily.  </li>
            <li> I have never used clip-in extensions before, but these are so gentle on my scalp and easy to put in</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I can be ready in 10 minutes!!  </li>
            <li> I found myself checking my head constantly (I do have very fine straight hair, in the inanimate objects defense) to see if they were sliding out and most of the time they were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do got to say that these extensions are great if you need a little length and thickness.</li>
            <li> I use them everyday, i straighten them n curl them and looks great either way</li>
            <li> Perfect for someone with thin hair trying to add length and volume.  </li>
            <li> but I think its worth what you pay for.</li>
            <li> So, for what I paid they are worth it</li>
            <li> Good but not what I expected.</li>
            <li> For the amount I payed it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Overall, I really enjoy them :)</li>
            <li> Well worth my money and beyond.  </li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and delivered exactly what was promised in the description for the hair extensions.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping also!</li>
            <li> And also weren&#x27;t the right color.</li>
            <li> And also weren&#x27;t the right length.</li>
            <li> The hair coloring is right.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair with very blonde highlights and when placed correctly the extensions match perfectly!</li>
            <li> If you have really short hair, I would recommend getting more packs if you want the ends to look full.  </li>
            <li> it looses life very easily, even with proper care (within 2 months).</li>
            <li> Make sure you inspect them and clean them before styling, I got a bit of glue on my flat iron.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll treat it like my own hair and just wash / condition / air dry as needed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i highly recommend these if you want good, long hair!</li>
            <li> Definitely would recommend if you&#x27;re willing to try clip ins for the first time! :)</li>
            <li> True to length, very easy to apply, &amp; blends extremely well with my shoulder-length hair.  </li>
            <li> It was super fast shipping, and at first the delivery was supposed to be tomorrow</li>
            <li> Very fast.</li>
            <li> It looks very natural!!!</li>
            <li> would rate this seller higher then 5 stars if I could!!!!!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most of the clips fell off, and I had to sew them back in.</li>
            <li> I would need double the amount of hair, but the problem is there would be too many clips for the amount of hair.</li>
            <li> It was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would buy some more.</li>
            <li> Have no problems using hot tools on them.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> This was my first time using clip ins</li>
            <li> but they definitely inspired me to purchase a better brand.</li>
            <li> Matches exactly to mine</li>
            <li> they are the first extensions I buy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly my colour and</li>
            <li> DO NOT buy these, i&#x27;d sure like my money back.</li>
            <li> The color looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY recommend them!!</li>
            <li> I put these in and my whole attitude changed!</li>
            <li> First off I ordered them in the end of January</li>
            <li> so those who plan on buying something from this seller rethink your decision because you will most likely not get anything after all .  !</li>
            <li> Did not feel like real hair!  </li>
            <li> Like ot alot, I got exactly what the description says.</li>
            <li> This is my first time wearing extensions and</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: 3 months later...</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!  </li>
            <li> The shipping was fast!  </li>
            <li> but you&#x27;d need a few packs to make it look good.</li>
            <li> Only downside is although it does give your hair more volume, don&#x27;t expect to much.</li>
            <li> I wash them every 2-3 days that I wear them, and they are still super silky and soft!</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> They also get very stringy looking after the first wash, so you have to brush them, A LOT, for them to look real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also they shipp pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Ordering 2 may suffice and you may be able to pull off the long hair.</li>
            <li> I just had to go back and buy another pack to they looked more realistic.</li>
            <li> , i didnt expect them to be here as soon as they were, seriously took 3 to 4 days not bad at all, such a good product for so cheap, thanks</li>
            <li> when you see 7 pcs you think it would be good enough for one set, and would give u the long hair you want</li>
            <li> I usually blend them with the other extensions I have and when blended they look great!</li>
            <li> This was a very great buy, I had to buy two pack because my hair is super short and thick so one pack was not enough.</li>
            <li> Hair is noting to mess with, order right, invest in better quality.</li>
            <li> They are great if you have thin hair like I do.</li>
            <li> Everyone thinks its my real hair</li>
            <li> I just received the product today, is very thinn hair</li>
            <li> I was very displeased.</li>
            <li> I have another set of extensions that are real hair</li>
            <li> I would say that you should buy two packs if you want to add hair to your whole head.&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li> Aside from the fact I do not believe they are entirely real hair, because when I straigntened them some hairs shriveled up like it was plastic.</li>
            <li> Over all u shld be very cautious buying these, they are not as they seem.</li>
            <li> The clips have the silicone strip and stay put very well.</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t shed much</li>
            <li> i bought some cheaper ones that are made of real hair too for $5 here on amazon</li>
            <li> not as much length as i was expecting since they are 18&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very upset.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> i just dont like how they get tangled so much.</li>
            <li> I Really Thought Twice About Ordering These Extensions ...</li>
            <li> So let me start off that I don&#x27;t go out of my way to review much of anything.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for $20.</li>
            <li> They are much thicker than the ones from Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> , totally doesn&#x27;t fit the description they give.</li>
            <li> Way too much auburn/redishness in this for my hair which had none of that.  </li>
            <li> It was only 50 bucks for two packs and free shipping</li>
            <li> There are others out there that are MUCH thicker</li>
            <li> I requested a refund and it was very prompt.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Both hair clips were real hair extensions &amp; both came in time.</li>
            <li> Real hair,</li>
            <li> The ends are very sparce, i had to cut off an inch so</li>
            <li> i am very upset</li>
            <li> The package came quite fast, faster than I thought they would.</li>
            <li> regret the purchase, wishing I had spent more money for quality hair.</li>
            <li> They shipped in fast which is another plus.</li>
            <li> This is great for people who have thin hair with no volume, I have alot of hair</li>
            <li> I really like mine</li>
            <li> I was very concerned about the price and whether or not this hair would be a waist of money.  </li>
            <li> Also, the color is very deceiving.  </li>
            <li> They are real hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;clips are difficult/painful, very thin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, the clips really pull at your hair so I don&#x27;t recommend wearing them often.</li>
            <li> These hair extensions are really made up of thinned hair.</li>
            <li> So I blended as much as I could</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t look like much, but when you put them in, it truly does give you a lot of length and volume.</li>
            <li> But when you clip them in, they really are not thin at all.</li>
            <li> the description never how much hair it was.</li>
            <li> it doesnt because this hair is so thin that the 7 pcs look like literally one thread of my hair lol</li>
            <li> I saw negative reviews and good reviews</li>
            <li> The hair is thin and very realistic in the fact that it comes with its very own split ends.</li>
            <li> they stopped blending with my own hair, and they got stiff and stuff..</li>
            <li> They were super thin and dangly at the bottom, luckily my hair is more on the thinner side</li>
            <li> I also tried flat ironing and everything went smoothly.</li>
            <li> The hair is pretty soft!</li>
            <li> It feels real and looks real, but it super thin and kind of spacey.</li>
            <li> Regardless I would still use the hair and it blends in just fine (although not as long as I was led to believe).</li>
            <li> The color is good and it looks nice, but my 16-yo daughter was a litte disappointed.</li>
            <li> Looks very natural, because it is not bone straight you can make it blend very well.  </li>
            <li> I purchased a dark brown, as was labeled on the package upon delivery, however it was more of a light/medium brown color with reddish tones and did not match my haircolor.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews, bot bad and good about this hair.  </li>
            <li> They clearly don&#x27;t know much about hair extensions and how much they go for.</li>
            <li> 2 packs of hair was more than enough for me to cover my entire head.  </li>
            <li> i was very surprised when i got these by how much hair truly came with.</li>
            <li> They seemed thin (which they kind of are) and i worried they wouldn&#x27;t look right.</li>
            <li> I would recommend buying some heat resistant high quality synthetic extensions instead though.</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes for these.</li>
            <li> Wow!!</li>
            <li> I expected the quality to be average due to the cost but to my surprise the extensions were an excellent quality.</li>
            <li> I rated this a 2 because the hair is soft and real looking.</li>
            <li> If you want a more fuller look you should order a few packs of these or order the 100 grams.</li>
            <li> I just use normal shampoo and conditioner on it, but you can get extension-made stuff if preferred.</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t get them more use then a few days</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s normal</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know what these people who wrote the negative comments were expecting?</li>
            <li> wish i would of looked into it more before i wasted my money.</li>
            <li> its so thin, that i dont think it would look good on anyone&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> they were thin but they look good shorter.</li>
            <li> Do  NOT buy these if u have shorter hair trying to make it look long, it might b ok just used for a little bit of a filler but just don&#x27;t expect much!!</li>
            <li> They Are The Right Color &amp;&amp; They ARE REAL Human Hair !</li>
            <li> and you can notice them easily , don&#x27;t buy them , there not worth it</li>
            <li> I contatced the seller to see if they would send me a new package.</li>
            <li> They last longer, look eay nicer and you get more bang for your buck, but if you want something inexpensive for minimal wear</li>
            <li> The hair is very soft.</li>
            <li> Its very soft and silky.</li>
            <li> The quality of the hair itself is very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I got light brown hair instead of dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> i was so excited to get my extentions, i had order them in the brown color and my surprise was that i got a totally diffrent color, igot hash blonde!!!!</li>
            <li> I brought dark brown alittle too light not a problem</li>
            <li> I have thin hair, so having an exta umph just makes me feel very confident.</li>
            <li> They are the exact color I needed and add enough volume to the hair.</li>
            <li> However, each piece was not as full as we expected.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this set for those seeking a bit of extra volume in certain areas.</li>
            <li> Very few people would be able to use these extensions...</li>
            <li> They naturally have a little bit of a wave to it, which is fine for me, but maybe not for someone else.</li>
            <li> PLZ make the CLIP little smaller &amp; more stronger.</li>
            <li> lol since im afraid they will be noticeable</li>
            <li> My daughter was surprised that the color and quality was what she was looking for</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> and they are so soft</li>
            <li> The only downside is that I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s real hair</li>
            <li> and they return back to being straight</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time or money making this purchase.</li>
            <li> These hair extensions were a bit lighter than my natural hair color</li>
            <li> I only straighten them when absolutely nessacery.</li>
            <li> The hair is soft and curls well.</li>
            <li> suggest washing it every week with shampoo only, be gentle when you brush them&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They are very similar to Sallys Beauty Supply ones, maybe just a bit thinner but not by much.</li>
            <li> I had extensions in as it was much thinner than my actual hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered abHair Real In Remy Human Hair Extensions as well &amp;</li>
            <li> Color is natural medium to darker brown.</li>
            <li> But then I started layering the pieces in my hair, and WOW, what a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dyed them to my hair color, and also have brought them to my hair dresser, to clip in and cut my hair to make them look natural.</li>
            <li> so i was surprised</li>
            <li> natural</li>
            <li> I now stand by ordering the more expensive brands in hair because they are really worth it.</li>
            <li> Because my hair is thin, 1 pack was good enough.  </li>
            <li> way too thin, couldn&#x27;t even make it look like my own hair.</li>
            <li> at this point, i&#x27;d rather just buy good quality expensive ones.</li>
            <li> So if thick look is what you are looking for you may need more than just the 7 pieces.</li>
            <li> Its nice hair just really thin</li>
            <li> but they did not blend with my natural hair, especially since my main area of concern was the clips being visible.</li>
            <li> Super super thin</li>
            <li> The top of the extensions have a decent amount of hair but as you get toward the bottom, it becomes horrifically thin.</li>
            <li> And matched my own hair identically, even down to the small high lights threw out it.</li>
            <li> Terrific high lights in my natural hair.</li>
            <li> The main thing it was human hair</li>
            <li> Ordered Dark Brown - After waiting weeks I received ... light red???</li>
            <li> THEY THINK THEY ARE OKAY NOT GOOD.</li>
            <li> I can say that the hair is not thick enough for my hair, however I knew that from the reviews, so i ordered 2 packs of hair.  </li>
            <li> They do straighten...but be careful how hot your straightener is...</li>
            <li> I tried to dye it because the color was not dark brown.</li>
            <li> They are exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> It had a dead head lice bug in the hair, and the hair was full of split ends.</li>
            <li> Hair is very fine, silky thin hair.</li>
            <li> Dry Shampoo and gentle combing.</li>
            <li> but this the extensions my hair looks fuller and comes down right below my chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Earlier Then Expected , I Give This Product 5 Stars Because They Are The Right Length ..</li>
            <li> The color was not a very dark brown.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased when my shipment was in 3 weeks before the due date, yes many will complain they are a little thin</li>
            <li> The hair is clearly synthetic, I could tell the second I touched it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used one so far.</li>
            <li> Dark brown was more of a dark reddish blonde.</li>
            <li> The hair was thin and a lighter color than the description, but was able to blend with my hair and received a lot of compliments.  </li>
            <li> Thin hair on the ends OK for price but not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I wont say that I have seen worse, but I&#x27;m sure there is.</li>
            <li> Okay, so like everyone else has mentioned, they are thin.</li>
            <li> with time i noticed their kind of flat and have manyyyyy split ends it makes my hair look messy and uneven....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently a cosmetology student and thought they would be fun to mess around with.</li>
            <li> For someone with really think hair, this helped but if you&#x27;re looking for extreme volume, this is prob not for you.</li>
            <li> so I would have to order two instead of one but other than that I dyed it and straight iron it</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want to put too much hair on your head, because it will be too thick and not look real.  </li>
            <li> They come in several separate little pieces which make them seem skimpy but they look great once in the hair and because they come in such small pieces, the weight is so little that you barely know you have them in.</li>
            <li> did order a second set I am going to cut to make them blend better because my hair is so short and thin.</li>
            <li> Shipping took a little long but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Other then that the hair was decent for the price.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product, it was very fast shipping and the extensions came with a few extra clips.  </li>
            <li> The hair is thin and breaks easily.</li>
            <li> Although, I did trim them just a little, they didn&#x27;t need much.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so little hair that there is no possible way it would ever look real on ANYONE.</li>
            <li> Plus there&#x27;s not enough for your whole head, probably not even half !</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t even really wash them because they are&lt;br /&gt;Plastic and It makes the hair stiff.. 0/10 would not recommend</li>
            <li> They are dark and they are very soft.</li>
            <li> only down side to these extensions are that they do not straighten very well, and they are not naturally straight.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend going long and trimming if necessary.</li>
            <li> I ordered this extensions because my hair fell out after giving birth to first child and now I don&#x27;t have such a thick hair I used to have.</li>
            <li> My natural hair is pretty thin and</li>
            <li> If your hair is highlighted a lighter color and your natural is dark, buy two of each color.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long at all, felt so brittle after straightening once.</li>
            <li> If you take care of them they last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> It will not make it seem that all of a sudden your hair is long.</li>
            <li> But, because I have thin hair, it makes it difficult to look nice with my length and thickness (I look like Shirley Temple haha).</li>
            <li> is if you have thick hair order 2 packs instead ;-)</li>
            <li> The are true to lengh but they are thin.</li>
            <li> the extensions seem a little thin as well, but I don&#x27;t mind it gives my head more volume in the end either way.</li>
            <li> so as you layer up your head, placing them in, its hard to blend with your own hair because of how thin they all are.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again THIS IS FOR THIN HAIR, so don&#x27;t buy it if you have thick hair and are expecting something amazing because you won&#x27;t get it with the 70g</li>
            <li> it was a waste even if they r cheap at least send the correct color def</li>
            <li> But I actually got them earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair just below the shoulders and it was enough for my whole head.</li>
            <li> They are super thin.</li>
            <li> I will use them both, my hair is super thin.</li>
            <li> Ends were super thin</li>
            <li> The hair us super thin and if you have a lot of hair like me then one will just not work</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews, both positive and negative and knew what to expect.  </li>
            <li> these were very thin, and the hair falls out so easily.</li>
            <li> It is hard to keep them straight</li>
            <li> If you are looking for extension that would look like real you would need to order at least 3 of this&lt;br</li>
            <li> Extremely thin and my hair is not thick still they did not work me not to mention the color doesn&#x27;t look natural at all ....</li>
            <li> I just got these two def not human hair its a lie and way off on the color I orderd a dark brown and got like a brownish red wayyyyy off</li>
            <li> I went from midlength to long hair overnight and have received 3 already on them.</li>
            <li> I already have long hair</li>
            <li> Its pretty thin especially at the bottom.</li>
            <li> they werea little thin but its an easy fix.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not an exact match and my hair still is darker (but jet black would really look fake).</li>
            <li> The clips actually are hidden in my hair which is a short pixie</li>
            <li> I received it much earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> They are very thin, the ends  look horrible but they blend very easily and they are good for the price.</li>
            <li> I put it in my hair and looked real except the fact that it doesn&#x27;t completely cover the hair, it leave strands of your Hair hanging out and Just looks weird.</li>
            <li> I guess I should have expected something to be wrong with them being so cheap.</li>
            <li> you can dry the hair.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I didn&#x27;t really like was how thin the hair was</li>
            <li> , it wasnt a dark enough brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It would look pretty weird if I had a bunch of different thicknesses and textures going</li>
            <li> There was grey hair, much lighter color than I thought it would be and so thin...</li>
            <li> They came in less than 2 weeks but they were so thin they looked gross at the ends because they were not thik enought &amp;&amp; I have very thik hair.</li>
            <li> These worked so well for my wedding they gave me a little extra length and volume to pull off the style I desired</li>
            <li> I received a tiny little bundle of then hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for a year now and only a little bit of hair has fallen out.</li>
            <li> i ordered 2 packs of these extensions and the came in a little yellow envelope and inside were the two packs.</li>
            <li> You can get better one at sally&#x27;s that will cost 30$ at twelve inches which isn&#x27;t bad like at all</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really like them , there to thin</li>
            <li> and we expected it to be plenty.  </li>
            <li> OR YOU WILL FRY THEM BECAUSE IT&#x27;S NOT REAL HAIR.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not real hair.</li>
            <li> After about four months of occasional wear they started getting frizzy and uneven.</li>
            <li> I received these sooner than expected</li>
            <li> The hair is thin and has a lot of breakage and does get much thinner towards the ends.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing them for a few weeks and have dyed, curled , washed and brushed them</li>
            <li> Not real hair.</li>
            <li> Too thin, very ratty at the ends</li>
            <li> I spent 125$ at Sally&#x27;s for extensions in January</li>
            <li> Buying extensions online can be some what of a guessing game because you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re really going to get.</li>
            <li> but they got so thin so fast.</li>
            <li> Money well spent.</li>
            <li> I noticed minimal shedding and it curls well.</li>
            <li> For the price, even for 17 bucks I still don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it because they are USELESS.</li>
            <li> they were exactly as expected, though I recommend buying two packs regardless if you have thin/thickhair</li>
            <li> I was surprised at just how thin they actually were.</li>
            <li> the clips suck and are so visible on your head and the hair is so thin that id need to order 2 more and my hair is thin</li>
            <li> yeah everyone was right they are a little too thin at the ends.</li>
            <li> If the next step after this is black, then I guess there is no match for my dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> However when i finally clipped them in and styled them they were not as bad as i had originally thought.</li>
            <li> They werent thick enough, and they shred when u use the flat iron on them.</li>
            <li> It is decent hair, but too thin at the ends.</li>
            <li> Now my hair isnt paper thin but its not thick either.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected from the photo at all!</li>
            <li> so I bought two sets but other</li>
            <li> Although his English was quite poor, I was deeply touched by the letter.</li>
            <li> For 7 pc, i paid 70 % less than other places.</li>
            <li> but I asked for dark brown</li>
            <li> it was really not worth the money.</li>
            <li> My only deal breaking complaint is that the clips themselves do not stay in place.</li>
            <li> Not worth your time buying &amp; waiting.</li>
            <li> I ordered dark brown and got a brassy blonde.thank god</li>
            <li> I ordered dark brown and got a redish brown.  </li>
            <li> , take this crappy product to someone you know with dark hair.  </li>
            <li> totally not worth their price.</li>
            <li> these hair extensions were way too dark than they looked as they were posted.</li>
            <li> the hair is what is pictured &amp; I always account in my monitors being off colored (aka not calibrated), my hair is darker than this dark brown.</li>
            <li> I ordered dark brown.</li>
            <li> AGAIN NOT WORTH BUYING</li>
            <li> I purchased the ones in Dark Brown...</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair, and this wasn&#x27;t enough to  look &amp;#34;real&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> When they dried they were wavy not straight, but fuller and softer.</li>
            <li> But someone with thick hair, you would probably have to double up.</li>
            <li> I always get my underlayer of my hair thinned out anyways, because i have such thick hair.  </li>
            <li> and I still use them when I braid my hair to beef it up but not when my hair is down.</li>
            <li> so I was just going for a fuller look when I wear it down.  </li>
            <li> I am keeping it down and curling it.</li>
            <li> Not real hair!!</li>
            <li> The only complaint I had is the product was not true to color in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I trimmed them down slightly.  </li>
            <li> I have really thick short hair at the moment, and in all honesty i was a little worried when the extensions arrived.</li>
            <li> Because it is longer, the thickness of hair is going to feel less than if you were getting 12&#x27;.</li>
            <li> They are almost black.</li>
            <li> Plus your paying almost 150 less.</li>
            <li> I have not tried to curl them so it may or may not work, but normally with fake hair it ruins the extensions.</li>
            <li> Shipped in alot less time than anticipated.</li>
            <li> Received the extensions less than a week after ordering.</li>
            <li> and it melted in less then 2.5 seconds</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ridiculous that they rate these so low.</li>
            <li> The color is SLIGHTLY lighter than pictured, &amp; I also found two random colored (red &amp; blue) strands of thread/hair/</li>
            <li> but after one time of doing so they are thinner than before which seems Impossible to begin with, if u have very thin hair than these are for you otherwise, spend the extra money on better quality</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;prime\\&quot; was not true as it took almost a week to arrive.  </li>
            <li> They r paper thin barely any hair on them.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t thick, so if you have hair this long</li>
            <li> I needed them for my senior prom last year, but unfortunately they took too long to come in</li>
            <li> BUT I did receive a little something with it.</li>
            <li> Some clips were damaged, and hair doesn&#x27;t seem real due to reaction when washed.</li>
            <li> so its a little bit of a difficultyto hide them</li>
            <li> I think when the little hair on them looks deceiving.</li>
            <li> These extensions are thin as mentioned in previous reviews so if you are using for length only then I suggest buying two.</li>
            <li> and I used them literally everyday.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> what  waste.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy it - you will waste your $.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thin hair, so I only use 5 of the 7 clips.</li>
            <li> But everyday use I don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and its above my shoulders</li>
            <li> Just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> They look so thin and like this tiny strip of hair.</li>
            <li> They were all uneven in length, they weren&#x27;t all 18&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Their is a few stings in the hair, but just go threw and cut those out.  </li>
            <li> These are not human hair at all, false advertising.</li>
            <li> The only thing i would have to say about these is they are shorter than what i expected and they are very thin and when you brush them, a lot of hair comes off and i wouldnt recommend styling them</li>
            <li> Just got my extensions in like not even a half hour ago!</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical because when I opened the package, the wefts looks too thin.</li>
            <li> I guess I took dark brown to mean darkest brown.  </li>
            <li> The only negative is they are thin</li>
            <li> Not the worst purchase I have ever made, but it is worth it to spend the extra money and get a quality set.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just too thin for my thick hair and it was beyond obvious</li>
            <li> I even trimmed them to make them a little shorter and they didn&#x27;t fray or anything!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this its fake hair I try to flat iron the extensions</li>
            <li> waste of my hard earn moneyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy</li>
            <li> Recieved the hair bent out of shape in a small package.</li>
            <li> The packaging was horrible and most of all, I did not get the type of product that I ordered.</li>
            <li> No more sew ins or glue for me nothing but clip ins from now on</li>
            <li> Its so Short and thin!</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> Same stuff is really expensive at my location, it also arrived 4 days after I ordered</li>
            <li> Not satisfied, even for the price.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical when i was reading the reviews, seeing that alot of people complained that there isn&#x27;t that much hair.</li>
            <li> , i sad that one got a little loose</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very impatient</li>
            <li> if your African American &amp; you have thick hair like me your going to be highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Just as the other reviews, the extentions are thin</li>
            <li> It is thin but it thickened up mine since my natural hair is very thin.</li>
            <li> I have too much :(</li>
            <li> they are hard to style or do anything with.</li>
            <li> A little thin for my hair</li>
            <li> A little on the thin side</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too thin for my hair</li>
            <li> and it was a little too thin for my hair.</li>
            <li> i dont undertsand why there would be a negative review?</li>
            <li> BUT id order at least 2 orders of them.</li>
            <li> so i cant complaint</li>
            <li> u need to order at least 3 pacs</li>
            <li> I have been told i have thick hair.</li>

            <li> If you have thick hair</li>
            <li> if u have thick hair</li>
            <li> These are the worst extensions I&#x27;ve ever seen and cannot imagine someone actually wearing them, the hair if you considering there really being any is waaay too thin.</li>
            <li> and I was wanting thick hair</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t expecting them to be thick</li>
            <li> soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo thin, small not a lot in it.</li>
            <li> Ordered dark brown got some weird reddish brown.</li>
            <li> Seriously for the cost and to add soe lentgh and voulme</li>
            <li> Big disappointment, I bought 3 packs and its still thin and lifeless.</li>
            <li> I guess Ill use this when I need a little lighter brown highlights.</li>
            <li> Also, the pack is extremely thin; you need at least two or three to make it work.</li>
            <li> The hair is more-so on the thin side, so I would advise everyone to purchase at least two packs, like I did.</li>
            <li> Thick wefts and hair is paper thin at ends..</li>
            <li> They also aren&#x27;t too thick, fairly thin.  </li>
            <li> It was EXPENSIVE for the cheap, terrible quality of hair that it is.</li>
            <li> These extensions are TO thin and not good quality.</li>
            <li> 7 pieces doesn&#x27;t create a very thick look.</li>
            <li> but you have to understand hair extensions to know that 70 grams is going to be thin.</li>
            <li> Hair was so thin you could literally see through it.</li>
            <li> said that the extensions were thin</li>

            <li> i tried curling them they melted,they are thin, and its a rip off because they dont tell the truth.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all.  </li>
            <li> A bit thin for my liking, but that&#x27;s my fault, I assume.</li>
            <li> And I knew they would be thin.</li>
            <li> I now have to thin my hair just to get them to match</li>
            <li> but the hair is really thin.</li>
            <li> And I have thin hair, so I didn&#x27;t think it would be a problem.</li>
            <li> The hair is so thin, what a rip off.</li>
            <li> My purchase came in and the hair extensions were really thin at the ends</li>
            <li> My clips were broken so I couldnt put them in my hair.</li>
            <li> They are thin hair</li>
            <li> As others have said, these extensions are extremely thin, and they get thinner toward the ends.</li>
            <li> These extensions are Too thin and stringy.  </li>
            <li> and they are really thin...</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s just way too thin for use.</li>
            <li> I was ecstatic about the price, so I ordered a quantity of 2 since there were warnings of the product being too thin.</li>
            <li> A bit thin</li>
            <li> If you want a dramatic look that will alway go with your any outfit</li>
            <li> So thin and they look really fake</li>
            <li> They were tightly rolled into uh ball, so when i took them out they were crazy looking!</li>
            <li> please dont waste your  money on them :(</li>
            <li> I got the wrong color, but am going to color them and see how they work.</li>
            <li> Sorry I don&#x27;t recommend this product</li>
            <li> like I do its extremely difficult to blend it</li>
            <li> I was so sad</li>
            <li> my stylist said you can tell when extensions are fake by curling them.</li>
            <li> 100% fake hair.</li>
            <li> but... they are fake</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with the quality at all.  </li>
            <li> I was so uncomfortable with my hair</li>
            <li> they dont look fake</li>
            <li> but unfortunately i did.</li>
            <li> When i received this hair, I realized they sent me the wrong hair color (4-medium brown)</li>
            <li> According to a family member that I purchased for indicated  wrong color n length</li>
            <li> It was fake</li>
            <li> NOT WORTH BUYING!!!!!!!!  </li>
            <li> but then it might be difficult to wear</li>
            <li> For the length, 18&amp;#34; you are going to get very thin hair.</li>
            <li> Very very thin</li>
            <li> They are very thin.</li>
            <li> and they would need to have very thin hair to pull it off.</li>
            <li> because the 7 pieces a set comes with, are all very very thin.</li>
            <li> the hair is alright, very thin</li>
            <li> When ordering this package, I would order two thought because it is very thin.</li>
            <li> The stitching was done very poorly.</li>
            <li> These extensions are VERY thin.</li>
            <li> and they are very thin</li>
            <li> you are going to purchase this, all I say is get two or three because they are very thin.</li>
            <li> So thin that It was impossible to layer/cut them like I desired.</li>
            <li> I am very dissatisfied, what a horrible product and to the stupid seller who has no problem ripping people off, I hope you lose all your customers and feel shame for your indecency.</li>
            <li> Now the bad:  the hair extensions are extremely thin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin &amp; ugly.</li>
            <li> when they where put it, even after thinning the crap out of my under-layer how thick it still made my hair look.</li>
            <li> Buy it if you have thin hair you wont regret it!!</li>
            <li> Bad quality of hair.</li>
            <li> So bad that I just threw it out.</li>
            <li> when i had them on it just made it look like i had a really bad hair cut.</li>
            <li> &amp; I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lighter color than the picture shows and it took like 3 weeks to come :(</li>

            <li> I hate  them $20  for three strands of hair....</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Horrible product.</li>
            <li> I think all of us agree that with extensions the worst thing to happen is it fall out in front of people.</li>
            <li> Horrible quality.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have time to worry about the color on this crap!  </li>
            <li> looks terrible</li>
            <li> but I have paid twice this amount for hair that was completely awful.</li>
            <li> This is awful hair.</li>
            <li> Stringy, and pathetic... fall apart and STINK!!!!</li>
            <li> I waited forever for these extensions and they are awful</li>
            <li> but the ends looked horrible.</li>
            <li> This is literally the worst hair ever.</li>
            <li> but the packaging was just awful!!</li>
            <li> So disappointed! !</li>

            <li> Looks beautiful and natural, east to maintain, doesn&#x27;t get tangled fast.</li>
            <li> Buy it if you have thin hair you wont regret it!! They make my hurr look real good for sure.</li>
            <li> I just reordered another color very nice fills in nicely if you have thin hair</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve gave it 5 stars but I asked for dark brown and I received a medium brown but product is amazing perfect for people who have thin hair like me, the hair is really remy and I died it to match my hair color I would buy these again :)</li>
            <li> My order was perfect and on-time.  The quality was excellent and the color matched perfect.  My daughter was surprised that the color and quality was what she was looking for - maybe even exceeded what she was looking for.  The price was excellent and well worth what we received 10 times over!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would rate this seller higher then 5 stars if I could!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much!!!!!</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews, both positive and negative and knew what to expect.  I still took a chance and ordered 2 packs.  The hair was thin and a lighter color than the description, but was able to blend with my hair and received a lot of compliments.  The main thing it was human hair and I was able to curl it.  It also came with an extra hair clip.  Because my hair is thin, 1 pack was good enough.  I will use again in the future.  The delivery is always quick and on time with Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was pleased when my shipment was in 3 weeks before the due date, yes many will complain they are a little thin but you have to understand hair extensions to know that 70 grams is going to be thin. If you want a more fuller look you should order a few packs of these or order the 100 grams. Overall the hair extensions are amazing, I love them. They are dark and they are very soft. They look natural and very healthy I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. I would recommend them to anyone looking for that extra length.  I hope this helped.&lt;br /&gt;-Breanna (:</li>
            <li> Love love love them.....just placed an order for more  :)</li>
            <li> Hair was so thin you could literally see through it. Most of the clips fell off, and I had to sew them back in. Horrible product. Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> way too thin, couldn&#x27;t even make it look like my own hair.</li>
            <li> keep in mind the amount of hair you are purchasing. 70g is not a lot of hair. For the length, 18&amp;#34; you are going to get very thin hair. Because it is longer, the thickness of hair is going to feel less than if you were getting 12&#x27;. I have been told i have thick hair. This did not work out for me. I would need double the amount of hair, but the problem is there would be too many clips for the amount of hair.</li>
            <li> There were lots of sticky fuss balls in hair and they got knotted very easily! Didn&#x27;t blend well cause there was not enough hair for front and u could see my short hair underneath it.</li>
            <li> Recieved the hair bent out of shape in a small package. The color was not the same as it was depicted to be.</li>
            <li> These are the thinnest hair extensions I&#x27;ve ever worn. if your African American &amp; you have thick hair like me your going to be highly disappointed. they tangle so easily and the hair falls out. they also took awhile to get here. this purchase made me want to use ebay.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really like them , there to thin and you can notice them easily , don&#x27;t buy them , there not worth it</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping. It was exactly as described. Perfect for someone with thin hair trying to add length and volume.  These looked great on. I also tried flat ironing and everything went smoothly. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> As others have stated, the hair is not all that thick but it is a good quality and the color is great. Blended perfectly with my own hair. I would highly recommend this set for those seeking a bit of extra volume in certain areas.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. It is thin but it thickened up mine since my natural hair is very thin. I recommend it to everyone. If you have thick hair i suggest buying two.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these extensions! They look and feel great. They stay put as well. I went from midlength to long hair overnight and have received 3 already on them.</li>
            <li> Shipped quick, they are beautiful</li>
            <li> Its good but one of the clips fell out &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> They took awhile to deliver, but since they came from overseas I guess it took the appropriate time.? They are great if you have thin hair like I do. I got the wrong color, but am going to color them and see how they work. Held a curl from curling iron. Overall, I would buy some more.</li>
            <li> I love mine and I even dyed them after I got them and they are so soft and I&#x27;m very happy with them!!</li>
            <li> I purchased these just to add a bit volume and thickness! I do got to say that these extensions are great if you need a little length and thickness. One pair lasted me about 6 months. I purchased more expensive ones, and these held up longer. Have no problems using hot tools on them. Will purchase again!!</li>
            <li> Great for if you want to add extra length to your hair but they are not dyeable so i do not recommend buying these if you plan on dying them</li>
            <li> So thin and they look really fake</li>
            <li> A little thin for my hair so I had to order 2 pairs but I&#x27;m so satisfied with them, they arrived in literally 5 days. I had to bleach the ends because I had ombré and they worked great and even when I had to dye them again darker brown they matched my hair perfectly and I used them literally everyday. Looked good curled as well. I wish they were thicker but they really are awesome and cheap. ;)</li>
            <li> i read the reviews and a lot of them said that the extensions were thin but i bought them anyway. i HATE them. it was really not worth the money. they are paper thin and look hideous in my hair. its so thin, that i dont think it would look good on anyone&#x27;s hair. at this point, i&#x27;d rather just buy good quality expensive ones.</li>
            <li> The hair is thin so you will need to buy two packages but I think its worth what you pay for. I like it.</li>
            <li> It had a dead head lice bug in the hair, and the hair was full of split ends.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot. The reasons for me not liking it are strictly my fault. I thought 7 pieces were going to be enough for me. They are not. 7 pieces doesn&#x27;t create a very thick look. So if thick look is what you are looking for you may need more than just the 7 pieces. I still wear them often. I usually blend them with the other extensions I have and when blended they look great! You can curl, straighten, use product and do just about anything that you would do with your own hair.</li>
            <li> I hair felt really cheap and thin. Bought a better make and threw these in the trash. Would not order again!</li>
            <li> I was so excited for these extensions to come in when I ordered them. I needed them for my senior prom last year, but unfortunately they took too long to come in &amp; I had to put my hair up for prom, no biggy. Anyways, the day they finally came in I put them in immediately. They were way too thin &amp; I was disappointed. The only way I got to put them in is when I crimped or curled them. They were so cheep so I suggest to get two packages of you want full quality.</li>
            <li> I loved this product! I received it much earlier than expected! The only thing that I didn&#x27;t really like was how thin the hair was so I ordered 2 bags the next time and made it fuller! Definitely would recommend if you&#x27;re willing to try clip ins for the first time! :)</li>
            <li> For the price these hair extentions are great. They are thinner than the one&#x27;s that I buy at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.  I recommend to get two sets.</li>
            <li> These extentions I used just about everyday they are excellent !! Everyone thinks its my real hair I love them! They&#x27;re very comfortable an I can straighten an curl them too! Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> The set had 7 pcs and we expected it to be plenty.  However, each piece was not as full as we expected.  The color is good and it looks nice, but my 16-yo daughter was a litte disappointed.</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t stay 18in after curling or straightening! and are thin. they look better (real) curled or crimped. might have to buy 2! &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo thin, small not a lot in it. waste of my hard earn moneyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy Im telling you. dont get it</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair, and this wasn&#x27;t enough to  look &amp;#34;real&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it wasnt a dark enough brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably more suitable for girls with thinner heir.&lt;br /&gt;great quality though. and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> These are amazing i highly recommend these if you want good, long hair! My hair looks great! Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> I just received the product today, is very thinn hair i guest you got what you pay for !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended is not worh...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maria Peralta</li>
            <li> I have really thick short hair at the moment, and in all honesty i was a little worried when the extensions arrived. They seemed thin (which they kind of are) and i worried they wouldn&#x27;t look right. However when i finally clipped them in and styled them they were not as bad as i had originally thought. I will be buying another pack just to make the layers look even, but the hair is very nice quality. I will be buying more if needed.</li>
            <li> These are great extensions for the price! The hair is very soft. Like many others said it is a good idea to buy two sets because the hair is fine, but even after buying two its still much cheaper than buying real hair extensions anywhere else. Love the product</li>
            <li> Very very thin and it says you may curl or straighten them but after one time of doing so they are thinner than before which seems Impossible to begin with, if u have very thin hair than these are for you otherwise, spend the extra money on better quality</li>
            <li> Where do I begin. The delivery date of this product took forever. The packaging was horrible and most of all, I did not get the type of product that I ordered. I got light brown hair instead of dark brown hair. I only hope that this is a one-off moment, and that it never happens again. I was very displeased. signed unsatisfied customer.</li>
            <li> These clip-ons are pretty nice.  I trimmed them down slightly.  Makes a nice additional to add volume to your hair.</li>
            <li> Thin hair on the ends OK for price but not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I wont say that I have seen worse, but I&#x27;m sure there is. The hair is thin and very realistic in the fact that it comes with its very own split ends. Regardless I would still use the hair and it blends in just fine (although not as long as I was led to believe). My only deal breaking complaint is that the clips themselves do not stay in place. I think all of us agree that with extensions the worst thing to happen is it fall out in front of people. I found myself checking my head constantly (I do have very fine straight hair, in the inanimate objects defense) to see if they were sliding out and most of the time they were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all in all not a terrible product and I still use them when I braid my hair to beef it up but not when my hair is down.</li>
            <li> Do not buy these they&#x27;re so stringy an they don&#x27;t seem like hair to me an I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have bought them</li>
            <li> Alright, so I have shoulder length hair and was wondering if I could get extensions for cheap, but still have them look good. Well I came across these and ordered one pack, thinking it would be enough. I got it within a week, and absolutely loved them! I just had to go back and buy another pack to they looked more realistic. These ones are lighter than advertized, and has a reddish tint to it, which I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are wonderful quality and definitely do not have a lot of hairs falling out. I wash them every 2-3 days that I wear them, and they are still super silky and soft! I just use normal shampoo and conditioner on it, but you can get extension-made stuff if preferred. I can straighten and curl them, but I don&#x27;t do so too often because I dont want to burn them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side to these extensions are that they do not straighten very well, and they are not naturally straight. They naturally have a little bit of a wave to it, which is fine for me, but maybe not for someone else. They also get very stringy looking after the first wash, so you have to brush them, A LOT, for them to look real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I absolutely love them!</li>
            <li> Not worth your time buying &amp; waiting. Horrible quality. Doesn&#x27;t last long at all, felt so brittle after straightening once. Ends looked straggly!</li>
            <li> They are wonderful. They are the exact same color of my hair and look so great no one knows when I&#x27;m wearing them!!</li>
            <li> i ordered these so i could get used to extensions and decide whtehr i wanted to invest in permanent ones. For the price these are great. Alittle thin and jagged but you can trim and style. Seriously for the cost and to add soe lentgh and voulme i dont undertsand why there would be a negative review?</li>
            <li> This was my first time using clip ins and I&#x27;m satisfied. The only negative is they are thin but they definitely inspired me to purchase a better brand. No more sew ins or glue for me nothing but clip ins from now on</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and color was prefect!!!!</li>
            <li> I received mine today on the shipping date it said I would. I&#x27;m very pleased with them they&#x27;re the right length, and color I ordered also they curl nicely and look real. I&#x27;ve paid $100 for some that didn&#x27;t even have the quality like these do so for $27 that&#x27;s a really good deal.only thing I would suggest is if you have thick hair order 2 packs instead ;-)</li>
            <li> Well, I got the hair extensions in about 3 weeks and it was okay, BUT I did receive a little something with it. My hair extensions came with nits, I was about to vomit. This is the worse purchase of my life.</li>
            <li> They were extremely thin. And also weren&#x27;t the right color. I ordered dark brown and got a brassy blonde.thank god I&#x27;m a hair dresser and can fix the issue . And also weren&#x27;t the right length.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a light brown and I didn&#x27;t like the hair texture at all. It&#x27;s a lighter color than the picture shows and it took like 3 weeks to come :(</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have time to worry about the color on this crap!  I ordered dark brown and got a redish brown.  Does not match people!  I had somewhere to go too!  Threw it out!  Waste of money.  Look like Barbie doll hair.  Waste of money.  I have an idea, take this crappy product to someone you know with dark hair.  Does it match?????????????????????</li>
            <li> When I was looking for extensions, I purposefully searched for some with reviews complaining about thinness because my hair is so fine. It would look pretty weird if I had a bunch of different thicknesses and textures going on.&lt;br /&gt;I think the picture looks a little darker than they are, and I was prepared to dye my hair one shade darker, but they match excellently. Use your own judgment, though.</li>
            <li> The hair coloring is right. Matches exactly to mine and nobody can ever tell I&#x27;m wearing extensions. The only downside is that I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s real hair like it claims. I have another set of extensions that are real hair and I can curl them and wash them and they return back to being straight but these ones just don&#x27;t curl and the ones that do, stay curled.</li>
            <li> Loved these. perfect color , dark brown matches my priginal hair color.For 7 pc, i paid 70 % less than other places. so loved it. PLZ make the CLIP little smaller &amp; more stronger. the clips r slightly big.Otherwise a very good happy purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Thanx ..</li>
            <li> the hair It feels real and looks real, but it super thin and kind of spacey. I put it in my hair and looked real except the fact that it doesn&#x27;t completely cover the hair, it leave strands of your Hair hanging out and Just looks weird. I would recommend it to People BUT id order at least 2 orders of them.</li>
            <li> this extensions are great for the price, but yeah everyone was right they are a little too thin at the ends. great product tho&#x27;. they are the first extensions I buy and  they still look good.</li>
            <li> Extremely thin and my hair is not thick still they did not work me not to mention the color doesn&#x27;t look natural at all .... Sorry I don&#x27;t recommend this product</li>
            <li> Work great, awesome price, match my hair great. Definitely recommend going long and trimming if necessary. Very happy with them.</li>
            <li> Bad quality of hair. So bad that I just threw it out. Do not waste your time or money making this purchase.</li>
            <li> There was grey hair, much lighter color than I thought it would be and so thin...if u have thick hair like I do its extremely difficult to blend it looks terrible I was so sad</li>
            <li> The quality is good. I am new at extensions when I fully figure them out and become a pro all the better. They could be thicker however and cme with a how to pamplet butbexactly as depicted</li>
            <li> So I noticed MOST RATINGS ARE A 3 MEANING THEY THINK THEY ARE OKAY NOT GOOD. You can get better one at sally&#x27;s that will cost 30$ at twelve inches which isn&#x27;t bad like at all they&#x27;re actually fairly longer. But these ones will be nice at first they&#x27;re fuller BUT they will tangle alot and rat you CAN NOT STRAIGHTEN OR CURL OR YOU WILL FRY THEM BECAUSE IT&#x27;S NOT REAL HAIR. They&#x27;re good for temporary terms but I wouldn&#x27;t get them more use then a few days</li>
            <li> These worked so well for my wedding they gave me a little extra length and volume to pull off the style I desired</li>
            <li> Wow!! the ends actually LOOK to Humannn!! jajajaja Its so Short and thin! did not like at all... Will Give away.</li>
            <li> They are very thin. Strands of hair falls out of them when brushed. If you have thinker hair look somewhere else.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter. She liked them &amp; said they were easy to use! The color matched up really good with her hair too!</li>
            <li> I read all of the reviews before purchasing this item, so I made sure to order 2 sets. I have thin hair to begin with, so I figured 2 would blend well with my hair. I was surprised at just how thin they actually were. Very few people would be able to use these extensions... and they would need to have very thin hair to pull it off. I ended up having to take all of the clips off one set and sew them together in order to not have a bunch of clips covering my head. Now I have to be careful that the doubled-up wefts aren&#x27;t showing through my natural hair. Not the worst purchase I have ever made, but it is worth it to spend the extra money and get a quality set.</li>
            <li> They werent thick enough, and they shred when u use the flat iron on them. Even at low heat. But they did match my hair perfect.</li>
            <li> I like the hair, it was as described, and came with clips attached as well as care instructions.&lt;br /&gt; I would say that you should buy two packs if you want to add hair to your whole head.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Excellent value! I bought extentions for the first time and these are super easy to use, the color and texture is perfect. Just as the other reviews, the extentions are thin so I bought two sets and problem solved. Make sure you inspect them and clean them before styling, I got a bit of glue on my flat iron.</li>
            <li> Thin hair..buy two. Its nice hair just really thin I would get two or go with 120g!!! :-) ♥♡♥♡♥♡♥♡♥♡♥ dont complain later when you buy this and it isnt enough because you should be doing research on what you buy and read the reviews...good quality hair but not enough BUY TWO.</li>
            <li> i was so excited to get my extentions, i had order them in the brown color and my surprise was that i got a totally diffrent color, igot hash blonde!!!! i was supposed to wear these for my sisters wedding, and now i had to dye my hair the same color of the extentions.</li>
            <li> I ordered this extensions because my hair fell out after giving birth to first child and now I don&#x27;t have such a thick hair I used to have. It&#x27;s exactly my colour and this hair is excellent quality. I got it earlier than expected and was surprised. This product contained a letter from seller saying he&#x27;s Chinese and his priority is to send out items on time for clients&#x27; satisfaction. Although his English was quite poor, I was deeply touched by the letter. I ordered another pack of these extensions and I&#x27;m looking forward to receive them soon.</li>
            <li> This was a very great buy, I had to buy two pack because my hair is super short and thick so one pack was not enough.The quality of the hair is fabulous and I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wedding and it worked wonderfully. Makes my hair look 10 times fully and better. So easy to clip on. Only downside is although it does give your hair more volume, don&#x27;t expect to much. Its pretty thin especially at the bottom. For someone with really think hair, this helped but if you&#x27;re looking for extreme volume, this is prob not for you. The hair is also very fine.</li>
            <li> This product was a great buy. Only con: The extensions took a good two weeks to come in. Pros: The color was an identical match to the online color palette. The are true to lengh but they are thin. They are a great &amp;#34;starter&amp;#34; pack if you have never worn extensions but i know next time i will spend the extra money for a thicker/fuller set. They do feel great and do not shed or change in any way when you wash them. The clips are very good quality and stay in place. I would recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> I love the extensions. However when I took them in to my hair salon to get my hair dyed the same color my stylist said you can tell when extensions are fake by curling them. She tried to curl the extensions and they did not curl. She said that&#x27;s the true test. If they barley curly it&#x27;s not real hair. Good thing I only paid 20 dollars for them.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 sets when I purchased these and thank goodness I did! They r paper thin barely any hair on them. Aside from the fact I do not believe they are entirely real hair, because when I straigntened them some hairs shriveled up like it was plastic. When they r in they look &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; at best. Do  NOT buy these if u have shorter hair trying to make it look long, it might b ok just used for a little bit of a filler but just don&#x27;t expect much!! Over all u shld be very cautious buying these, they are not as they seem.</li>
            <li> Definitely NOT human hair no matter what the title says!!! OBVIOUSLY synthetic and the color is way off what the picture shows. And since they&#x27;re synthetic they won&#x27;t absorb hair dye. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest buying these.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this hair if you are African American. This hair will not blend with the texture of your hair. It looks like baby doll hair.</li>
            <li> 100% fake hair. Cant color it</li>
            <li> Very good product, no complaints, shipping takes a while but that&#x27;s normal it came from China</li>
            <li> really nice hair, good quality. only issue is 1 set of hair is usually not enough. it definitelly was not enough for my hair so i had to order another pack.</li>
            <li> These hair extensions were a bit lighter than my natural hair color but i didnt mind. They blended rather nicely and looked beautiful. I have thick hair just below the shoulders and it was enough for my whole head. This was my first evet pair of extensions and I can&#x27;t say that they&#x27;re all that great. The hair is thin and breaks easily. I only straighten them when absolutely nessacery. After about four months of occasional wear they started getting frizzy and uneven. For the most part i loved them while they lasted. A fair price considering it was real soft shiney hair. The y didnt even smell funky which i was expecting. I would recommend buying some heat resistant high quality synthetic extensions instead though. I got some for 30 dollars and i wear them eveyday. They last longer, look eay nicer and you get more bang for your buck, but if you want something inexpensive for minimal wear i woul say these are quite nice as well.</li>
            <li> It looks very natural!!! love it</li>
            <li> The hair is really nice and soft.  I already have long hair so I was just going for a fuller look when I wear it down.  Looks great and stays in place.  Luv it!</li>
            <li> I received these sooner than expected so that was a nice bonus. The clips have the silicone strip and stay put very well. The hair is thin and has a lot of breakage and does get much thinner towards the ends. The hair is soft and curls well. I have been wearing them for a few weeks and have dyed, curled , washed and brushed them and they don&#x27;t shed much so that&#x27;s good. It isn&#x27;t a lot of hair or the best quality but I have paid twice this amount for hair that was completely awful. So, for what I paid they are worth it and I would buy again :)</li>
            <li> totally not worth their price. theyre stringy. i knew they were going to be thin, but these are like two strands of hair. honestly i would never recommend these to anyone. theyre litterally like three hairs on each clip. when i had them on it just made it look like i had a really bad hair cut. i bought some cheaper ones that are made of real hair too for $5 here on amazon and they were a lot better. they actually can stand heat and can be washed.</li>
            <li> it loooks wonderful when you get it but... they are fake i tried curling them they melted,they are thin, and its a rip off because they dont tell the truth. what  waste.</li>
            <li> This is awful hair. Thick wefts and hair is paper thin at ends.. don&#x27;t buy it - you will waste your $.</li>
            <li> These extensions are TO thin and not good quality. I&#x27;d NOT recommend.</li>
            <li> Well, These extensions got me prepared to want better ones. Had to cut them short becasue they were thin but they look good shorter. Shipping was great. Very fast. Couple things though. I washed them and the color ran alittle. When they dried they were wavy not straight, but fuller and softer. Good starter extensions, cheap, fast shipping, but not the quality I wanted.</li>
            <li> Unsatisfied. They are super thin. The hair doesn&#x27;t cover or hide the clips.  I guess I got what I paid for... $20.00 for 20 strands of hair.</li>
            <li> They are great especially for the price. I just wish there was more hair. The color is perfect and the hair is soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not 100% human hair</li>
            <li> soft and a great length</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this 18&amp;#34; Remy human hair extension, and personally, I do actually like it. Its absolutely beautiful qaulity hair! And matched my own hair identically, even down to the small high lights threw out it. its crazy! Its very soft and silky. The one thing i will say though, if you do order these extensions, make sure to ORDER TWO SETS!!! because the 7 pieces a set comes with, are all very very thin. so as you layer up your head, placing them in, its hard to blend with your own hair because of how thin they all are. BUT if you buy two sets like i did and you double them up as you layer them into your head, and it makes your hair much thicker, they blend perfectly, and you even add some length. not as much length as i was expecting since they are 18&amp;#34;. but overall with two sets, they look beautiful and i like them :)</li>
            <li> I have extremely thin hair, so I only use 5 of the 7 clips. I bought two packages but only use one. They look like my hair and feel like it&lt;br /&gt;I suggest washing it every week with shampoo only, be gentle when you brush them&lt;br /&gt;I love them no one can tell I have them in&lt;br /&gt;Again THIS IS FOR THIN HAIR, so don&#x27;t buy it if you have thick hair and are expecting something amazing because you won&#x27;t get it with the 70g</li>
            <li> If you take care of them they last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;If a clip falls out its so simple to replace.&lt;br /&gt;I really liked the look and feel of these</li>
            <li> the hair is alright, very thin and i&#x27;ve had to re-sew the clips several times. its okay for a quick fix when you don&#x27;t have the money for the good stuff</li>
            <li> When I ordered these extensions,&lt;br /&gt; it said these were 100g&#x27;s and that&#x27;s what I intended on getting. Instead they were 70g&#x27;s. I&#x27;m very upset.&lt;br /&gt;They are good extensions, although they only look good curly because my hairs thicker.</li>
            <li> This must be some type of joke. I received a tiny little bundle of then hair. Do not buy! It&#x27;s thin &amp; ugly. Plus there&#x27;s not enough for your whole head, probably not even half !</li>
            <li> Stringy, and pathetic... fall apart and STINK!!!! Save your money people... I now stand by ordering the more expensive brands in hair because they are really worth it. Hair is noting to mess with, order right, invest in better quality. I thought ordering this would be a nice change on my wallet IF THE PRODUCT WAS GOOD LIKE THEY CLAIMED IT TO BE... NOPE. spend wisely.</li>
            <li> I like these i just dont like how they get tangled so much. But i love the color it matches perfectly and i love that i can curl or straighten them and i just love them.</li>
            <li> SO GREAT. I&#x27;ve had these for a year now and only a little bit of hair has fallen out. Such a good deal for $20. But everyday use I don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> I just got these two def not human hair its a lie and way off on the color I orderd a dark brown and got like a brownish red wayyyyy off my hair color it was a waste even if they r cheap at least send the correct color def NEVER BUYING again</li>
            <li> Was not human hair like advertised fried as soon as I touched it with the curling iron will never buy again.</li>
            <li> Love my hair extensions need to buy some more. Terrific high lights in my natural hair. Lots of complements. Very happy</li>
            <li> These are NOT human hair like stated, now I purchased two sets, and cannot use them! Not happy at all.  Waste of money!</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and delivered exactly what was promised in the description for the hair extensions. I am very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I Really Thought Twice About Ordering These Extensions ... But , Mine Came In Today .. Earlier Then Expected , I Give This Product 5 Stars Because They Are The Right Length .. They Are The Right Color &amp;&amp; They ARE REAL Human Hair ! ❤😁</li>
            <li> Hi there! So let me start off that I don&#x27;t go out of my way to review much of anything.I&#x27;m currently a cosmetology student and thought they would be fun to mess around with. Lets start with the good  first : Super fast delivery. Said it would take a month, only took a week. The hair is pretty soft! Now the bad:  the hair extensions are extremely thin. So thin that It was impossible to layer/cut them like I desired. My natural hair is pretty thin and when in, they look stringy and flop around lol.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for $20. I&#x27;d say if you buy 2 packs you&#x27;d be ok.</li>
            <li> A bit thin for my liking, but that&#x27;s my fault, I assume. Still a great piece!</li>
            <li> these were very thin, and the hair falls out so easily. these hair extensions were way too dark than they looked as they were posted. if you want to buy these you must buy two or three packages...also there is too many clips for your hair and the tracks are very noticable. DO NOT buy these, i&#x27;d sure like my money back.</li>
            <li> They were thinner than I had anticipated. And I knew they would be thin. I got 2 sets which does the trick. The hair is super healthy and am impressed. I would buy them again for this Price. I wouldn&#x27;t pay any more, but they look good. Darker than my hair color though. They are almost black. I got lucky, they just make my hair look highlighted.</li>
            <li> Good but not what I expected. They are very thin, the ends  look horrible but they blend very easily and they are good for the price. I would recommend</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t the color I asked and when I tried coloring them it wouldn&#x27;t . Wasn&#x27;t very happy with them at all</li>
            <li> Product not as described or pictured.  Dark brown was more of a dark reddish blonde. The seller had good communication willing to return which is why I&#x27;m giving some stars... but after waiting 30 days for shipping from china I did not want to wait another 30 days for a refund. So I dyed it myself, worked for me for a couple months but they hair is now breaking, not the best quality. But u get what u pay for :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty pleased with mine. For the amount I payed it&#x27;s worth it. They were super thin and dangly at the bottom, luckily my hair is more on the thinner side so I just cut the dangly/thin parts at the ends and it worked for me. I did order another pack though I plan on stitching two together to make them thicker. The extra clips were great too. Same stuff is really expensive at my location, it also arrived 4 days after I ordered so I&#x27;m pretty happy</li>
            <li> I guess I should have expected something to be wrong with them being so cheap. I now have to thin my hair just to get them to match untill I buy some thicker extensions.</li>
            <li> Love the hair! It&#x27;s a great way to change up my short hair anytime I want! When ordering this package, I would order two thought because it is very thin.</li>
            <li> Alright. I wish you guys would stop dissing these extensions. They are much thicker than the ones from Sally&#x27;s. Plus your paying almost 150 less. Yes I would advise 2 packs. its not going to kill you. the clips are great! Plus you get more extensions. Than you would at Sallys! Also they shipp pretty fast. it says they get here 17-28 days I received them 4 days after ordering them! So there you go.</li>
            <li> These extensions look real and clip in easily.  They come in several separate little pieces which make them seem skimpy but they look great once in the hair and because they come in such small pieces, the weight is so little that you barely know you have them in.</li>
            <li> Not real hair. Was going to use for wedding. Not a chance. Ordered dark brown got some weird reddish brown. Tried dyeing them. Didn&#x27;t take color at all. Feels like Barbie doll hair.</li>
            <li> These are not human hair at all, false advertising. I have not tried to curl them so it may or may not work, but normally with fake hair it ruins the extensions. I waited forever for these extensions and they are awful, totally doesn&#x27;t fit the description they give. You can&#x27;t even really wash them because they are&lt;br /&gt;Plastic and It makes the hair stiff.. 0/10 would not recommend</li>
            <li> Ordered Dark Brown - After waiting weeks I received ... light red??? Ugh!!! Never order again!</li>
            <li> Just got my extensions in like not even a half hour ago! It was super fast shipping, and at first the delivery was supposed to be tomorrow but I got them today! The 18&amp;#34; extensions are just what I wanted. The color looks exactly like the picture. It&#x27;s packaged very nicely!! I will definitely be ordering more if need be from this company!! Thank you again!</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with the quality at all.  Two notes though:  The \\&quot;prime\\&quot; was not true as it took almost a week to arrive.  The color was not a very dark brown.  I guess I took dark brown to mean darkest brown.  What I got was, to my opinion, medium brown with a lot of red tone.  Way too much auburn/redishness in this for my hair which had none of that.  If the next step after this is black, then I guess there is no match for my dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> So, I bought two packs of them! I saw negative reviews and good reviews so i was iffy about purchasing them. It was only 50 bucks for two packs and free shipping so i decided to go for it. They are very similar to Sallys Beauty Supply ones, maybe just a bit thinner but not by much. Im dying mine darker because when you dye the hair extensions it makes them feel thicker and look thicker. I honestly don&#x27;t know what these people who wrote the negative comments were expecting? They clearly don&#x27;t know much about hair extensions and how much they go for. But for fifty dollars for two packs totally worth it! Super fast shipping also! Thank you so much! :)</li>
            <li> very nice, i bought them for my girlfriend and she loved em, i didnt expect them to be here as soon as they were, seriously took 3 to 4 days not bad at all, such a good product for so cheap, thanks (:</li>
            <li> I have to say buy two! But hey I bought mines for 23 dollars each, you will not get 46 dollars human hair extensions. They blend in well in my hair and they curl, dye whatever you like, I say get them for volume or for length great!</li>
            <li> Too thin, very ratty at the ends and I found louse nits in it. Not satisfied, even for the price. Color was also not what I was expecting. The stitching was done very poorly. Would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love them!! I spent 125$ at Sally&#x27;s for extensions in January and these are so much nicer and so great for the prince!! I would HIGHLY recommend them!!</li>
            <li> These extensions are VERY thin. There are others out there that are MUCH thicker so you get more bang for your buck per strand/clip. I&#x27;m returning mine today.</li>
            <li> Buying extensions online can be some what of a guessing game because you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re really going to get. These extensions were awesome! They curl, straighten &amp; you can color them. Very happy with them.</li>
            <li> The quality of the hair itself is very soft and shiny. It&#x27;s just too thin for my thick hair and it was beyond obvious I had extensions in as it was much thinner than my actual hair. This would be wonderful for someone who is just looking for volume. Also the customer support is fantastic! I requested a refund and it was very prompt. Customer service is also very kind and courteous.</li>
            <li> So in love with these! I recently had my hair cut and it was cut entirely too short. I was so uncomfortable with my hair I wore it up constantly. I put these in and my whole attitude changed! I feel more confident and they look great. I have thin hair and its above my shoulders but this the extensions my hair looks fuller and comes down right below my chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did order a second set I am going to cut to make them blend better because my hair is so short and thin.</li>
            <li> Big disappointment, I bought 3 packs and its still thin and lifeless. Just a waste of money. Super super thin</li>
            <li> This is good quality hair. Shipped in alot less time than anticipated. As someone who wears extensions regularly, I am very pleased with it. You can&#x27;t beat the price for human hair anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my upcoming wedding. I am keeping it down and curling it. But, because I have thin hair, it makes it difficult to look nice with my length and thickness (I look like Shirley Temple haha). I bought these in hopes of intermixing into my hair. And it is PERFECT. I did a trial run with my hair with my hair stylist. And she even said how easy they are to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color matches picture almost identically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to add natural-looking body and length to your hair for a low-cost, this is the route you def wanna take! I would recommend this to a friend :)</li>
            <li> work for what I got it for</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK when I have it curled but the hair is really thin. And some of the clips are coming off ...but it&#x27;s ok I&#x27;ll buy better ones</li>
            <li> This was a great buy for me to use to try out clip in extensions. Yes there is only 70g of hair, it&#x27;s great for giving you that fullness and body that most want. For the price it was a good deal. Happy with my purchase. Also Dark brown #2 is more of a light brown with slightly redish tent (which matched my hair perfectly). Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> the hair is what is pictured &amp; I always account in my monitors being off colored (aka not calibrated), my hair is darker than this dark brown. love the length. I guess Ill use this when I need a little lighter brown highlights. I ordered abHair Real In Remy Human Hair Extensions as well &amp; this is the extact color as my hair. Both hair clips were real hair extensions &amp; both came in time. I will use them both, my hair is super thin. the extensions seem a little thin as well, but I don&#x27;t mind it gives my head more volume in the end either way. it helps to have unwashed hair &amp; tease your roots when using them :)</li>
            <li> These are the worst extensions I&#x27;ve ever seen and cannot imagine someone actually wearing them, the hair if you considering there really being any is waaay too thin. And I have thin hair, so I didn&#x27;t think it would be a problem. But it&#x27;s definitely worth spending the extra cash to get good ones instead of these rip-offs.</li>
            <li> PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not buy. The hair is so thin, what a rip off.</li>
            <li> So when I ordered these I was sooo excited. First off I ordered them in the end of January and it said I would get them within a week of ordering it. As soon as I placed my order it said I would get them between feb 20 to march 10. I was pissed. But I actually got them earlier than expected. I received them feb 3rd:)&lt;br /&gt;But I got them out and was excited to put them in. Now my hair isnt paper thin but its not thick either. So I put them in easily but the ends looked horrible. Like straggly hair. Thats what I didnt want. Now my actual hair was fuller at the ends. My hair does feel full on my head but the ends of the extensions suck. Im highly disappointed. Now I need to figure out how to make them not look like that.</li>
            <li> These were so awesome at first but they got so thin so fast. It&#x27;d be better to just go to some from a beauty supply place.</li>
            <li> I brought dark brown alittle too light not a problem I just used a 1b rinse matches perfectly. Just wanted to add length and they worked. Will wear them today for my bday</li>
            <li> This is literally the worst hair ever. It was EXPENSIVE for the cheap, terrible quality of hair that it is. within two wears, my extensions became tangled and essentially unwearable. Also, the pack is extremely thin; you need at least two or three to make it work. I am very dissatisfied, what a horrible product and to the stupid seller who has no problem ripping people off, I hope you lose all your customers and feel shame for your indecency. AVOID AVOID AVOID AT ALL COSTS</li>
            <li> I expected the quality to be average due to the cost but to my surprise the extensions were an excellent quality.</li>
            <li> Delivery day said may 23-june 21.... Lucky for me it arrived on may 10 so it took like 2 weeks to arrive.  They were very nice the first week but with time i noticed their kind of flat and have manyyyyy split ends it makes my hair look messy and uneven.... They are still very nice they dont look fake and i bought mine for $17 so i cant complaint lol :)  overall  i love um so yes i reccomend</li>
            <li> My purchase came in and the hair extensions were really thin at the ends and I was wanting thick hair but it&#x27;ll do for now.</li>
            <li> I received my extensions yesterday and yes they did get to me fairly quick but the packaging was just awful!! i ordered 2 packs of these extensions and the came in a little yellow envelope and inside were the two packs. They were tightly rolled into uh ball, so when i took them out they were crazy looking! Didn&#x27;t want to straighten them soo soon but unfortunately i did. Other then that the hair was decent for the price.</li>
            <li> Real hair, but it&#x27;s so little hair that there is no possible way it would ever look real on ANYONE. Prompt shopping though.</li>
            <li> I use them everyday, i straighten them n curl them and looks great either way, i sad that one got a little loose</li>
            <li> Some clips were damaged, and hair doesn&#x27;t seem real due to reaction when washed. Matched color of my hair perfectly though.</li>
            <li> Hair is very fine, silky thin hair. If you have any texture to your hair at all these extensions will hang below like strings. Very disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> They are amazing! I can curl and straighten them! Money well spent. I totally recommend theses to anyone In need of good quality hair extensions.</li>
            <li> When i received this hair, I realized they sent me the wrong hair color (4-medium brown) the hair does great when worn on occasions (1/4 wks a month) and can last up to 4months...however i wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it weekly...it looses life very easily, even with proper care (within 2 months). The ends are very sparce, i had to cut off an inch so buy your hair 2 inches longer than your desired length</li>
            <li> I really liked these extensions. They came more than a week of the estimated delivery time and they were very soft and the perfect color and length. I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li> it has been over a month since i put in my order and i still haven&#x27;t gotten anything! i have contacted seller several times and they have NOT messaged back i am very upset and i do not trust this seller at all . so those who plan on buying something from this seller rethink your decision because you will most likely not get anything after all .  !</li>
            <li> I believe they are good quality, match my hair, and I can do practically anything with them. If you want a dramatic look that will alway go with your any outfit these are for you.</li>
            <li> Ok so I haven&#x27;t opened them yet. I may return. They look so thin and like this tiny strip of hair. Not what I expected from the photo at all!</li>
            <li> My clips were broken so I couldnt put them in my hair. The color was perfect and the lenght was perfect. The price is also really good.I contatced the seller to see if they would send me a new package. If clips were good I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> These hold curl really good! It is hard to keep them straight and they are very thin so order two packs. BUT for the price you pay it is well worth it!</li>
            <li> The color turned out perfect! It is decent hair, but too thin at the ends. I wish they were thicker all over. However, they were very inexpensive and look good on.</li>
            <li> For my daughter and her love of hair extensions, Daddy will gift what she has picked out in advance via Amazon and then forward link to email to buy the correct birthday gift.-)</li>
            <li> The only thing i would have to say about these is they are shorter than what i expected and they are very thin and when you brush them, a lot of hair comes off and i wouldnt recommend styling them</li>
            <li> Thinner than I had anticipated, which would be ok on someone like me who has very fine hair. But someone with thick hair, you would probably have to double up.</li>
            <li> These extensions are fantastic!!!!!!!  Real hair looks amazing. . . A little on the thin side but when matched with 2 set they look great!!!!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product, it was very fast shipping and the extensions came with a few extra clips.  Although, I did trim them just a little, they didn&#x27;t need much.  They also aren&#x27;t too thick, fairly thin.  Overall, I really enjoy them :)</li>
            <li> I loved the extensions ! They matched my hair perfectly , they were soft and easy to manage. They never got knotty and were really easy to take out when I was done using them. I would definitely recommend them. They were cheap too !</li>
            <li> Received the extensions less than a week after ordering. I have never used clip-in extensions before, but these are so gentle on my scalp and easy to put in I can be ready in 10 minutes!!  I have dark brown hair with very blonde highlights and when placed correctly the extensions match perfectly! I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this product, I will definitely be purchasing from them again.</li>
            <li> Took a while to get delivered but they were in great condition. They are thin hair so if you have Fuller set of hair you may need two sets of extensions.</li>
            <li> The description says you can curl or straighten these extentions...they do not curl! They do straighten...but be careful how hot your straightener is...you can dry the hair.</li>
            <li> They Looked Beautiful at First, then its like they stopped being like real hair like they was synthetic they stopped blending with my own hair, and they got stiff and stuff..</li>
            <li> Did not feel like real hair!  I tried to dye it because the color was not dark brown. .2 different boxes of dye wouldn&#x27;t even change the color!! Not real hair!! So disappointed! !</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this its fake hair I try to flat iron the extensions and it melted in less then 2.5 seconds</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;ll say the pros first. The package came quite fast, faster than I thought they would. The price is fair. I read in the reviews to get more than 1, and I ordered 2.&lt;br /&gt;Cons. As others have said, these extensions are extremely thin, and they get thinner toward the ends. They are cheaply sewn together. The hair IS NOT human hair, this hair is SYNTHETIC. I was disappointed. As soon as I took a curling iron to them, the strands melted and burned, as plastic would. They package the extensions in a bunch with a RUBBER BAND tied around it, which if you don&#x27;t CUT then it will rip out some of the hair from the extensions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I regret the purchase, wishing I had spent more money for quality hair. But there is a fault in the seller, they stated in their post that this was &amp;#34;100% Human Hair&amp;#34;. The hair is clearly synthetic, I could tell the second I touched it.</li>
            <li> kind of stringy, really made for super straight hair, wasn&#x27;t really able to curl but still used them. this product is definitely ideally for super pin straight hair.</li>
            <li> They were all uneven in length, they weren&#x27;t all 18&amp;#34;. They looked like they&#x27;ve already been worn for awhile. they are hard to style or do anything with.</li>
            <li> Great color, great texture! Amazing for those days u want curls and extra volume.</li>
            <li> Ends were super thin so it took away from the length. Good hair quality, but you&#x27;d need a few packs to make it look good.</li>
            <li> All and this is good but yes if you do plan in buying these please buy 2 or 3. The hair us super thin and if you have a lot of hair like me then one will just not work</li>
            <li> Feels like real hair will be buying more.</li>
            <li> According to a family member that I purchased for indicated  wrong color n length</li>
            <li> I ordered dark brown. I was sent strawberry blonde! It wasn&#x27;t human hair , It was synthetic so I can&#x27;t even color it and you cant return it.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t real Human hair. It was fake</li>
            <li> Love it! Easy to put in and clips didn&#x27;t get tangled in my hair while taking out. Shipping took a little long but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> The hair is great quality, the clips are great!  My problem is, it wasn&#x27;t enough hair!  I have too much :(</li>
            <li> I just received these in the mail about an hour ago and i can already tell that i hate them. these are the worst extensions on the market. the clips suck and are so visible on your head and the hair is so thin that id need to order 2 more and my hair is thin so thats saying alot. i would definately not recommand this item. you get what you pay for!!</li>
            <li> It came in very quick, and I was suprised with how good the condition of the hair was. Great product and customer service, for an excellent price. You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> I have short hair and I&#x27;m very impatient so I bought these extensions. Okay, so like everyone else has mentioned, they are thin. So what I did was thinned my hair out before I put them in which helped a lot. They shipped in fast which is another plus. I&#x27;m planning on wearing them to prom as well :) I&#x27;m satisfied with them and the price they were! I&#x27;d recommend them.</li>
            <li> I feel like a lot of people don&#x27;t understand that with most extensions you need two packs. It&#x27;s ridiculous that they rate these so low. They are cheap. Get two packs. Maybe even three.</li>
            <li> Like ot alot, I got exactly what the description says. This is great for people who have thin hair with no volume, I have alot of hair so I would have to order two instead of one but other than that I dyed it and straight iron it and it didnt fall out or break.</li>
            <li> love the extensions! I have thin hair, so having an exta umph just makes me feel very confident. I love it, I dont even feel them. I just got them today. I thought i would get them later in the month but they arrived early!I would definitely recommend them. This is my first time wearing extensions and im kind of scared wearing them out of the house lol since im afraid they will be noticeable but my brother saw me and didnt even notice xD. I&#x27;m super happy .</li>
            <li> i love them they are a good look to have I really like mine cause they blend with my hair a lot you cant even tell I have them on</li>
            <li> i really liked the hair it was a exact match to my daughters hair easy to put in and take out</li>
            <li> These extensions are Too thin and stringy.  I would not recommend.  more like 10&amp;#34;.  Also took about 10 weeks to receive</li>
            <li> The hair came in really quick. Easy to style, put in and even dye. they werea little thin but its an easy fix. i love this product!! Great choice!!</li>
            <li> These extensions were great. They are the exact color I needed and add enough volume to the hair. I&#x27;ve only used one so far.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hair!  I read many reviews, bot bad and good about this hair.  I was very concerned about the price and whether or not this hair would be a waist of money.  I can say that the hair is not thick enough for my hair, however I knew that from the reviews, so i ordered 2 packs of hair.  2 packs of hair was more than enough for me to cover my entire head.  You don&#x27;t want to put too much hair on your head, because it will be too thick and not look real.  My hair is shoulder length.  Also, the color is very deceiving.  The color is more of a #4 than a #2.  I panicked when I received the hair, but this was a simple fix.  I went to the dollar store and bought some hair dye to match my hair.  This did not alter the texture of hair at all.  Just make sure you condition it, after you dye it.  I have had this about a week.  I noticed minimal shedding and it curls well. Looks very natural, because it is not bone straight you can make it blend very well.  All my clips have stayed in place, but it is good to know that they sent extra clips just in case.  I am an African American and I wear Remy weave a lot.  I can tell that this is not Remy hair entirely, Yes it is about 75% human hair, but it is very good hair.  Their is a few stings in the hair, but just go threw and cut those out.  I have not noticed any tangling of the hair, yet! Well worth my money and beyond.  I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> I received these hair extensions early which is always nice. The color is pretty and the extensions are a great value for the buck. They&#x27;re only 70g so I wasn&#x27;t expecting them to be thick and they aren&#x27;t. They are exactly what I expected. I will buy more from this seller.</li>
            <li> I really loved these. They did not match my hair color but im getting another set and dying them. They are real hair. I havecurled them and straightened them. I use reagular hair supplys on the hair and it still is amazing. I just need another set and they&#x27;ll be perfect! The clips actually are hidden in my hair which is a short pixie so its a little bit of a difficultyto hide them but nobody knows there hair extensions if they dont know me! Lol</li>
            <li> S*** I hate  them $20  for three strands of hair.... NOT WORTH BUYING!!!!!!!!  It made my hair tangle and they are really thin... Also it has to many clips with no hair.... AGAIN NOT WORTH BUYING</li>
            <li> I rated this a 2 because the hair is soft and real looking. But it&#x27;s just way too thin for use. Please, for anyone reading this - believe me. I read countless reviews on these extensions and just wanted to believe all the good things I read about them. I was ecstatic about the price, so I ordered a quantity of 2 since there were warnings of the product being too thin. Two sets of these extensions is still not enough. The top of the extensions have a decent amount of hair but as you get toward the bottom, it becomes horrifically thin. Literally like pieces of string. For the price, even for 17 bucks I still don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it because they are USELESS. You can&#x27;t use these. I had really high hopes for these. please dont waste your  money on them :(</li>
            <li> They came in less than 2 weeks but they were so thin they looked gross at the ends because they were not thik enought &amp;&amp; I have very thik hair.</li>
            <li> The hair is not as full as the picture makes it appear. The hair is synthetic not virgin human like it says &amp; it&#x27;s from China not India like it says it is...</li>
            <li> I liked the product. I you are going to purchase this, all I say is get two or three because they are very thin. If your hair is highlighted a lighter color and your natural is dark, buy two of each color. You will see the difference. The more you buy the better. Makes your hair Full</li>
            <li> dont like this brand at all. wish i would of looked into it more before i wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Long, fast shipping, true to color, good price, good to wear for a wedding, occasion or something along those lines&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;clips are difficult/painful, very thin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DO like these extensions, I bought them to wear to prom once, so they work just fine. However, the clips really pull at your hair so I don&#x27;t recommend wearing them often. They aren&#x27;t thick, so if you have hair this long and you want to thicken it I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these. If you want to curl your hair and you&#x27;re looking for length these are awesome.</li>
            <li> If all you&#x27;re looking for is to add volume to your hair then it&#x27;s fine. It will not make it seem that all of a sudden your hair is long. Also, keep in mind that the natural hair in these extensions is very fine. Color is natural medium to darker brown.</li>
            <li> These hair extensions are really made up of thinned hair. Ordering 2 may suffice and you may be able to pull off the long hair.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical because when I opened the package, the wefts looks too thin. But then I started layering the pieces in my hair, and WOW, what a difference. 7 pieces is all you&#x27;ll ever need. I purchased the ones in Dark Brown...it&#x27;s not an exact match and my hair still is darker (but jet black would really look fake). So I blended as much as I could and it looks freaking awesome! Looks like I have highlights underneath. Feels real enough, too. Great for straight / fine hair. I don&#x27;t want to dye because it&#x27;ll ruin the quality so I&#x27;ll treat it like my own hair and just wash / condition / air dry as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 3 months later...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still rocking it! How? Dry Shampoo and gentle combing. Also, my hair has grown out a bit and now looks fuller over these extentions. Great buy. If they make it to 6 months, I&#x27;ll buy another set for sure:)</li>
            <li> i was very surprised when i got these by how much hair truly came with. it doesn&#x27;t look like much, but when you put them in, it truly does give you a lot of length and volume. They are 100% human hair, just as they are advertised as.I absolutely love them, and wear them almost every day.  I&#x27;ve dyed them to my hair color, and also have brought them to my hair dresser, to clip in and cut my hair to make them look natural. I was very skeptical when i was reading the reviews, seeing that alot of people complained that there isn&#x27;t that much hair. I think when the little hair on them looks deceiving. But when you clip them in, they really are not thin at all. I always get my underlayer of my hair thinned out anyways, because i have such thick hair.  so i was surprised when they where put it, even after thinning the crap out of my under-layer how thick it still made my hair look. I recommend buying just one pack, and bringing them to your hair dresser, to cut them accordingly, before you decide if you truly need another pack.  These are absolutely great!</li>
            <li> they fried way to easily and the clips broke on almost all of them.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!  Package shipped out a day or two after I placed my order, &amp; arrived four days earlier than the estimated delivery date.  The hair is more-so on the thin side, so I would advise everyone to purchase at least two packs, like I did. The color is SLIGHTLY lighter than pictured, &amp; I also found two random colored (red &amp; blue) strands of thread/hair/whatever in two of the clips in one pack.  The clips are secure &amp; extras are provided, as well.  True to length, very easy to apply, &amp; blends extremely well with my shoulder-length hair.  If you have really short hair, I would recommend getting more packs if you want the ends to look full.  Overall, I like these extensions.  They&#x27;re obviously not the greatest quality in hair extension land, but for the price, you certainly canNOT go wrong &amp; they look wonderful! :)</li>
            <li> there is was not enough hair at all. the description never how much hair it was. this would never be enough for someone using extensions. next time it should say its only a string of hair instead pf saying full extensions</li>
            <li> My girl purchased this and though I don&#x27;t see a difference in her beauty I&#x27;m just happy it makes her happy.</li>
            <li> they were exactly as expected, though I recommend buying two packs regardless if you have thin/thickhair two packs is needed!&lt;br /&gt;good quality, just take care of them as instructions state.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too thin for my hair so it&#x27;s obvious.  I&#x27;d probably have to double up to correct that.</li>
            <li> I think that product was okay just because I used it one time. I would not where these all the time. I was hoping it would look healthier and fuller. It matched my hair perfectly though!</li>
            <li> These extensions are thin as mentioned in previous reviews so if you are using for length only then I suggest buying two. If using to add volume than one should be enough depending on the amount of volume desired. The shipping was fast!  The only complaint I had is the product was not true to color in my opinion. I purchased a dark brown, as was labeled on the package upon delivery, however it was more of a light/medium brown color with reddish tones and did not match my haircolor. I did not want to have to dye my extensions but they did not blend with my natural hair, especially since my main area of concern was the clips being visible. I just wish they had been darker so I wouldnt have had to hassle with dying them. Please consider this when purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for extension that would look like real you would need to order at least 3 of this&lt;br /&gt;the hair is excellent quality&lt;br /&gt;looks natural&lt;br /&gt;very smooth&lt;br /&gt;and really beautiful&lt;br /&gt;but when you see 7 pcs you think it would be good enough for one set, and would give u the long hair you want&lt;br /&gt;well it doesnt because this hair is so thin that the 7 pcs look like literally one thread of my hair lol&lt;br /&gt;if you want to use this hair u need to order at least 3 pacs but then it might be difficult to wear</li>
            <li> I love these. They are the easier to work with, don&#x27;t tangle. I bought one set and it was a little too thin for my hair. But with two sets it looks just beautiful. I even trimmed them to make them a little shorter and they didn&#x27;t fray or anything! The color is perfect and I can curl them, straighten them, and they look totally natural!&lt;br /&gt;I even washed them with some shampoo and they got kinda wavy, totally gave me a beachy look.&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed if you buy these.</li>
            <li> A bit thin so I bought two sets but other then that it was fabulous I would deffenly recommend it :)</li>
