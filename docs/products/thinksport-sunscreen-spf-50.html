            <li>Great sunscreen from Thinksport.</li>
            <li>Great coverage and protection.  </li>
            <li>I have used Badger &amp; Elemental Herbs (both very effective)</li>
            <li>I have tried many, but for me, this is THE BEST!</li>
            <li>Awesome safe and waterproof sunscreen.</li>
            <li>After 3.5 hours in the afternoon sun, I was thrilled to see that I didn&#x27;t burn at all where I put the sunscreen on!</li>
            <li>burned!&lt;br /&gt;It covers great, smells good, and it does not sting, burn, or cause irritation.</li>
            <li>It is so wonderful to be able to go running in my contact lenses - previosuly, I always had to wear my glasses because sunscreen stung my eyes.</li>
            <li>I will say that it does have a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a pleasant citrus scent, and we know it doesn&#x27;t hurt his skin.</li>
            <li>It provides great protection, goes on nicely and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>The smell is the best of any sunscreen I&#x27;ve used, and the ingredients are the best by far as well.</li>
            <li>Good zinc-based sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>good spreader.plenty of protection.i&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
            <li>I am incredibly upset as I researched safe sunscreens fora month before our trip.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s good for outdoor activity.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re using an aerosol can, then you&#x27;re not using a good sunscreen.</li>
            <li>This seemed like a good choice.  </li>
            <li>It provides good protection and</li>
            <li>Good sun protection and not too greasy.</li>
            <li>screen.&lt;br /&gt;Another brand to try, which has a good consistency</li>
            <li>say: if the sun does not give you a rash and you need good protection and you are not worried about good absorption, use this.</li>
            <li>It seems to be a good alternative to toxic sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, blends in well, great protection!</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t the easiest to rub in and it takes a lot for good coverage.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>We all loved this.</li>
            <li>you know the batch is good.  </li>
            <li>Good product, good delivery.  </li>
            <li>I have a good tan.</li>
            <li>I have friends with whiter fair skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame that a company with a good product has no idea how to treat a customer.</li>
            <li>Good smell too.</li>
            <li>This is one of the good ones.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ve very pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ve very pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li>Very healthy and works well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the sunscreen otherwise, and I would buy it again if I can be assured it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;m not convinced the ingredients are that great - many of them are known irritants.  </li>
            <li>It smelled lovely and went on great.  </li>
            <li>The good ones were creamy, homogenized, effective.  </li>
            <li>Also has a nice pleasant smell which was a nice surprise.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought this sunscreen before and love it!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I will be buying more!</li>
            <li>Now buying again for both my daughter and myself - it is safe for kids too!</li>
            <li>We love this sunscreen!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love this product...love the price!  </li>
            <li>also love how this sunscreen smells!</li>
            <li>Light weight, easy to rub... GREAT!</li>
            <li>Amazon sells it for a great price and free shipping.</li>
            <li>Smelled great, went on smooth, no complaints.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of greasy</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Very effective.  </li>
            <li>None of us particularly liked the smell, which reminded me of orange creamsicles.</li>
            <li>I put them in the fridge overnight thinking they were just warm from being shipped</li>
            <li>I still get a nice tan afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I have even tried making my own sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Which I really liked because it worked.</li>
            <li>I wear sunscreen like its my job and this one REALLY works the best.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and doesn&#x27;t feel oily at all.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice.</li>
            <li>Also smells nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep looking for something that&#x27;s both chemical-free AND effective.</li>
            <li>you do not need a lot to be effective.....</li>
            <li>You really need to slather it on every couple of hours for best results-</li>
            <li>It has nice smell to it.  </li>
            <li>ThinkSport ranks high every year on the best sunscreen list and we agree.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product, but I also received four from a batch that was super watery.  </li>
            <li>It smells good and blends in easily.  </li>
            <li>This is one of best products I have found for water-related sports and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>A good sunscreen formula should not have more than a handful of 90% plus certified organic ingredients and FREE OF; fragrances, perfumes, additives, softeners, thickening agents, gums, alcohol, biologically harmful chemicals like Avobenzone, Oxybenzone, UV Chemical absorbers, paraben, phthalates, PABA and 1,4 dioxane.</li>

            <li>The first tube I ordered was great.  </li>
            <li>Most importantly, it works great and is chemical free.</li>
            <li>Nice product blends in easily.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily and is effective.</li>
            <li>Top rated by EWG.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to reapply after swimming, though.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s much better than the competition.</li>
            <li>I love the product.  </li>
            <li>Bottle came filled with water!</li>
            <li>Every time I try to use the tube, more liquid pours out.</li>
            <li>but  this sat on top of our skin and appeared ashy on even the fairest of my family.</li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen and it goes on well.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve used many, many varieties of sunscreen/sunblock.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t burn your eyes like many others and not as toxic as most.</li>
            <li>I came across this from the EWG website, where it got a 1 - the best possible - rating.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t put it on my face because I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would clog my pores.</li>
            <li>I did try so many sunscreen creames and this one does not give me any skin allergy.</li>
            <li>The way they get away with saying things like that is by making it sweat proof so that means that it is better than another brand that isn&#x27;t sweat proof and has an SPF rating of 50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Safe ingredients.</li>
            <li>As a distance runner I love this product.</li>
            <li>And this rubs in better than most zinc sunscreens.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this and keep it in my bag all the time</li>
            <li>This one smells better than the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>My favorite part of the Thinksport sunscreen is how well it rubs in.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite sunscreens.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, it is recommended by EWG SkinSafe website as a safe sunscreen, and it smells nice too.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; product, without the harmful chemicals found in most mass market brands.</li>
            <li>One tip: be sure to shake it up and squeeze the tube a bit to counter any settling of the ingredients before opening.</li>
            <li>Also - I love what it does NOT have - chemicals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is also rated only a 1 on ewg.org which is great!!</li>
            <li>Works great, but was very drying to the skin (or maybe it was the sun, but this sure didn&#x27;t help).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Product gets 3 stars because I ordered 3 more tubes</li>
            <li>They told me that I had to buy 4 more tubes from them, and then they would include 4 additional replacements for the defective product.</li>
            <li>ZO is insoluble in water, used in many industries, in ointments, creams and lotions.</li>
            <li>I researched &#x27;healthy&#x27; sunscreens to death.  </li>
            <li>I SOOOO wanted to love it.  </li>
            <li>I love to use it and reapply it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also one of the most affordable options.</li>
            <li>We have always seemed to do just fine using protective clothing and avoiding the sun from 10 to 2 and so on, but my new baby/toddler is very fair</li>
            <li>Works flawlessly every time, even after hiking several hours in full sun and sweat in desert heat and sand!</li>
            <li>This sunscreen goes on easy, doesn&#x27;t leave you looking white, and smells great!</li>
            <li>Although it works and I like supporting LiveSTRONG, which I do their bike ride challenges, I think there are just as good products cheaper.</li>
            <li>best if put on lightly and only rubbed one direction....</li>
            <li>So….if you are lucky enough to get a good tube, the product is great.  </li>
            <li>As a redhead with very fair skin that loves to spend time outside, I’ve tried almost every drug store brand.</li>
            <li>Love this because it does not have a strong odor and works fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like heated vaseline than a smooth cream.</li>
            <li>It had much better application compared to its competitors for chemical free sunblock.  </li>
            <li>I was in search of a sunscreen product that met my criteria:  animal cruelty free &amp; safe.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really surprised by all of the great reviews for this product.  </li>
            <li>When it comes to sunscreens we&#x27;ve tried them all - the kind that burn your eyes, ones that go on thick and gooey, the spray kind, the unspreadable kind, the stinky kind - you name it!</li>
            <li>Also goes on easily.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t burn easily, tan very quickly so the spf 50+ is what I ordered.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t come off easily</li>
            <li>This stuff does not rub in easy, but with some work it will blend in.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect it to blend easily.</li>
            <li>And it does not wash off easily.</li>
            <li>easy to apply on and wash off.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a strong sunscreen for my daughter, who plays soccer in the strong Arizona sun.</li>
            <li>It does not have a strong scent and works for hours of outdoor play.</li>
            <li>This is one of the first sun blocks of any kind I have used.  </li>
            <li>I really want to love this stuff, it smells great, goes on really well</li>
            <li>Although it works fine</li>
            <li>Works fine for me.  </li>
            <li>Worked fine.</li>
            <li>My bottle was SUPER watery!</li>
            <li>Keeps my very &amp;#34;pale&amp;#34; child sunburn free!!</li>
            <li>It goes on easily, isn&#x27;t greasy, and does a good job as far as protection.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell, is very moisturizing (often do not need a moisturizer on my face when I use), rubs into skin well, leaving no white residue and leaves your skin with a nice healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>As a BRCA1 gene carrier, I have been looking for a sunscreen to use this summer while working in the yard that is mineral based and paraben free.</li>
            <li>You should feel great about not using synthetic compounds, which could potentially cause harm to your body!</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is a great option for anyone looking for a physical blocker (as opposed to a chemical blocker).</li>
            <li>Hubby and I liked this so much</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave you white and rubs in great.</li>
            <li>(also, you will need to add a light layer of powder to reduce the shine)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I liked it so much that I bought extras to give as gifts to my aunts and friends.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to see a more reasonably priced, bulk size.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to see a more reasonably priced, bulk size.  </li>
            <li>After much research &amp; use of several products, I found Thinksport to best meet my needs.  </li>
            <li>An excellent product; only writing a review to advise of shaking the tube very well before use -</li>
            <li>I did a lot of online research and this product was at the top of most lists, and the price was decent here on Amazon, so we tried it.</li>
            <li>I originally bought it because it rates a &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; on the ewg.org site, meaning it&#x27;s chemical free and considered a &amp;#34;very safe&amp;#34; product.  </li>
            <li>Very happy with this - spreads nicely, not as thick as other safe brands.</li>
            <li>This is a great mix but contains too many ingredients and all are non-organic ingredients as well when I can get mixes with less ingredients, organic ingredients and not over 30SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Was so excited to use a mineral based sunscreen.</li>
            <li>If you shake it vigorously for a minute, it regains its original consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I wanted a reef friendly sun screen while sailing around the islands of Tahiti.  </li>
            <li>The higher the percentage the better.</li>
            <li>On the first trip out which was hiking I literally painted my face and arms with this product and thought I was okay, but to my horror when I got home</li>
            <li>Just be prepared to look like Casper the friendly ghost?</li>
            <li>ZO is like mud, the higher, the better protection but ZO stays on the surface of the skin for protection so</li>
            <li>ZO is like mud, the higher, the better protection but ZO stays on the surface of the skin for protection so</li>
            <li>Great for running long distances.</li>
            <li>family has very fair skin (red heads) and we have to use sunscreen for a large part of the year.</li>
            <li>This is a great sunscreen - rated well by the EWG and actually works, a rare combination.</li>
            <li>Works very well and is free of harmful chemicals unlike many mainstream sunscreens.</li>
            <li>So far this is my favorite sunscreen of the safe zinc oxide type.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different brands - those recommended by EWG, Consumer Reports, and through my own research.</li>
            <li>I had been purchasing a popular brand of sunscreen (expensive) because I thought it was the best product to use.</li>
            <li>(Bonus points right away)!</li>
            <li>Out of all of the brands I have tried, by far this is my favorite brand and one of the more economical choices out there.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff, no problem with white pastey look.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite sunscreen to use on my whole family.  </li>
            <li>We returned it for a full refund and no problems.</li>
            <li>its not a bad smell-</li>
            <li>I have been searching high and low for a good sunscreen that has zinc oxide without all the damaging chemicals!  </li>
            <li>It was pretty strong.</li>
            <li>We suffered pretty strong burns.</li>
            <li>But be forewarned that the healthier sunscreens available and there are several very reputable and effective brands will not be as smooth and translucent as the above mentioned.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s much better than the competition.ct is distinct, fairly strong, and doesn&#x27;t go away completely until after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;-The price.  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t bother me and the scent dissipates fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>I was worried when I heard about the trouble with Livestrong, but I&#x27;m glad thinksport is still making this good sunscreen affordable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a win all around, and is now my go-to sunscreen for all-day intense hikes in the Southern California sun.</li>
            <li>Luckily one of our friends recommended this brand and we&#x27;ve been fans ever since.</li>
            <li>It works quickly, doesn&#x27;t smell, and doesn&#x27;t make me cry.  </li>
            <li>Compared to other healthy sunscreen products I&#x27;ve purchased, this rubs in much more easily and does not have a greasy feel to it.</li>
            <li>But overall, I am very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>It you struggle with melasma (dark spots on the face that are greatly aggravated by sun exposure)</li>
            <li>good on dry skin.  </li>
            <li>That said, this is a very emollient sunscreen and is easy to blend</li>
            <li>and neither I nor my 10 and 7 year olds have ever had a sunburn not using sunblock, and we all got one the first time we used this!  </li>
            <li>It blends in nicely so you don&#x27;t have a pasty white face.  </li>
            <li>We have tried a number of titanium dioxide/zinc sunscreens and this is our favorite so far.</li>
            <li>It is worth it</li>
            <li>It is worth it</li>
            <li>Our family outing to the beach was a success and none of us got burned when applying this sunscreen as directed.</li>
            <li>We have been loving the Thinksport sunscreen, and I just ordered our second bottle.</li>
            <li>The scent is &amp;#34;barely there&amp;#34; and just smells a bit fresh.  </li>
            <li>Pricy, but worth it to not have all the chemicals.</li>
            <li>make my own sunscreen but for times when I do not, I need the same formula as I use in my organic sunscreen mix with fewer ingredients.</li>
            <li>make my own sunscreen but for times when I do not, I need the same formula as I use in my organic sunscreen mix with fewer ingredients.</li>
            <li>Yes, it leaves a whitish color on your skin, but all zinc-based sunscreens do if you apply enough to be effective.</li>
            <li>This and any of the other ThinkSport physical blocker sunscreens (ThinkBaby and LiveStrong) are the best on the market.  </li>
            <li>Most high zinc sunscreens leave some white cast, and I&#x27;m ok with that,</li>
            <li>Sunscreen goes on easy, rubs in easy and thoroughly without leaving white or purple marks or looking greasy.</li>
            <li>Tip- don&#x27;t get in the water right away</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t leave her white.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to rub in and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin matted over with a white film.</li>
            <li>There is no fragrance added to this but the smell of the product is distinct, fairly strong, and doesn&#x27;t go away completely until after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;-The price.  </li>
            <li>will try to remember to update and see if I notice a difference in my melasma, this is my first time using a sunscreen as powerful as this (20% zinc)</li>
            <li>I find it very easy to apply to my small children as it rubs in easily and disappears quickly.  </li>
            <li>I ordered ThinkSport Kids from different seller last week and the product is great.</li>
            <li>I usually avoid it, but the orange scent is pretty mild and pleasant.</li>
            <li>The citrus smell was a little strong for my taste, but otherwise a fine sunscreen!</li>
            <li>the light citrus smell is just lovely (especially when compared to many other sunscreens).</li>
            <li>It prevented burning and stayed on while walking 18 holes, sweating, in the hot sun.</li>
            <li>but I was willing to overlook it - if it worked.</li>
            <li>(I hope that if anyone is aware of a study, they will comment with a link.)</li>
            <li>Still, the concern is enough that many companies are switching to non-nano.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re just switching to physical sunscreens, you can expect to put a lot more time and effort into application than with the chemical brands and Thinksport</li>

            <li>I  found the price NOT outrageously expensive like some.  </li>
            <li>and I worried that would not be enough to keep him sun safe.</li>
            <li>But i was able to get this sun block to rub in so that I did not have a white tint to my screen.  </li>
            <li>Sunscreen has to protect from UVA and UVB and most sunscreens only do one.</li>
            <li>My first try was &#x27;ThinkBaby&#x27;.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;thinksport&#x27; is even better as it stays on longer and actually works.</li>
            <li>I am really liking this sunscreen!  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried so many of the physical sunscreens, but Thinksport is our current favorite.</li>
            <li>So the higher price of Thinksport doesn&#x27;t bother me, and living in Florida</li>
            <li>Many of the cheaper sun screens made my face puffy, red, and itchy.  </li>
            <li>We were there for 5 hot and sunny hours.</li>
            <li>I was burnt to a crisp.</li>
            <li>However, we were all burnt to a crisp after just one day trying it.  </li>
            <li>I did exactly what the label wanted us to do (I am an avid sunscreen wearer and have always applied it correctly) and re-applied again and again.  </li>
            <li>It smells like a sweet nice lotion but not strong.</li>
            <li>We tan pretty easily, and it does leave a white tint.  </li>
            <li>The tubes I received were full nothing but a clear oily substance.</li>
            <li>If you have very oily skin, apply sparingly the first time.  </li>
            <li>Slight odor but nice consistency, not too runny.</li>
            <li>I applied this three times in a 5-hr period to myself and my 3-yr old on a mild Spring day in the Midwest and it did not work AT ALL.</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin, you will like this product even more.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s works well, does not leave a white film on my skin &amp; is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>This stuff does not rub in easily at all - it&#x27;s reminiscent of Destin regarding texture.</li>
            <li>It goes on white and absorbs easily and provides unbeatable protection.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sticky or very white, but the citrus scent is extremely strong.</li>
            <li>I switched to physical sunscreens a few years ago and have been searching for a brand that is effective and easy to rub in ever since.  </li>
            <li>Mainly, because It blends better, but because of the high spf it is still white sunblock.</li>
            <li>To be fair, though, my skin is very pale and the white cast may be more visible on people with a little more melanin.&lt;br /&gt;-Not greasy.  </li>
            <li>We bought some of the thinkbaby for our little guy and liked it for ourselves, so we bought this too.</li>
            <li>Great coverage but tough to rub in.</li>
            <li>Hands down the BEST children&#x27;s sunscreen I have tried (and I have purchased 6 other natural style sunscreens).  </li>
            <li>hard to come off when showering.but that is good you know its working.</li>
            <li>They spread easily, are not greasy, and do not leave white residue like many other zinc sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>We really like this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Really bummed that this didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much that I bought a bigger tube of it recently.</li>
            <li>Very water proof since I go swimming and paddling a lot in the ocean.  </li>
            <li>I read reviews here that said this very thing but gave the product the benefit of the doubt thinking maybe they didn&#x27;t put it on correctly, etc.</li>
            <li>After some time, I have noticed that it separates in the tube and gets really watery.</li>
            <li>It also dries much faster than others we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>You will also really need to wash it off when you shower, like with a washcloth, otherwise you might feel a residue.</li>
            <li>This tube, used very sparingly, got us through 2 applications of my son and me.</li>
            <li>My son doesn’t like to put sunscreen on his face, but he loves the smell of ThinkSport so much that he doesn’t mind with this brand</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it protects very well.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t really describe it.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Like that it doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot to cover well and didn&#x27;t have any sunburns.</li>
            <li>Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one, blocks both UVA (320-400 nm) and UVB (280-320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light.</li>
            <li>/&gt;SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream.</li>
            <li>/&gt;SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream.</li>
            <li>It really stays put.</li>
            <li>If you have made the wise choice to ditch the chemical-laden sunscreen (which actually cause many forms of skin cancer) products sold at drug stores and department stores you are already a step ahead of the game.  </li>
            <li>I really love this stuff, especially because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine for surf sessions as long as it&#x27;s not midday when the sun is blazing.</li>
            <li>Additionally, while I am running the white film becomes even more apparent once I begin to perspire.  </li>
            <li>When I first put it on, you get a whiff of strong chemical odor trying to be hidden with what my wife calls a &amp;#34;fruity scent.&amp;#34; Soon after, the real odor comes blazing through.</li>
            <li>I applied it once this past Saturday and stayed out in the sun for over 2 hours when the temperatures rose to 115, and it seems to have protected me well.</li>
            <li>Protects my skin really well as a nice, thick cream that blends really well.</li>
            <li>This stuff is very sticky and you really have to rub it in, but it never, ever stings my eyes or irritates my sensitive skin like most other sunscreens.</li>
            <li>If that bothers you, than you might consider a different sunscreen, but I don&#x27;t mind a little residue to get good coverage.</li>
            <li>The sunscreen didn&#x27;t rub in smoothly over this dry patch.  </li>
            <li>Easy to put on and has no real smell to it.</li>
            <li>Worked as expected, goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t smell.  </li>
            <li>Reapplication, of course, is necessary after hours of water exposure.&lt;br /&gt;-Easier to rub in than most physical sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>The cream comes out white but disappears fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>There were better rated sunscreens and more expensive sunscreens, but for the price and the ingredients this one was a no brainer.</li>
            <li>After doing some research and looking at all the fairly good but mixed reviews for this product I decided to buy 5 bottles of it which was I think maybe a waste of money.</li>
            <li>I sweat a decent amount and even after working out, it keeps working.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I will continue to purchase this &amp; highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended in my book.</li>
            <li>Yes, it is easier to apply and doesn&#x27;t make your face look pasty, but they are high in toxins.</li>
            <li>I will keep it for use on my hands, but there are other natural sunscreens that have better aesthetics.</li>
            <li>This may or may not mean something.  </li>
            <li>for many, high ZO will not work since it will be too heavy.</li>
            <li>for many, high ZO will not work since it will be too heavy.</li>
            <li>I do see a little white residue collecting in my lines &amp; creases, but not bad at all; no where near the ghostly look you get from many zinc oxide sunscreens.</li>
            <li>so you can see where you missed, and then dries clear as long as you smooth it out.</li>
            <li>My kids and I wore it in direct sun for 2 hours, and it worked really well.  </li>
            <li>It is pricey but in my opinion worth paying extra to not have carcinogenic chemicals on your baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>Not sure it really works, we still get tanned and we tan even more when in the pool.</li>
            <li>that come with skin exposure to the sun.he skin do not get absorbed into the body, do not enter the bloodstream, and are not a threat to human health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a nice initial scent to it, although my family says that it smells like typical beach sunscreen.</li>
            <li>As with most mineral sunscreens, it tends to be difficult to wash off but Castile Soap is an easy remedy for that.</li>
            <li>The amount of zinc oxide is just right; it rubs in without leaving my face all white.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great--and it has a light citrus-y cent, doesn&#x27;t smell like other sunscreens.</li>
            <li>I might have to reserve it for long all day activities (beach days, hiking, etc..) and use a cheaper alternative for the more frequent 1-3 hours of outside time.</li>
            <li>I really sweat, so my former sunscreens (mostly NO-AD, Neutrogena) ran down and caused necklines to turn rusty orange, and nothing would take the stains out.</li>
            <li>None of them \\&quot;rub in\\&quot; to the point that the white is completely gone, unless it doesn&#x27;t have as much zinc to begin with, or you have rubbed it so thin that it won&#x27;t be very effective.</li>
            <li>I am a sailor with very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>For a non-chemical sunscreen, it rubs in easier than most; however, it is a white based sunscreen due to its 20% zinc content.  </li>
            <li>We purchased a tube of each and discovered that the ingredients and the product are exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>We purchased a tube of each and discovered that the ingredients and the product are exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen is COMPLETELY ineffective!</li>
            <li>And so far it has not caused rust stains on the necklines of my tops!</li>
            <li>After that, it stays mixed, i just had to do that on first opening it.</li>
            <li>ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS -2 ZO which has a mean particle size greater than 30nm, when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body, do not enter the bloodstream, and are not a threat to human health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bought two bottles at once right before a long vacation.</li>
            <li>but like I said it&#x27;s still good product just not good enough for surfing.</li>
            <li>I once read a review of sunscreen in Men&#x27;s Journal [...] that basically explained that most sunscreen is not very good and almost all of the advertisments and packaging is missleading.</li>
            <li>Wish they&#x27;d make a larger size which should be able to bring the price down a bit.  </li>
            <li>Normal sunscreens do not smell good and its weird to walk around reaking like that as an adult.</li>
            <li>I wear sunscreen every day and have tried so many different brands - cheap, expensive, drugstore, high end, and for now the search is over.</li>
            <li>It is odd that it claims &amp;#34;does not have an obtrusive smell that many organic sunscreens have&amp;#34; ... it does, hence only the 3-star rating instead of 4.</li>
            <li>Because this is a physical blocker, it doesn&#x27;t wear off like many other suncreens, so if you&#x27;re not wet or sweating, it will work all day (or until you shower) without reapplication.</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s the same as ThinkBaby, I usually just shop around to find whichever one is the better price at that particular moment.</li>
            <li>I wish I could love this, with its low EWG rating, nice application, and unobtrusive scent--but I&#x27;ve had two bad burns now while using this and reapplying every two hours, and it can&#x27;t just be user error.</li>
            <li>Upon opening one tube, clear liquid came pouring out instead of lotion.  </li>
            <li>if you want something clear- keep looking.</li>
            <li>Thumbs up so far.</li>
            <li>My 4 year old always complains about sunscreens getting into his eyes and stinging (even the baby sunscreens irritate his eyes) but this sunscreen did not budge once I applied it to his face</li>
            <li>It is also non-greasy and rubbed in very well (no white streaks).</li>
            <li>I bought this sunscreen to send with my 6 year old to camp.  </li>
            <li>To top it all of, Thinksport is rated with a score of 1 on EWG.org&#x27;s website which is one of the lowest ratings (lowest being the least toxic) you can find in sunscreen products.  </li>
            <li>Almost 2 weeks in Maui and so far no damage.</li>
            <li>and when I get hit with direct sunlight during the summer months I get all itchy.</li>
            <li>It does leave your skin white, but I&#x27;d much rather have that than skin cancer.  </li>
            <li>I have converted a whole cross country team to this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>The longest run I&#x27;ve been on so far while using this product has been 16 miles.  </li>
            <li>but I was surprised.</li>
            <li>and they told me to buy directly from their website, which I did</li>
            <li>I used this for my 3 young kids and myself as well.  </li>
            <li>and it was completely liquified.  </li>
            <li>works!!!&lt;br /&gt;I also have sensitive skin, and this hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin yet.</li>
            <li>Non-irritating, non-allergenic and non-comedogenic, used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve put this to the test time and time again, climbing Mount Whitney at 14,500 feet, trekking 18 miles across the desert in full sun all day, sweating a ton on various long hikes, and still it holds up</li>
            <li>I had a patch of dry, peeling skin from a sunburn (thanks to a different brand of sunscreen) when I first used this.  </li>
            <li>This brand costs less than the popular but extremely toxic, neutrogena broad spectrum helioplex.</li>
            <li>Wait about 10 minutes for it to dry on you first.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you buy some serious lotion to put on when you get inside.</li>
            <li>Remember this is a sport sunscreen, SPF 50 (high amount of zinc), and not something to wear daily to the office.</li>
            <li>So if your priorities are high SPF, zinc (non-nano if possible), and water resistant, then buy with confidence.</li>
            <li>Arrived watery, which at first I thought might have been the heat from shipping, but it never returned to the creamy consistency of Think Baby and Think Kids that I expected.</li>
            <li>I used it for golf outings in a southern state where I live.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had no sunburns and no noticeable sun damage (new and worsening freckles, white spots, etc.)</li>
            <li>I live in Australia and wanted a physical sunscreen because I am in the sun a lot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fair-skinned outdoorsy girl, and I burn easily even late into the Summer</li>
            <li>I especially appreciate it is free of harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Like others, I did all my research on the best but least expensive non-harmful sunscreen and settled on this one.</li>
            <li>Not at all like the traditional sunscreen smell, but a faint good scent -</li>
            <li>I was out in the sun for the better part of a day on several different occasions and each time my face got a little burned!  </li>
            <li>I wanted sport protection with no chemicals and broad spectrum coverage.</li>
            <li>It has SPF 50 broad spectrum waterproof protection.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Be aware that, as with any high mineral content sunscreen, you are going to have to deal with the slight white hue that goes along with it.</li>
            <li>This stuff seems great, especially considering the weird smells and texture of other all natural sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>BABO has 22% ZO with conventional not organic ingredients which is a higher amount of ZO than an organic brand like BADGER with 18.5% ZO.</li>
            <li>BABO has 22% ZO with conventional not organic ingredients which is a higher amount of ZO than an organic brand like BADGER with 18.5% ZO.</li>
            <li>The adult and kids one are the same but the adults one is cheaper so go with that one.</li>
            <li>I have tried nearly every singe sunscreen rated 2 or lower on EWG.org (skin deep) website.  </li>
            <li>, it completely soaks in to my skin, without leaving a white shadow!&lt;br /&gt;Awesomeness.</li>
            <li>I used Thinksport  for the first time while at the Wildlife Park with my 4 year old and a group of friends a few days ago.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, like a thick lotion.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not fragrance-free, but the subtle citrus scent is pleasant, not overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li>Would recommend and will definitely buy again, especially to use on my 6 month old this summer.</li>
            <li>the reality is that you just have to use a physical sunblock with either zinc oxide or titanium dioxide (aka - natural, mineral, physical sunblock).</li>
            <li>Used this item as a recommendation from a friend when I asked for a healthy sunscreen for endurance athletes and so far I am not impressed.</li>
            <li>We live in a beach town and i am out walking to the park or store with my son every single morning.</li>
            <li>The first time I opened it, a clear liquid oozed out, returned it, and a few days later got a replacement which had the same problem!</li>
            <li>Hard to spread, requires a lot to get full coverage</li>
            <li>and we&#x27;ll continue to buy (unless something better comes along), but the tube is very small and doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li>and we&#x27;ll continue to buy (unless something better comes along), but the tube is very small and doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li>There are, to my knowledge, no credible studies that show this is possible or, if possible, that zinc is harmful when absorbed.</li>
            <li>Thick sunblock that does the trick and doesn&#x27;t contain a lot of harmful chemicals in many other brands.</li>
            <li>There is some concern that the smaller particles may be small enough to be absorbed through your skin and into your body.  </li>
            <li>Chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks.</li>
            <li>My other thinkbaby sunscreen that I ordered at same time is normal.</li>
            <li>A little thick to put on but no Nasty chemicals on your skin.</li>
            <li>Only drawback is that it&#x27;s hard to remove, but worth the effort for protection.</li>

            <li> Great coverage and protection.  </li>
            <li> I have used Badger &amp; Elemental Herbs (both very effective)</li>
            <li> I have tried many, but for me, this is THE BEST!</li>
            <li> Awesome safe and waterproof sunscreen.</li>
            <li> After 3.5 hours in the afternoon sun, I was thrilled to see that I didn&#x27;t burn at all where I put the sunscreen on!</li>
            <li> burned!&lt;br /&gt;It covers great, smells good, and it does not sting, burn, or cause irritation.</li>
            <li> It is so wonderful to be able to go running in my contact lenses - previosuly, I always had to wear my glasses because sunscreen stung my eyes.</li>
            <li> I will say that it does have a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a pleasant citrus scent, and we know it doesn&#x27;t hurt his skin.</li>
            <li> It provides great protection, goes on nicely and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> The smell is the best of any sunscreen I&#x27;ve used, and the ingredients are the best by far as well.</li>
            <li> Good zinc-based sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> good spreader.plenty of protection.i&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
            <li> I am incredibly upset as I researched safe sunscreens fora month before our trip.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s good for outdoor activity.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re using an aerosol can, then you&#x27;re not using a good sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This seemed like a good choice.  </li>
            <li> It provides good protection and</li>
            <li> Good sun protection and not too greasy.</li>
            <li> screen.&lt;br /&gt;Another brand to try, which has a good consistency</li>
            <li> say: if the sun does not give you a rash and you need good protection and you are not worried about good absorption, use this.</li>
            <li> It seems to be a good alternative to toxic sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, blends in well, great protection!</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t the easiest to rub in and it takes a lot for good coverage.  </li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> We all loved this.</li>
            <li> you know the batch is good.  </li>
            <li> Good product, good delivery.  </li>
            <li> I have a good tan.</li>
            <li> I have friends with whiter fair skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame that a company with a good product has no idea how to treat a customer.</li>
            <li> Good smell too.</li>
            <li> This is one of the good ones.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ve very pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ve very pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li> Very healthy and works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the sunscreen otherwise, and I would buy it again if I can be assured it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m not convinced the ingredients are that great - many of them are known irritants.  </li>
            <li> It smelled lovely and went on great.  </li>
            <li> The good ones were creamy, homogenized, effective.  </li>
            <li> Also has a nice pleasant smell which was a nice surprise.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this sunscreen before and love it!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> I will be buying more!</li>
            <li> Now buying again for both my daughter and myself - it is safe for kids too!</li>
            <li> We love this sunscreen!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this product...love the price!  </li>
            <li> also love how this sunscreen smells!</li>
            <li> Light weight, easy to rub... GREAT!</li>
            <li> Amazon sells it for a great price and free shipping.</li>
            <li> Smelled great, went on smooth, no complaints.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of greasy</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Very effective.  </li>
            <li> None of us particularly liked the smell, which reminded me of orange creamsicles.</li>
            <li> I put them in the fridge overnight thinking they were just warm from being shipped</li>
            <li> I still get a nice tan afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I have even tried making my own sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Which I really liked because it worked.</li>
            <li> I wear sunscreen like its my job and this one REALLY works the best.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and doesn&#x27;t feel oily at all.  </li>
            <li> Smells nice.</li>
            <li> Also smells nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep looking for something that&#x27;s both chemical-free AND effective.</li>
            <li> you do not need a lot to be effective.....</li>
            <li> You really need to slather it on every couple of hours for best results-</li>
            <li> It has nice smell to it.  </li>
            <li> ThinkSport ranks high every year on the best sunscreen list and we agree.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product, but I also received four from a batch that was super watery.  </li>
            <li> It smells good and blends in easily.  </li>
            <li> This is one of best products I have found for water-related sports and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> A good sunscreen formula should not have more than a handful of 90% plus certified organic ingredients and FREE OF; fragrances, perfumes, additives, softeners, thickening agents, gums, alcohol, biologically harmful chemicals like Avobenzone, Oxybenzone, UV Chemical absorbers, paraben, phthalates, PABA and 1,4 dioxane.</li>

            <li> The first tube I ordered was great.  </li>
            <li> Most importantly, it works great and is chemical free.</li>
            <li> Nice product blends in easily.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily and is effective.</li>
            <li> Top rated by EWG.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to reapply after swimming, though.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s much better than the competition.</li>
            <li> I love the product.  </li>
            <li> Bottle came filled with water!</li>
            <li> Every time I try to use the tube, more liquid pours out.</li>
            <li> but  this sat on top of our skin and appeared ashy on even the fairest of my family.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen and it goes on well.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used many, many varieties of sunscreen/sunblock.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t burn your eyes like many others and not as toxic as most.</li>
            <li> I came across this from the EWG website, where it got a 1 - the best possible - rating.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t put it on my face because I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would clog my pores.</li>
            <li> I did try so many sunscreen creames and this one does not give me any skin allergy.</li>
            <li> The way they get away with saying things like that is by making it sweat proof so that means that it is better than another brand that isn&#x27;t sweat proof and has an SPF rating of 50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Safe ingredients.</li>
            <li> As a distance runner I love this product.</li>
            <li> And this rubs in better than most zinc sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this and keep it in my bag all the time</li>
            <li> This one smells better than the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> My favorite part of the Thinksport sunscreen is how well it rubs in.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite sunscreens.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, it is recommended by EWG SkinSafe website as a safe sunscreen, and it smells nice too.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; product, without the harmful chemicals found in most mass market brands.</li>
            <li> One tip: be sure to shake it up and squeeze the tube a bit to counter any settling of the ingredients before opening.</li>
            <li> Also - I love what it does NOT have - chemicals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is also rated only a 1 on ewg.org which is great!!</li>
            <li> Works great, but was very drying to the skin (or maybe it was the sun, but this sure didn&#x27;t help).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Product gets 3 stars because I ordered 3 more tubes</li>
            <li> They told me that I had to buy 4 more tubes from them, and then they would include 4 additional replacements for the defective product.</li>
            <li> ZO is insoluble in water, used in many industries, in ointments, creams and lotions.</li>
            <li> I researched &#x27;healthy&#x27; sunscreens to death.  </li>
            <li> I SOOOO wanted to love it.  </li>
            <li> I love to use it and reapply it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also one of the most affordable options.</li>
            <li> We have always seemed to do just fine using protective clothing and avoiding the sun from 10 to 2 and so on, but my new baby/toddler is very fair</li>
            <li> Works flawlessly every time, even after hiking several hours in full sun and sweat in desert heat and sand!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen goes on easy, doesn&#x27;t leave you looking white, and smells great!</li>
            <li> Although it works and I like supporting LiveSTRONG, which I do their bike ride challenges, I think there are just as good products cheaper.</li>
            <li> best if put on lightly and only rubbed one direction....</li>
            <li> So….if you are lucky enough to get a good tube, the product is great.  </li>
            <li> As a redhead with very fair skin that loves to spend time outside, I’ve tried almost every drug store brand.</li>
            <li> Love this because it does not have a strong odor and works fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like heated vaseline than a smooth cream.</li>
            <li> It had much better application compared to its competitors for chemical free sunblock.  </li>
            <li> I was in search of a sunscreen product that met my criteria:  animal cruelty free &amp; safe.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really surprised by all of the great reviews for this product.  </li>
            <li> When it comes to sunscreens we&#x27;ve tried them all - the kind that burn your eyes, ones that go on thick and gooey, the spray kind, the unspreadable kind, the stinky kind - you name it!</li>
            <li> Also goes on easily.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t burn easily, tan very quickly so the spf 50+ is what I ordered.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come off easily</li>
            <li> This stuff does not rub in easy, but with some work it will blend in.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect it to blend easily.</li>
            <li> And it does not wash off easily.</li>
            <li> easy to apply on and wash off.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a strong sunscreen for my daughter, who plays soccer in the strong Arizona sun.</li>
            <li> It does not have a strong scent and works for hours of outdoor play.</li>
            <li> This is one of the first sun blocks of any kind I have used.  </li>
            <li> I really want to love this stuff, it smells great, goes on really well</li>
            <li> Although it works fine</li>
            <li> Works fine for me.  </li>
            <li> Worked fine.</li>
            <li> My bottle was SUPER watery!</li>
            <li> Keeps my very &amp;#34;pale&amp;#34; child sunburn free!!</li>
            <li> It goes on easily, isn&#x27;t greasy, and does a good job as far as protection.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell, is very moisturizing (often do not need a moisturizer on my face when I use), rubs into skin well, leaving no white residue and leaves your skin with a nice healthy glow.  </li>
            <li> As a BRCA1 gene carrier, I have been looking for a sunscreen to use this summer while working in the yard that is mineral based and paraben free.</li>
            <li> You should feel great about not using synthetic compounds, which could potentially cause harm to your body!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is a great option for anyone looking for a physical blocker (as opposed to a chemical blocker).</li>
            <li> Hubby and I liked this so much</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave you white and rubs in great.</li>
            <li> (also, you will need to add a light layer of powder to reduce the shine)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I liked it so much that I bought extras to give as gifts to my aunts and friends.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to see a more reasonably priced, bulk size.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to see a more reasonably priced, bulk size.  </li>
            <li> After much research &amp; use of several products, I found Thinksport to best meet my needs.  </li>
            <li> An excellent product; only writing a review to advise of shaking the tube very well before use -</li>
            <li> I did a lot of online research and this product was at the top of most lists, and the price was decent here on Amazon, so we tried it.</li>
            <li> I originally bought it because it rates a &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; on the ewg.org site, meaning it&#x27;s chemical free and considered a &amp;#34;very safe&amp;#34; product.  </li>
            <li> Very happy with this - spreads nicely, not as thick as other safe brands.</li>
            <li> This is a great mix but contains too many ingredients and all are non-organic ingredients as well when I can get mixes with less ingredients, organic ingredients and not over 30SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Was so excited to use a mineral based sunscreen.</li>
            <li> If you shake it vigorously for a minute, it regains its original consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I wanted a reef friendly sun screen while sailing around the islands of Tahiti.  </li>
            <li> The higher the percentage the better.</li>
            <li> On the first trip out which was hiking I literally painted my face and arms with this product and thought I was okay, but to my horror when I got home</li>
            <li> Just be prepared to look like Casper the friendly ghost?</li>
            <li> ZO is like mud, the higher, the better protection but ZO stays on the surface of the skin for protection so</li>
            <li> ZO is like mud, the higher, the better protection but ZO stays on the surface of the skin for protection so</li>
            <li> Great for running long distances.</li>
            <li> family has very fair skin (red heads) and we have to use sunscreen for a large part of the year.</li>
            <li> This is a great sunscreen - rated well by the EWG and actually works, a rare combination.</li>
            <li> Works very well and is free of harmful chemicals unlike many mainstream sunscreens.</li>
            <li> So far this is my favorite sunscreen of the safe zinc oxide type.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different brands - those recommended by EWG, Consumer Reports, and through my own research.</li>
            <li> I had been purchasing a popular brand of sunscreen (expensive) because I thought it was the best product to use.</li>
            <li> (Bonus points right away)!</li>
            <li> Out of all of the brands I have tried, by far this is my favorite brand and one of the more economical choices out there.  </li>
            <li> Good stuff, no problem with white pastey look.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite sunscreen to use on my whole family.  </li>
            <li> We returned it for a full refund and no problems.</li>
            <li> its not a bad smell-</li>
            <li> I have been searching high and low for a good sunscreen that has zinc oxide without all the damaging chemicals!  </li>
            <li> It was pretty strong.</li>
            <li> We suffered pretty strong burns.</li>
            <li> But be forewarned that the healthier sunscreens available and there are several very reputable and effective brands will not be as smooth and translucent as the above mentioned.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s much better than the competition.ct is distinct, fairly strong, and doesn&#x27;t go away completely until after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;-The price.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t bother me and the scent dissipates fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> I was worried when I heard about the trouble with Livestrong, but I&#x27;m glad thinksport is still making this good sunscreen affordable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a win all around, and is now my go-to sunscreen for all-day intense hikes in the Southern California sun.</li>
            <li> Luckily one of our friends recommended this brand and we&#x27;ve been fans ever since.</li>
            <li> It works quickly, doesn&#x27;t smell, and doesn&#x27;t make me cry.  </li>
            <li> Compared to other healthy sunscreen products I&#x27;ve purchased, this rubs in much more easily and does not have a greasy feel to it.</li>
            <li> But overall, I am very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> It you struggle with melasma (dark spots on the face that are greatly aggravated by sun exposure)</li>
            <li> good on dry skin.  </li>
            <li> That said, this is a very emollient sunscreen and is easy to blend</li>
            <li> and neither I nor my 10 and 7 year olds have ever had a sunburn not using sunblock, and we all got one the first time we used this!  </li>
            <li> It blends in nicely so you don&#x27;t have a pasty white face.  </li>
            <li> We have tried a number of titanium dioxide/zinc sunscreens and this is our favorite so far.</li>
            <li> It is worth it</li>
            <li> It is worth it</li>
            <li> Our family outing to the beach was a success and none of us got burned when applying this sunscreen as directed.</li>
            <li> We have been loving the Thinksport sunscreen, and I just ordered our second bottle.</li>
            <li> The scent is &amp;#34;barely there&amp;#34; and just smells a bit fresh.  </li>
            <li> Pricy, but worth it to not have all the chemicals.</li>
            <li> make my own sunscreen but for times when I do not, I need the same formula as I use in my organic sunscreen mix with fewer ingredients.</li>
            <li> make my own sunscreen but for times when I do not, I need the same formula as I use in my organic sunscreen mix with fewer ingredients.</li>
            <li> Yes, it leaves a whitish color on your skin, but all zinc-based sunscreens do if you apply enough to be effective.</li>
            <li> This and any of the other ThinkSport physical blocker sunscreens (ThinkBaby and LiveStrong) are the best on the market.  </li>
            <li> Most high zinc sunscreens leave some white cast, and I&#x27;m ok with that,</li>
            <li> Sunscreen goes on easy, rubs in easy and thoroughly without leaving white or purple marks or looking greasy.</li>
            <li> Tip- don&#x27;t get in the water right away</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t leave her white.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to rub in and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin matted over with a white film.</li>
            <li> There is no fragrance added to this but the smell of the product is distinct, fairly strong, and doesn&#x27;t go away completely until after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;-The price.  </li>
            <li> will try to remember to update and see if I notice a difference in my melasma, this is my first time using a sunscreen as powerful as this (20% zinc)</li>
            <li> I find it very easy to apply to my small children as it rubs in easily and disappears quickly.  </li>
            <li> I ordered ThinkSport Kids from different seller last week and the product is great.</li>
            <li> I usually avoid it, but the orange scent is pretty mild and pleasant.</li>
            <li> The citrus smell was a little strong for my taste, but otherwise a fine sunscreen!</li>
            <li> the light citrus smell is just lovely (especially when compared to many other sunscreens).</li>
            <li> It prevented burning and stayed on while walking 18 holes, sweating, in the hot sun.</li>
            <li> but I was willing to overlook it - if it worked.</li>
            <li> (I hope that if anyone is aware of a study, they will comment with a link.)</li>
            <li> Still, the concern is enough that many companies are switching to non-nano.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re just switching to physical sunscreens, you can expect to put a lot more time and effort into application than with the chemical brands and Thinksport</li>

            <li> I  found the price NOT outrageously expensive like some.  </li>
            <li> and I worried that would not be enough to keep him sun safe.</li>
            <li> But i was able to get this sun block to rub in so that I did not have a white tint to my screen.  </li>
            <li> Sunscreen has to protect from UVA and UVB and most sunscreens only do one.</li>
            <li> My first try was &#x27;ThinkBaby&#x27;.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;thinksport&#x27; is even better as it stays on longer and actually works.</li>
            <li> I am really liking this sunscreen!  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried so many of the physical sunscreens, but Thinksport is our current favorite.</li>
            <li> So the higher price of Thinksport doesn&#x27;t bother me, and living in Florida</li>
            <li> Many of the cheaper sun screens made my face puffy, red, and itchy.  </li>
            <li> We were there for 5 hot and sunny hours.</li>
            <li> I was burnt to a crisp.</li>
            <li> However, we were all burnt to a crisp after just one day trying it.  </li>
            <li> I did exactly what the label wanted us to do (I am an avid sunscreen wearer and have always applied it correctly) and re-applied again and again.  </li>
            <li> It smells like a sweet nice lotion but not strong.</li>
            <li> We tan pretty easily, and it does leave a white tint.  </li>
            <li> The tubes I received were full nothing but a clear oily substance.</li>
            <li> If you have very oily skin, apply sparingly the first time.  </li>
            <li> Slight odor but nice consistency, not too runny.</li>
            <li> I applied this three times in a 5-hr period to myself and my 3-yr old on a mild Spring day in the Midwest and it did not work AT ALL.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, you will like this product even more.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works well, does not leave a white film on my skin &amp; is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> This stuff does not rub in easily at all - it&#x27;s reminiscent of Destin regarding texture.</li>
            <li> It goes on white and absorbs easily and provides unbeatable protection.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky or very white, but the citrus scent is extremely strong.</li>
            <li> I switched to physical sunscreens a few years ago and have been searching for a brand that is effective and easy to rub in ever since.  </li>
            <li> Mainly, because It blends better, but because of the high spf it is still white sunblock.</li>
            <li> To be fair, though, my skin is very pale and the white cast may be more visible on people with a little more melanin.&lt;br /&gt;-Not greasy.  </li>
            <li> We bought some of the thinkbaby for our little guy and liked it for ourselves, so we bought this too.</li>
            <li> Great coverage but tough to rub in.</li>
            <li> Hands down the BEST children&#x27;s sunscreen I have tried (and I have purchased 6 other natural style sunscreens).  </li>
            <li> hard to come off when showering.but that is good you know its working.</li>
            <li> They spread easily, are not greasy, and do not leave white residue like many other zinc sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> We really like this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Really bummed that this didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much that I bought a bigger tube of it recently.</li>
            <li> Very water proof since I go swimming and paddling a lot in the ocean.  </li>
            <li> I read reviews here that said this very thing but gave the product the benefit of the doubt thinking maybe they didn&#x27;t put it on correctly, etc.</li>
            <li> After some time, I have noticed that it separates in the tube and gets really watery.</li>
            <li> It also dries much faster than others we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> You will also really need to wash it off when you shower, like with a washcloth, otherwise you might feel a residue.</li>
            <li> This tube, used very sparingly, got us through 2 applications of my son and me.</li>
            <li> My son doesn’t like to put sunscreen on his face, but he loves the smell of ThinkSport so much that he doesn’t mind with this brand</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it protects very well.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t really describe it.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Like that it doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot to cover well and didn&#x27;t have any sunburns.</li>
            <li> Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one, blocks both UVA (320-400 nm) and UVB (280-320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light.</li>
            <li> /&gt;SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream.</li>
            <li> /&gt;SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream.</li>
            <li> It really stays put.</li>
            <li> If you have made the wise choice to ditch the chemical-laden sunscreen (which actually cause many forms of skin cancer) products sold at drug stores and department stores you are already a step ahead of the game.  </li>
            <li> I really love this stuff, especially because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine for surf sessions as long as it&#x27;s not midday when the sun is blazing.</li>
            <li> Additionally, while I am running the white film becomes even more apparent once I begin to perspire.  </li>
            <li> When I first put it on, you get a whiff of strong chemical odor trying to be hidden with what my wife calls a &amp;#34;fruity scent.&amp;#34; Soon after, the real odor comes blazing through.</li>
            <li> I applied it once this past Saturday and stayed out in the sun for over 2 hours when the temperatures rose to 115, and it seems to have protected me well.</li>
            <li> Protects my skin really well as a nice, thick cream that blends really well.</li>
            <li> This stuff is very sticky and you really have to rub it in, but it never, ever stings my eyes or irritates my sensitive skin like most other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> If that bothers you, than you might consider a different sunscreen, but I don&#x27;t mind a little residue to get good coverage.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen didn&#x27;t rub in smoothly over this dry patch.  </li>
            <li> Easy to put on and has no real smell to it.</li>
            <li> Worked as expected, goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t smell.  </li>
            <li> Reapplication, of course, is necessary after hours of water exposure.&lt;br /&gt;-Easier to rub in than most physical sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> The cream comes out white but disappears fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> There were better rated sunscreens and more expensive sunscreens, but for the price and the ingredients this one was a no brainer.</li>
            <li> After doing some research and looking at all the fairly good but mixed reviews for this product I decided to buy 5 bottles of it which was I think maybe a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I sweat a decent amount and even after working out, it keeps working.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase this &amp; highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended in my book.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is easier to apply and doesn&#x27;t make your face look pasty, but they are high in toxins.</li>
            <li> I will keep it for use on my hands, but there are other natural sunscreens that have better aesthetics.</li>
            <li> This may or may not mean something.  </li>
            <li> for many, high ZO will not work since it will be too heavy.</li>
            <li> for many, high ZO will not work since it will be too heavy.</li>
            <li> I do see a little white residue collecting in my lines &amp; creases, but not bad at all; no where near the ghostly look you get from many zinc oxide sunscreens.</li>
            <li> so you can see where you missed, and then dries clear as long as you smooth it out.</li>
            <li> My kids and I wore it in direct sun for 2 hours, and it worked really well.  </li>
            <li> It is pricey but in my opinion worth paying extra to not have carcinogenic chemicals on your baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> Not sure it really works, we still get tanned and we tan even more when in the pool.</li>
            <li> that come with skin exposure to the sun.he skin do not get absorbed into the body, do not enter the bloodstream, and are not a threat to human health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a nice initial scent to it, although my family says that it smells like typical beach sunscreen.</li>
            <li> As with most mineral sunscreens, it tends to be difficult to wash off but Castile Soap is an easy remedy for that.</li>
            <li> The amount of zinc oxide is just right; it rubs in without leaving my face all white.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is great--and it has a light citrus-y cent, doesn&#x27;t smell like other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I might have to reserve it for long all day activities (beach days, hiking, etc..) and use a cheaper alternative for the more frequent 1-3 hours of outside time.</li>
            <li> I really sweat, so my former sunscreens (mostly NO-AD, Neutrogena) ran down and caused necklines to turn rusty orange, and nothing would take the stains out.</li>
            <li> None of them \\&quot;rub in\\&quot; to the point that the white is completely gone, unless it doesn&#x27;t have as much zinc to begin with, or you have rubbed it so thin that it won&#x27;t be very effective.</li>
            <li> I am a sailor with very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> For a non-chemical sunscreen, it rubs in easier than most; however, it is a white based sunscreen due to its 20% zinc content.  </li>
            <li> We purchased a tube of each and discovered that the ingredients and the product are exactly the same.  </li>
            <li> We purchased a tube of each and discovered that the ingredients and the product are exactly the same.  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen is COMPLETELY ineffective!</li>
            <li> And so far it has not caused rust stains on the necklines of my tops!</li>
            <li> After that, it stays mixed, i just had to do that on first opening it.</li>
            <li> ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS -2 ZO which has a mean particle size greater than 30nm, when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body, do not enter the bloodstream, and are not a threat to human health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought two bottles at once right before a long vacation.</li>
            <li> but like I said it&#x27;s still good product just not good enough for surfing.</li>
            <li> I once read a review of sunscreen in Men&#x27;s Journal [...] that basically explained that most sunscreen is not very good and almost all of the advertisments and packaging is missleading.</li>
            <li> Wish they&#x27;d make a larger size which should be able to bring the price down a bit.  </li>
            <li> Normal sunscreens do not smell good and its weird to walk around reaking like that as an adult.</li>
            <li> I wear sunscreen every day and have tried so many different brands - cheap, expensive, drugstore, high end, and for now the search is over.</li>
            <li> It is odd that it claims &amp;#34;does not have an obtrusive smell that many organic sunscreens have&amp;#34; ... it does, hence only the 3-star rating instead of 4.</li>
            <li> Because this is a physical blocker, it doesn&#x27;t wear off like many other suncreens, so if you&#x27;re not wet or sweating, it will work all day (or until you shower) without reapplication.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s the same as ThinkBaby, I usually just shop around to find whichever one is the better price at that particular moment.</li>
            <li> I wish I could love this, with its low EWG rating, nice application, and unobtrusive scent--but I&#x27;ve had two bad burns now while using this and reapplying every two hours, and it can&#x27;t just be user error.</li>
            <li> Upon opening one tube, clear liquid came pouring out instead of lotion.  </li>
            <li> if you want something clear- keep looking.</li>
            <li> Thumbs up so far.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old always complains about sunscreens getting into his eyes and stinging (even the baby sunscreens irritate his eyes) but this sunscreen did not budge once I applied it to his face</li>
            <li> It is also non-greasy and rubbed in very well (no white streaks).</li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen to send with my 6 year old to camp.  </li>
            <li> To top it all of, Thinksport is rated with a score of 1 on EWG.org&#x27;s website which is one of the lowest ratings (lowest being the least toxic) you can find in sunscreen products.  </li>
            <li> Almost 2 weeks in Maui and so far no damage.</li>
            <li> and when I get hit with direct sunlight during the summer months I get all itchy.</li>
            <li> It does leave your skin white, but I&#x27;d much rather have that than skin cancer.  </li>
            <li> I have converted a whole cross country team to this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> The longest run I&#x27;ve been on so far while using this product has been 16 miles.  </li>
            <li> but I was surprised.</li>
            <li> and they told me to buy directly from their website, which I did</li>
            <li> I used this for my 3 young kids and myself as well.  </li>
            <li> and it was completely liquified.  </li>
            <li> works!!!&lt;br /&gt;I also have sensitive skin, and this hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin yet.</li>
            <li> Non-irritating, non-allergenic and non-comedogenic, used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve put this to the test time and time again, climbing Mount Whitney at 14,500 feet, trekking 18 miles across the desert in full sun all day, sweating a ton on various long hikes, and still it holds up</li>
            <li> I had a patch of dry, peeling skin from a sunburn (thanks to a different brand of sunscreen) when I first used this.  </li>
            <li> This brand costs less than the popular but extremely toxic, neutrogena broad spectrum helioplex.</li>
            <li> Wait about 10 minutes for it to dry on you first.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you buy some serious lotion to put on when you get inside.</li>
            <li> Remember this is a sport sunscreen, SPF 50 (high amount of zinc), and not something to wear daily to the office.</li>
            <li> So if your priorities are high SPF, zinc (non-nano if possible), and water resistant, then buy with confidence.</li>
            <li> Arrived watery, which at first I thought might have been the heat from shipping, but it never returned to the creamy consistency of Think Baby and Think Kids that I expected.</li>
            <li> I used it for golf outings in a southern state where I live.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no sunburns and no noticeable sun damage (new and worsening freckles, white spots, etc.)</li>
            <li> I live in Australia and wanted a physical sunscreen because I am in the sun a lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fair-skinned outdoorsy girl, and I burn easily even late into the Summer</li>
            <li> I especially appreciate it is free of harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Like others, I did all my research on the best but least expensive non-harmful sunscreen and settled on this one.</li>
            <li> Not at all like the traditional sunscreen smell, but a faint good scent -</li>
            <li> I was out in the sun for the better part of a day on several different occasions and each time my face got a little burned!  </li>
            <li> I wanted sport protection with no chemicals and broad spectrum coverage.</li>
            <li> It has SPF 50 broad spectrum waterproof protection.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Be aware that, as with any high mineral content sunscreen, you are going to have to deal with the slight white hue that goes along with it.</li>
            <li> This stuff seems great, especially considering the weird smells and texture of other all natural sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> BABO has 22% ZO with conventional not organic ingredients which is a higher amount of ZO than an organic brand like BADGER with 18.5% ZO.</li>
            <li> BABO has 22% ZO with conventional not organic ingredients which is a higher amount of ZO than an organic brand like BADGER with 18.5% ZO.</li>
            <li> The adult and kids one are the same but the adults one is cheaper so go with that one.</li>
            <li> I have tried nearly every singe sunscreen rated 2 or lower on EWG.org (skin deep) website.  </li>
            <li> , it completely soaks in to my skin, without leaving a white shadow!&lt;br /&gt;Awesomeness.</li>
            <li> I used Thinksport  for the first time while at the Wildlife Park with my 4 year old and a group of friends a few days ago.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, like a thick lotion.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not fragrance-free, but the subtle citrus scent is pleasant, not overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li> Would recommend and will definitely buy again, especially to use on my 6 month old this summer.</li>
            <li> the reality is that you just have to use a physical sunblock with either zinc oxide or titanium dioxide (aka - natural, mineral, physical sunblock).</li>
            <li> Used this item as a recommendation from a friend when I asked for a healthy sunscreen for endurance athletes and so far I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> We live in a beach town and i am out walking to the park or store with my son every single morning.</li>
            <li> The first time I opened it, a clear liquid oozed out, returned it, and a few days later got a replacement which had the same problem!</li>
            <li> Hard to spread, requires a lot to get full coverage</li>
            <li> and we&#x27;ll continue to buy (unless something better comes along), but the tube is very small and doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> and we&#x27;ll continue to buy (unless something better comes along), but the tube is very small and doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> There are, to my knowledge, no credible studies that show this is possible or, if possible, that zinc is harmful when absorbed.</li>
            <li> Thick sunblock that does the trick and doesn&#x27;t contain a lot of harmful chemicals in many other brands.</li>
            <li> There is some concern that the smaller particles may be small enough to be absorbed through your skin and into your body.  </li>
            <li> Chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks.</li>
            <li> My other thinkbaby sunscreen that I ordered at same time is normal.</li>
            <li> A little thick to put on but no Nasty chemicals on your skin.</li>
            <li> Only drawback is that it&#x27;s hard to remove, but worth the effort for protection.</li>
            <li> My husband and I spent a week in the DR, coming from a Northern New England wicked long winter.&lt;br /&gt;Neither of us</li>
            <li> A good sunscreen is not easy or convenient (sorry).</li>
            <li> It is certainly possible we are particularly sensitive to some ingredient since other people seem to like this a lot, but based on our experience I could not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It is a bit tough to smooth on, but I mix it with a lighter moisturizer and my kids don&#x27;t complain of white stuff on their faces, and it seems to stay on for a long time.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this product because of the lack of bad ingredients, but it is not worth the large price tag for as much as we burned after putting it on as often as the bottle suggested.</li>
            <li> Because it actually has zinc oxide in it as a physical sunscreen, it is thicker and a little harder to spread over large areas and will leave a bit of white over your skin.</li>
            <li> Went for it due to its sensitive aspects, but in a month in Morocco I got burned quite a bit on my nose, despite continued applications.  </li>
            <li> and I know many others as well, is that the non-toxic sunscreen products is usually the thick, greasy, white paste-like consistency and the the difficulty rubbing the product into the area applied.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It’s not too thick, spreads easily and evenly, no tacky feeling, doesn’t have a heavy white tint after you rub it in and no issues with wearing off from sweating.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and is not super thick.  </li>
            <li> It offered long lasting projection.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going on a long vacation, get them in time to test and return if necessary!</li>
            <li> It is perfectly fine, but the problem is that it is still so expensive compared with regular sunscreen.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, this is the same formulation as the ThinkBaby product we had been using when our sensitive-skinned boy was a little baby.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think the 3 oz tube will last very long.  </li>
            <li> I put it on, let it dry for 30 minutes, went outside to walk my dogs for 15 minutes</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t go on white like other sunscreens (that don&#x27;t have a bunch of chemicals) which is definitely a big plus.</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve known something was wrong when I heard a swishing sound inside the tube.  </li>
            <li> Just a dab of this stuff goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I’ve been trying to switch to natural products and have used quite a few mineral based sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I don’t know how long this 3 oz.</li>
            <li> I mean, really burnt.  </li>
            <li> but if you rub it in you don&#x27;t get a white pallor (as other reviewers suggested).  </li>
            <li> - doc says melasma will take a long time to fade!</li>
            <li> I checked 6 other unopen tubes, they are all the same, feel like liquid inside.</li>
            <li> After over 2 hours of extreme sweating in the direct sun, I didn&#x27;t have even a bit of a tan - much less a burn.</li>
            <li> however once applied, I had a white film on my clothing as well as my skin despite trying to be very careful during the application process.  </li>
            <li> After hearing about the bad chemicals in my Neutrogena sunscreen I&#x27;ve been using for ten years and how products with zinc oxide are much better, I thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> you have to be careful when applying to not put it on too thick and not to rub it in too much.....</li>
            <li> We re-apply every 2 hours when at the pool or the beach, and haven&#x27;t gotten a single sunburn since we&#x27;ve been using Thinksport.</li>
            <li> The only caveat is that it will leave a white residue when applied liberally, but that&#x27;s to be expected, given the lack of harsh chemicals in the product.</li>
            <li> They slosh when I shake the tube, and when I squeeze the tube, only a clear liquid (like water) comes out with perhaps a few small bits of white.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After shaking VIGOROUSLY things seem to have mixed up, but this was only after a wasted half my order trying to see if there was lotion in the tube after the water.  </li>
            <li> I mixed in a little moisturizer and that helped, but it still looked a little gross and scaly after application.&lt;br /&gt;-The</li>
            <li> When rubbed in, I didn&#x27;t notice the white cast that is common with physical brands at all.  </li>
            <li> My experience is that this will protect for at least 4+ hrs of direct sun and exercise without reapplication.  </li>
            <li> I spent tons of time outdoors boating, running, gardening, etc</li>
            <li> and the whole family is burned worse than we thought.</li>
            <li> And still got pink.</li>
            <li> I experience this minimally with Thinksport.  </li>
            <li> I had absolutely no sign of burning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lower SPF zinc sunscreens may be a little less white</li>
            <li> Thinksport is creamy and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way with this one.</li>
            <li> First, this product is difficult to remove in the bath.</li>
            <li> but I still managed to get pink on my bike ride this morning after two applications!  </li>
            <li> Price in line with other &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; suntan lotion.</li>
            <li> it takes some effort to apply evenly and usually leaves a whitish color, probably from the necessary zinc.</li>
            <li> BUT...  the last three tubes I bought (labeled as I noted in the title of my review), on Subscribe &amp; Save from Amazon, are NOT the product I had in the past.  </li>
            <li> Wait 5 minutes or so and do other parts of my morning routine&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> For a small investment, sunscreens may offer the possibility of sun burn, pain, cancer, medical bills, pain killers, etc.</li>
            <li> For a small investment, sunscreens may offer the possibility of sun burn, pain, cancer, medical bills, pain killers, etc.</li>
            <li> only thing I don&#x27;t like it about it is that it feels like it is hard to wash off at night.</li>
            <li> sunblocks I&#x27;ve used made me &amp;#34;sweat&amp;#34; pretty bad, especially my arms.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this sunscreen should be advertised as 50 plus when its clearly not, in fact it doesn&#x27;t even come close.</li>
            <li> Surf on average 2 hours per session.</li>
            <li> It is a bit thick, so allow time for it to spread properly.</li>
            <li> This stuff goes on thick and you need to spend some time rubbing to remove the white.</li>
            <li> Thinksport should tone down on the scent.</li>
            <li> It did not feel too heavy or grimy like some other sunscreens do.</li>
            <li> Has a slight scent to it</li>
            <li> This has a slight fragrance of lemon.</li>
            <li> The other bottle was like water with a few little lotiony blobs floating around.</li>
            <li> 50SPF is not a good idea, infact anything over 30SPF is only a marketing tool.</li>
            <li> It even lasts through my running and hiking sweat (miracle)!!&lt;br /&gt;And, it&#x27;s not full of Chemicals.</li>
            <li> Runs in eyes a little out in the water.</li>
            <li> It will probably give you a little lighter look, but all \\&quot;good\\&quot; sunscreen will be like this.</li>
            <li> So I often put on a little mineral powder and that helped the greasy feel.  </li>
            <li> No smell and won&#x27;t burn your little ones eyes.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t awful but it just kind of smelled odd for a sunblock.  </li>
            <li> The only issue is the viscosity - the lotion is very thick.</li>
            <li> I was at the practice range warming up for a round of golf and noticed that the maintenance crew seemed to have just sprayed some chemicals on the turf.</li>
            <li> It took about 15-30 minutes before I realized that the odor was from the sunscreen I applied a few minutes before arriving.</li>
            <li> but so far, not impressed.</li>
            <li> it feels heavy and greasy on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Seem to stay on well and not to heavy.  </li>
            <li> For me it is too heavy to use on face.</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday.</li>
            <li> and now I have a sunscreen that I like and use on my kids everyday.</li>
            <li> walk everyday for over an hr and haven&#x27;t gotten &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; yet, so I would say this thing</li>
            <li> so there are few issues with BABO formula.</li>
            <li> so there are few issues with BABO formula.</li>
            <li> Not too difficult to rub in and doesn&#x27;t leave white residue like other sunscreen.</li>
            <li> yeah, I burned pretty bad.</li>
            <li> Other chemical-free sunscreens I have tried are thick and pasty, which make it hard to rub in.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick which is expected for this type of sunscreen.</li>
            <li> not so much so that its painful to use.  </li>
            <li> The product does work as well as if not better than the Neutrogena sunscreen I was using.</li>
            <li> and I could not get past these issues.</li>
            <li> This brand lasts as well, if not better, then the chemical brands I used to use that claimed to be waterproof.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s definitely something wrong with the tubes.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it works as well as some others on the market.  </li>
            <li> No more rashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to have to keep doing my research to see if there is a less-toxic regular sunscreen at a regular price :(</li>
            <li> and I was thinking it would be a bit hard to apply and rub in since some folks said it was thick</li>
            <li> and he never once complained.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s physically delicate, and she claimed that she never burns when she wears this product.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen I bought arrived my house too late.</li>
            <li> But, it leaves a crazy white cast.  </li>
            <li> It was thick and pasty and just never rubbed in well.</li>
            <li> It does go on thick</li>
            <li> It is not too thick to the point that you have to keep rubbing and rubbing until it is evenly distributed.  </li>
            <li> The sunscreen is thick but</li>
            <li> thick and leaves a film which my husband didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> Has a citrus scent (not overwhelming but noticeable!</li>
            <li> Been using for the past two summers!</li>
            <li> Very small size.</li>
            <li> but this is ridiculous</li>
            <li> Only time my kids got a sunburn was using this sunscreen :(</li>
            <li> The texture of this stuff is very thick</li>
            <li> Goes on very thick, almost like rubbing paste over your skin.</li>
            <li> Not happy, returning this product and buying from another destributer of Thinksport.</li>
            <li> Apply an additional thin layer just over the problem areas (where the meslasma congregates)&lt;br /&gt;5)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I think it&#x27;s too late for me to return the messed up bottle.</li>
            <li> While UVB rays are behind the redness of sunburn, UVA rays damage the skin&#x27;s DNA at a deeper layer.</li>
            <li> While UVB rays are behind the redness of sunburn, UVA rays damage the skin&#x27;s DNA at a deeper layer.</li>
            <li> Not happy and wouldn&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous!</li>
            <li> so I take sunscreen very seriously.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this was a bad batch?</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t as expensive as the ones that came up when I asked for zinc/titantium</li>
            <li> No rash or weird problems.  </li>
            <li> Seems expensive</li>
            <li> The biggest issue for me is that it’s definitely expensive...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product is expensive.</li>
            <li> The only option is to leave a message.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thinksport has terrible customer service, and you should not buy their product.</li>
            <li> So sad.</li>
            <li> Also really difficult to spread it across skin.</li>
            <li> Boy, was I wrong.</li>
            <li> My kids and I had the worst chapped cheeks and my body was SO dry.  </li>
            <li> I drove everyone mad asking for recommendations.  </li>
            <li> I might take in some bad chemicals, but it beats skin cancer.</li>
            <li> Did I get a bad bottle???</li>
            <li> Am I got 7 bad product or they all like this?</li>
            <li> It was not usable. :(</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t get it on easily, it&#x27;s worthless.</li>
            <li> Seems like a crap shoot though.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> and/or there is something in the ingredient list that causes skin reactions, because we all got a terrible rash/sunburn that took weeks to heal.  </li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>
            <li> Not to mention the nasty chemicals the EWG warns against.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The citrus smell was a little strong for my taste, but otherwise a fine sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Love this because it does not have a strong odor and works fine.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the cancer causing chemicals! It smells like a sweet nice lotion but not strong. Normal sunscreens do not smell good and its weird to walk around reaking like that as an adult. It applies well without residue at all. I love it!!!! The adult and kids one are the same but the adults one is cheaper so go with that one. Perfect product!!</li>
            <li> I thought this product was junk.  Went for it due to its sensitive aspects, but in a month in Morocco I got burned quite a bit on my nose, despite continued applications.  I&#x27;m going back to the Nivea 45+ for faces.  I might take in some bad chemicals, but it beats skin cancer.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this - spreads nicely, not as thick as other safe brands.</li>
            <li> Slight odor but nice consistency, not too runny. Rubs in as well as any of the mineral based sun screens. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> After hearing about the bad chemicals in my Neutrogena sunscreen I&#x27;ve been using for ten years and how products with zinc oxide are much better, I thought I would give it a try. I used it for golf outings in a southern state where I live. It goes on a bit heavier than I&#x27;m used to. It&#x27;s more like heated vaseline than a smooth cream. But because of that, you know it&#x27;s covering you. The product does work as well as if not better than the Neutrogena sunscreen I was using. It prevented burning and stayed on while walking 18 holes, sweating, in the hot sun. Although it works fine and it&#x27;s healthier than what I have been using, I will not be using it again. First, this product is difficult to remove in the bath. I use a nylon wash cloth (friends call this type of wash cloth a &amp;#34;ball scrubber,&amp;#34; because it&#x27;s quite abrasive. After bathing, you can still smell the product on your skin. It takes about 6-12hrs after bathing for the smell to go away. Speaking of the smell. When I first put it on, you get a whiff of strong chemical odor trying to be hidden with what my wife calls a &amp;#34;fruity scent.&amp;#34; Soon after, the real odor comes blazing through. I was at the practice range warming up for a round of golf and noticed that the maintenance crew seemed to have just sprayed some chemicals on the turf. It was pretty strong. It took about 15-30 minutes before I realized that the odor was from the sunscreen I applied a few minutes before arriving. I used this product about 15 times and I could not get past these issues. I will continue searching for safer products, but will pass on this one.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen works great.  I&#x27;m outside walking dogs at the local SPCA for almost 5 hours each of 4 days per week. I put this on in the a.m and it gives great protection all day.  This plus a big hat and I feel like I don&#x27;t have to worry about the sun.  I like that it has zinc oxide which is a wonderful sun blocker.  It blends in nicely so you don&#x27;t have a pasty white face.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This is a great sunscreen - rated well by the EWG and actually works, a rare combination. Also goes on easily.</li>
            <li> We really like this sunscreen.  Great protection.  For a non-chemical sunscreen, it rubs in easier than most; however, it is a white based sunscreen due to its 20% zinc content.  Helps if you apply it 15 mins or longer before going out into the sun.  Has a slight scent to it but it doesn&#x27;t bother me and the scent dissipates fairly quickly. Top rated by EWG.  We have tried a number of titanium dioxide/zinc sunscreens and this is our favorite so far.</li>
            <li> Thinksport Sunscreen is a very good product. My husband wears it every day for work because he is outside all day. I highly recommend this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, but I also received four from a batch that was super watery.  After shaking VIGOROUSLY things seem to have mixed up, but this was only after a wasted half my order trying to see if there was lotion in the tube after the water.  Of course, after a day of nonuse, the contents seem to have separated again in the tube I shook.  There is a definite defect in these.  Order elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and safe for kids as well!!!</li>
            <li> Good zinc-based sunscreen.  Worked well after an all-day Florida boating trip.  Make sure to reapply after swimming, though.</li>
            <li> Was so excited to use a mineral based sunscreen. I put it on, let it dry for 30 minutes, went outside to walk my dogs for 15 minutes and my face burned and now I look like a tomato. It&#x27;s kind of greasy but I was willing to overlook it - if it worked. Really bummed that this didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> good spreader.plenty of protection.i&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
            <li> I switched to physical sunscreens a few years ago and have been searching for a brand that is effective and easy to rub in ever since.  This is the best I&#x27;ve found yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Very effective.  I&#x27;ve had no sunburns and no noticeable sun damage (new and worsening freckles, white spots, etc.) since using this brand.&lt;br /&gt;-Good water resistance.  This brand lasts as well, if not better, then the chemical brands I used to use that claimed to be waterproof.  Reapplication, of course, is necessary after hours of water exposure.&lt;br /&gt;-Easier to rub in than most physical sunscreens.  When rubbed in, I didn&#x27;t notice the white cast that is common with physical brands at all.  To be fair, though, my skin is very pale and the white cast may be more visible on people with a little more melanin.&lt;br /&gt;-Not greasy.  This is a big problem I have with a lot of physical sunscreens.  The texture of this stuff is very thick but it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy and it doesn&#x27;t rub off on your clothes, car, belongings, etc&lt;br /&gt;-Non-nano zinc.  This may or may not mean something.  Nano particles are much, much smaller than non-nano particles.  There is some concern that the smaller particles may be small enough to be absorbed through your skin and into your body.  There are, to my knowledge, no credible studies that show this is possible or, if possible, that zinc is harmful when absorbed. (I hope that if anyone is aware of a study, they will comment with a link.) Still, the concern is enough that many companies are switching to non-nano.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Not good on dry skin.  I had a patch of dry, peeling skin from a sunburn (thanks to a different brand of sunscreen) when I first used this.  The sunscreen didn&#x27;t rub in smoothly over this dry patch.  I mixed in a little moisturizer and that helped, but it still looked a little gross and scaly after application.&lt;br /&gt;-The smell.  There is no fragrance added to this but the smell of the product is distinct, fairly strong, and doesn&#x27;t go away completely until after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;-The price.  This is one of the more expensive physical sunscreen brands we&#x27;ve tried.  It is worth it and we&#x27;ll continue to buy (unless something better comes along), but the tube is very small and doesn&#x27;t last very long.  I&#x27;d love to see a more reasonably priced, bulk size.  Also price Thinkbaby sunscreen before you buy.  We purchased a tube of each and discovered that the ingredients and the product are exactly the same.  Now, we just buy whichever is cheaper at the time of purchase.&lt;br /&gt;-Easier to rub in, but still time consuming.  As I stated, this brand is the easiest to rub in of all physical sunscreens we&#x27;ve tried but, still, don&#x27;t expect miracles.  If you&#x27;re just switching to physical sunscreens, you can expect to put a lot more time and effort into application than with the chemical brands and Thinksport is no different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ve very pleased with the product.  There is still room for improvement but it&#x27;s much better than the competition.ct is distinct, fairly strong, and doesn&#x27;t go away completely until after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;-The price.  This is one of the more expensive physical sunscreen brands we&#x27;ve tried.  It is worth it and we&#x27;ll continue to buy (unless something better comes along), but the tube is very small and doesn&#x27;t last very long.

            <li> Since I am very fair, I am concerned about sunscreens I use.  This year, I ordered THINKSPORT, after reading the research done by EWG on sunscreens.  I love the product.  It goes on easily, isn&#x27;t greasy, and does a good job as far as protection. I  found the price NOT outrageously expensive like some.  I have tried many, but for me, this is THE BEST!</li>
            <li> Bottle came filled with water! Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This stuff seems great, especially considering the weird smells and texture of other all natural sunscreens.  Thumbs up so far.</li>
            <li> Ordered 2 tubes of this sunscreen.  Both tubes cannot be used.  I should&#x27;ve known something was wrong when I heard a swishing sound inside the tube.  Upon opening one tube, clear liquid came pouring out instead of lotion.  I figured it would come out creamy once the &amp;#34;liquid&amp;#34; was gone but this was not the case. Every time I try to use the tube, more liquid pours out. There&#x27;s definitely something wrong with the tubes.  When I shake the tube, you can hear the swishing noise of the liquid inside.  This should be a lotion, not fluid-like.</li>
            <li> One of the only actual &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; sunscreens out there.</li>
            <li> This is one of the first sun blocks of any kind I have used.  We have always seemed to do just fine using protective clothing and avoiding the sun from 10 to 2 and so on, but my new baby/toddler is very fair and I worried that would not be enough to keep him sun safe. I did a lot of online research and this product was at the top of most lists, and the price was decent here on Amazon, so we tried it. Well, this product just did not work out for us at all. It was thick and pasty and just never rubbed in well. I understand the way a physical sunblock is supposed to work but  this sat on top of our skin and appeared ashy on even the fairest of my family. None of us particularly liked the smell, which reminded me of orange creamsicles. It wasn&#x27;t awful but it just kind of smelled odd for a sunblock.  But the biggest issue was either the actual sunblock protection seemed to be nil and/or there is something in the ingredient list that causes skin reactions, because we all got a terrible rash/sunburn that took weeks to heal.  I am almost 40 and neither I nor my 10 and 7 year olds have ever had a sunburn not using sunblock, and we all got one the first time we used this!  It is certainly possible we are particularly sensitive to some ingredient since other people seem to like this a lot, but based on our experience I could not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this sunscreen. Easy to put on and has no real smell to it. I liked it so much that I bought a bigger tube of it recently.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this sunscreen before and love it! Amazon sells it for a great price and free shipping. However, this time I bought 2 of these and both were watery. I put them in the fridge overnight thinking they were just warm from being shipped but no luck, still watery. Not happy, returning this product and buying from another destributer of Thinksport.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t burn easily, tan very quickly so the spf 50+ is what I ordered.  It does go on very white and doesn&#x27;t blend well, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me as it may with some folks.  Very water proof since I go swimming and paddling a lot in the ocean.  I still get a nice tan afterwards.  No greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> After researching several EWG (Environmental Working Group) approved sunscreens I landed on Thinksport and ordered a tube. Our family outing to the beach was a success and none of us got burned when applying this sunscreen as directed. My 4 year old always complains about sunscreens getting into his eyes and stinging (even the baby sunscreens irritate his eyes) but this sunscreen did not budge once I applied it to his face and he never once complained. The smell is great and I was thinking it would be a bit hard to apply and rub in since some folks said it was thick but I had zero issues and applying this to my squirmy son was a breeze. Just a dab of this stuff goes a long way. One tube lasted our family of 3 the entire summer.</li>
            <li> As a BRCA1 gene carrier, I have been looking for a sunscreen to use this summer while working in the yard that is mineral based and paraben free. This stuff is great--and it has a light citrus-y cent, doesn&#x27;t smell like other sunscreens. It is also non-greasy and rubbed in very well (no white streaks). It did not feel too heavy or grimy like some other sunscreens do. Would recommend and will definitely buy again, especially to use on my 6 month old this summer.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works as well as some others on the market.  Sometimes, still feels like I got some sun&lt;br /&gt;when done riding. Did not have the same feeling with Nutrogena.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen and it goes on well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sunscreen.  I guess it works.  I didn&#x27;t get burned when out in the sun when I had it on.</li>
            <li> Used this item as a recommendation from a friend when I asked for a healthy sunscreen for endurance athletes and so far I am not impressed. The scent and consistency are both great but I still managed to get pink on my bike ride this morning after two applications!  Will give it another try but so far, not impressed.</li>
            <li> The only brand my family uses now for about 4 years</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is COMPLETELY ineffective! Did I get a bad bottle??? I spent tons of time outdoors boating, running, gardening, etc and I&#x27;ve used many, many varieties of sunscreen/sunblock. I applied this three times in a 5-hr period to myself and my 3-yr old on a mild Spring day in the Midwest and it did not work AT ALL. We both ended up sunburned and it was the equivalent of using no sunscreen at all. Horrible!</li>
            <li> The tubes I received were full nothing but a clear oily substance. Totally unusable. I ordered ThinkSport Kids from different seller last week and the product is great. Will be returning.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Wore it all afternoon in the pool, 110 degrees out, no burn! Product did not hurt my eyes either. It is a bit thick, so allow time for it to spread properly. I put one coat on and went for 2.5 hours without burning.</li>
            <li> The water will bead off you.  But i was able to get this sun block to rub in so that I did not have a white tint to my screen.  It had much better application compared to its competitors for chemical free sunblock.  It offered long lasting projection.</li>
            <li> 5 stars for the safest sunscreen known to humankind (aside from staying out of the sun altogether). You should feel great about not using synthetic compounds, which could potentially cause harm to your body!</li>
            <li> Awesome safe and waterproof sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Excellent sunblock. Doesn&#x27;t burn your eyes like many others and not as toxic as most.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: It is now 9 in the evening and the whole family is burned worse than we thought. I am incredibly upset as I researched safe sunscreens fora month before our trip. I have had two precancerous moles removed so I take sunscreen very seriously. I DO NOT lay out and tan. I try to stay in the shade as much as possible. I got in the pool twice for 15 minutes each time and got in the ocean the same amount. The rest of the time I was in the shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Original review): I put this on at 10 in the morning, and several times after, today at the beach. And I put plenty of it on. It is now 5 in the afternoon and I am burned. I read reviews here that said this very thing but gave the product the benefit of the doubt thinking maybe they didn&#x27;t put it on correctly, etc. I was really excited about this product because of the lack of bad ingredients, but it is not worth the large price tag for as much as we burned after putting it on as often as the bottle suggested. I also bought the kids version and my daughter is burned as well. I will be sending both back.</li>
            <li> took me a while to find it with the help of my GP but it isn&#x27;t as expensive as the ones that came up when I asked for zinc/titantium</li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen to send with my 6 year old to camp.  It&#x27;s very easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t leave her white.  I will definitely continue purchasing this brand.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, no problem with white pastey look.</li>
            <li> Works well, and prevents burns. After some time, I have noticed that it separates in the tube and gets really watery. If you shake it vigorously for a minute, it regains its original consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like it about it is that it feels like it is hard to wash off at night. I have to use a soapy wash cloth and scrub my skin...just using my hands with soap doesn&#x27;t do the trick. For the price, it is an excellent sunscreen, though.</li>
            <li> I came across this from the EWG website, where it got a 1 - the best possible - rating. I was looking for a strong sunscreen for my daughter, who plays soccer in the strong Arizona sun. The cream comes out white but disappears fairly quickly. It has a nice initial scent to it, although my family says that it smells like typical beach sunscreen. I applied it once this past Saturday and stayed out in the sun for over 2 hours when the temperatures rose to 115, and it seems to have protected me well. I will be buying more!</li>
            <li> A friend recommended thinksport SPF 50 to me. She&#x27;s physically delicate, and she claimed that she never burns when she wears this product. I agree with her -- this is an awesome product! I wore this in a scoring town where it was 100+ for weeks and it literally saved my skin.</li>
            <li> Upon receipt, I opened the tube to try it out and all I got from it was water, no sunscreen. Called Amazon and they were great at processing the return. Won&#x27;t be trying this one again.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is a great option for anyone looking for a physical blocker (as opposed to a chemical blocker). I use while running and have been protected. It&#x27;s very thick which is expected for this type of sunscreen. It doesn&#x27;t come off easily so it&#x27;s good for outdoor activity. It does take some effort to scrub off after your workout. I like the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t put it on my face because I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would clog my pores.</li>
            <li> I have tried nearly every singe sunscreen rated 2 or lower on EWG.org (skin deep) website.  I have even tried making my own sunscreen.  The problem I have run into and I know many others as well, is that the non-toxic sunscreen products is usually the thick, greasy, white paste-like consistency and the the difficulty rubbing the product into the area applied.  If you have made the wise choice to ditch the chemical-laden sunscreen (which actually cause many forms of skin cancer) products sold at drug stores and department stores you are already a step ahead of the game.  But be forewarned that the healthier sunscreens available and there are several very reputable and effective brands will not be as smooth and translucent as the above mentioned.  Out of all of the brands I have tried, by far this is my favorite brand and one of the more economical choices out there.  This brand costs less than the popular but extremely toxic, neutrogena broad spectrum helioplex. Plus it has UVA/UVB protection and spf of 50+.  To top it all of, Thinksport is rated with a score of 1 on EWG.org&#x27;s website which is one of the lowest ratings (lowest being the least toxic) you can find in sunscreen products.  It has a pleasant smell, is very moisturizing (often do not need a moisturizer on my face when I use), rubs into skin well, leaving no white residue and leaves your skin with a nice healthy glow.  If you have very oily skin, apply sparingly the first time.  If you have dry skin, you will like this product even more.  Also, this is the only sunscreen product I use on my kids and it is wonderful on their skin.</li>
            <li> No more rashes. I did try so many sunscreen creames and this one does not give me any skin allergy.</li>
            <li> Runs in eyes a little out in the water. Protection is moderate. It&#x27;s fine for surf sessions as long as it&#x27;s not midday when the sun is blazing. It doesn&#x27;t go on white like other sunscreens (that don&#x27;t have a bunch of chemicals) which is definitely a big plus. I won&#x27;t buy again simply because my face still got tan and it runs in my eyes but like I said it&#x27;s still good product just not good enough for surfing.</li>
            <li> I once read a review of sunscreen in Men&#x27;s Journal [...] that basically explained that most sunscreen is not very good and almost all of the advertisments and packaging is missleading. Sunscreen has to protect from UVA and UVB and most sunscreens only do one. There is no such thing as an SPF above 50 so if you&#x27;re buying sunscreen that is SPF 60, 70, etc. they&#x27;re lying to you. The way they get away with saying things like that is by making it sweat proof so that means that it is better than another brand that isn&#x27;t sweat proof and has an SPF rating of 50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My family has very fair skin (red heads) and we have to use sunscreen for a large part of the year. We started using this thinksport (it was called Livestrong back then) back in 2012 and we swear by it. A good sunscreen is not easy or convenient (sorry). If you&#x27;re using an aerosol can, then you&#x27;re not using a good sunscreen. This stuff does not rub in easy, but with some work it will blend in. It will probably give you a little lighter look, but all \\&quot;good\\&quot; sunscreen will be like this. There were better rated sunscreens and more expensive sunscreens, but for the price and the ingredients this one was a no brainer. I was worried when I heard about the trouble with Livestrong, but I&#x27;m glad thinksport is still making this good sunscreen affordable.</li>
            <li> Almost 2 weeks in Maui and so far no damage. Now it&#x27;s time to test it in Texas, this product has proved itself.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a sunscreen without chemicals.  This seemed like a good choice.  It does go on thick but if you rub it in you don&#x27;t get a white pallor (as other reviewers suggested).  It&#x27;s  not greasy but because of it&#x27;s thickness it feels heavy and greasy on the skin.  So I often put on a little mineral powder and that helped the greasy feel.  I was out in the sun for the better part of a day on several different occasions and each time my face got a little burned!  I only used this sunscreen on my face.  I reapplied every 70-80 minutes.  And still got pink.</li>
            <li> I have tried every un-fragranced sunscreen out there. My first try was &#x27;ThinkBaby&#x27;. Which I really liked because it worked. The &#x27;thinksport&#x27; is even better as it stays on longer and actually works. I am in Florida and work outdoors a lot and have been advised to avoid the sun. I wear sunscreen like its my job and this one REALLY works the best.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used. Works flawlessly every time, even after hiking several hours in full sun and sweat in desert heat and sand! I&#x27;ve put this to the test time and time again, climbing Mount Whitney at 14,500 feet, trekking 18 miles across the desert in full sun all day, sweating a ton on various long hikes, and still it holds up and I never got sunburn!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sunscreen goes on white so you can see where you missed, and then dries clear as long as you smooth it out. The smell is the best of any sunscreen I&#x27;ve used, and the ingredients are the best by far as well. It&#x27;s a win all around, and is now my go-to sunscreen for all-day intense hikes in the Southern California sun. My friends are always asking to &amp;#34;borrow&amp;#34; some! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I opened it and a bunch of watery stuff came out instead of sunscreen.  I don&#x27;t know if the ingredients separated or what, but I couldn&#x27;t use it and had to return it.</li>
            <li> I like this sunscreen. It provides good protection and the light citrus smell is just lovely (especially when compared to many other sunscreens). Because it actually has zinc oxide in it as a physical sunscreen, it is thicker and a little harder to spread over large areas and will leave a bit of white over your skin. If that bothers you, than you might consider a different sunscreen, but I don&#x27;t mind a little residue to get good coverage.</li>
            <li> hard to come off when showering.but that is good you know its working.</li>
            <li> I am really liking this sunscreen!  Seem to stay on well and not to heavy.  Now buying again for both my daughter and myself - it is safe for kids too!</li>
            <li> I was in search of a sunscreen product that met my criteria:  animal cruelty free &amp; safe.  After much research &amp; use of several products, I found Thinksport to best meet my needs.  It&#x27;s works well, does not leave a white film on my skin &amp; is easy to apply.  I have used Badger &amp; Elemental Herbs (both very effective) however once applied, I had a white film on my clothing as well as my skin despite trying to be very careful during the application process.  Additionally, while I am running the white film becomes even more apparent once I begin to perspire.  I experience this minimally with Thinksport.  I will continue to purchase this &amp; highly recommend it.  In fact, I have purchased several tubes &amp; have them strategically placed (car, gym bag, backpack) so as not to forget to use sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Good sun protection and not too greasy. Also doesn&#x27;t migrate and burn the eyes.</li>
            <li> Best in organic sunscreen panorama.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. No overpowering odor, and great marks for its ingredients. Buy it!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect it to blend easily. For me it is too heavy to use on face. Has a citrus scent (not overwhelming but noticeable! its not a bad smell- just different)&lt;br /&gt;Does it do the job? I use it because I have a sun allergy and when I get hit with direct sunlight during the summer months I get all itchy. Still looking for a (i dunno, miracle) sun screen.&lt;br /&gt;Another brand to try, which has a good consistency, is neutrogena 100+spf. Works on about the same level as this but is a lil different. I would us it  before i use this. Mainly, because It blends better, but because of the high spf it is still white sunblock. if you want it to blend and/or absorb use around 35spf or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;final say: if the sun does not give you a rash and you need good protection and you are not worried about good absorption, use this. if you want something clear- keep looking.</li>
            <li> Works well.  A little thick to put on but no Nasty chemicals on your skin.</li>
            <li> Compared to other healthy sunscreen products I&#x27;ve purchased, this rubs in much more easily and does not have a greasy feel to it.</li>
            <li> An excellent product; only writing a review to advise of shaking the tube very well before use - the product tends to separate as it sits.</li>
            <li> Hands down the BEST children&#x27;s sunscreen I have tried (and I have purchased 6 other natural style sunscreens).  Sunscreen goes on easy, rubs in easy and thoroughly without leaving white or purple marks or looking greasy. Also has a nice pleasant smell which was a nice surprise.  Hubby and I liked this so much we now use it for ourselves also not just our daughter. It is pricey but in my opinion worth paying extra to not have carcinogenic chemicals on your baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> Nice product blends in easily.</li>
            <li> It seems to be a good alternative to toxic sunscreen.  Does its job.  Like all sunscreens, though, when I sweat it burns my eyes.  JW</li>
            <li> Worked as expected, goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t smell.  No rash or weird problems.  Using it on the kids for our second year now.</li>
            <li> I researched sunscreens by reading about ingredient safety on the EWG and cross-referencing that with Amazon reviews, and I ended up choosing this Thinksport SPF 50 sunscreen and have been very happy with it.  My kids and I wore it in direct sun for 2 hours, and it worked really well.  It smells nice and doesn&#x27;t feel oily at all.  I would definitely buy this one again.</li>
            <li> Very, very good!  The only caveat is that it will leave a white residue when applied liberally, but that&#x27;s to be expected, given the lack of harsh chemicals in the product.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff. Doesn&#x27;t leave you white and rubs in great. Smells nice. Safe ingredients.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen I bought arrived my house too late. They should have arrived before our trip to Hawaii and China.</li>
            <li> We love this sunscreen! We&#x27;ve tried so many of the physical sunscreens, but Thinksport is our current favorite. It provides great protection, goes on nicely and has a pleasant scent. It also dries much faster than others we&#x27;ve tried. You&#x27;re not left feeling greasy. Also, several in our family have issues with eczema and this sunscreen has proven not to irritate.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, blends in well, great protection! Also smells nice. I wear it everyday.</li>
            <li> Works very well and is free of harmful chemicals unlike many mainstream sunscreens. It also has a very pleasant scent. The only issue is the viscosity - the lotion is very thick. If you have body hair, it tends to stick to that and not spread well on those parts. I may experiment with using a bit of water to make it go farther. Overall, I would recommend and will be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> I have a sun allergy.  I break out in a red rash when exposed to the sun.  This product has eliminated my getting a rash.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Works fine for me.  Isn&#x27;t the easiest to rub in and it takes a lot for good coverage.  It does leave your skin white, but I&#x27;d much rather have that than skin cancer.  Seems expensive and I don&#x27;t think the 3 oz tube will last very long.  Wish they&#x27;d make a larger size which should be able to bring the price down a bit.  Although it works and I like supporting LiveSTRONG, which I do their bike ride challenges, I think there are just as good products cheaper.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite sunscreen to use on my whole family.  I want something that not only prevents sunburns but also doesn&#x27;t contain a ton of harmful chemicals.  ThinkSport ranks high every year on the best sunscreen list and we agree.  It goes on smooth and is not super thick.  It does not have a strong scent and works for hours of outdoor play.</li>
            <li> This and any of the other ThinkSport physical blocker sunscreens (ThinkBaby and LiveStrong) are the best on the market.  They spread easily, are not greasy, and do not leave white residue like many other zinc sunscreens.  My experience is that this will protect for at least 4+ hrs of direct sun and exercise without reapplication.  Because this is a physical blocker, it doesn&#x27;t wear off like many other suncreens, so if you&#x27;re not wet or sweating, it will work all day (or until you shower) without reapplication.</li>
            <li> So far this is my favorite sunscreen of the safe zinc oxide type. And so far it has not caused rust stains on the necklines of my tops! I really sweat, so my former sunscreens (mostly NO-AD, Neutrogena) ran down and caused necklines to turn rusty orange, and nothing would take the stains out. Those chemical sunscreens (with unsafe ingredients) cost me a lot of money in ruined clothing and even stained leather car seats. So the higher price of Thinksport doesn&#x27;t bother me, and living in Florida I go thru a lot of sunscreen. Cons: If you don&#x27;t like fragrance, you might not like this one. I usually avoid it, but the orange scent is pretty mild and pleasant. I do see a little white residue collecting in my lines &amp; creases, but not bad at all; no where near the ghostly look you get from many zinc oxide sunscreens. You will also really need to wash it off when you shower, like with a washcloth, otherwise you might feel a residue. But overall, I am very satisfied with the product. Give Thinksport a try!</li>
            <li> I wish I could love this, with its low EWG rating, nice application, and unobtrusive scent--but I&#x27;ve had two bad burns now while using this and reapplying every two hours, and it can&#x27;t just be user error. I&#x27;ll keep looking for something that&#x27;s both chemical-free AND effective.</li>
            <li> As a distance runner I love this product. Having used this for months I don&#x27;t notice any smell. And this rubs in better than most zinc sunscreens. I have converted a whole cross country team to this sunscreen. I absolutely love this and keep it in my bag all the time</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Price in line with other &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; suntan lotion. Arrived timely and as described. Would buy from again.&lt;br /&gt;Like the others organics it takes some effort to apply evenly and usually leaves a whitish color, probably from the necessary zinc. This one smells better than the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> We have been loving the Thinksport sunscreen, and I just ordered our second bottle. I originally bought it because it rates a &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; on the ewg.org site, meaning it&#x27;s chemical free and considered a &amp;#34;very safe&amp;#34; product.  The container is sturdy, the cap is sealed well, and it hasn&#x27;t leaked in our beach bag.  The scent is &amp;#34;barely there&amp;#34; and just smells a bit fresh.  My favorite part of the Thinksport sunscreen is how well it rubs in.  Other chemical-free sunscreens I have tried are thick and pasty, which make it hard to rub in.  Thinksport is creamy and a little goes a long way.  I find it very easy to apply to my small children as it rubs in easily and disappears quickly.  Tip- don&#x27;t get in the water right away or it will melt off.  Wait about 10 minutes for it to dry on you first.  We re-apply every 2 hours when at the pool or the beach, and haven&#x27;t gotten a single sunburn since we&#x27;ve been using Thinksport.</li>
            <li> Like others, I did all my research on the best but least expensive non-harmful sunscreen and settled on this one. It is perfectly fine, but the problem is that it is still so expensive compared with regular sunscreen. We live in a beach town and i am out walking to the park or store with my son every single morning. We need sunscreen every day, and sometimes twice on weekends. This tube, used very sparingly, got us through 2 applications of my son and me. Add my husband to the mix, and we would be spending $50 a week on sunscreen. I&#x27;m going to have to keep doing my research to see if there is a less-toxic regular sunscreen at a regular price :(</li>
            <li> Goes on very thick, almost like rubbing paste over your skin. It is one of the best sun blocks I&#x27;ve ever used though. Highly recommended in my book.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m training for a marathon, so I&#x27;m spending a lot of time in the sun.  The longest run I&#x27;ve been on so far while using this product has been 16 miles.  After over 2 hours of extreme sweating in the direct sun, I didn&#x27;t have even a bit of a tan - much less a burn.</li>
            <li> great product. Very healthy and works well.</li>
            <li> I am a sailor with very sensitive skin.  Many of the cheaper sun screens made my face puffy, red, and itchy.  This is one of best products I have found for water-related sports and sensitive skin.  The amount of zinc oxide is just right; it rubs in without leaving my face all white.  For me, I haven&#x27;t gotten burned after using this product.</li>
            <li> As a redhead with very fair skin that loves to spend time outside, I’ve tried almost every drug store brand. I’ve been trying to switch to natural products and have used quite a few mineral based sunscreens. I used Thinksport  for the first time while at the Wildlife Park with my 4 year old and a group of friends a few days ago. My son doesn’t like to put sunscreen on his face, but he loves the smell of ThinkSport so much that he doesn’t mind with this brand (Bonus points right away)! We were there for 5 hot and sunny hours. I applied this all over both of us once when we got out of the car and then reapplied on my arms after about 2 hours. I had absolutely no sign of burning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s not too thick, spreads easily and evenly, no tacky feeling, doesn’t have a heavy white tint after you rub it in and no issues with wearing off from sweating. As with most mineral sunscreens, it tends to be difficult to wash off but Castile Soap is an easy remedy for that. The biggest issue for me is that it’s definitely expensive... I don’t know how long this 3 oz. tube will last for my family. I might have to reserve it for long all day activities (beach days, hiking, etc..) and use a cheaper alternative for the more frequent 1-3 hours of outside time.</li>
            <li> I am out in the mid day sun quite a bit on my bike working up a sweat. I wanted sport protection with no chemicals and broad spectrum coverage. This stuff goes on thick and you need to spend some time rubbing to remove the white. My only issue, I put it on my face liberally at about 10 AM for a 4 Hr ride and I ended up with some red, not a burn but I was surprised. I will say that it does have a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Love this product...love the price!  Keeps my very &amp;#34;pale&amp;#34; child sunburn free!!</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t get it on easily, it&#x27;s worthless. This stuff does not rub in easily at all - it&#x27;s reminiscent of Destin regarding texture. In fact, when my husband uses it, he looks like he has a white beard on his stubble. And it does not wash off easily. We tried it a number of times, thinking it was us or that we&#x27;d get used to it. It&#x27;s the pits. Save your money.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Protects my skin really well as a nice, thick cream that blends really well. No odor or irritation. EXCELLENT.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Works great.</li>
            <li> We took this on vacation to the beach. I had several sunblocks for the trip &amp; by day 2, everyone was going for this one!  Especially the kids. It went into the skin so easily...like lotion instead of sunblock. Nobody got a sunburn...from baby to grandma. We all loved this. We, of course, ran out &amp; I reordered as soon as we returned from vacation.</li>
            <li> Got in timely manner!  Love it.</li>
            <li> I like this product...you have to be careful when applying to not put it on too thick and not to rub it in too much.....best if put on lightly and only rubbed one direction....you do not need a lot to be effective.....an excellent product and provides great protection.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite sunscreens. It goes on smoothly, it is recommended by EWG SkinSafe website as a safe sunscreen, and it smells nice too. It does look chalky on the skin but that means it is a physical sunscreen and not chemical.  Don&#x27;t buy those aerosol sunscreens for kids, please. Yes, it is easier to apply and doesn&#x27;t make your face look pasty, but they are high in toxins. http://www.ewg.org/2014sunscreen/</li>
            <li> Hard to spread, requires a lot to get full coverage</li>
            <li> UPDATE on 5/31/16 -- Amazon refunded me for the watery tubes.  I have not repurchased since then, so I can&#x27;t comment on the newer batches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First: I like this sunscreen and have purchased 12 tubes of it over the last two years.  BUT...  the last three tubes I bought (labeled as I noted in the title of my review), on Subscribe &amp; Save from Amazon, are NOT the product I had in the past.  The good ones were creamy, homogenized, effective.  These three are, from what I can tell, liquid!  They slosh when I shake the tube, and when I squeeze the tube, only a clear liquid (like water) comes out with perhaps a few small bits of white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have contacted Amazon customer service, and they are looking into the issue.  They tell me they will follow up; I will update if I receive a response from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line-- maybe wait to buy til you know the batch is good.  I&#x27;m happy with the sunscreen otherwise, and I would buy it again if I can be assured it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, this is the same formulation as the ThinkBaby product we had been using when our sensitive-skinned boy was a little baby. It&#x27;s got a pleasant citrus scent, and we know it doesn&#x27;t hurt his skin. Not to mention the nasty chemicals the EWG warns against. Since it&#x27;s the same as ThinkBaby, I usually just shop around to find whichever one is the better price at that particular moment.</li>
            <li> I wanted a reef friendly sun screen while sailing around the islands of Tahiti.  This did the job well.  No complaints and no sunburn!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really surprised by all of the great reviews for this product.  Yes, it is an excellent sunscreen that is sweat resistant.  But, it leaves a crazy white cast.  Most high zinc sunscreens leave some white cast, and I&#x27;m ok with that, but this is ridiculous, I look like a mime!  Also, I&#x27;m not convinced the ingredients are that great - many of them are known irritants.  I will keep it for use on my hands, but there are other natural sunscreens that have better aesthetics.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen on the market!! The only one that doesn&#x27;t make my daughter break out in a rash! Been using for the past two summers!</li>
            <li> One of the best sunscreens on my market! When it comes to sunscreens we&#x27;ve tried them all - the kind that burn your eyes, ones that go on thick and gooey, the spray kind, the unspreadable kind, the stinky kind - you name it! Luckily one of our friends recommended this brand and we&#x27;ve been fans ever since. A little bit goes a long way with this one. It goes on white and absorbs easily and provides unbeatable protection. No smell and won&#x27;t burn your little ones eyes. This is where our search for sunscreens ends.</li>
            <li> Great product!! Wore for 5 hrs on float trip &amp; did not burn!!</li>
            <li> Good product, good delivery.  This has a slight fragrance of lemon.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; product, without the harmful chemicals found in most mass market brands. Goes on easily and is effective. One tip: be sure to shake it up and squeeze the tube a bit to counter any settling of the ingredients before opening. After that, it stays mixed, i just had to do that on first opening it.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this sunscreen. It you struggle with melasma (dark spots on the face that are greatly aggravated by sun exposure) the reality is that you just have to use a physical sunblock with either zinc oxide or titanium dioxide (aka - natural, mineral, physical sunblock). The higher the percentage the better. 10% minimum is best, and this has 20%. Also - I love what it does NOT have - chemicals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware that, as with any high mineral content sunscreen, you are going to have to deal with the slight white hue that goes along with it. That said, this is a very emollient sunscreen and is easy to blend in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my technique:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Wash skin&lt;br /&gt;2) apply sunscreen and massage it in  enough to minimize any white hue, but not enough to reduce the actual coverage&lt;br /&gt;3) Wait 5 minutes or so and do other parts of my morning routine&lt;br /&gt;4) Apply an additional thin layer just over the problem areas (where the meslasma congregates)&lt;br /&gt;5) Wait another 5 minutes and apply my makeup (also, you will need to add a light layer of powder to reduce the shine)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try to remember to update and see if I notice a difference in my melasma, this is my first time using a sunscreen as powerful as this (20% zinc) - doc says melasma will take a long time to fade!</li>
            <li> I live in Australia and wanted a physical sunscreen because I am in the sun a lot. After doing some research and looking at all the fairly good but mixed reviews for this product I decided to buy 5 bottles of it which was I think maybe a waste of money. On the first trip out which was hiking I literally painted my face and arms with this product and thought I was okay, but to my horror when I got home I was burnt to a crisp. I am not sure if this sunscreen should be advertised as 50 plus when its clearly not, in fact it doesn&#x27;t even come close. I really want to love this stuff, it smells great, goes on really well but I don&#x27;t think it protects very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair skinned and even with continual sunscreen, I still had skin cancer. Used this sunscreen all summer and not even a sunburn! I sweat a decent amount and even after working out, it keeps working. Will definitely keep buying!</li>
            <li> The one star is for the product I got from Amazon. The first time I opened it, a clear liquid oozed out, returned it, and a few days later got a replacement which had the same problem! Contacted thinksport and they told me to buy directly from their website, which I did and now I have a sunscreen that I like and use on my kids everyday. It is a bit tough to smooth on, but I mix it with a lighter moisturizer and my kids don&#x27;t complain of white stuff on their faces, and it seems to stay on for a long time. Preferred this one to the thinksport kids. 5 stars for the actual product.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly! Not too difficult to rub in and doesn&#x27;t leave white residue like other sunscreen. And it keeps us protected. I&#x27;ve used it on adults, babies and toddlers.</li>
            <li> Thick sunblock that does the trick and doesn&#x27;t contain a lot of harmful chemicals in many other brands. Only drawback is that it&#x27;s hard to remove, but worth the effort for protection.</li>
            <li> It smells good and blends in easily.  You really need to slather it on every couple of hours for best results- don&#x27;t be skimpy.</li>
            <li> Great coverage but tough to rub in.</li>
            <li> Not sure it really works, we still get tanned and we tan even more when in the pool. It&#x27;s not sticky or very white, but the citrus scent is extremely strong. Thinksport should tone down on the scent. It is odd that it claims &amp;#34;does not have an obtrusive smell that many organic sunscreens have&amp;#34; ... it does, hence only the 3-star rating instead of 4.</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 tubes of this sunscreen and 4 tubes of thinksport kids. Their expiration date is all after 05/2016. I opened one today 04/19/2015 and only to find out it&#x27;s all liquid inside. I checked 6 other unopen tubes, they are all the same, feel like liquid inside. I still have the product with seal on them. My other thinkbaby sunscreen that I ordered at same time is normal. Am I got 7 bad product or they all like this?</li>
            <li> I have been searching high and low for a good sunscreen that has zinc oxide without all the damaging chemicals!  It goes on smooth, like a thick lotion.  It is not too thick to the point that you have to keep rubbing and rubbing until it is evenly distributed.  It has nice smell to it.  It also has zinc oxide, a physical sunscreen to protect your skin from the sun rather than a chemical sunblock.  It is also rated only a 1 on ewg.org which is great!! Unfortunately, this product is expensive. It is pricy for 3 oz!</li>
            <li> This stuff is legit. I&#x27;m a fair-skinned outdoorsy girl, and I burn easily even late into the Summer when I *think* I have a good tan. Today I used this sunscreen on my face and neck where I am the most vulnerable to burns, but I didn&#x27;t bother to cover all exposed skin (whoops). After 3.5 hours in the afternoon sun, I was thrilled to see that I didn&#x27;t burn at all where I put the sunscreen on! The rest of me, however... yeah, I burned pretty bad. I can tell where I put the sunscreen on. :P&lt;br /&gt;I also love how this sunscreen smells! Not at all like the traditional sunscreen smell, but a faint good scent - can&#x27;t really describe it.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it completely soaks in to my skin, without leaving a white shadow!&lt;br /&gt;Awesomeness. I will buy this again!</li>
            <li> Surf on average 2 hours per session. There is still residual on my face when I get out and my sun damaged areas don&#x27;t change their appearance. Just be prepared to look like Casper the friendly ghost?</li>
            <li> Works great, but was very drying to the skin (or maybe it was the sun, but this sure didn&#x27;t help).  My kids and I had the worst chapped cheeks and my body was SO dry.  Make sure you buy some serious lotion to put on when you get inside.</li>
            <li> The first tube I ordered was great.  The sunscreen is thick but not so much so that its painful to use.  I used this for my 3 young kids and myself as well.  We tan pretty easily, and it does leave a white tint.  I have friends with whiter fair skin and you can&#x27;t see the white tint on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product gets 3 stars because I ordered 3 more tubes and it was completely liquified.  No amount of shaking could reconstitute it.  So I ordered replacement items and got the same results.  Didn&#x27;t even need to break the seal - I could hear the liquid swishing around.  So….if you are lucky enough to get a good tube, the product is great.  Seems like a crap shoot though.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much that I bought extras to give as gifts to my aunts and friends.&lt;br /&gt;I especially like that I don&#x27;t become all &amp;#34;sweaty&amp;#34; after walking under the sun for an hr or so.&lt;br /&gt;other sunblocks I&#x27;ve used made me &amp;#34;sweat&amp;#34; pretty bad, especially my arms.&lt;br /&gt;I walk everyday for over an hr and haven&#x27;t gotten &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; yet, so I would say this thing works!!!&lt;br /&gt;I also have sensitive skin, and this hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin yet.</li>
            <li> I used to like this product. It has great safety ratings, and works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the product I received from Amazon (4 tubes of it) was watery. It was not a cream...it was just like water. I contacted the manufacturer about getting replacements. They told me that I had to buy 4 more tubes from them, and then they would include 4 additional replacements for the defective product. Ridiculous! Why would I want 8 tubes of sunscreen? I wrote back again, and asked that they simply replace the defective product. They didn&#x27;t reply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I called them. And guess what? They don&#x27;t answer the phone. The only option is to leave a message.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thinksport has terrible customer service, and you should not buy their product. It&#x27;s a shame that a company with a good product has no idea how to treat a customer.</li>
            <li> My bottle was SUPER watery! All liquid! I had to throw it out. It was not usable. :(</li>
            <li> Bought two bottles at once right before a long vacation. One bottle was great! Smelled great, went on smooth, no complaints. The other bottle was like water with a few little lotiony blobs floating around. Don&#x27;t know why there would be such a difference in quality! Unfortunately I think it&#x27;s too late for me to return the messed up bottle. If you&#x27;re going on a long vacation, get them in time to test and return if necessary!</li>
            <li> We bought some of the thinkbaby for our little guy and liked it for ourselves, so we bought this too. Like that it doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot to cover well and didn&#x27;t have any sunburns. Pricy, but worth it to not have all the chemicals.</li>
            <li> thinksport difference with thinkbaby is that thinkbaby has papaya. 50SPF is not a good idea, infact anything over 30SPF is only a marketing tool. This is a great mix but contains too many ingredients and all are non-organic ingredients as well when I can get mixes with less ingredients, organic ingredients and not over 30SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thinksport&lt;br /&gt;Active Ingredient: Zinc Oxide 20% (Non-nano).

Chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks. ZO is insoluble in water, used in many industries, in ointments, creams and lotions. Non-irritating, non-allergenic and non-comedogenic, used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts. ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS -2 ZO which has a mean particle size greater than 30nm, when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body, do not enter the bloodstream, and are not a threat to human health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream. If the sun reddens unprotected skin in ten minutes, for example, a person wearing SPF15 can be exposed to the sun without reddening for 15 times longer - 150 minutes. While UVB rays are behind the redness of sunburn, UVA rays damage the skin&#x27;s DNA at a deeper layer. Both radiation types can cause skin cancer. The EU recommendation is for sunscreens to offer a UVA protection factor that is a third of their SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I make my own sunscreen but for times when I do not, I need the same formula as I use in my organic sunscreen mix with fewer ingredients. Zinc is what you see surfers put on their nose for protection.

BABO has 22% ZO with conventional not organic ingredients which is a higher amount of ZO than an organic brand like BADGER with 18.5% ZO. But ZO is not the only ingredient in BABO so there are few issues with BABO formula. ZO is like mud, the higher, the better protection but ZO stays on the surface of the skin for protection so for many, high ZO will not work since it will be too heavy.

            <li> This sunscreen goes on easy, doesn&#x27;t leave you looking white, and smells great! Most importantly, it works great and is chemical free.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff, especially because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Only time my kids got a sunburn was using this sunscreen :(</li>
            <li> I researched &#x27;healthy&#x27; sunscreens to death.  I drove everyone mad asking for recommendations.  We finally decided on this one.  I SOOOO wanted to love it.  It smelled lovely and went on great.  However, we were all burnt to a crisp after just one day trying it.  I did exactly what the label wanted us to do (I am an avid sunscreen wearer and have always applied it correctly) and re-applied again and again.  We still were burnt!  I mean, really burnt.  How it worked for some, I&#x27;ll never know but what&#x27;s the benefit of using a &#x27;healthier&#x27; product if you all get skin cancer.  So sad.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it. We suffered pretty strong burns.</li>
            <li> My husband and I spent a week in the DR, coming from a Northern New England wicked long winter.&lt;br /&gt;Neither of us burned!&lt;br /&gt;It covers great, smells good, and it does not sting, burn, or cause irritation.</li>
            <li> Light weight, easy to rub... GREAT!</li>
            <li> Arrived watery, which at first I thought might have been the heat from shipping, but it never returned to the creamy consistency of Think Baby and Think Kids that I expected. We returned it for a full refund and no problems. Not sure if this was a bad batch?</li>
            <li> BEST SUNSCREEN EVER. It&#x27;s very easy to rub in and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin matted over with a white film. It even lasts through my running and hiking sweat (miracle)!!&lt;br /&gt;And, it&#x27;s not full of Chemicals. ….&lt;br /&gt;There is also a Baby line too!!!! Check em out!!!</li>
            <li> thick and leaves a film which my husband didn&#x27;t like. Worked fine. Makes you feel like trail dust sticks to you though</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen from Thinksport. It has SPF 50 broad spectrum waterproof protection.  It works quickly, doesn&#x27;t smell, and doesn&#x27;t make me cry.  I especially appreciate it is free of harsh chemicals.  I love to use it and reapply it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Great coverage and protection.  Not as white as Think Baby, but still protects from the sun.</li>
            <li> I wear sunscreen every day and have tried so many different brands - cheap, expensive, drugstore, high end, and for now the search is over. This stuff is very sticky and you really have to rub it in, but it never, ever stings my eyes or irritates my sensitive skin like most other sunscreens. It is so wonderful to be able to go running in my contact lenses - previosuly, I always had to wear my glasses because sunscreen stung my eyes. It really stays put. It&#x27;s also one of the most affordable options.</li>
            <li> Very small size. Also really difficult to spread it across skin. Not happy and wouldn&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> easy to apply on and wash off. Good smell too. I like it over the thinkbaby.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different brands - those recommended by EWG, Consumer Reports, and through my own research. This is one of the good ones. It has non-nano zinc and is water and sweat resistant. Great for running long distances. It&#x27;s not fragrance-free, but the subtle citrus scent is pleasant, not overwhelming at all. Yes, it leaves a whitish color on your skin, but all zinc-based sunscreens do if you apply enough to be effective. None of them \\&quot;rub in\\&quot; to the point that the white is completely gone, unless it doesn&#x27;t have as much zinc to begin with, or you have rubbed it so thin that it won&#x27;t be very effective. Remember this is a sport sunscreen, SPF 50 (high amount of zinc), and not something to wear daily to the office. So if your priorities are high SPF, zinc (non-nano if possible), and water resistant, then buy with confidence. Lower SPF zinc sunscreens may be a little less white but then they&#x27;re lower SPF, or else they use chemical sunscreens to make up the difference... so it&#x27;s a trade-off.</li>
            <li> I have purchased the Food Babe Way book and looked up sunscreen. I purchased this as one of the sunscreens Food Babe recommended. The ingredients (chemicals) will not harm us and I can use this on my grandson. I had been purchasing a popular brand of sunscreen (expensive) because I thought it was the best product to use. Boy, was I wrong. Thinksport is our go to sunscreen and I know it won&#x27;t harm us in anyway.</li>
