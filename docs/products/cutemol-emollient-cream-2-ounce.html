            <li>I&#x27;m extremely satisfied w/it.</li>
            <li>Cheaper over the counter hand cream worked better than this.</li>
            <li>My skin looks so much better in just a couple of days.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to order in the 8 ounce tub.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s thicker than lotion or cream.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>It is magic.  </li>
            <li>PLEASE CONTINUE TO MAKE MORE.</li>
            <li>It may not be an issue of concern for everyone, you&#x27;re free to make your own judgements.</li>
            <li>Also, I am always pleased by lotion products without any fragrance, which Cutemol is (unscented that is).  </li>
            <li>Have been pleased with product performance.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and would recommend it to everyone.  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>To my surprise it worked better than the products meant for that purpose.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I have tried many creams...</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I was satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than any lotion I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>Also, I wish the smell could be more pleasant, although it doesn&#x27;t bother me that much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s especially great just before bedtime but suitable for use during the day too when you still need to use your hands for typing on the computer, writing with a pen, and other applications which are otherwise hampered by greasy lotions.  </li>
            <li>i did a huge test of as many recommended hand lotions and creams as i could find, and this and o&#x27;keeffe&#x27;s are miles better, for me, than anything else.</li>
            <li>Cutemol is an excellent cream for dry cuticles and hands.</li>
            <li>Cutemol was recommended to me by my dermatologist for dry, cracking and peeling finger nails and it works wonderfully!  </li>
            <li>it has been the best treatment I have ever used for my dry, peeling cuticles.</li>
            <li>This is the best lotion I have found to treat severe dry skin.</li>
            <li>and I was pleased to find it available on Amazon at a better price.</li>
            <li>you are interested in a hand cream that goes on quickly and disappears rapidly, you will not be happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Best cream for dry skin!</li>
            <li>This is the best cream I ever found for rough heels, and I have tried a bunch.  </li>
            <li>But, it goes on easily and absorbs well.</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty amazing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The is the BEST product hands down</li>
            <li>this and o&#x27;keeffe&#x27;s are fantastic.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the smell, but the end result is worth it.</li>
            <li>My hands, after massaging the cream into her feet, felt great the next day.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This (Cutemol) was recommended to me by a dermatologist, who provided me with some free samples four months ago.  </li>
            <li>This is a fabulous duo to the Derma Nail.&lt;br /&gt;Fabulous for hands and nails.</li>
            <li>Great cream for cracked hands and cuticles, especially in winter months</li>
            <li>Fantastic cuticle moisturizer</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to putting a smooth lotion on my hands.  </li>
            <li>easy to apply and works great on dry cuticles</li>
            <li>Original Review:</li>
            <li>Found it inn my dermatologist&#x27;s office originally.</li>
            <li>Have tried many other products if you use as directed it is by far the best !</li>
            <li>Really great cream for dry skin.</li>
            <li>This is great for really dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Works great when my skin gets dry and ichy.</li>
            <li>Nothing special about this cream as it claims, just did NOT work though was recommended by dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>A great cream if you have very dry skin on your hands.</li>
            <li>CAn&#x27;t say enough good things about this cream.  </li>
            <li>If you try this stuff, I really think you&#x27;ll be pleased.</li>
            <li>Since i began using Cutemol,  I  have successfully prevented dry winter hands and skin cracks on my fingertips and knuckles.</li>
            <li>but it absorbs quickly and feels silky and smooth right away.</li>
            <li>It is for this reason that I do not use it during the daytime; application is best left prior to bedtime.</li>
            <li>One main reason I bought this cream is more for my finger nails.</li>
            <li>especially good if you have skin  problems surrounding your nails, for weak split and brittle nails</li>
            <li>I recently discovered this product and am so glad I did!  </li>
            <li>Cutemol is the best for very dry skin especially eczema.  </li>
            <li>and I feel it is well worth the money, giving me protection and relief..</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s worth it &#x27;cause it works.</li>
            <li>dry,cracked cuticles and hands into soft healthy looking hands and cuticles in 2 days.</li>
            <li>Even the residue is eventually absorbed by my skin after an hour or so.</li>
            <li>If you have extremely dry, cracked skin and most general moisturizers have been ineffective, Cutemol is an extremely good choice</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!!!</li>
            <li>It is a bit greasy at first, but it seeps in quickly.  </li>
            <li>Both products are manufactured by Summers Labs and are meant to be used together, although I believe any other good moisturizer would also work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For ordinary cracked fingertips, it is very good, but chronic, genetic-origin cracked fingertips, not so much.</li>
            <li>But this is no longer the right product for me</li>
            <li>Most lotions and creams make my hands itch, turn bright red and dry my already parched skin out</li>
            <li>so I would be more likely to carry it with me and therefore use it more frequently.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t necessary to apply a great deal of this at any one time, thus I&#x27;m happy to have the small tube and this larger one, as I suspect I will be using this for my problem cuticles for years to come.</li>
            <li>Amazon.com has been great about finding products that I sometimes cannot find in local stores, and don&#x27;t have time to run to different locations looking for it.</li>
            <li>I have been primarily using Neutrogena Fragrance Free Norwegian Formula up until now (</li>
            <li>This is by far the best cream for my dry hands and cuticles, especially in winter in the North East USA.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to sound like a commercial, but it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Great product, but it is hard to get it out of the tube.</li>
            <li>well, it&#x27;s tied for first place with o&#x27;keeffe&#x27;s working hands cream.</li>
            <li>I have to use this more than two times daily when I have a break out.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s the same consistency, perhaps a bit more quick-drying.  </li>
            <li>First time you put it on those cracks don&#x27;t hurt and then in a couple days they are healed - a must for the winter.</li>
            <li>It is a bit greasy at first.</li>
            <li>I like it so much that I now have one mailed to me periodically!  </li>
            <li>This is the first product that has worked.</li>
            <li>My hands get dry and flaky very easily.  </li>
            <li>Other lotions just kind of coat my hands.  </li>
            <li>This is the first one that&#x27;s really worked.  </li>
            <li>it is far superior to any other product I have ever found or been given by a manicurist.  </li>
            <li>This is very thick and you need to rub it in good, but it makes my dry hands feel so much better!  </li>
            <li>My hair was back in shape and easy to manage where before using it</li>
            <li>At that rate, I expect the tube to last a long time, which is good</li>
            <li>container is that it is priced very high for the quantity of product received.</li>
            <li>I have tried many hand cremes for my very dry hands and bought this one on the advice of a friend.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need much, use sparingly.</li>
            <li>THANKS SUMMERS LABS.</li>
            <li>so it stays on really well.</li>
            <li>but it really works</li>
            <li>I have a very severe case of hand eczema and this was recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>I really had to &amp;#34;rub it in&amp;#34; for some time before my hands felt reasonable.  </li>
            <li>But this cream really takes the dryness away and stays on even after washing your hands a couple times.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not cheap, but is quite effective.</li>
            <li>It does make some difference but is not permanent you need to keep using you maybe able to achieve that with other cream</li>
            <li>love this cream very dry where I live and dr. suggested this cream</li>
            <li>When massaged in on top of the Dermanail, both products are locked down onto the surface of the nail.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>RICH EMOLLIENT IS DOING WONDERS FOR MY DRY CUTICLES,</li>
            <li>This instantly made my dry cuticles better.</li>
            <li>best thing in recent years I could find was the Euercrin ointment - the thick, gooey stuff that never really absorbs well even with MY skin!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lotion for people who frequently wash their hands.</li>
            <li>From the first use, this cream instantly soothes irritated skin, absorbs but stays with you.  </li>
            <li>Even small spots of eczema get better after using this cream.</li>
            <li>Most lotions that claim to leave a non oily residue never really do much for my dry hands and feet.  </li>
            <li>Your skin will be soft, but not greasy.  </li>
            <li>I use it 2-6 times a day and my red, rashy hands look almost normal now!  </li>
            <li>The only cream that keeps my hands in decent shape in winter.  </li>
            <li>No other cream you can just purchase without a prescription works as well, believe me, I have tried them all!</li>
            <li>There is a kind of greasy residue left behind (which the description explains is an intentional feature of the product)</li>
            <li>if I can get past the unique smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been on a quest trying to find products that work for my funky skin and came across this one on AMAZON, ready the reviews and tried it not really expecting anything</li>
            <li>My hands are always dry from frequent hand washing, and especially in the winter my skin cracks around the knuckles and bleeds unless I really slather the lotion on multiple times a day.  </li>
            <li>We got this cream for my wife who has VERY dry skin, particularly her feet.</li>
            <li>Other creams I have tried don&#x27;t moisturize as well as Cutemol, or they leave my hands very greasy.  </li>
            <li>I like the fact that it&#x27;s fragrance free and that a small amount goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>Unless you need something this small for travel purposes or other reasons of space, I&#x27;d suggest opting instead for the larger jar -- it&#x27;s a much better value for the money.</li>
            <li>When we first used it, it reminded me of heavy lube, like axle grease.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cutemol is a thick white cream with a heavy dose of lanolin and mineral oil that creates an effective moisture barrier on the skin.</li>
            <li>This is a very thick product which rubs in easily.</li>
            <li>This lotion (Cutemol) is very, very thick but after about 2-3 minutes of massaging into the skin, it is considerably less greasy than other &amp;#34;intensive repair&amp;#34;-type products I have tried; such as for example Eucerin Aquaphor which I could not tolerate at all due to the greasy &amp;#34;after-feel&amp;#34; and it didn&#x27;t seem to do a very good job of softening and healing my hands.  </li>
            <li>This cream makes my hands soft and relieves the pain I get from dry hands.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely thick and a bit greasy on application, but it quickly soaks in.  </li>
            <li>It works after application, because it is urea and a thick emollient, but it is not anything that hasn&#x27;t existed previously, just rebranded to appear more &amp;#34;medical&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;prescriptive&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I have VERY dry, sensitive fussy skin - especially my hands.  </li>
            <li>I live in the dry Southwest and this is the only product I have found that helps my dry cuticles.</li>

            <li> This is the best lotion I have found to treat severe dry skin.</li>
            <li> and I was pleased to find it available on Amazon at a better price.</li>
            <li> you are interested in a hand cream that goes on quickly and disappears rapidly, you will not be happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Best cream for dry skin!</li>
            <li> This is the best cream I ever found for rough heels, and I have tried a bunch.  </li>
            <li> But, it goes on easily and absorbs well.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty amazing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The is the BEST product hands down</li>
            <li> this and o&#x27;keeffe&#x27;s are fantastic.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love the smell, but the end result is worth it.</li>
            <li> My hands, after massaging the cream into her feet, felt great the next day.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This (Cutemol) was recommended to me by a dermatologist, who provided me with some free samples four months ago.  </li>
            <li> This is a fabulous duo to the Derma Nail.&lt;br /&gt;Fabulous for hands and nails.</li>
            <li> Great cream for cracked hands and cuticles, especially in winter months</li>
            <li> Fantastic cuticle moisturizer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to putting a smooth lotion on my hands.  </li>
            <li> easy to apply and works great on dry cuticles</li>
            <li> Original Review:</li>
            <li> Found it inn my dermatologist&#x27;s office originally.</li>
            <li> Have tried many other products if you use as directed it is by far the best !</li>
            <li> Really great cream for dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is great for really dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Works great when my skin gets dry and ichy.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this cream as it claims, just did NOT work though was recommended by dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> A great cream if you have very dry skin on your hands.</li>
            <li> CAn&#x27;t say enough good things about this cream.  </li>
            <li> If you try this stuff, I really think you&#x27;ll be pleased.</li>
            <li> Since i began using Cutemol,  I  have successfully prevented dry winter hands and skin cracks on my fingertips and knuckles.</li>
            <li> but it absorbs quickly and feels silky and smooth right away.</li>
            <li> It is for this reason that I do not use it during the daytime; application is best left prior to bedtime.</li>
            <li> One main reason I bought this cream is more for my finger nails.</li>
            <li> especially good if you have skin  problems surrounding your nails, for weak split and brittle nails</li>
            <li> I recently discovered this product and am so glad I did!  </li>
            <li> Cutemol is the best for very dry skin especially eczema.  </li>
            <li> and I feel it is well worth the money, giving me protection and relief..</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s worth it &#x27;cause it works.</li>
            <li> dry,cracked cuticles and hands into soft healthy looking hands and cuticles in 2 days.</li>
            <li> Even the residue is eventually absorbed by my skin after an hour or so.</li>
            <li> If you have extremely dry, cracked skin and most general moisturizers have been ineffective, Cutemol is an extremely good choice</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!!!</li>
            <li> It is a bit greasy at first, but it seeps in quickly.  </li>
            <li> Both products are manufactured by Summers Labs and are meant to be used together, although I believe any other good moisturizer would also work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For ordinary cracked fingertips, it is very good, but chronic, genetic-origin cracked fingertips, not so much.</li>
            <li> But this is no longer the right product for me</li>
            <li> Most lotions and creams make my hands itch, turn bright red and dry my already parched skin out</li>
            <li> so I would be more likely to carry it with me and therefore use it more frequently.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t necessary to apply a great deal of this at any one time, thus I&#x27;m happy to have the small tube and this larger one, as I suspect I will be using this for my problem cuticles for years to come.</li>
            <li> Amazon.com has been great about finding products that I sometimes cannot find in local stores, and don&#x27;t have time to run to different locations looking for it.</li>
            <li> I have been primarily using Neutrogena Fragrance Free Norwegian Formula up until now (</li>
            <li> This is by far the best cream for my dry hands and cuticles, especially in winter in the North East USA.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to sound like a commercial, but it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Great product, but it is hard to get it out of the tube.</li>
            <li> well, it&#x27;s tied for first place with o&#x27;keeffe&#x27;s working hands cream.</li>
            <li> I have to use this more than two times daily when I have a break out.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s the same consistency, perhaps a bit more quick-drying.  </li>
            <li> First time you put it on those cracks don&#x27;t hurt and then in a couple days they are healed - a must for the winter.</li>
            <li> It is a bit greasy at first.</li>
            <li> I like it so much that I now have one mailed to me periodically!  </li>
            <li> This is the first product that has worked.</li>
            <li> My hands get dry and flaky very easily.  </li>
            <li> Other lotions just kind of coat my hands.  </li>
            <li> This is the first one that&#x27;s really worked.  </li>
            <li> it is far superior to any other product I have ever found or been given by a manicurist.  </li>
            <li> This is very thick and you need to rub it in good, but it makes my dry hands feel so much better!  </li>
            <li> My hair was back in shape and easy to manage where before using it</li>
            <li> At that rate, I expect the tube to last a long time, which is good</li>
            <li> container is that it is priced very high for the quantity of product received.</li>
            <li> I have tried many hand cremes for my very dry hands and bought this one on the advice of a friend.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need much, use sparingly.</li>
            <li> THANKS SUMMERS LABS.</li>
            <li> so it stays on really well.</li>
            <li> but it really works</li>
            <li> I have a very severe case of hand eczema and this was recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I really had to &amp;#34;rub it in&amp;#34; for some time before my hands felt reasonable.  </li>
            <li> But this cream really takes the dryness away and stays on even after washing your hands a couple times.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not cheap, but is quite effective.</li>
            <li> It does make some difference but is not permanent you need to keep using you maybe able to achieve that with other cream</li>
            <li> love this cream very dry where I live and dr. suggested this cream</li>
            <li> When massaged in on top of the Dermanail, both products are locked down onto the surface of the nail.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> RICH EMOLLIENT IS DOING WONDERS FOR MY DRY CUTICLES,</li>
            <li> This instantly made my dry cuticles better.</li>
            <li> best thing in recent years I could find was the Euercrin ointment - the thick, gooey stuff that never really absorbs well even with MY skin!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this lotion for people who frequently wash their hands.</li>
            <li> From the first use, this cream instantly soothes irritated skin, absorbs but stays with you.  </li>
            <li> Even small spots of eczema get better after using this cream.</li>
            <li> Most lotions that claim to leave a non oily residue never really do much for my dry hands and feet.  </li>
            <li> Your skin will be soft, but not greasy.  </li>
            <li> I use it 2-6 times a day and my red, rashy hands look almost normal now!  </li>
            <li> The only cream that keeps my hands in decent shape in winter.  </li>
            <li> No other cream you can just purchase without a prescription works as well, believe me, I have tried them all!</li>
            <li> There is a kind of greasy residue left behind (which the description explains is an intentional feature of the product)</li>
            <li> if I can get past the unique smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been on a quest trying to find products that work for my funky skin and came across this one on AMAZON, ready the reviews and tried it not really expecting anything</li>
            <li> My hands are always dry from frequent hand washing, and especially in the winter my skin cracks around the knuckles and bleeds unless I really slather the lotion on multiple times a day.  </li>
            <li> We got this cream for my wife who has VERY dry skin, particularly her feet.</li>
            <li> Other creams I have tried don&#x27;t moisturize as well as Cutemol, or they leave my hands very greasy.  </li>
            <li> I like the fact that it&#x27;s fragrance free and that a small amount goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Unless you need something this small for travel purposes or other reasons of space, I&#x27;d suggest opting instead for the larger jar -- it&#x27;s a much better value for the money.</li>
            <li> When we first used it, it reminded me of heavy lube, like axle grease.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cutemol is a thick white cream with a heavy dose of lanolin and mineral oil that creates an effective moisture barrier on the skin.</li>
            <li> This is a very thick product which rubs in easily.</li>
            <li> This lotion (Cutemol) is very, very thick but after about 2-3 minutes of massaging into the skin, it is considerably less greasy than other &amp;#34;intensive repair&amp;#34;-type products I have tried; such as for example Eucerin Aquaphor which I could not tolerate at all due to the greasy &amp;#34;after-feel&amp;#34; and it didn&#x27;t seem to do a very good job of softening and healing my hands.  </li>
            <li> This cream makes my hands soft and relieves the pain I get from dry hands.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely thick and a bit greasy on application, but it quickly soaks in.  </li>
            <li> It works after application, because it is urea and a thick emollient, but it is not anything that hasn&#x27;t existed previously, just rebranded to appear more &amp;#34;medical&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;prescriptive&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I have VERY dry, sensitive fussy skin - especially my hands.  </li>
            <li> I live in the dry Southwest and this is the only product I have found that helps my dry cuticles.</li>
            <li> This cream is very thick and rich.  </li>
            <li> I could barely run a comb through it when wet....or dry for that matter.</li>
            <li> This cream helps not only dry hands but cracks and fissures.  </li>
            <li> peeling,,,in few hours it was almost completely healed!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone who finds that using the usual oils are ineffective.</li>
            <li> - I am curious if this is jut diaper rash cream with some extra things to make it for adults.  </li>
            <li> You have to really work it into your skin because it is so thick</li>
            <li> and it is not too greasy like a lot of other similar products.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin which cracks in the winter.  </li>
            <li> I have had cracked dry hands for years and my allergist recommended Cutemol.  </li>
            <li> I got this at the recomendation of a dermatoligist because my hands were getting painfully dry.  </li>
            <li> turns out that my dry, cracked (sometimes to the point of bleeding) hands need waxy or lanolin-containing creams, not oils.</li>
            <li> I faithfully use lotion on my hands, but I still wind up with dry, cracked cuticles.  </li>
            <li> It also helped my dry cuticles and is helping my cracking and peeling finger nails.</li>
            <li> While it is not a cure, it has dramatically helped the dry skin and itchiness.  </li>
            <li> This has helped my dry hands.</li>
            <li> nothing has ever worked to keep my hands from continually cracking and splitting during dry weather.</li>
            <li> We use it every night on chapped dry hands, cracked heels, etc.  </li>
            <li> which was dry and</li>
            <li> I use it on my dry lips at night too.</li>
            <li> I use it on my dry feet and cracked heals.</li>
            <li> I use it myself for severely dry hands and broken nails from keeping my hands in so much water daily.  </li>
            <li> I have had trouble with cracked and dry heels for several years, nothing seemed to help long term.</li>
            <li> I can now wear sandals without the embarrassment of dry, cracked heels!</li>
            <li> I used Cutemol for very dry and cracked skin on my fingers.</li>
            <li> One application transformed my ugly, dry, ragged, flaky cuticles into something respectable.  </li>
            <li> this product heals those little tiny cracks you get on your fingers in the winter.  </li>
            <li> However, it is very thick to spread on hands, I use the trick - dampen my skin gently so that it is easier to apply.</li>
            <li> The 2 oz size goes a long way, and is small enough to carry around with you.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a tad expensive, but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> it was partially liquified when it should be a dense cream.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive but it&#x27;s worth it...</li>
            <li> I have found and have already ordered the larger size and another small tube.</li>
            <li> I tried other products but nothing works as well as Cutemol.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a supplement to the DermaNail product but didn&#x27;t know that DermaNail also includes a small tube of this same cream.</li>
            <li> I looked at the other products sold by this manufacturer and it seems they sell alot of baby cream products</li>
            <li> I prefer other cremes.</li>
            <li> Healed my dry finger tips and cuticles in a few days.  </li>
            <li> You may find this hard to believe,  but I once used it overnight as a deep hair conditioner  when my hair was fried from having the color stripped.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint about this 2-oz.</li>
            <li> My feet are as soft as a baby&#x27;s behind, and so are my hands.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is that its really thick</li>
            <li> My skin has been so bad over the years, especially my hands, that&#x27;s it makes me really self conscience when people stare at my hands and ask if I have poison</li>
            <li> I typically suffer from cracked skin on my knuckles and around my fingernails &amp; have tried dozens of products to gain some relief.  </li>
            <li> I found, however, that it had the consistency and feel of cold creme, and was very oily.  </li>
            <li> It is a heavy cream that can be used night or day but with gloves.  </li>
            <li> It is not a light cream, as it clings to the skin and puts a protective layer on the skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a hobby woodworker for years, and my hands get really dried out from all the wood and sawdust.  </li>
            <li> A colleague introduced me to the jar version of this  product a few years ago.</li>
            <li> I use it before I go to sleep at night, and after my hands have been exposed to water or harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> and I mean small goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this is so costly as it is a typical urea-based product.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, I end up using the thick lotions that do look extremely greasy and too shiny on my hands.  </li>
            <li> I had problems with very dry skin and my fingers were the worse.</li>
            <li> It goes on a little thick and greasy...</li>
            <li> I have really bad eczema and this cream really helps keep my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> You have to use a small amount or follow the instructions on the tube to avoid greasiness.  </li>
            <li> No more, this stuff works wonders.</li>
            <li> I purchased a small 2oz.tube of this moisturizing cream to be used in conjunction with Summers Lab DermaNail Nail Conditioner, a product recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> No more hang nails to clip or</li>
            <li> Definitely work trying--you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> THIS CREAM HAS BEEN A AIDE RELIEVING DRYNESS FROM HARD WATER WASHINGS EVERYDAY!</li>
            <li> and i got it for him and got myself a tube and found it keeps the winter hangnails from getting hard and splitting away from your nails.  </li>
            <li> At least it didn&#x27;t burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; I leave it on my cuticles for at least five minutes before rubbing in.  </li>
            <li> It is really thick</li>
            <li> The normally thick liquid and separated in a watery substance and some cream.  </li>
            <li> Its thick</li>
            <li> In fact, the &amp;#34;solar oil&amp;#34; that is usually recommended by salons makes my cuticles worse and this cream helps.</li>
            <li> A very small dab....</li>
            <li> I have had a bad habit of picking at my cuticles because they are so dry and thick.  </li>
            <li> This is some serious lotion!  </li>
            <li> Within a week I noticed a difference and by two weeks no more painful cracks and bleeding.  </li>
            <li> Expensive, yes,</li>
            <li> Something was wrong with it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy, was I wrong!  </li>
            <li> but my cuticle habit is nearly as bad.  </li>
            <li> I have struggled with ugly heels for years.</li>
            <li> Follow directions given for applying, and you will not be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> A Dr prescribed it for my boyfriend who has terrible splits in the skin in his thumbs</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> A great cream if you have very dry skin on your hands.</li>
            <li> Cutemol is an excellent cream for dry cuticles and hands. I have seen a nice improvement and fewer ragged cuticles since I started using it.</li>
            <li> Cutemol was recommended to me by my dermatologist for dry, cracking and peeling finger nails and it works wonderfully!  I&#x27;m extremely satisfied w/it.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this cream as it claims, just did NOT work though was recommended by dermatologist.  Cheaper over the counter hand cream worked better than this.</li>
            <li> Cutemol works amazingly well and is an excellent product. My only complaint about this 2-oz. container is that it is priced very high for the quantity of product received. Unless you need something this small for travel purposes or other reasons of space, I&#x27;d suggest opting instead for the larger jar -- it&#x27;s a much better value for the money.</li>
            <li> I have VERY dry, sensitive fussy skin - especially my hands.  Most lotions and creams make my hands itch, turn bright red and dry my already parched skin out even worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing in recent years I could find was the Euercrin ointment - the thick, gooey stuff that never really absorbs well even with MY skin!  At least it didn&#x27;t burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been on a quest trying to find products that work for my funky skin and came across this one on AMAZON, ready the reviews and tried it not really expecting anything great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy, was I wrong!  From the first use, this cream instantly soothes irritated skin, absorbs but stays with you.  I use it 2-6 times a day and my red, rashy hands look almost normal now!  My skin has been so bad over the years, especially my hands, that&#x27;s it makes me really self conscience when people stare at my hands and ask if I have poison oak!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The is the BEST product hands down (LOL) I have found and have already ordered the larger size and another small tube.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin which cracks in the winter.  Dermatologist recommended this cream and it works wonders.  My skin looks so much better in just a couple of days.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Dr. recommended. Use it at night and put cotton gloves on. Works well.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00121TEQW Cutemol Emollient Cream, 2-Ounce]]  We actually just ordered 2 8 ounce tubs.  I have had cracked dry hands for years and my allergist recommended Cutemol.  Absolutely best and only effective cream I have ever used.  Not cheap, but much cheaper on Amazon.  Have let friends and family with the same problem use it and they have the ordered it as well.  CAn&#x27;t say enough good things about this cream.  Be sure to order in the 8 ounce tub.</li>
            <li> I have damaged hands and I have found the Cutemol Emolient cream to be a blessing.  It is a heavy cream that can be used night or day but with gloves.  It is not a light cream, as it clings to the skin and puts a protective layer on the skin.  This cream was suggested to me by my Dermitologist and I feel it is well worth the money, giving me protection and relief..</li>
            <li> My hands get dry and flaky very easily.  This cream makes my hands soft and relieves the pain I get from dry hands.  Other creams I have tried don&#x27;t moisturize as well as Cutemol, or they leave my hands very greasy.  Cutemol will not leave your hands greasy.  You have to use a small amount or follow the instructions on the tube to avoid greasiness.  Also, it seems like the cream actually seals in the moisture!  Other lotions just kind of coat my hands.  For me, it feels like Cutemol locks in the moisture and actually creates a barrier on my skin.  Also works for eczema!  Wish I had known about this sooner.</li>
            <li> One application transformed my ugly, dry, ragged, flaky cuticles into something respectable.  And the improvement lasted almost all day, through a couple of hand-washings.  The improvement is not only cosmetic--I&#x27;ve been using this fairly faithfully once a day for about two weeks, and my nails are fundamentally improved.  They look good even when I forget to use Cutemol in the morning.  Really amazing.  I don&#x27;t hide my hands anymore.</li>
            <li> I got this at the recomendation of a dermatoligist because my hands were getting painfully dry.  No more, this stuff works wonders.</li>
            <li> It does make some difference but is not permanent you need to keep using you maybe able to achieve that with other cream</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a hobby woodworker for years, and my hands get really dried out from all the wood and sawdust.  I typically suffer from cracked skin on my knuckles and around my fingernails &amp; have tried dozens of products to gain some relief.  This is the first one that&#x27;s really worked.  I like the fact that it&#x27;s fragrance free and that a small amount goes a long way.  If you try this stuff, I really think you&#x27;ll be pleased.</li>
            <li> Have tried many other products if you use as directed it is by far the best !</li>
            <li> I tried other products but nothing works as well as Cutemol. I love that it&#x27;s thicker than lotion or cream. I know I&#x27;m going to see results in hours, not days!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best cream for my dry hands and cuticles, especially in winter in the North East USA. My dermatologist gave me a sample and I love it. I don&#x27;t understand why this product isn&#x27;t on the shelves at the local stores. It goes on a little thick and greasy...but it absorbs quickly and feels silky and smooth right away. Expensive, yes, but I think it&#x27;s worth it &#x27;cause it works.</li>
            <li> For ordinary cracked fingertips, it is very good, but chronic, genetic-origin cracked fingertips, not so much. I will continue to use it as it does dampen the pain and seems to make for some healing.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff, it works better than any over the counter cream .</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist,</li>
            <li> This cream is the best thing thing for keeping  split skin around fingers soft &amp; supple. A Dr prescribed it for my boyfriend who has terrible splits in the skin in his thumbs and i got it for him and got myself a tube and found it keeps the winter hangnails from getting hard and splitting away from your nails.  Havent had a hangnail since i got it.</li>
            <li> well, it&#x27;s tied for first place with o&#x27;keeffe&#x27;s working hands cream. i did a huge test of as many recommended hand lotions and creams as i could find, and this and o&#x27;keeffe&#x27;s are miles better, for me, than anything else. turns out that my dry, cracked (sometimes to the point of bleeding) hands need waxy or lanolin-containing creams, not oils. this and o&#x27;keeffe&#x27;s are fantastic. i keep this one in my purse and o&#x27;keeffe&#x27;s in my nightstand for overnight use.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist, I ordered Cutemol from Amazon since I can&#x27;t buy it is any pharmacy locally.  It is magic.  Healed my dry finger tips and cuticles in a few days.  Cutemol is now a staple of my skin-treatment remedies. Spot on!</li>
            <li> I faithfully use lotion on my hands, but I still wind up with dry, cracked cuticles.  This cream finally cured that problem.  It&#x27;s extremely thick and a bit greasy on application, but it quickly soaks in.  I still use my regular lotion and then put this all around my cuticles.  A drop the size of pea will do all ten fingers.  At that rate, I expect the tube to last a long time, which is good cause it&#x27;s a tad expensive, but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> This instantly made my dry cuticles better. I don&#x27;t love the smell, but the end result is worth it.</li>
            <li> I get cracked, bleeding hands in the winter.  This helps a lot.  I have to use this more than two times daily when I have a break out.  This is the best product I have found.</li>
            <li> This cream is very thick and rich.  My dermatologist had recommended it for my psoriasis, and it does help quite a bit.  I use it between flare-ups and also during flareups with prescribed medication.  The 2 OZ size is great for traveling.</li>
            <li> Cutemol is the best for very dry skin especially eczema.  The trick is to put a pea size amount on the skin and massage with a dab a water.  Your skin will be soft, but not greasy.  This is a winter staple in my house.</li>
            <li> This is very thick and you need to rub it in good, but it makes my dry hands feel so much better!  I will definitely reorder!</li>
            <li> We got this cream for my wife who has VERY dry skin, particularly her feet. When we first used it, it reminded me of heavy lube, like axle grease. But, it goes on easily and absorbs well. My hands, after massaging the cream into her feet, felt great the next day.&lt;br /&gt;It is not cheap, but is quite effective. We&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> I had problems with very dry skin and my fingers were the worse. I even went to the doctor and nothing he prescribed worked. Found this stuff at the dermatologist I take my son too, and OMG it couldn&#x27;t be happier. My husband loves it too.</li>
            <li> I used Cutemol for very dry and cracked skin on my fingers. It has done wonders clearing up the condition. Nothing else I tried would help. It also helped my dry cuticles and is helping my cracking and peeling finger nails. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the best cream I ever found for rough heels, and I have tried a bunch.  Don&#x27;t need much, use sparingly.</li>
            <li> THANKS SUMMERS LABS. YOUR PRODUCTS IS EVERYTHING YOU STATED! RICH EMOLLIENT IS DOING WONDERS FOR MY DRY CUTICLES, AS A PERSON WHO IS CONSTANTLY IN WATER THIS CREAM HAS BEEN A AIDE RELIEVING DRYNESS FROM HARD WATER WASHINGS EVERYDAY! THANK YOU AGAIN. PLEASE CONTINUE TO MAKE MORE. I WILL NEED IT!</li>
            <li> Really great cream for dry skin.</li>
            <li> This cream helps not only dry hands but cracks and fissures.  It is really thick so it stays on really well.</li>
            <li> This is the finest emollient cream I have ever seen.  I used it on my mother when she was in the nursing home to prevent skin breakdown.  I use it myself for severely dry hands and broken nails from keeping my hands in so much water daily.  It&#x27;s wonderful to put on at bedtime, massage into cuticles and under/around nails.  Follow directions given for applying, and you will not be disappointed.  Amazon.com has been great about finding products that I sometimes cannot find in local stores, and don&#x27;t have time to run to different locations looking for it.</li>
            <li> Something was wrong with it.  It had spoiled.  The normally thick liquid and separated in a watery substance and some cream.  I would never order from that supplier again.</li>
            <li> The cream was spoiled. it was partially liquified when it should be a dense cream.  I had no idea how to return it so I threw it away and  will never purchase anything like this through amazon again</li>
            <li> A colleague introduced me to the jar version of this  product a few years ago. I have been using it diligently on my hands . Since i began using Cutemol,  I  have successfully prevented dry winter hands and skin cracks on my fingertips and knuckles. I was delighted to find the tube version that travels with me .</li>
            <li> UPDATE 05/25/2016: I stopped using this product quite some time ago because it contains parabens. If you have concerns about parabens in your personal care products you should not use this product. It may not be an issue of concern for everyone, you&#x27;re free to make your own judgements. But this is no longer the right product for me and I regret that I would no longer recommend this product.  Original Review: This (Cutemol) was recommended to me by a dermatologist, who provided me with some free samples four months ago.  I have been primarily using Neutrogena Fragrance Free Norwegian Formula up until now (which remains a good product and I will continue to use it also).  My hands are always dry from frequent hand washing, and especially in the winter my skin cracks around the knuckles and bleeds unless I really slather the lotion on multiple times a day.  This lotion (Cutemol) is very, very thick but after about 2-3 minutes of massaging into the skin, it is considerably less greasy than other &amp;#34;intensive repair&amp;#34;-type products I have tried; such as for example Eucerin Aquaphor which I could not tolerate at all due to the greasy &amp;#34;after-feel&amp;#34; and it didn&#x27;t seem to do a very good job of softening and healing my hands.  Also, I am always pleased by lotion products without any fragrance, which Cutemol is (unscented that is).  It&#x27;s especially great just before bedtime but suitable for use during the day too when you still need to use your hands for typing on the computer, writing with a pen, and other applications which are otherwise hampered by greasy lotions.  The 2 oz size goes a long way, and is small enough to carry around with you.  I bought two 2 oz bottles rather than the larger 8 oz jar so I would be more likely to carry it with me and therefore use it more frequently.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this is so costly as it is a typical urea-based product.  It doesn&#x27;t have the traditional &amp;#34;my grandmother&#x27;s handcream&amp;#34; urea smell, but it&#x27;s the same consistency, perhaps a bit more quick-drying.  It works after application, because it is urea and a thick emollient, but it is not anything that hasn&#x27;t existed previously, just rebranded to appear more &amp;#34;medical&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;prescriptive&amp;#34;.  If there is a scent-free urea product, you will have the same results, IMHO.</li>
            <li> Always have it on hand.</li>
            <li> Best cream for dry skin!</li>
            <li> especially good if you have skin  problems surrounding your nails, for weak split and brittle nails</li>
            <li> I have had trouble with cracked and dry heels for several years, nothing seemed to help long term. A couple of times a week at bedtime, I put on Cutemol, followed by socks.  My feet are as soft as a baby&#x27;s behind, and so are my hands.  What an amazing difference.  My sister has psoriasis, and she has also used it.  While it is not a cure, it has dramatically helped the dry skin and itchiness.  What a find!!!!</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by my dermatologist and it worked perfectly, clearing my eczema on my hands.  Good product.</li>
            <li> easy to apply and works great on dry cuticles and it is not too greasy like a lot of other similar products.  plus it has a very nice scent</li>
            <li> Please see my review of review of Cutemol Emollient Cream, 8-Ounce as this is the same product.  This size is good to keep in the car or my purse.</li>
            <li> I have had a bad habit of picking at my cuticles because they are so dry and thick.  I end up making myself bleed at times.  This is the best product I have found to deal with the problem-- it is far superior to any other product I have ever found or been given by a manicurist.  I stopped being a nail biter over 40 years ago but my cuticle habit is nearly as bad.  If I remember to put this on every night, problem is solved.  Also great for gnarly toe nails and toe cuticles...</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous duo to the Derma Nail.&lt;br /&gt;Fabulous for hands and nails. A deep deep cream. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Great cream for cracked hands and cuticles, especially in winter months</li>
            <li> this product heals those little tiny cracks you get on your fingers in the winter.  First time you put it on those cracks don&#x27;t hurt and then in a couple days they are healed - a must for the winter.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a supplement to the DermaNail product but didn&#x27;t know that DermaNail also includes a small tube of this same cream. This is a very thick product which rubs in easily. It isn&#x27;t necessary to apply a great deal of this at any one time, thus I&#x27;m happy to have the small tube and this larger one, as I suspect I will be using this for my problem cuticles for years to come. I just wish I had found this product earlier. I highly recommend this to anyone who finds that using the usual oils are ineffective. In fact, the &amp;#34;solar oil&amp;#34; that is usually recommended by salons makes my cuticles worse and this cream helps.</li>
            <li> everyone should have in MD kit.</li>
            <li> This is some serious lotion!  You have to really work it into your skin because it is so thick but it really works</li>
            <li> Great product, but it is hard to get it out of the tube.</li>
            <li> I live in the dry Southwest and this is the only product I have found that helps my dry cuticles. My dermatologist recommended this and I was pleased to find it available on Amazon at a better price.</li>
            <li> love this cream very dry where I live and dr. suggested this cream</li>
            <li> This cream was recommended by my dermatologist. It is the only cream that protects my hands from the dryness and severe cracking and bleeding in winter. It is a bit greasy at first. I apply it at night and wear cotton gloves to bed. In the morning apply a second time. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I have a very severe case of hand eczema and this was recommended by my dermatologist. It is by far the best cream that I have found.</li>
            <li> I purchased a small 2oz.tube of this moisturizing cream to be used in conjunction with Summers Lab DermaNail Nail Conditioner, a product recommended by my dermatologist. Both products are manufactured by Summers Labs and are meant to be used together, although I believe any other good moisturizer would also work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cutemol is a thick white cream with a heavy dose of lanolin and mineral oil that creates an effective moisture barrier on the skin. It requires massaging into preferably moist skin and it leaves fingers and palms feeling sticky and somewhat greasy. It is for this reason that I do not use it during the daytime; application is best left prior to bedtime. When massaged in on top of the Dermanail, both products are locked down onto the surface of the nail.&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested in a hand cream that goes on quickly and disappears rapidly, you will not be happy with this product. If you have extremely dry, cracked skin and most general moisturizers have been ineffective, Cutemol is an extremely good choice</li>
            <li> I have really bad eczema and this cream really helps keep my skin moisturized. No other cream you can just purchase without a prescription works as well, believe me, I have tried them all!</li>
            <li> Received promptly and well.  Have been pleased with product performance.  Will reorder!</li>
            <li> Love It! This has helped my dry hands. I work with a lot of paper and wash my hands a lot.</li>
            <li> THE SEARCH IS OVER! I&#x27;ve tried everything...nothing has ever worked to keep my hands from continually cracking and splitting during dry weather. I still cannot believe how well this prouct works. I don&#x27;t want to sound like a commercial, but it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This is great for really dry skin.  I tried a lot of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products as I wish to avoid chemicals that aren&#x27;t good - however, I have to say I have never found anything as good as this, will try to use it sparingly, as it does have things in it I would prefer not to have, but it DOES work!!</li>
            <li> Cutemol hand (and feet, too) cream transformed my dry,cracked cuticles and hands into soft healthy looking hands and cuticles in 2 days. No more hang nails to clip or cuticles to cut.  I use it before I go to sleep at night, and after my hands have been exposed to water or harsh chemicals.  It is a bit greasy at first, but it seeps in quickly.  I have also tried applying it to damp hands. That works too.  I love this product and would recommend it to everyone.  [[ASIN:B00121TEQW Cutemol Emollient Cream, 2-Ounce]]</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time - althoguh it smells like baby diaper rash cream.  I looked at the other products sold by this manufacturer and it seems they sell alot of baby cream products - I am curious if this is jut diaper rash cream with some extra things to make it for adults.  The product worked okay if I can get past the unique smell.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty amazing.  I use it before I go to bed, on hands and especially cuticles. It heals them overnight. Definitely work trying--you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Been using for years.  Good for all types of skin&lt;br /&gt;irritation. You may find this hard to believe,  but I once used it overnight as a deep hair conditioner  when my hair was fried from having the color stripped.  To my surprise it worked better than the products meant for that purpose.  My hair was back in shape and easy to manage where before using it I could barely run a comb through it when wet....or dry for that matter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive but it&#x27;s worth it...it has been the best treatment I have ever used for my dry, peeling cuticles.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have tried many creams...and we keep coming back to this one.  It&#x27;s priceless.  We use it every night on chapped dry hands, cracked heels, etc.  Even small spots of eczema get better after using this cream.</li>
            <li> Works great when my skin gets dry and ichy.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Its thick but if you warm up in your hands it goes on a lot lighter and faster</li>
            <li> Fantastic cuticle moisturizer; I leave it on my cuticles for at least five minutes before rubbing in.  Great for maintaining nice nails.  There is a kind of greasy residue left behind (which the description explains is an intentional feature of the product) but since I use it on the tops of my hands, and not the palm side, it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  Even the residue is eventually absorbed by my skin after an hour or so.</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with this product.  Overall some changes in my nails did occur beneficially.</li>
            <li> Wow this lotion is AWESOME! i only had to use it once on my left shoulder which was dry and peeling,,,in few hours it was almost completely healed! I use it on my dry lips at night too. I highly recommend this lotion for people who frequently wash their hands. The only thing is that its really thick but if u put it at night before going to bed it wont bother u.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to putting a smooth lotion on my hands.  This product does not spread evenly and then leaves a sticky feeling on your hands.  I have not seen an improvment in the moisture in my hands.</li>
            <li> A very small dab....and I mean small goes a long way. I have to use it for several month to see result as it is for my fingernails.</li>
            <li> I have tried many hand cremes for my very dry hands and bought this one on the advice of a friend.  I found, however, that it had the consistency and feel of cold creme, and was very oily.  I really had to &amp;#34;rub it in&amp;#34; for some time before my hands felt reasonable.  I prefer other cremes.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!!! I love it and very fast delivery!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this cream!  Most lotions that claim to leave a non oily residue never really do much for my dry hands and feet.  Therefore, I end up using the thick lotions that do look extremely greasy and too shiny on my hands.  But this cream really takes the dryness away and stays on even after washing your hands a couple times.  It also leaves your hands looking and feeling deeply moisturized without all of the greasiness!!  I would definitely recommend this product!  I like it so much that I now have one mailed to me periodically!  It&#x27;s better than any lotion I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried a ton!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion I have found to treat severe dry skin. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this cream for about 1 week now. It seems work well in terms of moisturizing my hand skin. However, it is very thick to spread on hands, I use the trick - dampen my skin gently so that it is easier to apply. Also, I wish the smell could be more pleasant, although it doesn&#x27;t bother me that much. One main reason I bought this cream is more for my finger nails. For some reason, I noticed that my nails have been chipping, which it never happened before. This cream says it works on nails too, so I want to give it a try. I guess I need to wait for some time to see the result on my nails.</li>
            <li> I have cracked bleeding hands.  I have tried every hand cream and lotion/cream on the market.  I finally ordered Cutemol and it works!  Within a week I noticed a difference and by two weeks no more painful cracks and bleeding.  I&#x27;m going to order the larger container next time!</li>
            <li> This product works!!!  The only cream that keeps my hands in decent shape in winter.  Found it inn my dermatologist&#x27;s office originally.</li>
            <li> I recently discovered this product and am so glad I did!  I use it on my dry feet and cracked heals. I have struggled with ugly heels for years. This is the first product that has worked. I can now wear sandals without the embarrassment of dry, cracked heels!</li>
