    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Great!</li>
            <li>tell me my lashes looked great and would ask me if i changed mascarra or something!</li>
            <li>so they&#x27;re the best they can be.</li>
            <li>this way you look great when you get up in the morning before you do anything!    </li>
            <li>Would happily have carried on forever ...</li>
            <li>But I heard lots of good comments about this product.</li>
            <li>and it took a good 3 weeks to start seeing a difference.  </li>
            <li>I think Talika is a good balance and price and effect</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for 2 weeks and the results are absolutely amazing...  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just ordered some more because i want to see how good i can get my lashes...    </li>
            <li>and the technician complimented me on how nice my eyelashes are.  </li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t see a \\&quot;miracle\\&quot;  after using this product for over a month.  </li>
            <li>i noticed a huge difference!</li>
            <li>but others started to notice too which was huge for me!</li>
            <li>(make sure to get as close as you can to the lash line).  </li>
            <li>I have been putting mascara over the Talika during the day and it seems ok.</li>
            <li>I was amazed, my lashes are noticeably longer, thicker, and have more of a curl to them.  </li>
            <li>Might not work for everyone, but it sure does for me.  </li>
            <li>and they look more even.  </li>
            <li>I just ordered 2 more.</li>
            <li>on nice clean ungreasy (pre-moisturised) skin + lashes.</li>
            <li>Much more filled in</li>
            <li>It really just makes them about twice as good at</li>
            <li>I bought this after seeing the high price of revitalash and seeing a review that said it was as good.</li>
            <li>Very pleased and I highly recommend.     </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had eyelash extensions before and this stuff is better: more natural and versatile, but just as cute and way cheaper.  </li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s an important part of letting your lashes re-grow, so if you can skip the mascara, do.</li>
            <li>it is so worth the $35!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m blonde and fair skinned, and my eyelashes have always been sort of light in color.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product despite the fact that it takes more than 28 days to product to work.</li>
            <li>I have searched high and low for an effective and safe eye lash conditioner/lengthener.  </li>
            <li>I read many good reviews of this product, but I am a sceptic by nature and took far to long to give this product a try.  </li>
            <li>I used it on my eyebrows because my left side was becoming sparse (more than the right).  </li>
            <li>right now-</li>
            <li>It is a clear gel, and when you put it on it kind of makes your lashes look like they do when you get out of the water -- natural and dewy.</li>
            <li>The formula is very gentle and it does not irritate my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff; makes me feel like a maybeline commercial!  </li>
            <li>this MIRACLE GEL really really works!</li>
            <li>I purchased and used this product consistently for months with no results.</li>
            <li>I read the positive reviews and ordered this</li>
            <li>It really does work and it doesn&#x27;t cost as much as Latise, etc.</li>
            <li>Much researching and review</li>
            <li>I say &#x27;skin&#x27; because you need to treat the roots of your lashes and work the stuff onto the eye lid itself really.</li>
            <li>I make sure my lashes feel wet.</li>
            <li>Ive been sweeping the wet brush over my eyebrows as well by the way - and they seem thicker too   :)    </li>
            <li>If you really pile it on it may make your eyes water a bit, but</li>
            <li>nothing unusual considering you&#x27;re smearing stuff on your eyes.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t really tell how much.</li>
            <li>It really does work for me.</li>
            <li>but other people might be looking for more effect or be unwilling to spend this much.    </li>
            <li>and she said that if I didnt see a difference in 28 days, I could bring it back for a full refund.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d encourage trying it out though, you might find you really like your new lashes</li>
            <li>I bought this about 4 weeks ago, and I&#x27;ve been using it more or less twice a day since I got it.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes more, sometimes less.  </li>
            <li>i actually had many different people that never knew i tried this item</li>
            <li>Some, like Ardell are a lot cheaper and do work, some like Revitalash are way more expensive but may work slighly better.</li>
            <li>then you&#x27;re only going to have a few months of good lashes.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes looked pretty much the same-- no growth, no added fullness or length!</li>
            <li>In fact, my lashes have grown so healthy and full that I recently opted to have them died black ($25 at my local salon)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had very full or long lashes and recently my lashes started to fall out.  </li>
            <li>I love long eye lashes, and I do have long eye lashes</li>
            <li>The product doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes at all, and I have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>It goes on clear</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with the results from using the Talika Eyelash Lipocils.  </li>
            <li>So I used the product for the whole 28 days, I still have some left in the bottle.</li>
            <li>, I never thought I had sensitive eyes, but after every application, I would tear up and my eyes would get somewhat irritated.   </li>
            <li>But ... i gradualy found i had less and less of my own lashes to work with and then ended up with puffy itchy eyelids.</li>
            <li>but after a few weeks of using this gel morning and night ontop of clean lashes</li>
            <li>but if you stop using it after about a month they go back to normal.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but Talika Lipocils actually works, if you give it enough time.</li>
            <li>but i did notice a major major difference in the length and fullness of my lashes.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth the trouble.</li>
            <li>If you are going for something more dramatic, you might make to consider getting fakes.    </li>
            <li>Feels a little damp at first, then you forget about it.</li>
            <li>At the end of the first four weeks, I noticed a little bit of a difference but it had been so gradual coming on that</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect long, lush, thick eyelashes, but the product is worth a try if you are losing lashes.</li>
            <li>I noticed a slight difference in the thickness and length after about 2 weeks, but I *really* noticed a change when I put on mascara for a night out recently.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I was very skeptical that this kind of product could actually make my eyebrows thicker.  </li>
            <li> I started using this years ago, before the other brands starting coming up with the same thing.</li>
            <li> there was short and stubby and weak and pointing in funny directions.</li>
            <li> In a few short weeks I can see a big difference--tiny eyelashes are growing back.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are definitely NOT thicker, slightly longer</li>
            <li> I was surprised because I didn&#x27;t always remember to use it twice a day, but I did use it at least once a day.</li>
            <li> Missing a day or a week is no big deal</li>
            <li> I took off all the false lashes and was VERY upset with what i&#x27;d done to myself.</li>
            <li> so I have been completely surrounded by beauty products for the past year and a half.  </li>
            <li> on one eye my lashes were uneven and not as full as the other side due to a disasterous fake eyelash removal insident.</li>
            <li> The results are INSTANT, it&#x27;s fuller and longer by at least 50%</li>
            <li> I switched down to using it once a day, expecting that I&#x27;d just finish out the tube I bought and maybe not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I tried covering my sad lashes with normal natural looking day wear false lashes on a strip.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably save the little that I have left for those rare occasions that I do wear mascara, and use it as a base coat or in between coat like it suggests.</li>
            <li> A little pricy, but it works.  </li>
            <li> 50 - 60% missing and what was</li>
            <li> once a day everyday after that.</li>
            <li> There are a few products that work like Talika- strengthening your lashes and keeping them from falling out</li>
            <li> I can say now, I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I may have to slow down or they&#x27;ll be up to my brows!</li>
            <li> I have to admit i was skeptical when considering buying talika eyelash lipocils, but i have always been self concious of my short thinned eyelashes and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I had very thin lashes that fell out almost constantly.  </li>
            <li> At least it didn&#x27;t give me an infection.</li>
            <li> No more difficult than applying mascara everyday and</li>
            <li> My once average natural lashes were now AWFUL.</li>
            <li> But they shifted around and iritated my poor puffy lids, and i gave up.     </li>
            <li> Talika will never make your eyelashes look as thick as they do when you wear fake ones.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my eyelashes were beginning to thin as I neared 40.</li>
            <li> but nothing too dramatic.   </li>
            <li> I am obsessed wtih beauty products.  </li>
            <li> now of course we are not talking baby doll fake looking lashes</li>
            <li> and although I was skeptical, it worked!  </li>
            <li> I used it as directed, but nothing happend.:(</li>
            <li> they looked awful!</li>
            <li> Furthermore, whenever I&#x27;d use this product at night I&#x27;d wake up with awful eye boogers.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I started using this years ago, before the other brands starting coming up with the same thing. I have one eye where the eyelashes started to be sparse. (I think this was caused by waterproof mascara) I use Talika every night before bedtime. In a few short weeks I can see a big difference--tiny eyelashes are growing back. It really does work and it doesn&#x27;t cost as much as Latise, etc.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed wtih beauty products.  I work for Estee Lauder so I have been completely surrounded by beauty products for the past year and a half.  I love long eye lashes, and I do have long eye lashes but I wanted them longer.  I have searched high and low for an effective and safe eye lash conditioner/lengthener.  I went to sephora and a woman recommended Talika Eyelash lipocils.  It was 40 dollars and she said that if I didnt see a difference in 28 days, I could bring it back for a full refund.  A little pricy, but it works.  Also check on sites like ebay or amazon for lower prices.  The formula is very gentle and it does not irritate my eyes.  I just apply it day and night like I would with a mascara (make sure to get as close as you can to the lash line).  I have been using this product for 2 weeks and the results are absolutely amazing...  I may have to slow down or they&#x27;ll be up to my brows!</li>
            <li> My reason for trying Talika Lipocils:     4 months ago (August) i had profesional eyelash extensions put in, decided i could do a better job myself with individual &#x27;permanent&#x27; home aplication ones, and spent the next 6 weeks or so maintaining fabulously long false lashes. I looked like Bambi. 24/7! Great! Would happily have carried on forever ... But ... i gradualy found i had less and less of my own lashes to work with and then ended up with puffy itchy eyelids. I took off all the false lashes and was VERY upset with what i&#x27;d done to myself. My once average natural lashes were now AWFUL. 50 - 60% missing and what was there was short and stubby and weak and pointing in funny directions. Sigh. I tried covering my sad lashes with normal natural looking day wear false lashes on a strip. But they shifted around and iritated my poor puffy lids, and i gave up.     Decision time:    Much researching and review reading later, i ordered a 10ml Talika Lash Gel online for apx £16, Frankly i was prepared to pay three times that to repair my lashes - but thought i&#x27;d start &#x27;mid price range&#x27;. And girls - ITS WORKED! Yay! After 4 weeks my lashes are not only &#x27;repaired&#x27; but longer and thicker than b4 i ruined them. I&#x27;ve just ordered some more because i want to see how good i can get my lashes...    Tips and info:    Use the stuff morn. and eve. on nice clean ungreasy (pre-moisturised) skin + lashes. I say &#x27;skin&#x27; because you need to treat the roots of your lashes and work the stuff onto the eye lid itself really. I make sure my lashes feel wet. then avoid them with your creams and things if you can. I have been putting mascara over the Talika during the day and it seems ok. The brush is a bit spikey, given you have to get the product on the roots - so this time i&#x27;m buying the eyebrow one which is the same stuff, but with a sponge wand i think.  Ive been sweeping the wet brush over my eyebrows as well by the way - and they seem thicker too   :)    Results:     Thicker, longer lovlierlashes! Simply that. Bottom ones as well. Give it a go.</li>
            <li> I have used this product two days only and I have had constant pain, red eyes and burning sensation.</li>
            <li> I read many good reviews of this product, but I am a sceptic by nature and took far to long to give this product a try.  I was pleasantly surprised with the results from using the Talika Eyelash Lipocils.  I had very thin lashes that fell out almost constantly.  I noticed a difference in just a couple of weeks.  My lashes are definately fuller and longer.  In fact, my lashes have grown so healthy and full that I recently opted to have them died black ($25 at my local salon) and I no longer wear mascara.  I am on my second tube of lipocils and plan to continue to use this product permanently.</li>
            <li> I used this product for over 6 months now. I don&#x27;t think there is any change. sometimes, after I apply this product, my eye starts to watering. But I heard lots of good comments about this product. I used it as directed, but nothing happend.:(</li>
            <li> A friend of mine started working at Sephora as I was diagnosed with breast cancer and recommended Talika Eyelash Lipocils.  My chemo buddies are amazed that I still have eyelashes after 4 months of chemo.  I should smear it on my eyebrows and hair...they are gone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had very full or long lashes and recently my lashes started to fall out.  I came across this product and purchased it and although I was skeptical, it worked!  Just last week I had my eye brows done and the technician complimented me on how nice my eyelashes are.  I have NEVER been complimented on my eyelashes so I think this is a testament to how well this product works.</li>
            <li> So I used the product for the whole 28 days, I still have some left in the bottle. It definitely made my eyelashes longer, and if I wore mascara then I would totally see a difference in length. But the claims of making the eyelashes thicker I did not observe. My eyelashes are definitely NOT thicker, slightly longer yes, but not thicker. I&#x27;ll probably save the little that I have left for those rare occasions that I do wear mascara, and use it as a base coat or in between coat like it suggests. Would I pay $40 for it again, probably not, but I might pay $25.</li>
            <li> I read the positive reviews and ordered this but it burned my eyes, not when I applied it but in the morning in the shower.  My eyes got very red.  Had to quit after two days.  Trying castor oil now.</li>
            <li> I bought this about 4 weeks ago, and I&#x27;ve been using it more or less twice a day since I got it.  Sometimes more, sometimes less.  It goes on clear and I&#x27;ve had no problems wearing it around or sleeping in it.  If you really pile it on it may make your eyes water a bit, but nothing unusual considering you&#x27;re smearing stuff on your eyes.  Feels a little damp at first, then you forget about it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m blonde and fair skinned, and my eyelashes have always been sort of light in color.  I noticed a slight difference in the thickness and length after about 2 weeks, but I *really* noticed a change when I put on mascara for a night out recently.  Wow!  I was amazed, my lashes are noticeably longer, thicker, and have more of a curl to them.  I&#x27;ve had eyelash extensions before and this stuff is better: more natural and versatile, but just as cute and way cheaper.  Love this stuff; makes me feel like a maybeline commercial!  Might not work for everyone, but it sure does for me.  Plus, it&#x27;s way cheaper than the Jane Iredale equivalent ($100+?!) the girl who does my brows tried to sell me.  I don&#x27;t know if you have to keep using it to maintain the effect, though.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical that this kind of product could actually make my eyebrows thicker.  I used it on my eyebrows because my left side was becoming sparse (more than the right).  I use it twice a day and it took a good 3 weeks to start seeing a difference.  But I do.  Much more filled in and they look more even.  Very pleased and I highly recommend.     Now for my eyelashes!!  I just ordered 2 more.</li>
            <li> I have to admit i was skeptical when considering buying talika eyelash lipocils, but i have always been self concious of my short thinned eyelashes and decided to give it a try. on one eye my lashes were uneven and not as full as the other side due to a disasterous fake eyelash removal insident. they looked awful! but after a few weeks of using this gel morning and night ontop of clean lashes i noticed a huge difference! now of course we are not talking baby doll fake looking lashes but i did notice a major major difference in the length and fullness of my lashes. and not only that but others started to notice too which was huge for me! i actually had many different people that never knew i tried this item tell me my lashes looked great and would ask me if i changed mascarra or something! i was totally psyched! so if you have short stubby eyelashes this MIRACLE GEL really really works! it is so worth the $35! trust me you will be amazed!!!!</li>
            <li> I actually did a lot of reviews reading before I made this purchase.  I decided to give it a try because a lot of people raved about it.  I honestly didn&#x27;t see a \\&quot;miracle\\&quot;  after using this product for over a month.  I did feel like my lashes did get some what fuller but nothing too dramatic.   &lt;br /&gt;Also, I never thought I had sensitive eyes, but after every application, I would tear up and my eyes would get somewhat irritated.   &lt;br /&gt;I stopped using Talika and bought Lancome&#x27;s Cil Booster and Hypnose.  The results are INSTANT, it&#x27;s fuller and longer by at least 50%</li>
            <li> The directions on Talika are to apply twice a day for 4 weeks then once a day everyday after that. At the end of the first four weeks, I noticed a little bit of a difference but it had been so gradual coming on that I couldn&#x27;t really tell how much. I switched down to using it once a day, expecting that I&#x27;d just finish out the tube I bought and maybe not buy it again. But about 6 weeks in, I noticed that it was starting to look really different. I kept thinking I had mascara on when I didn&#x27;t and when I actually put mascara on- WOW! I like Talika and I&#x27;m going to keep buying it but I thought I&#x27;d offer this advice:    1. Talika will never make your eyelashes look as thick as they do when you wear fake ones. It really just makes them about twice as good at the are right now- like you with mascara. If you are going for something more dramatic, you might make to consider getting fakes.    2. There are a few products that work like Talika- strengthening your lashes and keeping them from falling out so they&#x27;re the best they can be. Some, like Ardell are a lot cheaper and do work, some like Revitalash are way more expensive but may work slighly better. I think Talika is a good balance and price and effect but other people might be looking for more effect or be unwilling to spend this much.    3. You have to use this basically forever. A tube lasts months and it takes a second a day to do it, but it&#x27;s not a treatment that you do once or once a year. Missing a day or a week is no big deal but if you stop using it after about a month they go back to normal. If you&#x27;re not prepared to incorporate it into your permanent beauty routine then you&#x27;re only going to have a few months of good lashes. I&#x27;d encourage trying it out though, you might find you really like your new lashes and it&#x27;s worth the trouble. No more difficult than applying mascara everyday and this way you look great when you get up in the morning before you do anything!    Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> What a surprise! I bought this product because my eyelashes were beginning to thin as I neared 40. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but Talika Lipocils actually works, if you give it enough time. It is a clear gel, and when you put it on it kind of makes your lashes look like they do when you get out of the water -- natural and dewy. I used this product alone, I simply stopped using mascara for a month. I think that&#x27;s an important part of letting your lashes re-grow, so if you can skip the mascara, do. After one month&#x27;s time, my lashes looked and felt longer and thicker. I will definitely buy again. Oh, I should also mention that I wear contacts, and this product did not bother my eyes at all.</li>
            <li> Talika Lipocils is my savior! I had problems with my eyelashes after the pregnancy but after using Talika for about 3 months my eyelashes are longer and fuller than they were before the pregnancy! I highly recommend this product despite the fact that it takes more than 28 days to product to work.</li>
            <li> I read all of the reviews and decided to take a chance on this product. I saw a difference in my lashes within 2 weeks. I was surprised because I didn&#x27;t always remember to use it twice a day, but I did use it at least once a day. The product doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes at all, and I have very sensitive eyes - I can&#x27;t wear  contact lenses, mascara, or eyeliner. I will definitely continue to use this product. Don&#x27;t expect long, lush, thick eyelashes, but the product is worth a try if you are losing lashes. It really does work for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased and used this product consistently for months with no results. My eyelashes looked pretty much the same-- no growth, no added fullness or length! Furthermore, whenever I&#x27;d use this product at night I&#x27;d wake up with awful eye boogers. At least it didn&#x27;t give me an infection.</li>
            <li> I bought this after seeing the high price of revitalash and seeing a review that said it was as good. I can say now, I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money. I have seen no improvement in my lashes.  I also bought the brow stuff and have seen zero results and have been using them for almost a month.</li>
