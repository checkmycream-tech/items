    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Works great!  </li>
            <li>Excellent product for those who need nasal flushing</li>
            <li>This sinus rinse is the best.  </li>
            <li>the Grossan kit, along with the Grossan unit was the best investment i have made.</li>
            <li>Great sinus congestion product.  </li>
            <li>I have recommended this to a number of friends who have also had great results.     </li>
            <li>Grossan Breathe-ease stuff is great.  </li>
            <li>Much better than antibiotics!!  </li>
            <li>Not that nasal lavage is pleasant, but this does work.  </li>
            <li>A good product.  </li>
            <li>I use with heated distilled water (from the microwave) and give the sinuses a good rinse as needed.  </li>
            <li>This is a good substance to use for people with sinus problems.</li>
            <li>You therefore can save money by making your own that is just as good.  </li>
            <li>but IMO it is the best one right now.  </li>
            <li>Been using this for years, there is nothing better in my case!</li>
            <li>I started out with using the 1/4-teaspoon end, which did not seem to be too effective.  </li>
            <li>However, I find breathe-ease xl a fairly economical solution itself, and with great value at that.  </li>
            <li>The best form by far.</li>
            <li>This is without question far and away the very best!</li>
            <li>This product is by far the best I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>It does a better job of forcing the solution through the sinuses.  </li>
            <li>have used this product for many years.  </li>
            <li>cured my chronic sinusitis and keeps me healthy during cold/allergy season.</li>
            <li>this is simply the best!</li>
            <li>It clears out sinus passages safely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Grossan products for years... fantastic!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t irrigate any more at all with any product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using my Grossan system for many years.</li>
            <li>The top comes off easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 6 years, and it has made a huge difference in how I am able to manage my chronic sinusitis.  </li>
            <li>always replace the clear cap on the tip (prevents clogging?), and it will continue to work just great.</li>
            <li>My doctor recommended this treatment to clear my sinuses of pollen; it works great and allows me to breathe through my nose.</li>
            <li>Some people just feel more comfortable spending money on a brand name.  </li>
            <li>If you buy this one in the jar, you use the scoop so it is not as easy as the packages.  </li>
            <li>I googled about using xylitol to clean my nasal, and apparently it is safe.  </li>
            <li>The spray bottle easy for kids to use.&lt;br /&gt;Only  </li>
            <li>The irrigation solution is way too strong for me.</li>
            <li>So I tried it, and it works fine.  </li>
            <li>easy to use, great customer service...can&#x27;t recommended it enough.</li>
            <li>Grossan Breathe-ease solution did a fantastic job.</li>
            <li>This solution is much easier on my sinuses than mixing my own salt water.  </li>
            <li>This is so light and dosen&#x27;t burn or stings and it has Xyleitol in it for inflammation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very good product, but, unfortunately, I&#x27;ve recently learned that it is overpriced relative to the competition, which is just as effective.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Critics of breathe ease remark that the cost of salt and baking soda is dirt cheap, and I concede that is true.  </li>
            <li>When I used a full teaspoon of the saline solution, it did leave a smooth, clean sensation in my nasal after cleansing.  </li>
            <li>The large mouth opening on the container makes it an even better product.</li>
            <li>However, it is much more gentle on the inside of your nose.  </li>
            <li>I bought a Purmist and a Airo Swiss portable cool mist humidifier (both from Amazon) and that did the trick.</li>
            <li>Follow directions to keep solution fresh and spray bottle clean.</li>
            <li>It leaves your sinuses clean, fresh, and breathable.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to Dr Grossan and his nasal irrigation system and coaching I have been largely free of problems.     </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It is still not as good as SinuSense, (i.e., the aloe vera in SinuSense left a very smoothing sensation in my nasal after every washing; this one does not;)</li>
            <li>So a full teaspoon is the proper amount to use with most neti pots or squeeze bottles.  </li>
            <li>Recently, I ran out of some so, while ordering more Breathe ease xl solution, I started using 1 tsp.</li>
            <li>For someone who has a relatively sensitive nasal mucosa like me, this is so important and beneficial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Clears the nasal passages and sinuses pretty well, and its portable.  </li>
            <li>This is the only one that doesn&#x27;t have that \\&quot;sting\\&quot; or \\&quot;bite\\&quot; that I&#x27;ve experienced with other products, or with a saline solution.  </li>
            <li>However, that creates another problem: if I use a full teaspoon every time, I will likely go through the whole container quickly.</li>
            <li>Retail organic food stores sell pure, sterilized sodium chloride that is marketed for a saline nasal rinse.  </li>
            <li>If you wish to include Xylitol with your saline rinse as does this product, then organic food stores sell Xylitol in pure granular form, too.  </li>
            <li>It really does moisturize you nasal passages.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend both!</li>
            <li>This really works well with the sinus irrigation machine my husband got</li>
            <li>Grossan sinus system has really been a life saver for me</li>
            <li>IT REALLY WORKS.</li>
            <li>I called and expressed my concern and a very helpful person sent me a return label and put in a re-order for the product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Breathe-ease xl is far more gentler than basic salt and baking soda (used isotonically), and it&#x27;s moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I love this product because it does not irritate my nasal passages like other products have.  </li>
            <li>(Some might use it up more or less quickly depending on whether it is used in hypertonic fashion, if you do nasal washes more or less frequently, or if you use it for both the spray bottle and the Hydropulse).  </li>
            <li>I use 1/4 teaspoon (to 100 cc) for each nasal wash, which means one full bottle of Breathe-ease is equal to 160 nasal washes.  </li>
            <li>Regardless, not bad for $14.95 (current price), and</li>
            <li>However, this product is a huge improvement and far longer lasting.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend use of this product with the Grossan Hydro-pulse nasal irrigation appliance.</li>
            <li>I was also using far too much antibiotics and decongestants like sudafed.  </li>
            <li>I believed my nasal breathing was much clearer and more comfortable or less irritated than after irrigating with just plain salt and baking soda.  </li>
            <li>Although it took several weeks of daily use to finally notice the results, I now breathe much easier at night and sleep better.</li>
            <li>The new order also arrived without the nasal sprayer.</li>
            <li>So far this particular brand comes the closest to SinuSense.</li>
            <li>We lived in Dallas for many years - and developed a few allergies up there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>I like this better than the small saline packets.  </li>
            <li>When I am not bad, I often use the packets from the other company because they are cheaper for both my rinses (morning, evening) or use the cheaper version for the morning rinse.  </li>
            <li>Grossan&#x27;s practice included a number of North Sea saturation divers for whom clear sinuses is close to a life and death issue.      </li>
            <li>I have allergies and frequently get sinus infections.</li>
            <li>It is not harsh.  </li>
            <li>I use this with my young kids as soon as they say they have a sore throat.</li>
            <li>This works for someone with mild everyday allergies that involve the nasal passages.  </li>
            <li>Breathe-ease xl nasal nasal moisturizing and irrigation solution far outperforms simple saline solution for nasal lavage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Be careful how much you are paying.</li>
            <li>Well worth the small investment.     </li>
            <li>well worth the small increase in price.</li>

            <li> It is more expensive than the cheaper one made by the other company that you can get everywhere.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product as long as I can afford it.</li>
            <li> Since then, I have been trying out other different saline solutions and looking for a replacement.  </li>
            <li> The container includes a tiny measuring scoop that has a teaspoon at one end and 1/4 teaspoon at the other end.  </li>
            <li> My passages were so dry that they bled then formed scabs.</li>
            <li> To combat irritated sinus caused by dry air in the winter, or from seasonal allergies, and to assist in preventing sinus infections and sinusits, my doctor recommended trying nasal irrigation.  </li>
            <li> Most other brands use only purified/ionized salt, which is very harsh and caused my nasal to feel uncomfortable after using.  </li>
            <li> They have different pollen and boogems down here.  </li>
            <li> When I used with water straight from the hot water tap, I would get really bad headaches so recommend you learn from my experience.</li>
            <li> Jar is much less hassle than individual packets.</li>
            <li> This version is cheaper than the Grossan packets and not that much harder to do.</li>
            <li> EVERYTHING I EXPECTED</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t spend your time and money on other sinus irrigation units/neti pots etc.</li>
            <li> The container is actually quite small.</li>
            <li> I also make us of the small spray bottle that is provided, especially when I travel.  </li>
            <li> I had a really hard time getting the bottle to open.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it would work as well for someone with excessive sneezing, or other symptoms, though undoubtedly it would help by removing allergens from the sinuses, thereby lessening exposure..</li>
            <li> I use a little plastic cup that comes in the container bought in distilled water and helps me to avoid sinus infections.</li>
            <li> Originally plain table salt was recommended for the nasal irrigator.</li>
            <li> No more saline solutions for me.</li>
            <li> Usually salt</li>
            <li> I AM VERY UNHAPPY, especially because this is the third time I have communicated this issue and the vendor has done nothing to satisfy me.</li>
            <li> The aloe vera moisturized my nasal and prevented the saline from dehydrating my nasal, leaving my nasal feeling dry and uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I used to get at least 3 sinus infectious a year.</li>
            <li> I must use much less than recommended or it burns uncomfortably.</li>
            <li> Those with alergies should seriously consider trying this product!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Waterpik stopped making SinuSense about a year ago.  </li>
            <li> A daily whooshing-out during the worst allergy seasons (with a Zyrtec-D) keeps me breathing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t do without it when I have a cold or sinus problems.  </li>

            <li> A good product.  I have never had any problems with irritation.</li>
            <li> I have allergies and frequently get sinus infections. Grossan Breathe-ease solution did a fantastic job. It really does moisturize you nasal passages. My passages were so dry that they bled then formed scabs. I used this solution as directed and my nasal passages cleared up over a period of a couple weeks. No burning at all. Follow directions to keep solution fresh and spray bottle clean. No more saline solutions for me. I highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Works well in my nasal irrigator.  It is not harsh.  Jar is much less hassle than individual packets. I wish it could ship to Singapore.</li>
            <li> Works great!  I use with heated distilled water (from the microwave) and give the sinuses a good rinse as needed.  Can be up to two times a day during the worst of allergy season.  When I used with water straight from the hot water tap, I would get really bad headaches so recommend you learn from my experience.</li>
            <li> Great sinus congestion product.  Those with alergies should seriously consider trying this product!  My wife and I both found immediate relief from congestion and its related pain.  I highly recommend use of this product with the Grossan Hydro-pulse nasal irrigation appliance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been almost 25 years since I was referred to Dr. Grossan. I was at the crossroads of needing to find a fix for chronic sinus infections or give up flying (and diving ) and sell our company airplane. I was also using far too much antibiotics and decongestants like sudafed.  Thanks to Dr Grossan and his nasal irrigation system and coaching I have been largely free of problems.     Originally plain table salt was recommended for the nasal irrigator. However, this product is a huge improvement and far longer lasting. Well worth the small investment.     Grossan&#x27;s practice included a number of North Sea saturation divers for whom clear sinuses is close to a life and death issue.      I have recommended this to a number of friends who have also had great results.     It&#x27;s been 10 years or so since I have talked with Dr Grossan but not a day passes withoug me appreciating his work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never needed another allergy product since I started using this.  This works for someone with mild everyday allergies that involve the nasal passages.  I don&#x27;t know if it would work as well for someone with excessive sneezing, or other symptoms, though undoubtedly it would help by removing allergens from the sinuses, thereby lessening exposure..</li>
            <li> During allergy season I use this product to give me relief from my nasal congestion. I would recommend it to anyone with seasonal allergies.</li>
            <li> This solution is much easier on my sinuses than mixing my own salt water.  I couldn&#x27;t do without it when I have a cold or sinus problems.  It also helps to have the Grossan Hydro Pulse machine.  It does a better job of forcing the solution through the sinuses.  I highly recommend both!</li>
            <li> Breathe-ease xl nasal nasal moisturizing and irrigation solution far outperforms simple saline solution for nasal lavage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for many years.  Recently, I ran out of some so, while ordering more Breathe ease xl solution, I started using 1 tsp. of salt and baking soda to 100 ccs of water.  And what a difference breathe ease xl made when I could start using this again.  Breathe-ease xl is far more gentler than basic salt and baking soda (used isotonically), and it&#x27;s moisturizing.  I believed my nasal breathing was much clearer and more comfortable or less irritated than after irrigating with just plain salt and baking soda.  For someone who has a relatively sensitive nasal mucosa like me, this is so important and beneficial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Critics of breathe ease remark that the cost of salt and baking soda is dirt cheap, and I concede that is true.  However, I find breathe-ease xl a fairly economical solution itself, and with great value at that.  If 6 teaspoons equals 1 ounce, and 1 Breathe-ease bottle equals 6.7 ounces, then that is equivalent to 40.2 teaspoons.  I use 1/4 teaspoon (to 100 cc) for each nasal wash, which means one full bottle of Breathe-ease is equal to 160 nasal washes.  I do two washes a day, so one bottle should last me for 80 days or almost three months of nasal washes.  (Some might use it up more or less quickly depending on whether it is used in hypertonic fashion, if you do nasal washes more or less frequently, or if you use it for both the spray bottle and the Hydropulse).  Regardless, not bad for $14.95 (current price), and well worth the small increase in price.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for those who need nasal flushing</li>
            <li> This sinus rinse is the best.  It is more expensive than the cheaper one made by the other company that you can get everywhere.  However, it is much more gentle on the inside of your nose.  If you have bad sinus problems and/allergies, you understand this.  If you buy this one in the jar, you use the scoop so it is not as easy as the packages.  However, you can use this for the machine and for the squeeze bottles that you can get.  I use the bottles when we go on short trips.  I have to sinus rinse all of the time to not have problems.  When I am not bad, I often use the packets from the other company because they are cheaper for both my rinses (morning, evening) or use the cheaper version for the morning rinse.  This version is cheaper than the Grossan packets and not that much harder to do.</li>
            <li> the Grossan kit, along with the Grossan unit was the best investment i have made. cured my chronic sinusitis and keeps me healthy during cold/allergy season. easy to use, great customer service...can&#x27;t recommended it enough. it&#x27;s worth every penny. don&#x27;t spend your time and money on other sinus irrigation units/neti pots etc. this is simply the best!</li>
            <li> This really works well with the sinus irrigation machine my husband got</li>
            <li> I used to use Waterpik SinuSense, which has aloe vera as an ingredient.  The aloe vera moisturized my nasal and prevented the saline from dehydrating my nasal, leaving my nasal feeling dry and uncomfortable.  Unfortunately, Waterpik stopped making SinuSense about a year ago.  Since then, I have been trying out other different saline solutions and looking for a replacement.  SinuSense was the only solution that used aloe vera in its solution.  Most other brands use only purified/ionized salt, which is very harsh and caused my nasal to feel uncomfortable after using.  So far this particular brand comes the closest to SinuSense. I was reluctant to try this one because I read it has xylitol in it.  I put xylitol in my coffee and tea.  I was not if I wanted it in my nasal.  I googled about using xylitol to clean my nasal, and apparently it is safe.  So I tried it, and it works fine.  It is still not as good as SinuSense, (i.e., the aloe vera in SinuSense left a very smoothing sensation in my nasal after every washing; this one does not;) but IMO it is the best one right now.  UPDATE: The container includes a tiny measuring scoop that has a teaspoon at one end and 1/4 teaspoon at the other end.  I started out with using the 1/4-teaspoon end, which did not seem to be too effective.  When I used a full teaspoon of the saline solution, it did leave a smooth, clean sensation in my nasal after cleansing.  So a full teaspoon is the proper amount to use with most neti pots or squeeze bottles.  However, that creates another problem: if I use a full teaspoon every time, I will likely go through the whole container quickly. The container is actually quite small. Which means this brand is actually more expensive than the alternatives (including Waterpik SinuSense.)</li>
            <li> I have been doing this for 43 years. Usually salt but also any variety I could get my hands on just to check it out. The best form by far.This is without question far and away the very best!</li>
            <li> This is a MUST HAVE For anyone with sinus problems. It clears out sinus passages safely. Much better than antibiotics!!  And it works!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 6 years, and it has made a huge difference in how I am able to manage my chronic sinusitis.  Although it took several weeks of daily use to finally notice the results, I now breathe much easier at night and sleep better. It&#x27;s a very good product, but, unfortunately, I&#x27;ve recently learned that it is overpriced relative to the competition, which is just as effective. Be careful how much you are paying.</li>
            <li> To combat irritated sinus caused by dry air in the winter, or from seasonal allergies, and to assist in preventing sinus infections and sinusits, my doctor recommended trying nasal irrigation.  This product is by far the best I&#x27;ve tried.  This is the only one that doesn&#x27;t have that \\&quot;sting\\&quot; or \\&quot;bite\\&quot; that I&#x27;ve experienced with other products, or with a saline solution.  I use this product at home with the Grossan Hydro-Pulse nasal irrigator instead of a neti pot.  I also make us of the small spray bottle that is provided, especially when I travel.  I&#x27;ve learned one thing to keep the spray bottle working - always replace the clear cap on the tip (prevents clogging?), and it will continue to work just great.</li>
            <li> I used to get at least 3 sinus infectious a year. But after getting my Grossan sinus machine and using the breath-ease Moisturizing I had maybe one sinus infection in the last 6 yrs. Grossan sinus system has really been a life saver for me and I don&#x27;t know what I would have done without it. IT REALLY WORKS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Grossan products for years... fantastic!</li>
            <li> We lived in Dallas for many years - and developed a few allergies up there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then moved to South Texas (Boerne/San Antonio) a while back.  They have different pollen and boogems down here.  Especially Cedar, Oak, Ragweed, and Elm - not to mention occasional Mold and Smoke from across the border.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Grossan Breathe-ease stuff is great.  It is gentler than the home-made solution of baking soda and salt.  It leaves your sinuses clean, fresh, and breathable.  (The home-made mixes tended to BURN...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great defense for the South Texas pollen seasons.  I recommend the Grossan solution with a Grossan nasal tip - connected to a powered Waterpik device.  A daily whooshing-out during the worst allergy seasons (with a Zyrtec-D) keeps me breathing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kind of pricey (everywhere), but after one try, you may be hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JDMc</li>
            <li> This is a good substance to use for people with sinus problems. I use a little plastic cup that comes in the container bought in distilled water and helps me to avoid sinus infections. This does work for me.</li>
            <li> The product description and photo indicated that it includes a nasal sprayer. It arrived without that. I called and expressed my concern and a very helpful person sent me a return label and put in a re-order for the product. The new order also arrived without the nasal sprayer. In the meantime, I determined that the order for the same product that I had sent to my daughter arrived without the nasal sprayer. At this point, I am assuming that the product has changed and that the vendor did not bother to change the description, the photo, or the price. I AM VERY UNHAPPY, especially because this is the third time I have communicated this issue and the vendor has done nothing to satisfy me. The product no longer appears on the Amazon site in this configuration but I still believe that the vendor owes me satisfaction for two double orders, one for myself and one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I had a really hard time getting the bottle to open. The irrigation solution is way too strong for me. I must use much less than recommended or it burns uncomfortably. I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it if I had known all this before.</li>
            <li> Tried this out of desperation since Rite Aid nasal rinse didn&#x27;t work to ease my non-specific rhinitis.  This didn&#x27;t work either. I bought a Purmist and a Airo Swiss portable cool mist humidifier (both from Amazon) and that did the trick. I use the Purmist 2 or 3 times a day or when needed and the portable humidifier all night. I don&#x27;t irrigate any more at all with any product.</li>
            <li> Not that nasal lavage is pleasant, but this does work.  Clears the nasal passages and sinuses pretty well, and its portable.  You can take it with you and use it during the day is necessary.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this for years. It does wonders for my PND.</li>
            <li> I like this better than the small saline packets.  This is so light and dosen&#x27;t burn or stings and it has Xyleitol in it for inflammation.</li>
            <li> EVERYTHING I EXPECTED</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this treatment to clear my sinuses of pollen; it works great and allows me to breathe through my nose.</li>
            <li> I keep getting this and it works and that is what the product is suppose to do will buy again</li>
            <li> This is way over priced for what it is because, in essence, it is nothing but salt. You therefore can save money by making your own that is just as good.  Retail organic food stores sell pure, sterilized sodium chloride that is marketed for a saline nasal rinse.  If you wish to include Xylitol with your saline rinse as does this product, then organic food stores sell Xylitol in pure granular form, too.  I would therefore only recommend this Grossan product for beginners who either lack experience or self confidence to attempt making a homemade mixture.  You know.  Some people just feel more comfortable spending money on a brand name.  But salt is salt.  It is all the same thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Grossan system for many years. This solution helps my sinuses and doesn&#x27;t irritate them when flushing. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Been using this for years, there is nothing better in my case! The large mouth opening on the container makes it an even better product.</li>
            <li> I use this with my young kids as soon as they say they have a sore throat. I instantly begin using this solution twice a day ( morning and night).&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and measure salt. . The bottle is white and allowed my kids to personalize each of their irrigation bottle with stickers from home.  This way we never get bottles mixed up. The spray bottle easy for kids to use.&lt;br /&gt;Only  drawback is manufacturer needs to fix the bottle. The top comes off easily. Even so, I recommend buying it.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it does not irritate my nasal passages like other products have.  I will continue to use this product as long as I can afford it.</li>
