            <li>Looks kind of orange when I put it on.</li>
            <li>The smell is kind of overbearing.</li>
            <li>Nice colors.</li>
            <li>More shimmers than I was expecting based on otger reviews nice neutral colors.</li>
            <li>So creamy and easily blendable, I have zero complaints!</li>
            <li>but they are very light.</li>
            <li>I mix these colors with bright colors sometimes and they are super.</li>
            <li>I have a bit of difficulty opening the case easily, but the compactness and the mirror are always handy.</li>
            <li>Awesome colors and a soft and easy application.</li>
            <li>Great price and very high quality.  </li>
            <li>I love this eye-shadow pallate.</li>
            <li>really has a great pallette to create many looks.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I wish I could find those favs in a separate case as I use them more than the others...</li>
            <li>Colors are more in the orangey family than I wanted.</li>
            <li>Love these shadows.</li>
            <li>Really enjoying the color pallet.</li>

            <li>I love these eye shadows</li>
            <li>I was able to find this cream style shadow which does not flake and affect my eyes.</li>
            <li>Okay.  </li>
            <li>These colors are ok.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it shows up on my eye lids.</li>
            <li>I will get another brush because this one is more like a sponge.</li>
            <li>Use it every day and love it</li>
            <li>I love the colors, they are as they look.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>

            <li>I really am glad I added this palette to my collection -</li>
            <li>I love the metallic quality to these colors (this review is for the &amp;#34;naked&amp;#34; palette) but also that they&#x27;re neutral.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll disturb the surface and loosen more product than you intended.  </li>
            <li>I also love the slim design of the case and the mirror.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still cute..</li>
            <li>Love love it...</li>
            <li>Truly worth the price and some more! :)</li>
            <li>Great colors, much cheaper but similar quality to brand name- good buy!</li>
            <li>The shadows are very soft when applied and the colors as great.  </li>
            <li>This is a very light neutral shimmery, soft...almost buttery powder with lots of light effects.  </li>
            <li>They go on amazing and the colors are vibrant and amazing.</li>
            <li>Which is fine if you are a teenager.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was easy and smooth to apply.</li>
            <li>Shadow goes on smooth and easily.</li>
            <li>I love these eyeshadows they super pigmented and are a powder but feel like a creme.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>The ELF adds a light shimmer.</li>
            <li>It smells like those cheap makeup kits I used to use when I was a kid.</li>
            <li>Great price (especially at Target).</li>
            <li>Great dup of UD&#x27;s Naked.</li>
            <li>The pigment in these color are great and last all day!</li>
            <li>/&gt;These go on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>very pleased with this - I have bought brown and neutral shades in multiple colors and brands and love this</li>
            <li>this palette is the BEST, very pigmented and lasts long!</li>
            <li>The colors are gorgeous, and the texture is silky and sheer but easily buildable.  </li>
            <li>Amazing product and for the same price through the website with free shipping instead!  </li>
            <li>Worth the price and arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of shimmer!</li>
            <li>I read reviews about the colors not being pigmented well and that they don&#x27;t stay on, but I don&#x27;t find this to be true.  </li>
            <li>The palette is fine and the colors look pretty</li>
            <li>I feel so lucky to have found this palette.</li>
            <li>Very lovely especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Very neutral tones, super easy to put on.</li>
            <li>This eyeshadow has more than enough variety and is easy to apply and lasts.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a nice neutral colored palette and found this Naked one from Elf.</li>
            <li>For the price, its worth it.</li>
            <li>This is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>by far my favorite nude eyeshadow palette</li>
            <li>Just the right brown palette I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li>a positive note, the shimmery quality of the shadow is very pretty, and the swatches are just the right size.</li>
            <li>Great colors for green eyes!</li>
            <li>I can actually get away with wearing this to work (at a law office), but it would be suitable for an evening out, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted these shadow colors for use in the day, thought I had less bright.</li>
            <li>I tried this eye shadow for the first time.</li>
            <li>the colors were pretty though</li>
            <li>look but for MUCH cheaper!</li>
            <li>I really recommend this!</li>
            <li>So be aware of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Given the glowing reviews, I had higher expectations for this eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>My palettes from Revlon and Maybelline don&#x27;t need a primer to stay on a good few hours, but you&#x27;ll definitely need a solid primer to keep this product looking good over the course of a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my favorite eye shadow purchase in a long time.</li>
            <li>The colors are very pigmented and without any primer, they lasted all day.  </li>
            <li>Very shimmery.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>, they&#x27;re all actually very orange-y, even the gold.</li>
            <li>so I highly highly recommend this to anyone that is considering!</li>
            <li>I have now gone thru 2 and Getting ready to buy another.</li>
            <li>It compares well to very high-end makeup.  </li>
            <li>(Ranging from very pale/ivory- medium-olive skintone).</li>
            <li>I just got it today and the colors are so much prettier in person.</li>
            <li>I really like this shadow.</li>
            <li>but they are not pigmented enough nor fine enough to be applied quickly and well.</li>
            <li>The shades are neutral enough to be a little conservative, yet have some shimmer and create a nice, fun glow.</li>
            <li>Color lasts and stays true to shade - I also use Urban Decay&#x27;s primer</li>
            <li>I love these elf eyeshadows but the color in the picture and on the box is very different from what the actual shade is.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Interestingly, when I opened the palette, the colors did not look as vibrant as the picture on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Plus, the colors are still vibrant after 8-10 hours of wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used other elf eye palettes and I think this one is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t really build well and even though I had special shimmer eyelid primer on, they still creased up, which other eyeshadows don&#x27;t do nearly as much as these did.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are a bit creamier than normal powder eyeshadows</li>
            <li>nice colors but not good staying power.</li>
            <li>Reminds me of Naked eyeshadow but not nearly as expensive.</li>
            <li>Such a good price for the same thing as another, more expensive eyeshadow!</li>
            <li>but when I received it  was little and could fit in your pocket.</li>
            <li>I am 70 yrs old</li>
            <li>They also don&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, sometimes needing a reapplication a few hours after wear.</li>
            <li>I have bought it like 4 times so far</li>
            <li>Really brings the blue out in my eyes.</li>
            <li>Wow</li>
            <li>I did a test run just wearing it around the house for the evening, and it had almost completely faded within a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine how fast it would wear off if I were actually out and about.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll want to find a good primer (unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t had a lot of luck using the e.l.f.</li>
            <li>So flexible to use for everyday or somewhere special.</li>
            <li>I had no problem whatsoever with fallout, I just use my NYX eyeshadow base on my eyelids (that are pretty oily if you ask me) and the colors last beautifully.</li>
            <li>I got this because I wanted something comparable to the Naked Palette by Urban Decay because I certainly won&#x27;t pay that price ($50)</li>
            <li>Go easy with the applicator when you&#x27;re picking up the pigment -- press too hard</li>
            <li>Seeing as I&#x27;ve always wanted one of those UD Naked palettes and this being much cheaper, I tried it out after extensive research</li>
            <li>The second and third colors appear to be neutral beige / tan shades in the picture, but show up a very vibrant yellow and orange</li>
            <li>I purchased the Naked palette, and am surprised by the discrepancies in colors between the image provided and the actual product.</li>
            <li>any rate, if you have been interested in trying a neutral palette like this but have been holding out because competing products are so expensive, this one is definitely worth a look.</li>

            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> Love this pallet.</li>
            <li> I really am glad I added this palette to my collection -</li>
            <li> I love the metallic quality to these colors (this review is for the &amp;#34;naked&amp;#34; palette) but also that they&#x27;re neutral.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll disturb the surface and loosen more product than you intended.  </li>
            <li> I also love the slim design of the case and the mirror.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still cute..</li>
            <li> Love love it...</li>
            <li> Truly worth the price and some more! :)</li>
            <li> Great colors, much cheaper but similar quality to brand name- good buy!</li>
            <li> The shadows are very soft when applied and the colors as great.  </li>
            <li> This is a very light neutral shimmery, soft...almost buttery powder with lots of light effects.  </li>
            <li> They go on amazing and the colors are vibrant and amazing.</li>
            <li> Which is fine if you are a teenager.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was easy and smooth to apply.</li>
            <li> Shadow goes on smooth and easily.</li>
            <li> I love these eyeshadows they super pigmented and are a powder but feel like a creme.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li> The ELF adds a light shimmer.</li>
            <li> It smells like those cheap makeup kits I used to use when I was a kid.</li>
            <li> Great price (especially at Target).</li>
            <li> Great dup of UD&#x27;s Naked.</li>
            <li> The pigment in these color are great and last all day!</li>
            <li> /&gt;These go on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> very pleased with this - I have bought brown and neutral shades in multiple colors and brands and love this</li>
            <li> this palette is the BEST, very pigmented and lasts long!</li>
            <li> The colors are gorgeous, and the texture is silky and sheer but easily buildable.  </li>
            <li> Amazing product and for the same price through the website with free shipping instead!  </li>
            <li> Worth the price and arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of shimmer!</li>
            <li> I read reviews about the colors not being pigmented well and that they don&#x27;t stay on, but I don&#x27;t find this to be true.  </li>
            <li> The palette is fine and the colors look pretty</li>
            <li> I feel so lucky to have found this palette.</li>
            <li> Very lovely especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Very neutral tones, super easy to put on.</li>
            <li> This eyeshadow has more than enough variety and is easy to apply and lasts.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a nice neutral colored palette and found this Naked one from Elf.</li>
            <li> For the price, its worth it.</li>
            <li> This is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> by far my favorite nude eyeshadow palette</li>
            <li> Just the right brown palette I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li> a positive note, the shimmery quality of the shadow is very pretty, and the swatches are just the right size.</li>
            <li> Great colors for green eyes!</li>
            <li> I can actually get away with wearing this to work (at a law office), but it would be suitable for an evening out, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted these shadow colors for use in the day, thought I had less bright.</li>
            <li> I tried this eye shadow for the first time.</li>
            <li> the colors were pretty though</li>
            <li> look but for MUCH cheaper!</li>
            <li> I really recommend this!</li>
            <li> So be aware of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Given the glowing reviews, I had higher expectations for this eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> My palettes from Revlon and Maybelline don&#x27;t need a primer to stay on a good few hours, but you&#x27;ll definitely need a solid primer to keep this product looking good over the course of a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my favorite eye shadow purchase in a long time.</li>
            <li> The colors are very pigmented and without any primer, they lasted all day.  </li>
            <li> Very shimmery.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> , they&#x27;re all actually very orange-y, even the gold.</li>
            <li> so I highly highly recommend this to anyone that is considering!</li>
            <li> I have now gone thru 2 and Getting ready to buy another.</li>
            <li> It compares well to very high-end makeup.  </li>
            <li> (Ranging from very pale/ivory- medium-olive skintone).</li>
            <li> I just got it today and the colors are so much prettier in person.</li>
            <li> I really like this shadow.</li>
            <li> but they are not pigmented enough nor fine enough to be applied quickly and well.</li>
            <li> The shades are neutral enough to be a little conservative, yet have some shimmer and create a nice, fun glow.</li>
            <li> Color lasts and stays true to shade - I also use Urban Decay&#x27;s primer</li>
            <li> I love these elf eyeshadows but the color in the picture and on the box is very different from what the actual shade is.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Interestingly, when I opened the palette, the colors did not look as vibrant as the picture on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Plus, the colors are still vibrant after 8-10 hours of wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used other elf eye palettes and I think this one is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t really build well and even though I had special shimmer eyelid primer on, they still creased up, which other eyeshadows don&#x27;t do nearly as much as these did.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are a bit creamier than normal powder eyeshadows</li>
            <li> nice colors but not good staying power.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of Naked eyeshadow but not nearly as expensive.</li>
            <li> Such a good price for the same thing as another, more expensive eyeshadow!</li>
            <li> but when I received it  was little and could fit in your pocket.</li>
            <li> I am 70 yrs old</li>
            <li> They also don&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, sometimes needing a reapplication a few hours after wear.</li>
            <li> I have bought it like 4 times so far</li>
            <li> Really brings the blue out in my eyes.</li>
            <li> Wow</li>
            <li> I did a test run just wearing it around the house for the evening, and it had almost completely faded within a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine how fast it would wear off if I were actually out and about.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll want to find a good primer (unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t had a lot of luck using the e.l.f.</li>
            <li> So flexible to use for everyday or somewhere special.</li>
            <li> I had no problem whatsoever with fallout, I just use my NYX eyeshadow base on my eyelids (that are pretty oily if you ask me) and the colors last beautifully.</li>
            <li> I got this because I wanted something comparable to the Naked Palette by Urban Decay because I certainly won&#x27;t pay that price ($50)</li>
            <li> Go easy with the applicator when you&#x27;re picking up the pigment -- press too hard</li>
            <li> Seeing as I&#x27;ve always wanted one of those UD Naked palettes and this being much cheaper, I tried it out after extensive research</li>
            <li> The second and third colors appear to be neutral beige / tan shades in the picture, but show up a very vibrant yellow and orange</li>
            <li> I purchased the Naked palette, and am surprised by the discrepancies in colors between the image provided and the actual product.</li>
            <li> any rate, if you have been interested in trying a neutral palette like this but have been holding out because competing products are so expensive, this one is definitely worth a look.</li>
            <li> Stays on for a long time and has what I thought was a very pretty, but delicate shimmer.</li>
            <li> I will try to make us of this product so as not to waste the money, but I would caution potential buyers not to keep their hopes too high for this one.</li>
            <li> Subtle but fun.</li>
            <li> However, when I put them on (I did a dry application), there was a lot of pigment to them.  </li>
            <li> I used the last dark color</li>
            <li> Very subtle but pretty.  </li>
            <li> A little shimmer to it, but not enough to be distracting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a complete sucker for a deal.  </li>
            <li> I expected to have a couple of shades of brown.</li>
            <li> But, they are not very saturated.  </li>
            <li> so this is not too extreme for me and no drying or flaking.</li>
            <li> and I now want the other palets.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first to purchase this, having never tried an ELF product before.  </li>
            <li> I think because they&#x27;re a little creamy, there&#x27;s not powder that can get in my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I wear it basically everyday.</li>
            <li> I apply it over a thin coating of a flat color (of almost any brown-tone eye shadow I have).</li>
            <li> I was not very impressed with how long they lasted though.</li>
            <li> It lasts the Entire day and can work with a casual day, office day, or even a night out.</li>
            <li> the product came damaged and one of the shadows was completely broken in half; shadow was all over the box.</li>
            <li> Hardly anyone noticed I had eyeshadow on.</li>
            <li> when worn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also not thrilled with the staying power of this shadow.</li>
            <li> I use it for my base shadow when I opt for a soft look, then add a darker color, usually matte, for the crease.  </li>
            <li> Possibly the worst eye shadow I&#x27;ve ever come across.</li>
            <li> It gives the expensive &amp;#34;naked palette&amp;#34;</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> nice colors but not good staying power. that could be my fault though bc i didnt use a primer.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors and an awesome price! I love this eye-shadow pallate.</li>
            <li> How can it be 17.99 when I just ordered it for 10.00 at elf website</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one of those that feels they need every color under the rainbow. This eyeshadow has more than enough variety and is easy to apply and lasts.  Great price.</li>
            <li> Perfect color. Lasts all day without creasing, which is a MUST!</li>
            <li> Love this shadow! Beautiful colors, goes on so smooth and no fallout!</li>
            <li> Amazing product and for the same price through the website with free shipping instead!  The colors are very pigmented and without any primer, they lasted all day.  Love E.l.f. products!</li>
            <li> Possibly the worst eye shadow I&#x27;ve ever come across. The palette is fine and the colors look pretty but they are not pigmented enough nor fine enough to be applied quickly and well. The product also caused my eyes to react and it was days before I felt the itching stopped.</li>
            <li> The colors are very cute but is too sparkly for my taste.</li>
            <li> very pleased with this - I have bought brown and neutral shades in multiple colors and brands and love this really has a great pallette to create many looks. I had not bought this brand yet but at the price will be buying their pallettes instead of the pricey ones from now on!</li>
            <li> This eyeshadow is gorgeous</li>
            <li> More shimmers than I was expecting based on otger reviews nice neutral colors.</li>
            <li> Very good quality!!!Fast shipping, thank you.</li>
            <li> I love these elf eyeshadows but the color in the picture and on the box is very different from what the actual shade is.  They are not that drastic in tones abd I was hoping for those darker browns that were pictured.</li>
            <li> Such a good price for the same thing as another, more expensive eyeshadow! The colors are great and stay on all day. Very shimmery.</li>
            <li> I tried this eye shadow for the first time. I love it. It goes on smooth and creamy. I definitely would buy this again!</li>
            <li> Great colors for green eyes! Very neutral tones, super easy to put on. I use this daily and do not have to reapply unless I&#x27;m out dancing and sweating a lot. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this item. I am 70 yrs old so this is not too extreme for me and no drying or flaking.</li>
            <li> The darker shades are a joke; the picture displayed on the package is rather deceptive...I expected to have a couple of shades of brown.</li>
            <li> I feel so lucky to have found this palette. I apply it over a thin coating of a flat color (of almost any brown-tone eye shadow I have). The ELF adds a light shimmer. I have not tried it &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; as I&#x27;m so happy with the effect it makes &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;. Two of the colors are my favs, altho&#x27; I do use each of the 6.  I wish I could find those favs in a separate case as I use them more than the others...</li>
            <li> Just the shades I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Colors are more in the orangey family than I wanted.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find an eyeshadow palette that won&#x27;t cost me $30+ but I hadn&#x27;t found the one for me until now. e.l.f. Prism Eyeshadow is a perfect option for me because it isn&#x27;t chalky or muddy - the colors seem to brighten when they&#x27;re applied. At the suggestion of another reviewer, I&#x27;ve applied an eyeshadow primer, which has worked out nicely. I think it&#x27;s the perfect option for what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Really nice product. A little shimmer to it, but not enough to be distracting. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Love these shadows. Just the right amount of shimmer!</li>
            <li> Looks kind of orange when I put it on.</li>
            <li> Really enjoying the color pallet.</li>
            <li> It was just okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors in the palette came correctly, but I feel like they applied very differently. They not brown-y or pink-y, they&#x27;re all actually very orange-y, even the gold. They don&#x27;t really build well and even though I had special shimmer eyelid primer on, they still creased up, which other eyeshadows don&#x27;t do nearly as much as these did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, they are still okay-ish colors. Orange-y is definitely not my color, so I only use these occasionally. They also don&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a nice neutral colored palette and found this Naked one from Elf. Seeing as I&#x27;ve always wanted one of those UD Naked palettes and this being much cheaper, I tried it out after extensive research and I love it! I had no problem whatsoever with fallout, I just use my NYX eyeshadow base on my eyelids (that are pretty oily if you ask me) and the colors last beautifully. These copper bronze colors are beautiful for the summer time so I highly highly recommend this to anyone that is considering!</li>
            <li> I like the colors and the quality of the powder. I did want matte colors though not the shiny/frosted for every day use.</li>
            <li> I got this because I wanted something comparable to the Naked Palette by Urban Decay because I certainly won&#x27;t pay that price ($50) I have now gone thru 2 and Getting ready to buy another. I love the shimmer. I&#x27;m a red head and this is absolutely perfect in every way!</li>
            <li> Great colors, much cheaper but similar quality to brand name- good buy!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first to purchase this, having never tried an ELF product before.  I was pleasantly suprised by this eyeshadow palette.  Great price and very high quality.  It compares well to very high-end makeup.  The colors are gorgeous, and the texture is silky and sheer but easily buildable.  It stays on all day without creasing; performs best with a primer applied first on the eyelid (I use Avon&#x27;s).</li>
            <li> For the price, its worth it. Goes on smooth, sometimes needing a reapplication a few hours after wear.</li>
            <li> Posting wasn&#x27;t an issue for me, everything was perfectly intact. I love these eye shadows and I now want the other palets. Strong pigmentation and great metallic finish ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
            <li> After struggling with itchy eyes from flaky eye shadow I was able to find this cream style shadow which does not flake and affect my eyes.</li>
            <li> this palette is the BEST, very pigmented and lasts long! perfect smokey eye colors</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful colors!</li>
            <li> Okay.  I&#x27;m a complete sucker for a deal.  If someone online says that you can get the same colors in an ELF eyeshadow as you can in a Naked palette, I will buy the ELF one.  Just. In. Case.  These colors are ok.  But, they are not very saturated.  They also use a lot of sparkle.  Which is fine if you are a teenager.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still on the look-out for a Naked dupe.  I will let you all know if I find it.  But, this is not it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! I have bought it like 4 times so far and I will keep doing so. I have had really expensive make up, but this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Nice shadow with good colors. I like the bit of shimmer in it as well.</li>
            <li> The colors are so beautiful and elegant and work well with any kind of look you&#x27;re trying to achieve, whether it be for work or for play.</li>
            <li> I love the way it shows up on my eye lids. It was easy and smooth to apply. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell. It smells like those cheap makeup kits I used to use when I was a kid. The smell is kind of overbearing. But if I plug my nose while applying it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li> I wanted these shadow colors for use in the day, thought I had less bright. For evening makeup is excellent.</li>
            <li> GREAT PALETTE! Wonderful colors, really good sparkle to them. Subtle but fun. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday. I love it! Great for the price.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite eye shadow purchase in a long time. The shades are neutral enough to be a little conservative, yet have some shimmer and create a nice, fun glow. This is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Colors are great. Not too sparkly but just sparkle enough. Really brings the blue out in my eyes. Definitely goes office to night out. All day wear.</li>
            <li> did not like that it looked big but when I received it  was little and could fit in your pocket. the colors were pretty though</li>
            <li> Worth the price and arrived very quickly. Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Colors are beautiful, my bridesmaids and I shared this palette and it complimented all of our skintones nicely. (Ranging from very pale/ivory- medium-olive skintone). Stays on for a long time and has what I thought was a very pretty, but delicate shimmer.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of Naked eyeshadow but not nearly as expensive. I will be buying this again!</li>
            <li> Great price (especially at Target). Blends well. Color lasts and stays true to shade - I also use Urban Decay&#x27;s primer</li>
            <li> They make amazing makeup for the price! Wow</li>
            <li> by far my favorite nude eyeshadow palette</li>
            <li> I have not used it yet but the colors look a bit lighter when it came in the mail. I will get another brush because this one is more like a sponge.</li>
            <li> Great colors! They stay on well</li>
            <li> ive received countless compliments on the color of my eye shadow with this stuff. It lasts the Entire day and can work with a casual day, office day, or even a night out. im now on my third one (lasts me about 6 months and i only use 4 of the shades) Only eye shadow i will ever buy</li>
            <li> Awesome colors and a soft and easy application. I love this palette!</li>
            <li> Nice colors. Shadow goes on smooth and easily.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shadow! It gives the expensive &amp;#34;naked palette&amp;#34; look but for MUCH cheaper!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a lot of this and it lasts</li>
            <li> This makeup pallets is absolutely amazing! I just got it today and the colors are so much prettier in person. They go on amazing and the colors are vibrant and amazing. I really recommend this! Truly worth the price and some more! :)</li>
            <li> Use it every day and love it</li>
            <li> I love the colors, they are as they look. I am very satisfied with this purchase. It arrived when it was promised and it great condition.</li>
            <li> I like the colors, only used one of the colors</li>
            <li> Love this. Great dup of UD&#x27;s Naked. The pigment in these color are great and last all day!</li>
            <li> Love this pallet. So flexible to use for everyday or somewhere special. Stays all day. Very lovely especially for the price. I will definitely repeat this purchase.</li>
            <li> I used the last dark color and you don&#x27;t need to get a handful to see the color, I really love these colors!!</li>
            <li> I really am glad I added this palette to my collection - and I have many!  This is a very light neutral shimmery, soft...almost buttery powder with lots of light effects.  I use it for my base shadow when I opt for a soft look, then add a darker color, usually matte, for the crease.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s too shimmery without the matte addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this for a tiny dab in the inner corner of my eye for an extra bit of hi-light.  Yet another great elf product at an amazing price!</li>
            <li> the eyeshadow colors are good. I was not very impressed with how long they lasted though. the product came damaged and one of the shadows was completely broken in half; shadow was all over the box.</li>
            <li> I love the metallic quality to these colors (this review is for the &amp;#34;naked&amp;#34; palette) but also that they&#x27;re neutral.  I can actually get away with wearing this to work (at a law office), but it would be suitable for an evening out, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interestingly, when I opened the palette, the colors did not look as vibrant as the picture on Amazon.  However, when I put them on (I did a dry application), there was a lot of pigment to them.  So don&#x27;t let the appearance in the palette deceive you.  Plus, the colors are still vibrant after 8-10 hours of wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These go on smoothly.  You&#x27;ll want to find a good primer (unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t had a lot of luck using the e.l.f. primer with e.l.f. eyeshadows) to keep from getting creases.  Go easy with the applicator when you&#x27;re picking up the pigment -- press too hard and you&#x27;ll disturb the surface and loosen more product than you intended.  These are a bit creamier than normal powder eyeshadows so they should blend well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear contact lenses and have found these shadows to be non-irritating.  I think because they&#x27;re a little creamy, there&#x27;s not powder that can get in my eyes.  Please note: this product does contain parabens.  So be aware of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, if you have been interested in trying a neutral palette like this but have been holding out because competing products are so expensive, this one is definitely worth a look.</li>
            <li> I really like this shadow. I wear it basically everyday. It has the colors i like and is really great quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Good pigmentation, great for day but light for night</li>
            <li> There is a shimmer to all of these color.  Please do not purchase of you are looking for a matte look.</li>
            <li> Given the glowing reviews, I had higher expectations for this eyeshadow. I purchased the Naked palette, and am surprised by the discrepancies in colors between the image provided and the actual product. The second and third colors appear to be neutral beige / tan shades in the picture, but show up a very vibrant yellow and orange when worn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also not thrilled with the staying power of this shadow. I did a test run just wearing it around the house for the evening, and it had almost completely faded within a couple of hours. I can&#x27;t imagine how fast it would wear off if I were actually out and about. My palettes from Revlon and Maybelline don&#x27;t need a primer to stay on a good few hours, but you&#x27;ll definitely need a solid primer to keep this product looking good over the course of a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a positive note, the shimmery quality of the shadow is very pretty, and the swatches are just the right size. I have a bit of difficulty opening the case easily, but the compactness and the mirror are always handy. I will try to make us of this product so as not to waste the money, but I would caution potential buyers not to keep their hopes too high for this one.</li>
            <li> Bought this at the ladies request, she says she loves it.</li>
            <li> Loved the colors.  Very subtle but pretty.  Just the right brown palette I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li> Nothing in your description noted this was metalic,  so it didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
            <li> I love these eyeshadows they super pigmented and are a powder but feel like a creme. You can use these as eyeshadow or contouring and highlighting all use it for everything. Amazing product and I totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> Purchased this pallet based on the reviews I read and I have to say that this pallet is great.  The shadows are very soft when applied and the colors as great.  I read reviews about the colors not being pigmented well and that they don&#x27;t stay on, but I don&#x27;t find this to be true.  I have used other elf eye palettes and I think this one is by far my favorite.  It stays on all day and the colors are great neutrals.  I also love the slim design of the case and the mirror.  Great for traveling.</li>
            <li> Great product, and love the price!!</li>
            <li> So creamy and easily blendable, I have zero complaints! The beautiful toasted gold color builds up beautifully, already planning on working this palette into my homecoming makeup!</li>
            <li> I thought the colors would be darker once I put them on but they are very light. Hardly anyone noticed I had eyeshadow on. Up close it&#x27;s noticeable only!! It&#x27;s still cute.. Just not what I personally wanted.</li>
            <li> Perfect! I mix these colors with bright colors sometimes and they are super. Stay on we&#x27;ll all day.</li>
            <li> Love love it... Can use for any ocassion</li>
