            <li>/&gt;Still, it does a great job and there is 300 feet of it!</li>

            <li>Why I have to go to Amazon to find J&amp;J dentotape--the best floss there is--</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this product has been very good for me.</li>
            <li>It is a very good product.  </li>

            <li>It works great for me.  </li>
            <li>I had been looking for a good dental tape and trying others before I found I could get this one, which I had used for years</li>
            <li>Here is a good one I recommend:</li>
            <li>Works really good for me...</li>
            <li>Using a floss fork is very effective and handy, as one does not have to get fingers in the mouth.</li>
            <li>Excellent service with a good product at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>it gets hung in my teeth, but dentotape works great and my dentist says it does a better job than floss.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this item.</li>
            <li>an go kiss someone nice.</li>
            <li>i like this product, for it is good, affordable, and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Amazon had the best price by far.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I found it.</li>
            <li>I love these</li>
            <li>I would personally recommend all Reach Dental Tapes as the best around throughout the world.</li>
            <li>This almost unbreakable floss solves most of the problems associated with breaking floss.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find dentotape in stores any more</li>
            <li>Love this dentotape has a thicker floss for my teeth.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>The shipping charges were more than the Dentotape.  </li>
            <li>(fluoride makes the enamel crystal more resistant to acid destruction).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;konedog</li>
            <li>It cleans better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>it needs to have more wax in order to slide between them.</li>
            <li>This floss is perfect for those wide spaced teeth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not so wide that I can&#x27;t get it in between all my teeth, so it works great!</li>
            <li>and won&#x27;t shread nor break easily.</li>
            <li>but I can get it easily on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I have spaces between my teeth which makes it easy to miss one side when flossing.  </li>
            <li>The product was fine.  </li>
            <li>This Dentotape works very well in between teeth nice ,and strong string.</li>
            <li>If you can fit it ( You have wider spaces in between)</li>
            <li>Best of all, it isn&#x27;t too narrow to be used in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>I floss 2-3 times a day and this floss keep my teeth free of food particles.</li>
            <li>the best stuff was green mint-flavored waxed dentotape</li>
            <li>It was good to be able to order Johnson and Johnson Dentotape online and not have to try searching for it in local stores.</li>
            <li>This is the best Dental Floss you can find.. particularly if you have larger space between your teeth ...</li>
            <li>is a mystery, but after searching my local drugstores and groceries, I was very glad to find it readily available and well-priced on the site.</li>
            <li>This floss actually feels like it&#x27;s doing some good.</li>
            <li>If you have adequate room between your teeth</li>
            <li>(ASIN: B000GGFZLC on this Reach Dentotape Ribbon Gloss) a super product.  </li>
            <li>This is a super product; the tape is wider, presumably stronger, and tasty.  </li>
            <li>The thicker the dental tape is, the more comfortable it is to use on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>I had to laugh when I received it...</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick; product exactly as described.</li>
            <li>This stuff works much better at gettin the space between my teeth clean than regular dental floss.</li>
            <li>I returned this item this dental floss back to the seller; it was not what I thought they were selling, a better description would have been helpful.  </li>
            <li>Then its much better than regular floss.</li>
            <li>Ribbon floss works much better than regular floss.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been looking for more of this floss in all of my local stores for months, to no avail.</li>
            <li>First time in years a dental hygienist recommended dental tape.  </li>
            <li>This is advertised as being for wide spaced teeth, but it is the best thing I have found for tightly spaced teeth.</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY dental floss I have found that is thick/wide enough to really do a good job.</li>
            <li>The wide ribbon floss is what I recommend to my patients as it covers more tooth surface to remove plaque and is gentle on the gums as it has a cushion effect at the bottom of the gum sulcus.</li>
            <li>The tape (Dentatape) is more like floss ~ not as wide as I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>Its very embarrassing when people wrap their hands over their mouths because your breath is offensive.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Floss each tooth contact with a gentle insertion of the floss between the teeth.  </li>
            <li>Gum disease almost always starts in-between the teeth, and the only way to clean the germs that cause gum disease and cavities between the teeth is with floss.  </li>
            <li>Gently scrub each tooth up and down and make sure to go under the gumline (as this is where gum disease germs get their start).  </li>
            <li>Seller is Highly Recommended A+++++</li>
            <li>This one is unwaxed; maybe the waxed version is a little more slippery,</li>
            <li>/&gt;The extra wide dentotape is very strong though, and doesn&#x27;t tear or shred.</li>
            <li>I am a stickler for a fresh mouth and using a thicker floss makes me feel like I&#x27;m getting all the food from between my teeth properly.</li>
            <li>normal floss tends to do.</li>
            <li>It is the only one that really cleans my teeth, particularly one spot where I have to double it to clean.</li>
            <li>Most floss I&#x27;ve used are so thin that they don&#x27;t adequately remove problem debris between the teeth.</li>
            <li>It will be more difficult to pass between teeth, but I like it because I find that it cleans my teeth better than the smaller diameter floss.</li>
            <li>i feel this extra width really scrubs the sides of my teeth better than ordinary floss.  </li>
            <li>It does not shred, and it has enough friction to do some cleaning, unlike many of the products made for tight teeth.</li>
            <li>A wide Dentotape really works well for me, much more so than the thin style.</li>
            <li>The type of dental floss most readily available in drugstores and supermarkets is the thin, round variety which breaks and shreds all too easily besides digging very uncomfortably into my thumb and</li>
            <li>This really gets in those tight places.</li>

            <li> All the floss that&#x27;s made for tight teeth is very fine, and it immediately shreds and thin pieces get stuck in between my teeth.</li>
            <li> This item is pretty hard to find in some retail stores.</li>
            <li> I understand now why the shipping was high for such a small item,</li>
            <li> It is far less prone to break or shred between your teeth--and won&#x27;t dig into fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> what&#x27;s needed is a new design where the floss alternates between strong thin waxed sections for &amp;#34;getting in&amp;#34; and thick soft fluffy sections for cleaning.</li>
            <li> regular floss is too thin but this type really works in between your teeth.</li>
            <li> This floss helps because it&#x27;s thick, but not too thick to fit between teeth without spaces.  </li>
            <li> Though this extra wide floss is made for widely spaced teeth, I actually use it for my incredibly tightly packed teeth.</li>
            <li> The dentist told me that in the back of your tongue (near tonsils) there are hole pockets; as you get older, they get bigger and if you don&#x27;t brush your tongue; you&#x27;ll get bad breath.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The extra width does not prevent me from getting into tight places although a little extra effort is sometimes</li>
            <li> No more trips to the dentists since we started using these great products and no more bad breath.</li>
            <li> I buy this dental tape from an Amazon supplier because I have trouble finding it in my local pharmacy, supermarket, etc.   </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s the only one thick enough for my teeth (wide gaps)</li>
            <li> If memory serves, there was once an orange-flavored wide tape</li>
            <li> Shipping was a little expensive but it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> The unfortunate result of such neglect is the rapid development of cavities between the teeth (especially in kids), and inevitable gum disease in adults, which can lead to eventual tooth loss.  </li>
            <li> But I know other people who cannot get it in between their teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Reach floss is thicker than the average floss.</li>
            <li> i have tight teeth with gumline spaces.</li>
            <li> This is a thick, tough floss that is not slick.  </li>
            <li> Those with tight contacts will have trouble with Reach floss.</li>
            <li> like all the other tapes i have tried, this one is too hard to get between the tight tops.</li>
            <li> As a  dentist I always had trouble getting my patients to floss with any enthusiasm.  </li>
            <li> Brushing behind the back teeth helps, too.</li>
            <li> I thought it was the thick yarn type floss, which was what I needed for a dental gap &amp; overhangs.  </li>
            <li> Received a couple of days late, due to inclement weather, but that&#x27;s no fault of supplier.</li>
            <li> The other thin flosses; are too sharp and make my teeth bleed but not this one.</li>
            <li> It is flat--perhaps 1/32 of an inch wide--and stronger than ordinary dental floss.</li>
            <li> I prefer dento tape to dental floss, but it is hard to find.  </li>
            <li> wish it were less expensive, and wish they had a flavored type.</li>
            <li> And it hasn&#x27;t broken on me yet.</li>
            <li> then it&#x27;s too thin to work well in the spaces.</li>
            <li> and if I don&#x27;t take the food out; it&#x27;ll definitely give me horrible breath!</li>
            <li> As a dentist, I have seen over and over again the destructive results of not flossing one&#x27;s teeth.</li>
            <li> Simply impossible to find this in stores.  </li>
            <li> Hate dental floss because my teeth are close together.</li>

            <li> Simply impossible to find this in stores.  Amazon had the best price by far.  This is a thick, tough floss that is not slick.  If you have adequate room between your teeth it is great.  This one is unwaxed; maybe the waxed version is a little more slippery, I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;Still, it does a great job and there is 300 feet of it!</li>
            <li> The type of dental floss most readily available in drugstores and supermarkets is the thin, round variety which breaks and shreds all too easily besides digging very uncomfortably into my thumb and forefinger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reach Dentotape by Johnson &amp; Johnson is different. It is flat--perhaps 1/32 of an inch wide--and stronger than ordinary dental floss. It is far less prone to break or shred between your teeth--and won&#x27;t dig into fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extra width does not prevent me from getting into tight places although a little extra effort is sometimes required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product has been very good for me. I am so glad I found it.</li>
            <li> I buy this dental tape from an Amazon supplier because I have trouble finding it in my local pharmacy, supermarket, etc.   But the shipping charges are out of line for the size of the package and its value. Three of these cost me $9 in shipping.  Next time I will ask my pharmacy to order it for me.</li>
            <li> This is the only place I can find this dentotape. If you have gaps between your teeth this is the product you would want because of the width of it.</li>
            <li> I love these Dentotape.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the only one thick enough for my teeth (wide gaps) and won&#x27;t shread nor break easily.</li>
            <li> i feel this extra width really scrubs the sides of my teeth better than ordinary floss.  wish it were less expensive, and wish they had a flavored type.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll order it again!!!!</li>
            <li> The thicker the dental tape is, the more comfortable it is to use on a daily basis.  I would personally recommend all Reach Dental Tapes as the best around throughout the world.</li>
            <li> This stuff works much better at gettin the space between my teeth clean than regular dental floss.The concept of flavored dental floss escapes me. All I ask is that it helps prevent gum disease; which this does in spades.</li>
            <li> The tape (Dentatape) is more like floss ~ not as wide as I was expecting.  Plus, the container fell apart almost immediately, and I had to tape it back together.</li>
            <li> As a  dentist I always had trouble getting my patients to floss with any enthusiasm.  This almost unbreakable floss solves most of the problems associated with breaking floss.</li>
            <li> This is the best Dental Floss you can find.. particularly if you have larger space between your teeth ... others don&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find dentotape in stores any more but I can get it easily on Amazon.  I do not like floss it gets hung in my teeth, but dentotape works great and my dentist says it does a better job than floss.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a good dental tape and trying others before I found I could get this one, which I had used for years but the stores no longer carry, at Amazon.  It is the only one that really cleans my teeth, particularly one spot where I have to double it to clean.</li>
            <li> The wide ribbon floss is what I recommend to my patients as it covers more tooth surface to remove plaque and is gentle on the gums as it has a cushion effect at the bottom of the gum sulcus.</li>
            <li> Love this dentotape has a thicker floss for my teeth. I am 54, I have gaps between all my teeth where food gets in and if I don&#x27;t take the food out; it&#x27;ll definitely give me horrible breath! The dentist told me that in the back of your tongue (near tonsils) there are hole pockets; as you get older, they get bigger and if you don&#x27;t brush your tongue; you&#x27;ll get bad breath. Brushing behind the back teeth helps, too. I use to watch my dentist when he&#x27;d cleaning my teeth with floss (during dentist cleanings). Its very embarrassing when people wrap their hands over their mouths because your breath is offensive. Oh, this dental tape doesn&#x27;t make my teeth bleed either. The other thin flosses; are too sharp and make my teeth bleed but not this one. I cannot find dentotape at my local store (W...) so I have to order it here. I also recommend Biotene (a mouth rinse) by GlaxoSmithKline. The biotene rinse helps get rid of food particles; where brushing isn&#x27;t enough. No more trips to the dentists since we started using these great products and no more bad breath.</li>
            <li> I use nothing but this for flossing my teeth.  Love it.  Hate dental floss because my teeth are close together.</li>
            <li> I returned this item this dental floss back to the seller; it was not what I thought they were selling, a better description would have been helpful.  I thought it was the thick yarn type floss, which was what I needed for a dental gap &amp; overhangs.  It took about 4wks, but Seller did finally refund me.</li>
            <li> The product was fine.  The shipping charges were more than the Dentotape.  I won&#x27;t order from this source again.</li>
            <li> This is advertised as being for wide spaced teeth, but it is the best thing I have found for tightly spaced teeth.It does not shred, and it has enough friction to do some cleaning, unlike many of the products made for tight teeth.</li>
            <li> ...but they do the job!</li>
            <li> As a dentist, I have seen over and over again the destructive results of not flossing one&#x27;s teeth. The unfortunate result of such neglect is the rapid development of cavities between the teeth (especially in kids), and inevitable gum disease in adults, which can lead to eventual tooth loss.  Gum disease almost always starts in-between the teeth, and the only way to clean the germs that cause gum disease and cavities between the teeth is with floss.  Mechanical scrubbing with floss is the key, and all the daily brushings and rinsings will not remove the in-between stubborn plaque below the gumline and at the contact point of the teeth. The bottom line is that we need to floss our teeth if we want to keep them for a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reach floss is thicker than the average floss. It will be more difficult to pass between teeth, but I like it because I find that it cleans my teeth better than the smaller diameter floss. This is a personal preference not based on any clinical data. Reach floss is not for everyone. Those with tight contacts will have trouble with Reach floss. This floss is waxed (easier to slide between teeth), and is unflavored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If one&#x27;s fingers get sore from flossing, there are various floss forks that one can load with this floss.  Using a floss fork is very effective and handy, as one does not have to get fingers in the mouth. Here is a good one I recommend: [[ASIN:B000LC22R6 Flossaid Dental Floss Holder **ONE**]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Floss each tooth contact with a gentle insertion of the floss between the teeth.  Gently scrub each tooth up and down and make sure to go under the gumline (as this is where gum disease germs get their start).  After flossing, it is a great time to brush.  Always use a fluoridated toothpaste for maximum protection of the teeth (fluoride makes the enamel crystal more resistant to acid destruction).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;konedog</li>
            <li> I have spaces between my teeth which makes it easy to miss one side when flossing.  This floss helps because it&#x27;s thick, but not too thick to fit between teeth without spaces.  And it hasn&#x27;t broken on me yet.</li>
            <li> I happen to like this item, But I know other people who cannot get it in between their teeth. If you can fit it ( You have wider spaces in between) Then its much better than regular floss. It cleans better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  I had to laugh when I received it...I understand now why the shipping was high for such a small item, I though an ipad arrived by the size of the package and wrapping.</li>
            <li> This floss is perfect for those wide spaced teeth.  Gets the crud out without having to double or quadruple the floss or use toothpicks for flossing.</li>
            <li> I prefer dento tape to dental floss, but it is hard to find.  The proprietary brand sold by one national drugstore chain shreds.  It was good to be able to order Johnson and Johnson Dentotape online and not have to try searching for it in local stores.</li>
            <li> This Dentotape works very well in between teeth nice ,and strong string. Would recommend to anybody. Seller is Highly Recommended A+++++</li>
            <li> Ribbon floss works much better than regular floss.  It is a very good product.  Reach is a dependable product, and I was sorry to see it is not carried in local stores any more.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY dental floss I have found that is thick/wide enough to really do a good job. Most floss I&#x27;ve used are so thin that they don&#x27;t adequately remove problem debris between the teeth.</li>
            <li> Excellent service with a good product at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Obviously, this product is not for everybody. Some people have gaps between the teeth, some don&#x27;t...&lt;br /&gt;For those with spaces there it&#x27;s a perfect solution. Works really good for me...</li>
            <li> (ASIN: B000GGFZLC on this Reach Dentotape Ribbon Gloss) a super product.  I don&#x27;t think it has the distribution it should have, but Amazon does.  If memory serves, there was once an orange-flavored wide tape but I can&#x27;t recall who sold it.  This is a super product; the tape is wider, presumably stronger, and tasty.  Best of all, it isn&#x27;t too narrow to be used in your mouth.  Now floss your teeth an go kiss someone nice.</li>
            <li> It works great for me.  Best for people who have some wider spaces between teeth.</li>
            <li> This really gets in those tight places. I am a stickler for a fresh mouth and using a thicker floss makes me feel like I&#x27;m getting all the food from between my teeth properly. I floss 2-3 times a day and this floss keep my teeth free of food particles.</li>
            <li> i like this product, for it is good, affordable, and it is easy to use. I would buy it again and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> This item is pretty hard to find in some retail stores. It was great to find it on Amazon! A wide Dentotape really works well for me, much more so than the thin style. Shipping was a little expensive but it arrived quickly. I am very pleased with this item.</li>
            <li> This floss actually feels like it&#x27;s doing some good. regular floss is too thin but this type really works in between your teeth. I didn&#x27;t see it at Tar-jay so I just ordered it.</li>
            <li> recommended by hygienist, but couldn&#x27;t find in stores around here</li>
            <li> Received a couple of days late, due to inclement weather, but that&#x27;s no fault of supplier. UPS couldn&#x27;t get to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been looking for more of this floss in all of my local stores for months, to no avail. Though this extra wide floss is made for widely spaced teeth, I actually use it for my incredibly tightly packed teeth. All the floss that&#x27;s made for tight teeth is very fine, and it immediately shreds and thin pieces get stuck in between my teeth. Terrible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extra wide dentotape is very strong though, and doesn&#x27;t tear or shred. It&#x27;s not so wide that I can&#x27;t get it in between all my teeth, so it works great! And with 100 yards in the package, it lasts forever. I&#x27;m so happy to have found it on amazon! I was losing hope that I&#x27;d ever see it again!</li>
            <li> First time in years a dental hygienist recommended dental tape.  Couldn&#x27;t find any at local Wal-Mart so I ended ujp buying this from Amazon.  I like the heavier stuff becuase it doesn&#x27;t break like normal floss tends to do.</li>
            <li> I HAD TO PURCHASE ON LINE BECAUSE NO STORES CARRY DENTAL TAPE ANY MORE, WHAT IS WRONG WITH AMERICA&lt;br /&gt;WHEN YOU HAVE TO ORDER ON THE INTERNET TO GET EVERY DAY PRODUCTS?</li>
            <li> i have tight teeth with gumline spaces. like all the other tapes i have tried, this one is too hard to get between the tight tops. it needs to have more wax in order to slide between them. then it&#x27;s too thin to work well in the spaces. the best stuff was green mint-flavored waxed dentotape but they don&#x27;t sell it anymore. instead you get generic copies that shred before you even get them off the spool. what&#x27;s needed is a new design where the floss alternates between strong thin waxed sections for &amp;#34;getting in&amp;#34; and thick soft fluffy sections for cleaning. if you commercialize this idea, please send me a percentage of the profits.  :-]</li>
            <li> Why I have to go to Amazon to find J&amp;J dentotape--the best floss there is--is a mystery, but after searching my local drugstores and groceries, I was very glad to find it readily available and well-priced on the site. Delivery was quick; product exactly as described. I will be buying more--before it disappears from here!</li>
