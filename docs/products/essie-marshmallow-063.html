            <li>Even wearing this polish alone, it looks excellent!</li>
            <li>Best color ever.</li>
            <li>Great for summer with a tan!</li>
            <li>Perfect for the summer or fall in my opinion!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the best nail polishes on the market.</li>
            <li>This Essie gal is happy again!</li>
            <li>and it really is gorgeous!</li>
            <li>bought it as a gift and it looks great on her.</li>
            <li>The wear time is amazing!</li>
            <li>The color is bright and coats</li>
            <li>The formula is excellent, maximum opacity in 2 coats using light, even strokes.  </li>
            <li>Good for making a jelly sandwich.</li>
            <li>A very cute color.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s perfect for a first coat under another color that needs brightening or thickening.</li>
            <li>I however, completely love it!  </li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this color!</li>
            <li>It does look better with about 3 coats and be sure to shake before using, but love it!</li>
            <li>It took 3 coats to get a good coverage but tried quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for french manicure.</li>
            <li>It looks much better with a top coat than without.</li>
            <li>I really love this color, it was just what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Seemed too liquidy for essie nail polish and requires many coats to get the desired color..</li>
            <li>I love all Essie nail polish</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE Essie.</li>
            <li>Cute spring color.</li>
            <li>This happens to be one of my favorite colors.</li>
            <li>Marshmallow is sweet !</li>
            <li>Not bad, not my favorite.</li>
            <li>so I knew the polish itself would be fine.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and smoothly.</li>
            <li>From a distance, it looks amazing and very flattering against my brown skin.</li>
            <li>As usual, Essie has good coverage, stays on well, and just good stuff</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a more peachy color like the picture to look more natural.</li>
            <li>This is just a clean, gorgeous white!  </li>
            <li>By that point your nails are bright white...</li>
            <li>This essie color is opaque and 2-3 coats gets a great, crisp white.</li>
            <li>(extremely subtle off-white) and is the perfect accent color.  </li>
            <li>so the nail polish is excellent, however, this off-white color takes a few coats to really pop.</li>
            <li>Its worth the price.</li>
            <li>Drys super fast and lasts for day.</li>
            <li>so it takes about 3 coats to look even, which is fine, but it turns out to be super white like WhiteOut.</li>
            <li>I thought I would be using it for a french manicure, but now I&#x27;m not so sure.</li>
            <li>Different than most I use</li>
            <li>When I bought this I was envisioning a fresh, clean, simple color.</li>
            <li>I need a pure white for my french manicures and this is the best by far, its a white out!</li>
            <li>It seemed like it was thinner than most Essie polishes I&#x27;ve used, and I was hoping for something just a little more white.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much to say about it.</li>
            <li>I love white nail polish but find most brands sell whites that are too sheer and require a thousand coats before they start to look white.  </li>
            <li>I see that some people use this shade for a more natural looking French manicure.</li>
            <li>Formula wise, it is streaky and I had to apply at least 2 (sometimes 3) coats for complete opaqueness.</li>
            <li>It was only the first time I tried it</li>
            <li>and I first was afraid it would look too bright like white-out.</li>
            <li>You need to put more than 2 coats though so it is a bit tough to be able to keep occupied so that you don&#x27;t mess them up after 3 coats...</li>
            <li>This is definitely not like other white polishes that look more like a gross, \\&quot;white-out\\&quot; color.  </li>
            <li>If your nails are clean and long enough, just two coats will give you the faux french manicure effect (sounds bad, looks good).</li>
            <li>I usually go for the neutral soft light pink colors all year long</li>

            <li> Marshmallow is a pearl white color. Formula wise, it is streaky and I had to apply at least 2 (sometimes 3) coats for complete opaqueness. A very cute color. It&#x27;s perfect for french manicure. It looks much better with a top coat than without.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an off white-ish color. Just what I was looking for. My only problem is that it goes on kinda streaky. I apply two coats and it evens out somewhat with the 2nd coat, but not enough. Maybe I&#x27;m applying the coats too thin. Maybe I need to add a little nail enamel thinner to my bottle. From a distance, it looks amazing and very flattering against my brown skin. Up close, there&#x27;s room for improvement due to the streaks. I see that some people use this shade for a more natural looking French manicure. As of this writing, I&#x27;ve only used it for full-nail coverage. Other than that it stays on pretty well as do all of my other Essie polishes.</li>
            <li> I really love this color, it was just what I was looking for.  It does look better with about 3 coats and be sure to shake before using, but love it!</li>
            <li> bought it as a gift and it looks great on her. The color is bright and coats well. I will buy this brand again</li>
            <li> Not bad, not my favorite. I don&#x27;t have much to say about it. Its worth the price.</li>
            <li> Read the title. It&#x27;s what I wanted in a white and what I got. If your nails are clean and long enough, just two coats will give you the faux french manicure effect (sounds bad, looks good).</li>
            <li> Seemed too liquidy for essie nail polish and requires many coats to get the desired color..other nail polish was on the outside of the bottle as well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin so it takes about 3 coats to look even, which is fine, but it turns out to be super white like WhiteOut. I was hoping for a more peachy color like the picture to look more natural. I also thought it would be milkier.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have a problem with seller or nail polish. I love all Essie nail polish so I knew the polish itself would be fine. Only down side is it takes three costs to be opaque.</li>
            <li> It seemed like it was thinner than most Essie polishes I&#x27;ve used, and I was hoping for something just a little more white. However, it&#x27;s perfect for a first coat under another color that needs brightening or thickening.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Essie so the nail polish is excellent, however, this off-white color takes a few coats to really pop. I thought I would be using it for a french manicure, but now I&#x27;m not so sure.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t match up with other Essie polishes. It&#x27;s streaky and thin and it takes several coats to make it look decent. I think I&#x27;ll grab a different brand from now on when it comes to white jelly polishes. Don&#x27;t get pulled in by the name. This polish just doesn&#x27;t cut it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a lot of people disappointed in this color. I however, completely love it!  It is NOT a pure white and some people seem to think that&#x27;s what it was supposed to be (adjust your monitor settings).  It&#x27;s a subtle off (extremely subtle off-white) and is the perfect accent color.  Even wearing this polish alone, it looks excellent! This is definitely not like other white polishes that look more like a gross, \\&quot;white-out\\&quot; color.  This is just a clean, gorgeous white!  The formula is excellent, maximum opacity in 2 coats using light, even strokes.  Love!</li>
            <li> Best color ever. I&#x27;ve had my nails done three times in a row with this color. Great for summer with a tan!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this color! I have seen swatches of this online and it really is gorgeous! The wear time is amazing! I wore mie for about 4 days with no chipping! Perfect for the summer or fall in my opinion! Makes me look tan in the summer and winter! Definitely recommend this nail color!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE Essie. It&#x27;s one of the best nail polishes on the market. Drys super fast and lasts for day.</li>
            <li> I use this for french manicures.  It does the job.  The polish dries fast and lasts at least a week before it needs to be taken off.</li>
            <li> Good for making a jelly sandwich. As usual, Essie has good coverage, stays on well, and just good stuff all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:&lt;br /&gt;Finally used this by itself for my 4th of July mani. It took 3 coats to get a good coverage but tried quickly.</li>
            <li> I like this shade. Different than most I use and I first was afraid it would look too bright like white-out. It is definitely a softer white. I usually do 2 coats, but felt it needed a third. It was only the first time I tried it so I may just need some practice to get the brush technique with this color. Cute spring color. I think it can work well with designs or a softer  french-tip look.</li>
            <li> When I bought this I was envisioning a fresh, clean, simple color. The problem is it goes on sooo streaky. Because of that you need at least 3 coats to make it even. By that point your nails are bright white...totally not what I was going for.</li>
            <li> I need a pure white for my french manicures and this is the best by far, its a white out! Marshmallow is sweet ! This Essie gal is happy again!</li>
            <li> I love white nail polish but find most brands sell whites that are too sheer and require a thousand coats before they start to look white.  This essie color is opaque and 2-3 coats gets a great, crisp white.</li>
            <li> Its very white. Not pearl. But I prefer that at times. It goes on easily and smoothly. You need to put more than 2 coats though so it is a bit tough to be able to keep occupied so that you don&#x27;t mess them up after 3 coats...</li>
            <li> You cant go wrong with any Essie color. Marshmallow is a soft white and you can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> This happens to be one of my favorite colors. I usually go for the neutral soft light pink colors all year long</li>
