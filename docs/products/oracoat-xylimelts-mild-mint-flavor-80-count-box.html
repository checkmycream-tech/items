            <li>Amazing product !</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with this product!  </li>
            <li>Treatment was successful (thank you lord) and these help with the resulting mouth and throat dryness.</li>
            <li>Pleasant taste and they work.</li>
            <li>- so the experience is rather pleasant</li>
            <li>have a pleasant mint flavor while hydrating my mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is a world of difference in the way it works and it has a pleasant taste.</li>
            <li>The XyliMelts have a pleasant minty taste that I can still taste in the morning when I get</li>
            <li>I bought mine from SPEC Sales - they had the best pricing and I received my delivery very quickly.</li>
            <li>Seem to be working as promised and that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li>Good for overnight</li>
            <li>Not quite as good as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li>Good product...good service.</li>
            <li>Hopefully they are good for my teeth/crowns also.  </li>
            <li>They are that good.</li>
            <li>It tastes good and it lasted for about six hours before melting away in my mouth as I slept.  </li>
            <li>and she agreed that it was a good product for me.</li>
            <li>I am good all night.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Taste is good as well.</li>
            <li>My dentist, who&#x27;s been around the block a couple of times and has always had wise and frugal advice, recommended these to me.</li>
            <li>I loved the idea of this mint sticking in place and keeping my teeth lubricated.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a good product, but it just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li>While, this is a good product, it just was not for me.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t imagine getting a good night&#x27;s sleep without XyliMelts.  </li>
            <li>It continually emits a really pleasant mint taste into the mouth, and makes it fresh and very pleasant.</li>
            <li>and he is very pleased.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>and I was very pleased  </li>
            <li>Very glad we found something to help~</li>
            <li>They are great for cotton mouth for sure.</li>
            <li>However, it took care of my problem so well that I&#x27;ve ordered more!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>The product is the best remedy I&#x27;m aware of.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad someone invented them!</li>
            <li>So glad I found these!</li>
            <li>It has literally been like magic for her!  </li>
            <li>Great for reducing the germ type that can lead to decay and making a ph positive saliva for a healthier mouth!!!</li>
            <li>These pills are great, easy to apply and they do create lots of saliva.</li>
            <li>Waking up is more pleasant, and there is no need to sip water throughout the night.</li>
            <li>I can not remember the wonderful feeling of being able to swallow when I first wake up!  </li>
            <li>XyliMelts has been an amazing help.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how it sticks to my gum inside my mouth and stays there.</li>
            <li>A mint would do just as well, but it is handy to have for a while during the time is does stick.  </li>
            <li>nice to wake up with a moist mouth</li>
            <li>However, they are extremely effective for patients who are being treated for Cancer and for autoimmune problems.  </li>
            <li>It does kind of &amp;#34;gum up&amp;#34; my invisalign trays.</li>
            <li>They are effective for the rest of the night.</li>
            <li>I had tried another popular product, but didn&#x27;t get the results that Orahealth Xylimelts gave me.</li>
            <li>Great product, great delivery service, reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Nice alternative to keeping your mouth moist.  </li>
            <li>Made with xylitol makes me feel better since I have read research showing xylitol is good for preventing cavities.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know how effective it might be for that purpose.</li>
            <li>It has a nice mint flavor and helps keep the mouth moist.</li>
            <li>They sit nicely wherever you want them</li>
            <li>Work really well and have a pleasant taste!</li>
            <li>They are much more effective than the baking soda rinses the physicians recommend.</li>
            <li>I love these for when I cannot have water handy.  </li>
            <li>He has tried other &amp;#34;solutions,&amp;#34; but these work the best and are the most pleasant to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These help tremendously!!</li>
            <li>I liked this best out of the non-prescription helps to a very dry mouth.</li>
            <li>Truly Refreshing.  </li>
            <li>I am getting better dental check-ups.</li>
            <li>That way, when i wake up from a good night&#x27;s sleep my mouth would still be fresh and moist.</li>
            <li>I find them helpful and refreshing during the day and even overnight.</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended that I try these, and I am glad he did.  </li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>but it cost more</li>
            <li>I tried just about everything, and this helped the most.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been giving them to all my friends and they love them, too, and I&#x27;ve just ordered more for myself, since I&#x27;ve been giving so many away to my friends.  </li>
            <li>Because I wish it were better.  </li>
            <li>would be better if didn&#x27;t stick to part of mouth.  </li>
            <li>For me, one tab nightly lasts most of the night.  </li>
            <li>Many of them use it now.</li>
            <li>and I can sleep so much better.</li>
            <li>They love it, too.</li>
            <li>It is better than chomping on gum to freshen your breath.</li>
            <li>I will buy more when I run out.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you get the Mint.  </li>
            <li>And the price is certainly better than the gels I&#x27;ve tried (</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more today.</li>
            <li>And the chemo worked! :-)</li>
            <li>Placing a XyliMelts tab on my gums after dinner creates more saliva which helps my digestion.</li>
            <li>They seem to work best when I sleep  on my back.</li>
            <li>They sure get the job done.</li>
            <li>Glad to have gotten a sample from my dentist.</li>
            <li>better than anything else ve tried</li>
            <li>We have tried so many products, spray and rinses and nothing worked.  </li>
            <li>so perhaps I want my mouth to be more moist than some.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the mint free type yet, but will be ordering some of those soon as I would prefer mint free if they work just as good.  </li>
            <li>While that doesn&#x27;t take care of all my concerns, it takes care of some of the biggest and is certainly better than what I had been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I stopped using two at a time and found that one at a time worked better.</li>
            <li>THAT I HAD FOR  MANY YEARS.</li>
            <li>AND THEY ARE ALL IN AGREEMENT THAT THIS IS AN EXCELLANT, SAFE, AND NESSESARY  </li>
            <li>Love these things.</li>
            <li>really work well and what a great idea.</li>
            <li>It is the better than Biotiine products for oral dryness.  </li>
            <li>They are still better than competitive products.</li>
            <li>Great product, fast shipper</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many brands and Xylimelts</li>
            <li>I use this in conjunction with Biotene Gel and seems to work better.</li>
            <li>Works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Keep my mouth comfortably moist all night!</li>
            <li>they make my life better</li>
            <li>I have been pleased as punch.</li>
            <li>Also refreshing.</li>
            <li>I was about to go to the dentist, but decided to stop using Xylimelts to make sure it wasn&#x27;t the cause.</li>
            <li>Love how it &amp;#34;sticks&amp;#34; to your mouth.</li>
            <li>I buy these mints for a relative who says they are wonderful.</li>
            <li>I use them mostly at night.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to be able to sleep 7 hours straight.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with them</li>
            <li>Did ok for the moisture</li>
            <li>I found greater result with just chewing Xylitol gum, which induced saliva production and didn&#x27;t give that pasty taste/feeling in my mouth.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I really love the taste of these mints.</li>
            <li>so would be safe for night time..</li>
            <li>I love the research that spoke of doctors using these for antibacterial properties before pt.s</li>
            <li>sure help the burning in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>Love the service that Orahelath promotes.  </li>
            <li>They work better than anything I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Has worked well most of the time in the evening and night.  </li>
            <li>was so glad to find them on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I love these.  </li>
            <li>Works Great, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>But pretty good.</li>
            <li>I am so happy that my new dentist recommended Xylimelts to me.</li>

            <li>I  thank my dentist mentally every morning for recommending this wonderful product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that they are most comfortable when I stick them to the roof of my mouth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other things, but this is the best.  </li>
            <li>it is easy and Xylimelts keep my mouth moist for the day.</li>

            <li>Great product that will help so many people that suffer with dry mouth.</li>
            <li>Yet, that&#x27;s effective and this is probably one of the more effective products I&#x27;ve used for dry mouth.</li>
            <li>I just wish it lasted a little longer; then it would be perfect.</li>
            <li>The Xylimelts make a huge difference in his sleeping comfort.  </li>
            <li>anywhere in the mouth that is comfortable.</li>
            <li>The Xylimelts are fantastic for healing and preventing mouth ulcers and sores.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the ultimate, GREAT breath mint, also.</li>
            <li>These mints have allowed me to literally smile more again.</li>
            <li>I was not producing any saliva at all, therefore no moisture was available to dissolve the tablets.  </li>
            <li>Worth a try for sure.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have a CPAP, but I also enjoy Xylimelts when I sleep.  </li>
            <li>They stick lightly to areas in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>Works great for public speaking and job interviews too!</li>
            <li>Fortunately, the AutoPAP has a humidification unit coupled with a heated hose.  </li>
            <li>My dentists had some free samples.</li>
            <li>This time, I ordered 3 boxes at once to take advantage of free shipping.  </li>
            <li>This product is GREAT, creates saliva flow, and helps me fall back to sleep when my CPAP machine dries out my mouth and wakes me up.  </li>
            <li>Since a friend&#x27;s dentist gave her some XyliMelts samples and she shared with me, I have slept through comfortably.  </li>
            <li>I use them primarily</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like sugary foods, you won&#x27;t enjoy the flavour of these.  </li>
            <li>It is also notable that I have experienced no irritation or other side effects from their use.</li>
            <li>The melt lasts an hour, two if you are very calm (asleep or not talking/moving the mouth).</li>
            <li>, all these products are pleasant tasting and promote fresh breath so you can be comfortable getting up close and personal :-)</li>
            <li>The first time he used them, he fell in love with them.</li>
            <li>For the first 6 hours or so, they sort of moisten my mouth - more like gargling with a gel toothpaste or something.  </li>
            <li>but so worth it!</li>
            <li>but still worth it!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t make the mistake of ordering the original (the one with the picture of the tree bark on the box).  </li>
            <li>and I wake up with minty fresh breath!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen these in any local stores, but if they were available, I doubt that the prices would be as good as they are on Amazon.</li>
            <li>THEY WORK GREAT FOR DRY MOUTH.  </li>
            <li>Then I tried the XyliMelts and found that I liked them better in that they did not produce the same stickiness.</li>
            <li>These are great during the day preventing dry mouth.</li>
            <li>Great for dry mouth.  </li>
            <li>These are great for dry mouth.  </li>
            <li>I suffer greatly from dry mouth...</li>
            <li>Sometimes my mouth is slightly dry when I wake up,but really great making it through the night.  </li>
            <li>These are a great option to control breath issues as well even if you dont suffer from dry mouth.</li>
            <li>They leave you with a very nice feeling, especially knowing that they make my dad smile.</li>
            <li>Great for dry mouth even at night!</li>
            <li>Product was exactly as expected and at great price.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll notice that you, once again, have the correct balance of mucus and saliva in your mouth that is important to taste, feel and everything else you need to keep your mouth and tongue feeling fresh and moist.</li>
            <li>If you are a mouth breather and use a full face mask, be prepared for additional  cleaning in the morning</li>
            <li>and it was ok really sticks to gums.</li>
            <li>It seems to need a full 20 seconds of holding the mint there for it to stick well.</li>
            <li>My greatest hope is that with continued use, the decay/destruction of my teeth will either slow, or cease.</li>
            <li>The non-peppermint ones have a slightly sweet almost vanilla flavor, so I know that there&#x27;s something in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>I only get fair results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;During the day is really dependent upon what I&#x27;m doing as to how many I use.  </li>
            <li>He uses a full face c-pap mask,while I use a nasal mask.</li>
            <li>I love them so  much I will occassionally share..</li>
            <li>Xylimelts have a pleasant, minty taste that lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li>I wish it did not dissolve so quickly.</li>
            <li>If your mouth is open much when you sleep theses help great.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these. : )</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like super sweet minty, feels like I&#x27;ve been chewing fresh gum all night.  </li>
            <li>my husband has dry mouth syndrome and this works; he has tried many other gums; sprays and this is the best.</li>
            <li>I have tried other products and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>I like everything about the Mints: they ease my continual dry mouth, they taste good and they sit on my gum while I talk or sing and don&#x27;t get in my way.  </li>
            <li>A good product, recommended by my dentist, for dry mouth.  </li>
            <li>so a great product all wrapped up into one super little mint.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li>This is a terrific product for helping to alleviate the dry mouth; in fact it is excellent.</li>
            <li>Love, love this product for helping to relieve my dry mouth at night.  </li>
            <li>In my experience, they don&#x27;t last the whole night, but the taste is pleasant, and if you use two at a time they work</li>
            <li>I much prefer the mint ones to the mint free ones.</li>
            <li>product also, allegedly, promotes good oral health; an allegation I believe.</li>
            <li>Yeah, kind of gross.</li>
            <li>When I sleep with these, although they are gone when I wake, my mouth is relieved, moist and fresh.</li>
            <li>That alone has been worth the price of these things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are FAR BETTER than any Biotene product.  </li>
            <li>I consider it a bonus that it gives me fresh breath.</li>
            <li>Disolves slowly, tastes great and gum side adheres to cheek comfortably.</li>
            <li>Once my wisdom tooth extraction is healed (fun experience after 40)  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I ordered there here and found delivery speedy and continuing use a success.</li>
            <li>But it is worth it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;By night 14, I noticed my teeth felt much more sensitive, even though I was paying attention and rotating where I was putting the tablet each night.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money and have put it on my subscribe and save</li>
            <li>This product is a great help for those with dry mouth; it&#x27;s easy to use, especially when you&#x27;re on the go</li>
            <li>Both mornings so far, I woke up with a pleasant minty taste in my mouth and no dry mouth.</li>
            <li>These are far better than nothing, but far less than ideal too.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my mouth moist for a couple of hours and the price is right .</li>
            <li>You should get some right away.</li>
            <li>THE RIGHT WAY IT HAS BEEN</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>I pop it into my mouth right before I get into bed and position it where I want it to stick.  </li>
            <li>, I jumped right in and bought the 80-pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>wow, these are great for some of us with dry mouth....</li>
            <li>These mints are really good and really work with dry  mouth</li>
            <li>I have used the non minty ones in the past and they were great, but</li>
            <li>Unlike most of the reviews I&#x27;ve read, I do seem to go through a few more at night and during the day than what I read.  </li>
            <li>These are the best mints for dry mouth, hands down.</li>
            <li>Xylimelts answers a real need!  </li>
            <li>I ordered it to complete a free shipping order.    </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re suppose to last for most of the night.     </li>
            <li>More dependent on your personal comfort with the placement.</li>
            <li>At first, I was worried about swallowing it at night while sleeping</li>
            <li>/&gt;They&#x27;re also pretty nifty when I have to teach training classes for my job.  </li>
            <li>But, I had to take the Biotene pretty often during the night.</li>
            <li>This was not my first order for these.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried gels and still wake during the mouth barely able to open my mouth.  </li>
            <li>The only thing she wishes is that they had more flavors.</li>
            <li>Not perfect but very good!</li>
            <li>I admit I was pretty hopeful about these.</li>
            <li>By experience, I&#x27;ve actually used more when in situations where I&#x27;m not talking and alone than I have when in those where I am talking and with others.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m trying to be hyper aware of what I put in my body.  </li>
            <li>Most last from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m</li>
            <li>they really help!</li>
            <li>I take two tablets and stick them next to top teeth in the rear.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products in the 20 months since I finished radiation and these are the only things that work.</li>
            <li>enough and four more words.</li>
            <li>It worked on the first night.</li>
            <li>My bedroom is hot, so I&#x27;ve a fan on in summer and winter.  </li>
            <li>These really help!  </li>
            <li>I use them while at work for a flavorful mint without the sugar...why not fight drymouth,breath issues,fight cavities and germs all in one step!By the way..I am very conservative in  my spending and feel these are really worth the .22/mint.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite these minor problems, this is the most effective solution that I&#x27;ve found to night time dry mouth</li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite these minor problems, this is the most effective solution that I&#x27;ve found to night time dry mouth problems.</li>
            <li>Great for dry mouth caused by medications, especially at night.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read great reviews for this product, especially for cancer patients who have had head and neck radiation and is dealing with dry mouth.</li>
            <li>My throat and mouth used to get extremely dry at night, but these really help with no sugars, and adhere nicely to my gums without discomfort.</li>
            <li>Sure, I woke up with a minty slime that was hard to get out of my [[ASIN:B0036WTV2C dental protector]], but it was better than feeling like I had sand in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are the best solution for dry mouth problems (especially sleeping at night or public speaking).  </li>
            <li>I started using these melts several months ago and was so happy that they really helped with my dry mouth issues.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m likely not needing them as much when alone, just am more aware of the desire not to have a dry mouth or will rub my tongue against them and make them melt more swiftly.  </li>
            <li>The main problem is finding the right place so that my apnea gear doesn&#x27;t press against the tablet.  </li>
            <li>After trying all of the Bioteen products for Burning Mouth Syndrome, this is the first real relief I&#x27;ve gotten.  </li>
            <li>I pretty much put them anywhere in my mouth and just roll them around,</li>
            <li>My dentist gave me a sample of XYLIMELTS and from the first night my husband felt they really worked.  </li>
            <li>I also haven&#x27;t tried the other brand of these I&#x27;ve seen at CVS, only because it has many more ingredients in it</li>
            <li>These mints work better for dry mouth than anything else I have found.  </li>
            <li>One of these per night alleviates most of my dry mouth.</li>
            <li>My mom orders these for her chronic dry mouth, she said she has tried EVERYTHING and these offer the most relief.</li>
            <li>The dry mouth is definitely better</li>
            <li>My wife is very particular about ingredients and found nothing she was concerned about for me in this product.</li>
            <li>Says they certainly provide oral moisture.</li>
            <li>With the current market for dry mouth sufferers right now, these XyliMelts are just hands down the best you can get.</li>
            <li>I suffered  dry mouth for more than 8yrs and could not sleep much .Somehow  </li>
            <li>here&#x27;s where I hail XyliMelts as the savior to dry mouth (which is good for potential buyers because I&#x27;m not a one time review robot that plugs the products incessantly for their company, but that&#x27;s another rant for another day).</li>
            <li>I wish they were less expensive but the best costs more.</li>
            <li>but essentially my upper gums/teeth are so dry that I can&#x27;t lift my gums up to smile effectively.</li>
            <li>Had cancer surgery and Radiation that messed up my salivary glands etc,  always had very dry mouth and tried many products like Biotene.  </li>
            <li>I find it hard to find in stock at Rite Aid or Walgreens and have ended up with product that isn&#x27;t as good when I try what they have in stock.  </li>
            <li>Biotene Dry Mouth Toothpaste, Fresh Mint Original, 4.5-Ounce Box (Pack of 4)]]</li>
            <li>Great, but my still a bit dry due to food &amp; environmental allergies...</li>
            <li>Glad I tried them, not much else really helped.</li>
            <li>To my surprise I slept straight 6hrs.</li>
            <li>This product really helps.</li>
            <li>So thanks to XyliMelts &amp; Amazon.com</li>
            <li>B002KAOAUE Biotene Mouth Spray, Gentle Mint, 1.5-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]], and [[ASIN:B001ET7I6U</li>
            <li>To the bathroom all night!These really work and</li>
            <li>there is no way I could justify spending so much</li>
            <li>Very helpful.</li>
            <li>I ended up needing pilocarpine because I have Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome, and that has really helped.</li>
            <li>I use Xylimelts at night and they really help to keep my mouth moist.  </li>
            <li>Very clandestine- sometimes</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable to.</li>
            <li>These tablets really solved that.  </li>
            <li>Keeps mouth from drying up too much.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Nothing had really worked before.  </li>
            <li>They really take care of the problem.</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s dentist wants my husband to use this before he puts on his BiPAP each night.  </li>
            <li>They really do adhere and stay put.</li>
            <li>they do work very well.</li>
            <li>an idea of how much might be used to try and relieve</li>
            <li>Yesterday I was out and in a 6 hour time period filled with constant conversation, I used 3.  </li>
            <li>Its doesn&#x27;t really help to well.</li>
            <li>I HAVE SAVED SO MUCH MONEY IN DENTAL BILLS.  </li>
            <li>SO MUCH EASIER,</li>
            <li>i really could not sleep at night without them.....</li>
            <li>It really helps keep my mouth from getting parched.  </li>
            <li>These really help.</li>
            <li>I use these along with biotene, and it&#x27;s really helped.</li>
            <li>I recommended then to my sister who absolutely loves them</li>
            <li>And the price is really steep.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have allergies (no concerns about ingredients)</li>
            <li>For anyone who knows what it&#x27;s like to have your CPAP machine remove every molecule of water from your mouth (despite the machine&#x27;s humidifier), I think this is real progress.</li>
            <li>night 20, my teeth straight up hurt.</li>
            <li>Between this and ACT mouthwash he is receiving much needed relief.</li>
            <li>These work really well</li>
            <li>This product has been very helpful to me at night.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I wish it lasted a whole 7 or 8 hours but</li>
            <li>These work very well</li>
            <li>And then the mint that &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; from them, doesn&#x27;t really do anything for me.</li>
            <li>My dentist is extremely good, has extra credentials thru the military and is my son.  </li>
            <li>I now wake up in the morning with a moist mouth and a pleasant yet, subtle mint taste.  </li>
            <li>Originally I would only use it at night during sleep</li>
            <li>And the added benefit is it helps my normally smelly breath!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other products to relieve this condition, no others were palatable.&lt;br /&gt;XyliMelts</li>
            <li>Works better than other products I have tried.</li>
            <li>After that it&#x27;s fine, as long as you don&#x27;t fool with it with your tongue.</li>
            <li>Really works for dry mouth problems; far better than Biotene, etc.</li>
            <li>DURING THE DAY, IT IS DIFFICULT TO HAVE A CONVERSATION, BUT THESE WONDERFUL, LITTLE MINTS HAVE MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE FOR ME.  </li>
            <li>With regular health care costs higher and higher,  </li>
            <li>I would go as far as to say that for me, this will be life changing in a positive way.  </li>
            <li>My mouth is dry and these little mints help keep my mouth comfortable and healthy.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to raise the humidifier too high because it just causes condensation in the tube.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended by my dentist.  </li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND XYLIMELTS FOR ANYONE USING A C-PAP.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you have the condition.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them for over a year and highly recommend them.  </li>
            <li>These are the only little tabs that work,  Put in your mouth when you go to bed and your mouth stays moist all night, wonderful little tabs.</li>
            <li>For my dad to make such compliments is rare.</li>
            <li>The ingredients in these mints immediately made my teeth ache, and I don&#x27;t have especially sensitive teeth, just the normal sensitivity of a 70 year old.</li>
            <li>While they don&#x27;t seem to last as long, most do make it through the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Xylimelts contain only Xylitol, vegetable gum, cellulose gum, stearate of calcium/magnesium and mild natural peppermint.</li>
            <li>This is my third order of Xylimelts Mints that I have purchased and I am so glad that there is a product like this available for people like me who suffer extreme dry mouth.  </li>
            <li>However this mint does seem to stay secure at other locations.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I need to pop a new one in midway through the night</li>
            <li>They do not get rid of my dry mouth completely, but they do lessen it to a significant degree.  </li>
            <li>However, a box of 80 Ora-Health domed mints lasts about 80 days compared to about two weeks for a small (1.5 Oz) tube (the only size available) of Biotene OralBalance for only $3-$4 more.</li>
            <li>However do not use more than 4 melts in one day as excessive use can cause gastric upset.</li>
            <li>I recently tried Xylimelts for the first time.  </li>
            <li>This is a first in about 15 years, so I am definitely sold on XyliMelts.</li>
            <li>at my last checkup, and the three tablets I had worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>But I do also have that severe of a dry mouth and am very aware and sensitive to it,</li>
            <li>My husband has dry mouth from medications he takes, so Xylimelts is the only way he can sleep comfortably at night without periodically waking to sip water.</li>
            <li>Living in the desert simply makes dry mouth a more regular occurrence for me.  </li>
            <li>I purchased these for my Mother who is 93 and was suffering from a dry mouth at night so much so that she was very wakeful all thru the night and had to drink water frequently which disturbed her sleep.</li>
            <li>I did some limited trial methods while awake and finally decided it would be safe enough under the tongue.</li>
            <li>This is the second large order I have placed for Orahealth Xylimelts Mints.  </li>
            <li>I also like that I can order a large box of these at a time vs.a smaller quantity at the store.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s been able to eat things he had a hard time eating before.     </li>
            <li>I have continuous dry mouth due to the many medications I take.  </li>
            <li>long as I don&#x27;t have any unforeseen long-term reactions to this product, it is hands down the best thing I have found when it comes to chronic dry mouth due to medical conditions and medications.  </li>
            <li>Benefit, I&#x27;m now able to sleep in late in the morning</li>
            <li>Their products are complete garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The very longest I had one last was 3 hours with the shortest being just over an hour.    </li>
            <li>The only real drawback is the expense; they are $$$$</li>
            <li>SEAMLESS TRANSACTION...</li>
            <li>Keep my mouth moist and are completely gone in the morning.  </li>
            <li>i found this product to be very helpful in the short run</li>
            <li>One tab lasts at least 2 hours, sometimes more.  </li>
            <li>My wife at night has a towel under her head near the mouth.</li>
            <li>I use 2 tabs at bed time, I sleep through the nite ,and my mouth and tongue are not dried out and stuck together when I wake up..</li>
            <li>It is the only thing that I have found that really takes care of the problem at night.</li>
            <li>Within a few seconds it is secure</li>
            <li>but so far it has worked</li>
            <li>Hoping I will keep my natural teeth longer.</li>
            <li>She said it wasn&#x27;t nearly as helpful</li>
            <li>These melts actually suction very well to the palate or the vestibule.</li>
            <li>Work really well for the entire night</li>
            <li>For a change, getting up in the middle of the night to go the the bathroom is proving to be useful, because if I need another XyliMelt when I get up, I just pop one in my mouth before getting back in bed.</li>
            <li>Now I wake up with fresh, wet mouth.</li>
            <li>Amazon was offering a certain product I had been wanting but would allow only 1 package to be purchased and furthermore, did not offer any other of the products offered by Emerald Forest at the same price with free shipping--there was another product that I wanted</li>
            <li>Most likely will continue to order as long as I have this dry mouth problem.</li>
            <li>It definitely produced some saliva, but not enough to where the XyliMelts would &amp;#34;flow&amp;#34; or taste right.</li>
            <li>I do not breathe through my mouth, but still my mouth would be so dry I couldn&#x27;t speak or swallow when I first woke up.</li>
            <li>Recommended by my dentist for dry mouth during the night, and it really helps!</li>
            <li>My dentist gave me a sample of these to combat waking up with a painfully dry mouth (thanks, Diabetes!)</li>
            <li>the mint is very mild, he usually does not like mint, but does not mind this at all.</li>
            <li>It also produced a better check up with my hygeniest with less plaque that is caused by dry</li>
            <li>Makes me sound old and creepy but its better than sleep apnea and hamring my teeth from overly dry mucous membranes</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, the original (blue bottle) Biotene has been reformulated, so unless Biotene&#x27;s new PBF formula (in the green bottle) with ingredients SIMILAR (but not identical) to the original blue Biotene formula compares, looks like I&#x27;m out of options for dry mouth.</li>
            <li>Because this is such a big deal to me, I know it is to others as well, so I will share how much I use them thus far in an effort to give anyone who might be thinking, &amp;</li>
            <li>I really like how long this moisturizers my mouth at night.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t feel comfortable anywhere in my mouth, and the last little bit stuck to the gum</li>
            <li>I can get away with using Xylitol mints and drinking extra water during the daytime, but at night, nothing I had tried lasted long enough to be really useful as far as keeping my mouth from drying out.</li>
            <li>Bought a selection of anti-dry-mouth products, after getting 2 of my 4 lifetime cavities after starting new medications.  </li>
            <li>I have Sjogrens disease (dry mouth), and this really works.</li>
            <li>Really works well with his dry mouth condition.</li>
            <li>The Xylimelt Mints really ease dry mouth.  </li>
            <li>XyliMelts really work to keep my mouth from being dry.</li>
            <li>XyliMelts really worked to solve my night dry mouth problem.</li>
            <li>Waking up in the morning with severe dry mouth is a real bummer.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much of an affect on dry mouth from use of a CPAP machine</li>
            <li>If you have dry mouth , give them a try,I hope you get as much relief as I do.</li>
            <li>I absolutely would recommend this product to anyone who has a problem with dry mouth overnight.  </li>
            <li>Very helpful for dry mouth.</li>
            <li>Really does the job of reducing dry mouth at night or anytime.  </li>
            <li>My medicine gives me dry mouth so much that I dislike meetings away from my desk knowing</li>
            <li>You can use a regular xylitol mint, but there are much cheaper choices then, as a regular mint.</li>
            <li>My mouth is so dry, that if you were to stick me in a room without something to suck on and/or some water I would start getting anxious pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, for my condition the Mint did, initially, caused a minor burning sensation, but, after the first time they no longer did.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These really work and last almost the entire night.  </li>
            <li>Normally place the Xylimelt in the left side of the mouth between cheek and gum near the back of the mouth.  </li>
            <li>These little guys stick to your gums and nicely moisten your mouth as the CPAP tries to dry you out.</li>
            <li>I did notice a slight increase in saliva production right away, but not a bothersome amount.</li>
            <li>They work really well for dry mouth!</li>
            <li>This is the only product that provided me some relief the only reason I gave it a 4 is because I end up using alot of them and the cost is too high</li>
            <li>I am a senior  citizen and at nights in particular suffer with dry  mouth.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s stuck to feels sensitive after only 2-3 minutes of having it your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li>As far as I can find there are only two products that work like this.</li>
            <li>I tried OraMoist first but the recommended one patch did not last long enough.</li>
            <li>The Zylimelts have helped me so much at night to keep my mouth wet &amp; also take my mind off the burning mouth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big boy with big teeth, but they are too big to really adhere to a tooth, and generally end up at the bottom of my mouth in the crease.&lt;br</li>
            <li>&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;These light tasting mint sticks to the roof of my mouth and slowly dissolves leaving my mouth</li>
            <li>I love the idea of having XyliMelts that adhere to the inside of my gums (Can be used on false teeth also.)</li>
            <li>I am a dental hygienist and highly recommend this product for anyone suffering from dry mouth issues.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend them for anyone battling dry mouth.</li>
            <li>Common sense tells me that a dry mouth would be more prone to harmful bacteria than a moist one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only product that really helped my wife&#x27;s dry mouth during the night.</li>
            <li>My wife get dry mouth when she has to speak publicly and these really work for her.</li>
            <li>No more available this product at any local Pharmacy stores- only on Amazon</li>
            <li>But that evening, I did the same thing, and a canker sore developed in the exact spot and lasted for a few days.  </li>
            <li>This used to cause me to wake up in the middle of the night and resulted in high dental bills due to frequent cavities.    </li>
            <li>Upper jaw, and in the far back, seems to dissolve slower than lower jaw towards the front.</li>
            <li>The only decent dry mouth product I&#x27;ve used is MedActive lozenges.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite sensitive to most fake sweeteners and this doesn&#x27;t bother me at all - no headache, no 6 hour foul aftertaste</li>
            <li>In the morning, no dry mouth.</li>
            <li>I usually like to wait to rate a product like this until I&#x27;ve had more time to see if there is a down side</li>
            <li>cup of water by the bedside to take gentle sips to reactivate the tab and for quick swallows to rinse down excessive goo in the throat is a big help.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t wake up due to a dry mouth for the first time in years.</li>
            <li>Dry mouth made me wake up early whether I wanted to or not.  </li>
            <li>It eliminated my dry mouth completely.</li>
            <li>In Dentistry we frequently recommend Xylimelts to patients for dry mouth problems.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at the results and will attest to the reduction of dry mouth condition.</li>
            <li>In addition, I can get through the day and night without the embarrassing effects of dry mouth while I am trying to talk to people while I am working, and as a sales professional, I have to talk (and listen) all day.</li>
            <li>Reading reviews for other product found that other people were using Xylimelts with success, decided to try them.  </li>
            <li>I am hoping that some  other company will come out with something for dry  mouth at a cheaper price(they should probably hurry it  up as I,m not getting any younger fast!).</li>

            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with this product!  </li>
            <li> Treatment was successful (thank you lord) and these help with the resulting mouth and throat dryness.</li>
            <li> Pleasant taste and they work.</li>
            <li> - so the experience is rather pleasant</li>
            <li> have a pleasant mint flavor while hydrating my mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is a world of difference in the way it works and it has a pleasant taste.</li>
            <li> The XyliMelts have a pleasant minty taste that I can still taste in the morning when I get</li>
            <li> I bought mine from SPEC Sales - they had the best pricing and I received my delivery very quickly.</li>
            <li> Seem to be working as promised and that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li> Good for overnight</li>
            <li> Not quite as good as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li> Good product...good service.</li>
            <li> Hopefully they are good for my teeth/crowns also.  </li>
            <li> They are that good.</li>
            <li> It tastes good and it lasted for about six hours before melting away in my mouth as I slept.  </li>
            <li> and she agreed that it was a good product for me.</li>
            <li> I am good all night.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Taste is good as well.</li>
            <li> My dentist, who&#x27;s been around the block a couple of times and has always had wise and frugal advice, recommended these to me.</li>
            <li> I loved the idea of this mint sticking in place and keeping my teeth lubricated.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a good product, but it just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> While, this is a good product, it just was not for me.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t imagine getting a good night&#x27;s sleep without XyliMelts.  </li>
            <li> It continually emits a really pleasant mint taste into the mouth, and makes it fresh and very pleasant.</li>
            <li> and he is very pleased.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> and I was very pleased  </li>
            <li> Very glad we found something to help~</li>
            <li> They are great for cotton mouth for sure.</li>
            <li> However, it took care of my problem so well that I&#x27;ve ordered more!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> The product is the best remedy I&#x27;m aware of.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad someone invented them!</li>
            <li> So glad I found these!</li>
            <li> It has literally been like magic for her!  </li>
            <li> Great for reducing the germ type that can lead to decay and making a ph positive saliva for a healthier mouth!!!</li>
            <li> These pills are great, easy to apply and they do create lots of saliva.</li>
            <li> Waking up is more pleasant, and there is no need to sip water throughout the night.</li>
            <li> I can not remember the wonderful feeling of being able to swallow when I first wake up!  </li>
            <li> XyliMelts has been an amazing help.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how it sticks to my gum inside my mouth and stays there.</li>
            <li> A mint would do just as well, but it is handy to have for a while during the time is does stick.  </li>
            <li> nice to wake up with a moist mouth</li>
            <li> However, they are extremely effective for patients who are being treated for Cancer and for autoimmune problems.  </li>
            <li> It does kind of &amp;#34;gum up&amp;#34; my invisalign trays.</li>
            <li> They are effective for the rest of the night.</li>
            <li> I had tried another popular product, but didn&#x27;t get the results that Orahealth Xylimelts gave me.</li>
            <li> Great product, great delivery service, reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Nice alternative to keeping your mouth moist.  </li>
            <li> Made with xylitol makes me feel better since I have read research showing xylitol is good for preventing cavities.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know how effective it might be for that purpose.</li>
            <li> It has a nice mint flavor and helps keep the mouth moist.</li>
            <li> They sit nicely wherever you want them</li>
            <li> Work really well and have a pleasant taste!</li>
            <li> They are much more effective than the baking soda rinses the physicians recommend.</li>
            <li> I love these for when I cannot have water handy.  </li>
            <li> He has tried other &amp;#34;solutions,&amp;#34; but these work the best and are the most pleasant to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These help tremendously!!</li>
            <li> I liked this best out of the non-prescription helps to a very dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Truly Refreshing.  </li>
            <li> I am getting better dental check-ups.</li>
            <li> That way, when i wake up from a good night&#x27;s sleep my mouth would still be fresh and moist.</li>
            <li> I find them helpful and refreshing during the day and even overnight.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended that I try these, and I am glad he did.  </li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> but it cost more</li>
            <li> I tried just about everything, and this helped the most.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been giving them to all my friends and they love them, too, and I&#x27;ve just ordered more for myself, since I&#x27;ve been giving so many away to my friends.  </li>
            <li> Because I wish it were better.  </li>
            <li> would be better if didn&#x27;t stick to part of mouth.  </li>
            <li> For me, one tab nightly lasts most of the night.  </li>
            <li> Many of them use it now.</li>
            <li> and I can sleep so much better.</li>
            <li> They love it, too.</li>
            <li> It is better than chomping on gum to freshen your breath.</li>
            <li> I will buy more when I run out.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you get the Mint.  </li>
            <li> And the price is certainly better than the gels I&#x27;ve tried (</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more today.</li>
            <li> And the chemo worked! :-)</li>
            <li> Placing a XyliMelts tab on my gums after dinner creates more saliva which helps my digestion.</li>
            <li> They seem to work best when I sleep  on my back.</li>
            <li> They sure get the job done.</li>
            <li> Glad to have gotten a sample from my dentist.</li>
            <li> better than anything else ve tried</li>
            <li> We have tried so many products, spray and rinses and nothing worked.  </li>
            <li> so perhaps I want my mouth to be more moist than some.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the mint free type yet, but will be ordering some of those soon as I would prefer mint free if they work just as good.  </li>
            <li> While that doesn&#x27;t take care of all my concerns, it takes care of some of the biggest and is certainly better than what I had been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I stopped using two at a time and found that one at a time worked better.</li>
            <li> THAT I HAD FOR  MANY YEARS.</li>
            <li> AND THEY ARE ALL IN AGREEMENT THAT THIS IS AN EXCELLANT, SAFE, AND NESSESARY  </li>
            <li> Love these things.</li>
            <li> really work well and what a great idea.</li>
            <li> It is the better than Biotiine products for oral dryness.  </li>
            <li> They are still better than competitive products.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipper</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brands and Xylimelts</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with Biotene Gel and seems to work better.</li>
            <li> Works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Keep my mouth comfortably moist all night!</li>
            <li> they make my life better</li>
            <li> I have been pleased as punch.</li>
            <li> Also refreshing.</li>
            <li> I was about to go to the dentist, but decided to stop using Xylimelts to make sure it wasn&#x27;t the cause.</li>
            <li> Love how it &amp;#34;sticks&amp;#34; to your mouth.</li>
            <li> I buy these mints for a relative who says they are wonderful.</li>
            <li> I use them mostly at night.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to be able to sleep 7 hours straight.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with them</li>
            <li> Did ok for the moisture</li>
            <li> I found greater result with just chewing Xylitol gum, which induced saliva production and didn&#x27;t give that pasty taste/feeling in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I really love the taste of these mints.</li>
            <li> so would be safe for night time..</li>
            <li> I love the research that spoke of doctors using these for antibacterial properties before pt.s</li>
            <li> sure help the burning in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Love the service that Orahelath promotes.  </li>
            <li> They work better than anything I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Has worked well most of the time in the evening and night.  </li>
            <li> was so glad to find them on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I love these.  </li>
            <li> Works Great, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> But pretty good.</li>
            <li> I am so happy that my new dentist recommended Xylimelts to me.</li>

            <li> The best for dry mouth!</li>
            <li> I  thank my dentist mentally every morning for recommending this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that they are most comfortable when I stick them to the roof of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other things, but this is the best.  </li>
            <li> it is easy and Xylimelts keep my mouth moist for the day.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> So easy to use and one tablet lasts all night,  </li>
            <li> and I have told others about how easy it is to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s neither sweet nor minty, but tastes more like a Tums.</li>
            <li> These tabs are very good for anyone with dry mouth.</li>
            <li> attached one to my lower gum, and it worked fine.</li>
            <li> and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They have a pleasant taste - I chose the natural flavor.  </li>
            <li> awesome product for people using CPAP with dry mouth problems Highly recommend this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> Great product that will help so many people that suffer with dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Yet, that&#x27;s effective and this is probably one of the more effective products I&#x27;ve used for dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I just wish it lasted a little longer; then it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> The Xylimelts make a huge difference in his sleeping comfort.  </li>
            <li> anywhere in the mouth that is comfortable.</li>
            <li> The Xylimelts are fantastic for healing and preventing mouth ulcers and sores.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the ultimate, GREAT breath mint, also.</li>
            <li> These mints have allowed me to literally smile more again.</li>
            <li> I was not producing any saliva at all, therefore no moisture was available to dissolve the tablets.  </li>
            <li> Worth a try for sure.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have a CPAP, but I also enjoy Xylimelts when I sleep.  </li>
            <li> They stick lightly to areas in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> Works great for public speaking and job interviews too!</li>
            <li> Fortunately, the AutoPAP has a humidification unit coupled with a heated hose.  </li>
            <li> My dentists had some free samples.</li>
            <li> This time, I ordered 3 boxes at once to take advantage of free shipping.  </li>
            <li> This product is GREAT, creates saliva flow, and helps me fall back to sleep when my CPAP machine dries out my mouth and wakes me up.  </li>
            <li> Since a friend&#x27;s dentist gave her some XyliMelts samples and she shared with me, I have slept through comfortably.  </li>
            <li> I use them primarily</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like sugary foods, you won&#x27;t enjoy the flavour of these.  </li>
            <li> It is also notable that I have experienced no irritation or other side effects from their use.</li>
            <li> The melt lasts an hour, two if you are very calm (asleep or not talking/moving the mouth).</li>
            <li> , all these products are pleasant tasting and promote fresh breath so you can be comfortable getting up close and personal :-)</li>
            <li> The first time he used them, he fell in love with them.</li>
            <li> For the first 6 hours or so, they sort of moisten my mouth - more like gargling with a gel toothpaste or something.  </li>
            <li> but so worth it!</li>
            <li> but still worth it!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t make the mistake of ordering the original (the one with the picture of the tree bark on the box).  </li>
            <li> and I wake up with minty fresh breath!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen these in any local stores, but if they were available, I doubt that the prices would be as good as they are on Amazon.</li>
            <li> THEY WORK GREAT FOR DRY MOUTH.  </li>
            <li> Then I tried the XyliMelts and found that I liked them better in that they did not produce the same stickiness.</li>
            <li> These are great during the day preventing dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Great for dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> These are great for dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> I suffer greatly from dry mouth...</li>
            <li> Sometimes my mouth is slightly dry when I wake up,but really great making it through the night.  </li>
            <li> These are a great option to control breath issues as well even if you dont suffer from dry mouth.</li>
            <li> They leave you with a very nice feeling, especially knowing that they make my dad smile.</li>
            <li> Great for dry mouth even at night!</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as expected and at great price.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll notice that you, once again, have the correct balance of mucus and saliva in your mouth that is important to taste, feel and everything else you need to keep your mouth and tongue feeling fresh and moist.</li>
            <li> If you are a mouth breather and use a full face mask, be prepared for additional  cleaning in the morning</li>
            <li> and it was ok really sticks to gums.</li>
            <li> It seems to need a full 20 seconds of holding the mint there for it to stick well.</li>
            <li> My greatest hope is that with continued use, the decay/destruction of my teeth will either slow, or cease.</li>
            <li> The non-peppermint ones have a slightly sweet almost vanilla flavor, so I know that there&#x27;s something in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I only get fair results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;During the day is really dependent upon what I&#x27;m doing as to how many I use.  </li>
            <li> He uses a full face c-pap mask,while I use a nasal mask.</li>
            <li> I love them so  much I will occassionally share..</li>
            <li> Xylimelts have a pleasant, minty taste that lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I wish it did not dissolve so quickly.</li>
            <li> If your mouth is open much when you sleep theses help great.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these. : )</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like super sweet minty, feels like I&#x27;ve been chewing fresh gum all night.  </li>
            <li> my husband has dry mouth syndrome and this works; he has tried many other gums; sprays and this is the best.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> I like everything about the Mints: they ease my continual dry mouth, they taste good and they sit on my gum while I talk or sing and don&#x27;t get in my way.  </li>
            <li> A good product, recommended by my dentist, for dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> so a great product all wrapped up into one super little mint.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> This is a terrific product for helping to alleviate the dry mouth; in fact it is excellent.</li>
            <li> Love, love this product for helping to relieve my dry mouth at night.  </li>
            <li> In my experience, they don&#x27;t last the whole night, but the taste is pleasant, and if you use two at a time they work</li>
            <li> I much prefer the mint ones to the mint free ones.</li>
            <li> product also, allegedly, promotes good oral health; an allegation I believe.</li>
            <li> Yeah, kind of gross.</li>
            <li> When I sleep with these, although they are gone when I wake, my mouth is relieved, moist and fresh.</li>
            <li> That alone has been worth the price of these things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are FAR BETTER than any Biotene product.  </li>
            <li> I consider it a bonus that it gives me fresh breath.</li>
            <li> Disolves slowly, tastes great and gum side adheres to cheek comfortably.</li>
            <li> Once my wisdom tooth extraction is healed (fun experience after 40)  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I ordered there here and found delivery speedy and continuing use a success.</li>
            <li> But it is worth it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;By night 14, I noticed my teeth felt much more sensitive, even though I was paying attention and rotating where I was putting the tablet each night.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the money and have put it on my subscribe and save</li>
            <li> This product is a great help for those with dry mouth; it&#x27;s easy to use, especially when you&#x27;re on the go</li>
            <li> Both mornings so far, I woke up with a pleasant minty taste in my mouth and no dry mouth.</li>
            <li> These are far better than nothing, but far less than ideal too.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my mouth moist for a couple of hours and the price is right .</li>
            <li> You should get some right away.</li>
            <li> THE RIGHT WAY IT HAS BEEN</li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> I pop it into my mouth right before I get into bed and position it where I want it to stick.  </li>
            <li> , I jumped right in and bought the 80-pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> wow, these are great for some of us with dry mouth....</li>
            <li> These mints are really good and really work with dry  mouth</li>
            <li> I have used the non minty ones in the past and they were great, but</li>
            <li> Unlike most of the reviews I&#x27;ve read, I do seem to go through a few more at night and during the day than what I read.  </li>
            <li> These are the best mints for dry mouth, hands down.</li>
            <li> Xylimelts answers a real need!  </li>
            <li> I ordered it to complete a free shipping order.    </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re suppose to last for most of the night.     </li>
            <li> More dependent on your personal comfort with the placement.</li>
            <li> At first, I was worried about swallowing it at night while sleeping</li>
            <li> /&gt;They&#x27;re also pretty nifty when I have to teach training classes for my job.  </li>
            <li> But, I had to take the Biotene pretty often during the night.</li>
            <li> This was not my first order for these.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried gels and still wake during the mouth barely able to open my mouth.  </li>
            <li> The only thing she wishes is that they had more flavors.</li>
            <li> Not perfect but very good!</li>
            <li> I admit I was pretty hopeful about these.</li>
            <li> By experience, I&#x27;ve actually used more when in situations where I&#x27;m not talking and alone than I have when in those where I am talking and with others.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m trying to be hyper aware of what I put in my body.  </li>
            <li> Most last from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m</li>
            <li> they really help!</li>
            <li> I take two tablets and stick them next to top teeth in the rear.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products in the 20 months since I finished radiation and these are the only things that work.</li>
            <li> enough and four more words.</li>
            <li> It worked on the first night.</li>
            <li> My bedroom is hot, so I&#x27;ve a fan on in summer and winter.  </li>
            <li> These really help!  </li>
            <li> I use them while at work for a flavorful mint without the sugar...why not fight drymouth,breath issues,fight cavities and germs all in one step!By the way..I am very conservative in  my spending and feel these are really worth the .22/mint.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite these minor problems, this is the most effective solution that I&#x27;ve found to night time dry mouth</li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite these minor problems, this is the most effective solution that I&#x27;ve found to night time dry mouth problems.</li>
            <li> Great for dry mouth caused by medications, especially at night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read great reviews for this product, especially for cancer patients who have had head and neck radiation and is dealing with dry mouth.</li>
            <li> My throat and mouth used to get extremely dry at night, but these really help with no sugars, and adhere nicely to my gums without discomfort.</li>
            <li> Sure, I woke up with a minty slime that was hard to get out of my [[ASIN:B0036WTV2C dental protector]], but it was better than feeling like I had sand in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are the best solution for dry mouth problems (especially sleeping at night or public speaking).  </li>
            <li> I started using these melts several months ago and was so happy that they really helped with my dry mouth issues.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m likely not needing them as much when alone, just am more aware of the desire not to have a dry mouth or will rub my tongue against them and make them melt more swiftly.  </li>
            <li> The main problem is finding the right place so that my apnea gear doesn&#x27;t press against the tablet.  </li>
            <li> After trying all of the Bioteen products for Burning Mouth Syndrome, this is the first real relief I&#x27;ve gotten.  </li>
            <li> I pretty much put them anywhere in my mouth and just roll them around,</li>
            <li> My dentist gave me a sample of XYLIMELTS and from the first night my husband felt they really worked.  </li>
            <li> I also haven&#x27;t tried the other brand of these I&#x27;ve seen at CVS, only because it has many more ingredients in it</li>
            <li> These mints work better for dry mouth than anything else I have found.  </li>
            <li> One of these per night alleviates most of my dry mouth.</li>
            <li> My mom orders these for her chronic dry mouth, she said she has tried EVERYTHING and these offer the most relief.</li>
            <li> The dry mouth is definitely better</li>
            <li> My wife is very particular about ingredients and found nothing she was concerned about for me in this product.</li>
            <li> Says they certainly provide oral moisture.</li>
            <li> With the current market for dry mouth sufferers right now, these XyliMelts are just hands down the best you can get.</li>
            <li> I suffered  dry mouth for more than 8yrs and could not sleep much .Somehow  </li>
            <li> here&#x27;s where I hail XyliMelts as the savior to dry mouth (which is good for potential buyers because I&#x27;m not a one time review robot that plugs the products incessantly for their company, but that&#x27;s another rant for another day).</li>
            <li> I wish they were less expensive but the best costs more.</li>
            <li> but essentially my upper gums/teeth are so dry that I can&#x27;t lift my gums up to smile effectively.</li>
            <li> Had cancer surgery and Radiation that messed up my salivary glands etc,  always had very dry mouth and tried many products like Biotene.  </li>
            <li> I find it hard to find in stock at Rite Aid or Walgreens and have ended up with product that isn&#x27;t as good when I try what they have in stock.  </li>
            <li> Biotene Dry Mouth Toothpaste, Fresh Mint Original, 4.5-Ounce Box (Pack of 4)]]</li>
            <li> Great, but my still a bit dry due to food &amp; environmental allergies...</li>
            <li> Glad I tried them, not much else really helped.</li>
            <li> To my surprise I slept straight 6hrs.</li>
            <li> This product really helps.</li>
            <li> So thanks to XyliMelts &amp; Amazon.com</li>
            <li> B002KAOAUE Biotene Mouth Spray, Gentle Mint, 1.5-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]], and [[ASIN:B001ET7I6U</li>
            <li> To the bathroom all night!These really work and</li>
            <li> there is no way I could justify spending so much</li>
            <li> Very helpful.</li>
            <li> I ended up needing pilocarpine because I have Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome, and that has really helped.</li>
            <li> I use Xylimelts at night and they really help to keep my mouth moist.  </li>
            <li> Very clandestine- sometimes</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable to.</li>
            <li> These tablets really solved that.  </li>
            <li> Keeps mouth from drying up too much.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Nothing had really worked before.  </li>
            <li> They really take care of the problem.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s dentist wants my husband to use this before he puts on his BiPAP each night.  </li>
            <li> They really do adhere and stay put.</li>
            <li> they do work very well.</li>
            <li> an idea of how much might be used to try and relieve</li>
            <li> Yesterday I was out and in a 6 hour time period filled with constant conversation, I used 3.  </li>
            <li> Its doesn&#x27;t really help to well.</li>
            <li> I HAVE SAVED SO MUCH MONEY IN DENTAL BILLS.  </li>
            <li> SO MUCH EASIER,</li>
            <li> i really could not sleep at night without them.....</li>
            <li> It really helps keep my mouth from getting parched.  </li>
            <li> These really help.</li>
            <li> I use these along with biotene, and it&#x27;s really helped.</li>
            <li> I recommended then to my sister who absolutely loves them</li>
            <li> And the price is really steep.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have allergies (no concerns about ingredients)</li>
            <li> For anyone who knows what it&#x27;s like to have your CPAP machine remove every molecule of water from your mouth (despite the machine&#x27;s humidifier), I think this is real progress.</li>
            <li> night 20, my teeth straight up hurt.</li>
            <li> Between this and ACT mouthwash he is receiving much needed relief.</li>
            <li> These work really well</li>
            <li> This product has been very helpful to me at night.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I wish it lasted a whole 7 or 8 hours but</li>
            <li> These work very well</li>
            <li> And then the mint that &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; from them, doesn&#x27;t really do anything for me.</li>
            <li> My dentist is extremely good, has extra credentials thru the military and is my son.  </li>
            <li> I now wake up in the morning with a moist mouth and a pleasant yet, subtle mint taste.  </li>
            <li> Originally I would only use it at night during sleep</li>
            <li> And the added benefit is it helps my normally smelly breath!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other products to relieve this condition, no others were palatable.&lt;br /&gt;XyliMelts</li>
            <li> Works better than other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> After that it&#x27;s fine, as long as you don&#x27;t fool with it with your tongue.</li>
            <li> Really works for dry mouth problems; far better than Biotene, etc.</li>
            <li> DURING THE DAY, IT IS DIFFICULT TO HAVE A CONVERSATION, BUT THESE WONDERFUL, LITTLE MINTS HAVE MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE FOR ME.  </li>
            <li> With regular health care costs higher and higher,  </li>
            <li> I would go as far as to say that for me, this will be life changing in a positive way.  </li>
            <li> My mouth is dry and these little mints help keep my mouth comfortable and healthy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to raise the humidifier too high because it just causes condensation in the tube.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended by my dentist.  </li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND XYLIMELTS FOR ANYONE USING A C-PAP.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you have the condition.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them for over a year and highly recommend them.  </li>
            <li> These are the only little tabs that work,  Put in your mouth when you go to bed and your mouth stays moist all night, wonderful little tabs.</li>
            <li> For my dad to make such compliments is rare.</li>
            <li> The ingredients in these mints immediately made my teeth ache, and I don&#x27;t have especially sensitive teeth, just the normal sensitivity of a 70 year old.</li>
            <li> While they don&#x27;t seem to last as long, most do make it through the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Xylimelts contain only Xylitol, vegetable gum, cellulose gum, stearate of calcium/magnesium and mild natural peppermint.</li>
            <li> This is my third order of Xylimelts Mints that I have purchased and I am so glad that there is a product like this available for people like me who suffer extreme dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> However this mint does seem to stay secure at other locations.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I need to pop a new one in midway through the night</li>
            <li> They do not get rid of my dry mouth completely, but they do lessen it to a significant degree.  </li>
            <li> However, a box of 80 Ora-Health domed mints lasts about 80 days compared to about two weeks for a small (1.5 Oz) tube (the only size available) of Biotene OralBalance for only $3-$4 more.</li>
            <li> However do not use more than 4 melts in one day as excessive use can cause gastric upset.</li>
            <li> I recently tried Xylimelts for the first time.  </li>
            <li> This is a first in about 15 years, so I am definitely sold on XyliMelts.</li>
            <li> at my last checkup, and the three tablets I had worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> But I do also have that severe of a dry mouth and am very aware and sensitive to it,</li>
            <li> My husband has dry mouth from medications he takes, so Xylimelts is the only way he can sleep comfortably at night without periodically waking to sip water.</li>
            <li> Living in the desert simply makes dry mouth a more regular occurrence for me.  </li>
            <li> I purchased these for my Mother who is 93 and was suffering from a dry mouth at night so much so that she was very wakeful all thru the night and had to drink water frequently which disturbed her sleep.</li>
            <li> I did some limited trial methods while awake and finally decided it would be safe enough under the tongue.</li>
            <li> This is the second large order I have placed for Orahealth Xylimelts Mints.  </li>
            <li> I also like that I can order a large box of these at a time vs.a smaller quantity at the store.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been able to eat things he had a hard time eating before.     </li>
            <li> I have continuous dry mouth due to the many medications I take.  </li>
            <li> long as I don&#x27;t have any unforeseen long-term reactions to this product, it is hands down the best thing I have found when it comes to chronic dry mouth due to medical conditions and medications.  </li>
            <li> Benefit, I&#x27;m now able to sleep in late in the morning</li>
            <li> Their products are complete garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The very longest I had one last was 3 hours with the shortest being just over an hour.    </li>
            <li> The only real drawback is the expense; they are $$$$</li>
            <li> SEAMLESS TRANSACTION...</li>
            <li> Keep my mouth moist and are completely gone in the morning.  </li>
            <li> i found this product to be very helpful in the short run</li>
            <li> One tab lasts at least 2 hours, sometimes more.  </li>
            <li> My wife at night has a towel under her head near the mouth.</li>
            <li> I use 2 tabs at bed time, I sleep through the nite ,and my mouth and tongue are not dried out and stuck together when I wake up..</li>
            <li> It is the only thing that I have found that really takes care of the problem at night.</li>
            <li> Within a few seconds it is secure</li>
            <li> but so far it has worked</li>
            <li> Hoping I will keep my natural teeth longer.</li>
            <li> She said it wasn&#x27;t nearly as helpful</li>
            <li> These melts actually suction very well to the palate or the vestibule.</li>
            <li> Work really well for the entire night</li>
            <li> For a change, getting up in the middle of the night to go the the bathroom is proving to be useful, because if I need another XyliMelt when I get up, I just pop one in my mouth before getting back in bed.</li>
            <li> Now I wake up with fresh, wet mouth.</li>
            <li> Amazon was offering a certain product I had been wanting but would allow only 1 package to be purchased and furthermore, did not offer any other of the products offered by Emerald Forest at the same price with free shipping--there was another product that I wanted</li>
            <li> Most likely will continue to order as long as I have this dry mouth problem.</li>
            <li> It definitely produced some saliva, but not enough to where the XyliMelts would &amp;#34;flow&amp;#34; or taste right.</li>
            <li> I do not breathe through my mouth, but still my mouth would be so dry I couldn&#x27;t speak or swallow when I first woke up.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist for dry mouth during the night, and it really helps!</li>
            <li> My dentist gave me a sample of these to combat waking up with a painfully dry mouth (thanks, Diabetes!)</li>
            <li> the mint is very mild, he usually does not like mint, but does not mind this at all.</li>
            <li> It also produced a better check up with my hygeniest with less plaque that is caused by dry</li>
            <li> Makes me sound old and creepy but its better than sleep apnea and hamring my teeth from overly dry mucous membranes</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, the original (blue bottle) Biotene has been reformulated, so unless Biotene&#x27;s new PBF formula (in the green bottle) with ingredients SIMILAR (but not identical) to the original blue Biotene formula compares, looks like I&#x27;m out of options for dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Because this is such a big deal to me, I know it is to others as well, so I will share how much I use them thus far in an effort to give anyone who might be thinking, &amp;</li>
            <li> I really like how long this moisturizers my mouth at night.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t feel comfortable anywhere in my mouth, and the last little bit stuck to the gum</li>
            <li> I can get away with using Xylitol mints and drinking extra water during the daytime, but at night, nothing I had tried lasted long enough to be really useful as far as keeping my mouth from drying out.</li>
            <li> Bought a selection of anti-dry-mouth products, after getting 2 of my 4 lifetime cavities after starting new medications.  </li>
            <li> I have Sjogrens disease (dry mouth), and this really works.</li>
            <li> Really works well with his dry mouth condition.</li>
            <li> The Xylimelt Mints really ease dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> XyliMelts really work to keep my mouth from being dry.</li>
            <li> XyliMelts really worked to solve my night dry mouth problem.</li>
            <li> Waking up in the morning with severe dry mouth is a real bummer.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much of an affect on dry mouth from use of a CPAP machine</li>
            <li> If you have dry mouth , give them a try,I hope you get as much relief as I do.</li>
            <li> I absolutely would recommend this product to anyone who has a problem with dry mouth overnight.  </li>
            <li> Very helpful for dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Really does the job of reducing dry mouth at night or anytime.  </li>
            <li> My medicine gives me dry mouth so much that I dislike meetings away from my desk knowing</li>
            <li> You can use a regular xylitol mint, but there are much cheaper choices then, as a regular mint.</li>
            <li> My mouth is so dry, that if you were to stick me in a room without something to suck on and/or some water I would start getting anxious pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, for my condition the Mint did, initially, caused a minor burning sensation, but, after the first time they no longer did.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These really work and last almost the entire night.  </li>
            <li> Normally place the Xylimelt in the left side of the mouth between cheek and gum near the back of the mouth.  </li>
            <li> These little guys stick to your gums and nicely moisten your mouth as the CPAP tries to dry you out.</li>
            <li> I did notice a slight increase in saliva production right away, but not a bothersome amount.</li>
            <li> They work really well for dry mouth!</li>
            <li> This is the only product that provided me some relief the only reason I gave it a 4 is because I end up using alot of them and the cost is too high</li>
            <li> I am a senior  citizen and at nights in particular suffer with dry  mouth.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s stuck to feels sensitive after only 2-3 minutes of having it your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li> As far as I can find there are only two products that work like this.</li>
            <li> I tried OraMoist first but the recommended one patch did not last long enough.</li>
            <li> The Zylimelts have helped me so much at night to keep my mouth wet &amp; also take my mind off the burning mouth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big boy with big teeth, but they are too big to really adhere to a tooth, and generally end up at the bottom of my mouth in the crease.&lt;br</li>
            <li> &#x27;&lt;br /&gt;These light tasting mint sticks to the roof of my mouth and slowly dissolves leaving my mouth</li>
            <li> I love the idea of having XyliMelts that adhere to the inside of my gums (Can be used on false teeth also.)</li>
            <li> I am a dental hygienist and highly recommend this product for anyone suffering from dry mouth issues.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend them for anyone battling dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Common sense tells me that a dry mouth would be more prone to harmful bacteria than a moist one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only product that really helped my wife&#x27;s dry mouth during the night.</li>
            <li> My wife get dry mouth when she has to speak publicly and these really work for her.</li>
            <li> No more available this product at any local Pharmacy stores- only on Amazon</li>
            <li> But that evening, I did the same thing, and a canker sore developed in the exact spot and lasted for a few days.  </li>
            <li> This used to cause me to wake up in the middle of the night and resulted in high dental bills due to frequent cavities.    </li>
            <li> Upper jaw, and in the far back, seems to dissolve slower than lower jaw towards the front.</li>
            <li> The only decent dry mouth product I&#x27;ve used is MedActive lozenges.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite sensitive to most fake sweeteners and this doesn&#x27;t bother me at all - no headache, no 6 hour foul aftertaste</li>
            <li> In the morning, no dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I usually like to wait to rate a product like this until I&#x27;ve had more time to see if there is a down side</li>
            <li> cup of water by the bedside to take gentle sips to reactivate the tab and for quick swallows to rinse down excessive goo in the throat is a big help.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t wake up due to a dry mouth for the first time in years.</li>
            <li> Dry mouth made me wake up early whether I wanted to or not.  </li>
            <li> It eliminated my dry mouth completely.</li>
            <li> In Dentistry we frequently recommend Xylimelts to patients for dry mouth problems.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at the results and will attest to the reduction of dry mouth condition.</li>
            <li> In addition, I can get through the day and night without the embarrassing effects of dry mouth while I am trying to talk to people while I am working, and as a sales professional, I have to talk (and listen) all day.</li>
            <li> Reading reviews for other product found that other people were using Xylimelts with success, decided to try them.  </li>
            <li> I am hoping that some  other company will come out with something for dry  mouth at a cheaper price(they should probably hurry it  up as I,m not getting any younger fast!).</li>
            <li> When I read that Xylimelt recommended using two, I tried using two OraMoist patches and found that they lasted through the night but produced a very sticky saliva that was unpleasant, although much better than the dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Apparently the enamel in on his teeth becomes more vulnerable to tooth decay bacteria when he has dry mouth.</li>
            <li> However, they&#x27;re not overpowering and they do help with dry mouth a lot better than a typical mint or hard candy.</li>
            <li> I had very dry mouth due to health problems, woke up several times a night with dry mouth and trouble breathing.&lt;br /&gt;Ordered the Xylimelts, got here very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Recommended to her by her doctor, it took her a while to mention it, as she had tried nearly every other product on the market.</li>
            <li> Cost is a little high as well.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about whether the tablet would really stick, but they REALLY STICK!</li>
            <li> They are also pretty expensive which means I don&#x27;t use them as much as I would find beneficial.</li>
            <li> I feel that this product doesn&#x27;t last long enough compared to &amp;#34;OraMoist&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps Xylimelts Mints might work for some people but only if their dry mouth is not as extensive as mine is/was.  </li>
            <li> These do help with a dry mouth, but only for a short time.  </li>
            <li> problems.ivate the tab and for quick swallows to rinse down excessive goo in the throat</li>
            <li> I like that these last so long.  </li>
            <li> Occasionally I have some slightly crusty drool residue when I awake in the morning, but it is slight and not really a problem; certainly worth it for the sleep comfort I get.</li>
            <li> Very long  lasting and convenient to use.</li>
            <li> I have dry mouth, but only at night.</li>
            <li> Tried Bioten &amp; lozenges, these are the only things that have worked for my dry mouth problems.</li>
            <li> Use this product daily to help with dry mouth issues.</li>
            <li> It helps my dry mouth, especially at night.</li>
            <li> I had been fighting the dry mouth situation for several years.</li>
            <li> I use CPAP and awakened several times with dry mouth...not since using this product.  </li>
            <li> I would wake up several times a night because my tongue and mouth were so dry.</li>
            <li> I only have dry mouth at night.  </li>
            <li> The tablet is easy to use, it attaches to either your gums or teeth and isn&#x27;t uncomfortable during sleep.  </li>
            <li> I have a dry mouth only during the night ever since I contracted mumps.</li>
            <li> I have been using a C-Pap for 3 years and my mouth would get unbearably dry, I tried several products before I discovered XyliMelts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have dry mouth related to Sjorgren&#x27;s syndrome.  </li>
            <li> They also protect against decay which is a big issue with dry mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> only product I found to help dry</li>
            <li> I have a sever dry mouth, especially at night.</li>
            <li> It is such a pleasure not have dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Finally a product that works for severe dry mouth at night.  </li>
            <li> These are terrific at alleviating dry mouth while sleeping.  </li>
            <li> I had throat cancer and suffer from dry mouth, especially at night.&lt;br /&gt;Each</li>
            <li> Took one at bed time, woke up about 4 hours later with slightly dry mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Took</li>
            <li> This is the only product my dentist recommends for dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> I use a Cpap breathing machine and wake up several times in the night because of a desert dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using these for 5 days now, however I haven&#x27;t chewed a single piece of gum in those five days.  </li>
            <li> But thy will keep you from getting dry mouth as long as they last.</li>
            <li> When I used them at night, I found one on my pillow and the product, which was supposed to help with dry mouth didn&#x27;t seem to last long.</li>
            <li> Numerous times during the night I would wake up and have to drink some water because my mouth was very dry.</li>
            <li> it, the only thing you have to loose is your dry mouth.</li>
            <li> For an adult, they are small enough not to create a choking hazard, but I would check with a doctor before using them with a sleeping child.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually awake after five hours and normally some of the mint is unmelted and still in place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few completely dissolve within 45 minutes.</li>
            <li> Water does not help in the long run, so I searched for something like this and found these.</li>
            <li> They almost outlast a meeting if it does not go too long, and I plan to keep these on hand.</li>

            <li> Got this for my mom because she has dry mouth as an alternative to Biotene gel.</li>
            <li> if you have problems with dry mouth at night.</li>
            <li> Would recommend it to anyone that has dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I have used these during the day while I&#x27;m working,  I&#x27;m a dental hygienist, I can suction one in and it keeps my mouth from being too dry during patient treatment.</li>
            <li> ; all of which have the same active ingredient, Xylitol, to keep the mouth moist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Recently, I ran out and had to sleep a few nights without my Xylimelts and woke up several times in the night for water.</li>
            <li> I stopped putting this on my outer gum, and rather stuck it to the roof of my mouth - just to one side of center where it feels natural  I have not had any trouble, since.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to talk at work all day, and they often come loose.  </li>
            <li> The discs adhere to the roof of the mouth &amp; do not come loose.  </li>
            <li> Only one hitch, the liquid the mint created dripped into my throat while I was laying down.  </li>
            <li> A side benefit I discovered is that they help me when I&#x27;m having trouble with slow digestion (a hazard of age); even tho I might have dinner early, 3 hrs later I can often feel my meal has still not digested enough for going to bed.</li>
            <li> In the morning, I wake up with my mouth moist instead of DRY!  </li>
            <li> Well, they do stick there, but they cause that part of my mouth to get really dry!</li>
            <li> The only slight difficulty I had was learning how to place it on the gum.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> These will last me half the night.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wake up in the middle of the night needing to drink water from the dryness, though I do usually sort of swish my mouth out before adding the second pair because I have found that I don&#x27;t care for the &amp;#34;slippery&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The mint-free ones are just less obvious in your mouth because the flavor is not as noticeable.</li>
            <li> I do find they last me longer at night although I&#x27;m not sure how that actually works.</li>
            <li> My dentist has recommended that I use chewing gum containing xylitol for a few years now to combat my dry mouth, and I have done so, however this has produced only limited results.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> Without these I wake about every hour with very dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> I used to have a very dry mouth while I slept.</li>
            <li> Before Xylimelts, I would wake up every 2 to 3 hours with a very dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Can&#x27;t say enough about these little things that have been a life-changer for me.</li>
            <li> You can find the lozenge type at retail stores, but they lack the little concavity on the back side that makes them suction onto your gums and stay in place overnight.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to lower cost visits to my dentist due to eliminating night time dry mouth.</li>
            <li> My dentist did an online search for products to help me with my dry mouth problem which is mostly due to medications I take, but is also aggravated by using a CPAP (I think).</li>
            <li> I have dry mouth due to a medication.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from dry mouth due to side effects of medications.  </li>
            <li> My mouth is always extremely dry due to a number of prescription medications that I must take.  </li>
            <li> None of the other dry mouth products even came close...</li>
            <li> I have dry mouth due to taking a number of meds.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for some time to treat dry mouth at night due to using cpap.  </li>
            <li> I have dry mouth all the time due to meds i must take.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended these to use at night for my extreme dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> CPAP user with sleep apnea and extreme dry mouth condition.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my ENT doctor due to the fact I suffer from a dry mouth from the autoimmune disease Sjogrens Syndrome.  </li>
            <li> I just got diagnosed with Sjogrens and was looking for something to help my extreme dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> I have dry mouth due to prescriptions I take.  </li>
            <li> My dry mouth is due to medication.</li>
            <li> The only problem I can see is the taste when they get down to the bottom of the mint - yuk!  </li>
            <li> minty flavor is refreshing and helps with drymouth bad breath</li>
            <li> Moreover, the flavor is not very agreeable.</li>
            <li> It feels a bit rough there until it smooths out with some melting.</li>
            <li> I was without my drymouth mints last night because I&#x27;d forgotten to order 2 boxes a few days ago and that part stunk.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are expensive, but completely worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s every thing I expected.</li>
            <li> Not much I can do about that, I suppose.</li>
            <li> I have to be careful not to start them within two hours of a meal.</li>
            <li> I think for me it reminds me to keep my mouth closed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> The other is that they could be just a little bigger.  </li>
            <li> I now tuck one of these between my upper lip and gums and have no more dry mouth problem.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from extreme nighttime dry mouth due to radiation.</li>
            <li> I have had a little difficulty getting the tablets to stick to molars on either side of my mouth, but now, into my second box of Xyliments, I think that I&#x27;ve got it fairly down pat.  </li>
            <li> I have serious dry-mouth problems due to various medications I take regularly.</li>
            <li> Once I discovered these gems, I have much less of a dry mouth problem.  </li>
            <li> But, I barely drank any water and even left my water behind at one point.  </li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend these to anyone who suffers from EXTREME dry mouth due to medical issues and medication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After completing 35 rounds of radiation for tongue cancer,I was left with very little saliva production.</li>
            <li> I use 2 at night everyday and would like to know if there are any side effects in the long run.</li>
            <li> I have added issues due to chemo.  </li>
            <li> I have tried all the toothpastes, gum, mouthwashes, sprays, and other melts and lozenges, but NOTHING did the trick - as soon as the lozenges melted, that was the end of relief.</li>
            <li> I use other Xylitol products, too.  </li>
            <li> Now I use only one disc each night for the past 9 months,and whenever I wake up, my mouth is moist.</li>
            <li> I have Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome, which causes extreme dryness of my nose, eyes, and mouth.  </li>
            <li> Other methods I tried promoted decay along gumlines.</li>
            <li> No need to scrape off residue as you do with other xylitol discs.</li>
            <li> I ordered from Amazon, and it came packed in a box with my other purchases.  </li>
            <li> I am alarmed to have the product opened like this due to tampering.  </li>
            <li> Not a pretty picture.  </li>
            <li> I usually put it on the outside of one of my molars or the gums beneath them.</li>
            <li> OraMoist contains Xylitol, stearate of magnesium, lemon flavor and twelve other chemicals.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been told this is due to me</li>
            <li> I HAVE SPOKEN TO OTHER M.D.&#x27;S ABOUT</li>
            <li> WILL KEEP TRYING OTHER THINGS.</li>
            <li> Tried using other products before bed, did not work.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully, this time I only had two small cavities.</li>
            <li> I bought these upon the recommendation of some other people on Facebook....</li>
            <li> Forget all other products.  </li>
            <li> This is used even for those patients that have had injury to salivary gland due to radiation therapy.  </li>
            <li> Usually, one will last between 3-4 hours for me.</li>
            <li> A little expensive but worth the money.</li>
            <li> This was an extremely frustrating state to live with.</li>
            <li> I was having trouble with dry mouth/cotton mouth from using a CPAP machine.</li>
            <li> Forget putting &amp;#34;biotene gel behind your upper incisiors.&amp;#34; This actually works.</li>
            <li> Oral cancer left me with serious dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> I am a CPAP user and had trouble with dry mouth overnight.</li>
            <li> These little tablets stick to the side of your jaw and dry mouth disappears!  </li>
            <li> I would recommend you try a small box of these before you buy the larger box that is less money per lozenge.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it does require a certain amount of moisture to dissolve the tablets to allow them to encourage the production of saliva.  </li>
            <li> It is not real strong flavor -</li>
            <li> and they stain is a pain to remove from dark colored pillow cases.  </li>
            <li> These Xylimelts last at least 4 hours</li>
            <li> Expensive, but really work well.  </li>
            <li> tab last at least 1 1/2 to 2 hrs depending on how you use them.  </li>
            <li> The tablet stays put, melts at a rate of hours, tastes minty but not powerful, stimulates saliva and has eliminated my mouth dryness since I began using it.</li>
            <li> The last time I used them, I woke up choking because my saliva was souper thick.  </li>
            <li> Xlimelts really work for someone who suffers from dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I have them, down to a couple of days verses 10-14 days.  </li>
            <li> mouth moist cuts down on dental problems.</li>
            <li> Just pop one in your mouth when you lay down and it sticks to the side and helps create saliva flow all through the night.</li>
            <li> I put one mint on each side and when morning rolls around my mouth still has a slight mint taste.  </li>
            <li> Slight after taste in morning.</li>
            <li> Up every hour,hour and a half for a drink and rinse.</li>
            <li> [LESS SALIVA]</li>
            <li> I put two in at night and no more dry mouth!</li>
            <li> One in each cheek at bedtime and no more CPAP dry mouth!</li>
            <li> I have had dry mouth for years.&lt;br /&gt;Other products over the past few years did not</li>
            <li> I purchased the Xylimelts in a mint flavor and the mint is a mild spearmint, and not too bad, I just have to get used to it.  </li>
            <li> Expensive and don&#x27;t last as long as stated, but they do work.</li>
            <li> sometimes it&#x27;s the little things.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little pricey</li>
            <li> I THINK THESE LITTLE BEAUTIES HAVE HELPED SAVE MY LIFE.  </li>
            <li> These little things have been a Godsend to me.  </li>
            <li> I think they are a little pricey.</li>
            <li> A little pricey</li>
            <li> guess is that it has something to do with having sensitive teeth, since pain doesn&#x27;t seem to be a very common complaint with this product.</li>
            <li> ALSO  THIS PRODUCT HAS DECREASED THE AMOUNT OF CAVITIES I GET, DUE TO DRY MOUTH,</li>
            <li> I use a CPAP at night for apnea, and at times my mouth was getting dried out.  </li>
            <li> but, after a few days I no longer notice it.</li>
            <li> To save everyone the trouble, DO NOT buy Biotene.</li>
            <li> They help keep my throat from getting dried out from talking so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We had trouble finding something that worked and these do.</li>
            <li> MY HUSBAND IS USING THEM EVERYDAY</li>
            <li> I use a CPAP and tho it has a humidifier, the air pressure still dried me out.  </li>
            <li> I tried Biotene and that didn&#x27;t help, either, it seemed as if made it worse actually.</li>
            <li> MAYBE OVAL INSTEAD OF ROUND.</li>
            <li> I have  been using these for a few months now at night.</li>
            <li> Talking to someone for a few minutes would result in my lips sticking to my gums</li>
            <li> I use it a few times a day,</li>
            <li> Only complaint is they create a thick coating on my tongue</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s because of the very slight abrasive quality of it, not because of the chemical compound.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Biotene OralBalance which worked but was relatively expensive due to only coming in a small tube.  </li>
            <li> These little tabs are miraculous - no more night time cotton mouth.  </li>
            <li> I tried a number of different dry mouth options including washes, sprays and tablets and these were disappointing.</li>
            <li> I have tried the Biotene gums, toothpaste, gel, rinse but always felt they were not very effective.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little hard to explain sometimes</li>
            <li> My dad suffered cancer surgery and lost half his jaw and tongue, with severe issues of dry mouth from radiation, making it difficult for him to eat.    </li>
            <li> but I actually consider it useless.</li>
            <li> The dentist recommended this item but I was not only skeptical of its effectiveness but concerned about sleeping with a tablet in my mouth.</li>
            <li> No more since I discovers this product.</li>
            <li> But once they&#x27;re in, the usually stay in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I usually have a route canal and crown done every time I go to the dentist.</li>
            <li> My usual source no longer carries them.</li>
            <li> This product works no better than a tic tac.</li>
            <li> Did not find them uncomfortable but given the choice of dry mouth or the feel of dried syrup in my mouth</li>
            <li> As well, the dry mouth is so bad that I often have difficulty simply *speaking,* and end up sounding like a drunk as I try to be articulate and stumble through teeth-sticking, tongue gymnastics.</li>
            <li> From what I can determine both release 500 mg of Xylitol, although Xylimelts may release only 250 mg, 500 in total when two are used, as recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have radiation induced dry mouth and have been looking for ways to alleviate it at night when it is the worst.</li>
            <li> Prior to this, I was quite disappointed with the dry mouth gums, mouthwashes, toothpastes, and mints out there.</li>
            <li> Long story short, it caused annoying post nasal drip hacking cough.</li>
            <li> Using an oral appliance for sleep apnea provided much needed sleep, but it also created awful dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> If yours is severe so that you can hardly talk or swallow meat, it&#x27;s time to get your eyes tested for dryness, and to see if you have Sjogren&#x27;s, because there is help out there for you.</li>
            <li> The dentist recommended them for him, but boy are they hard to find.</li>
            <li> I found these Ora-Health domed mints and find that they work at least as well as the Biotene products.  </li>
            <li> I take a plethora of medications and use a biPap ASV machine for complex sleep apnea.</li>
            <li> These have the least amount of ingredients of anything I have found and as the package states they CONTAIN</li>
            <li> I was getting up at least once a night with coughing spells and either got a cough drop or cough syrup.  </li>
            <li> This has been going on for years, and has led to the slow destruction of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> They slowly release xylitol that kills germs overnight and sweetness of it seems to help with saliva production as well.</li>
            <li> it before going to bed and let it dissolve slowly.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t swallow it and choke and it moisturizes your mouth all night which lessens the chance of tooth decay, as it slowly dissolves.</li>
            <li> They will stick to your gum and slowly dissolve while sleeping.  </li>
            <li> He sticks one on each side of his mouth (on teeth, I think) and it slowly keeps his mouth moist through the night.</li>
            <li> I pop one of these slow melting mints in my mouth between cheek and gum.</li>
            <li> They are slow to dissolve and will stay lodged against the teeth without moving..</li>
            <li> I am not sure which is worse</li>
            <li> they are awful sweet.  </li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband who is a cancer patient and suffers a terribly dry mouth.</li>
            <li> would recommend this to anyone who is desperate for relief from dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> Not good.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed in the overall experience.</li>
            <li> I have had an exceedingly bad problem with dry mouth for years, after having come out of cancer treatment twice and having been given a regimen of drugs that would make a desert of a lake.</li>
            <li> my husband has terrible dry mouth, possibly due to another medication.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy it from the store if the seal was broken.</li>
            <li> I hate waking up in the middle of the night with my tongue stuck to the roof of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> You are instructed to stick them behind your molars, against your cheek.</li>
            <li> NOW I CAN SPEAK IN FRONT OF PEOPLE, WITHOUT THE  ANNOYING, EMBARRASING, CHRONIC DRY COUGH,</li>
            <li> No more dry mouth with the awful taste that can result from it.  </li>
            <li> It is also used in mouthwash and as an artificial sweetener in some hard candy.  </li>
            <li> A 50 year old never having had a cavity, I was BUMMED when I got three of them as a result of this cruel dry-mouth punishment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more congested throat or painful tongue.</li>
            <li> I have to use a C Pap machine at night time and it was giving me a very bad dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> Your results may vary, but it made me wary to try this again, as a \\&quot;stick-on\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with the Biotin</li>
            <li> Plus it was expensive.</li>
            <li> AT NIGHT, BREATHING IS SO DIFFICULT.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical but tried them</li>
            <li> it is completely useless.  </li>
            <li> why so expensive online.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though I hate chewing gum, I&#x27;m someone who would go through a few packs a day in an effort to keep my mouth semi-moist.  </li>
            <li> so others may find concern in the vague vegetable gums ingredient</li>
            <li> And no matter what people are saying, the effect does not outlast the mint.&lt;br /&gt;Way too expensive for what it does.</li>
            <li> Just wish they were not so expensive.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that night, got the tablet placed where she told me to.</li>
            <li> but found that they did not produce saliva and they were just plain annoying in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I have a full-face CPAP mask and have horrible dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> so dry it was awful.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> my husband suffered from dry mouth and horrible bad breath from coap. Tried several products. This worked immediately!! I&#x27;m thrilled!!!</li>
            <li> Way too expensive for a breath and/or moisture mint!! Would not pay that price ever again for those mints! Regular mints or hardy candy would have the same result.</li>
            <li> I have severe dry mouth from medications.  These will stick to your gums but and they do help in producing saliva, but I have not had one last longer than 1 hour.  I have to talk at work all day, and they often come loose.  A mint would do just as well, but it is handy to have for a while during the time is does stick.  I had hoped in might help with the pain of dry mouth, but there is no relief there.  I won&#x27;t buy again even though they do work, because the effectiveness does not offset the price.</li>
            <li> best product ever for dry mouth</li>
            <li> After trying all of the Bioteen products for Burning Mouth Syndrome, this is the first real relief I&#x27;ve gotten.  I  stick one on the inside of my cheek at bedtime, and don&#x27;t wake up with my tongue stuck to the roof of my mouth and experiencing terrible pain.  I  thank my dentist mentally every morning for recommending this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything on the market for dry mouth and none of it works well.  Nothing except this product, anyway!  You&#x27;ll not only find yourself refreshed you&#x27;ll notice that you, once again, have the correct balance of mucus and saliva in your mouth that is important to taste, feel and everything else you need to keep your mouth and tongue feeling fresh and moist.</li>
            <li> I have dry mouth, but only at night. This used to cause me to wake up in the middle of the night and resulted in high dental bills due to frequent cavities.    I&#x27;ve tried Biotene OralBalance which worked but was relatively expensive due to only coming in a small tube.  I found these Ora-Health domed mints and find that they work at least as well as the Biotene products.  However, a box of 80 Ora-Health domed mints lasts about 80 days compared to about two weeks for a small (1.5 Oz) tube (the only size available) of Biotene OralBalance for only $3-$4 more. I am looking forward to lower cost visits to my dentist due to eliminating night time dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Use this at night, and sleep all night!  I have Sjogrens disease (dry mouth), and this really works.</li>
            <li> Mints are excellent.I suffered  dry mouth for more than 8yrs and could not sleep much .Somehow  I tried various products but no results but&lt;br /&gt;accidently I came across these mints at Rite Aid and started  using it and what a  relief.To my surprise I slept straight 6hrs.Now I am buying in bulk&lt;br /&gt;From you..I use 2 at night everyday and would like to know if there are any side effects in the long run.</li>
            <li> My husband has dry mouth so I ordered these.  They work well and he is very pleased.</li>
            <li> Thank You!  Do to occasions of anxiety or medications that can make your mouth dry There is nothing else to replace the moisture back . I love the idea of having XyliMelts that adhere to the inside of my gums (Can be used on false teeth also.) Especially When going to sleep you don&#x27;t have to worry about it dislodging. And the wonderful hint of mint it provides I Find XyliMelts Truly Refreshing.  Again I Thank You!!!</li>
            <li> I take a lot of meds and wake up with dry mouth. I tried these for about a week. Did not find them uncomfortable but given the choice of dry mouth or the feel of dried syrup in my mouth I am not sure which is worse</li>
            <li> My dad is not a computer man, so I&#x27;m relaying his opinion on Xylimelts. My dad suffered cancer surgery and lost half his jaw and tongue, with severe issues of dry mouth from radiation, making it difficult for him to eat.    His last dental appointment, the nurse gave these to him to try. The first time he used them, he fell in love with them. He&#x27;s been able to eat things he had a hard time eating before.     For my dad to make such compliments is rare. As for me, I have tried them to see what he was talking about. They leave you with a very nice feeling, especially knowing that they make my dad smile.</li>
            <li> I use this product because I get canker sores, it works so well to reduce the time the I have them, down to a couple of days verses 10-14 days.  I don&#x27;t know what I would do without Xylimelts!!!</li>
            <li> Seem to be working as promised and that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li> I use a CPAP at night for apnea, and at times my mouth was getting dried out.  I didn&#x27;t want to raise the humidifier too high because it just causes condensation in the tube.  My dentist gave me a sample of Xylimelts and they seemed to work well to keep my mouth moist.  I have now been using them nightly for over a month, and they do the trick!  Pleasant taste and they work.</li>
            <li> I have dry mouth from medications and this makes a world of difference!  I use them when I&#x27;m sleeping and on days when my mouth just won&#x27;t stop drying out.  They solve the problem.</li>
            <li> My mouth is dry and these little mints help keep my mouth comfortable and healthy. I would recommend this product to everyone. However do not use more than 4 melts in one day as excessive use can cause gastric upset. Even with that caveat I still think this is a great product for the price.</li>
            <li> My dentist did an online search for products to help me with my dry mouth problem which is mostly due to medications I take, but is also aggravated by using a CPAP (I think). This is what he found. I ordered them from Amazon and have been using them ever since. I can get away with using Xylitol mints and drinking extra water during the daytime, but at night, nothing I had tried lasted long enough to be really useful as far as keeping my mouth from drying out. Dry mouth for those who haven&#x27;t been told, leads to tooth decay, which is why my dentist was concerned. This product really helps. For a change, getting up in the middle of the night to go the the bathroom is proving to be useful, because if I need another XyliMelt when I get up, I just pop one in my mouth before getting back in bed. I haven&#x27;t seen these in any local stores, but if they were available, I doubt that the prices would be as good as they are on Amazon. So thanks to XyliMelts &amp; Amazon.com I am getting better dental check-ups.</li>
            <li> I take a plethora of medications and use a biPap ASV machine for complex sleep apnea. Accordingly, I suffer from dry mouth. This is a terrific product for helping to alleviate the dry mouth; in fact it is excellent. I&#x27;ve been using it for six months and continue to order them from Amazon. Originally I would only use it at night during sleep but now I keep one in my mouth almost constantly. It adheres to your gum so it doesn&#x27;t affect your speech or ability to eat or drink anything while it&#x27;s in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I wish it lasted longer. It lasts a good two to three hours but an 8 hour solution would be ideal. That way, when i wake up from a good night&#x27;s sleep my mouth would still be fresh and moist. Along with this product I also recommend: [[ASIN:B002KAOAZ4 Biotene Dry Mouth Mouthwash, 33.8 Bottle]], [[ASIN:B002KAOAUE Biotene Mouth Spray, Gentle Mint, 1.5-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]], and [[ASIN:B001ET7I6U Biotene Dry Mouth Toothpaste, Fresh Mint Original, 4.5-Ounce Box (Pack of 4)]]; all of which have the same active ingredient, Xylitol, to keep the mouth moist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, all these products are pleasant tasting and promote fresh breath so you can be comfortable getting up close and personal :-) if you&#x27;re using them regularly. The toothpaste has fluoride and calcium, although I think you can buy a non fluoridated version if you need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product also, allegedly, promotes good oral health; an allegation I believe. Common sense tells me that a dry mouth would be more prone to harmful bacteria than a moist one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy with confidence.</li>
            <li> I use a CPAP nightly.  These little guys stick to your gums and nicely moisten your mouth as the CPAP tries to dry you out. If you are a mouth breather and use a full face mask, be prepared for additional  cleaning in the morning and they stain is a pain to remove from dark colored pillow cases.  Makes me sound old and creepy but its better than sleep apnea and hamring my teeth from overly dry mucous membranes</li>
            <li> I have dry mouth due to a medication.  I stick one of these on the roof of my mouth at night and it helps keep my mouth moist.</li>
            <li> the product seems to work as advertised.</li>
            <li> These mints provide some relief from dry mouth.  I use a CPAP and tuck one in my mouth before bedtime, there&#x27;s still a sliver remaining in the morning and my mouth is moister.</li>
            <li> I was having trouble with dry mouth/cotton mouth from using a CPAP machine. I do not breathe through my mouth, but still my mouth would be so dry I couldn&#x27;t speak or swallow when I first woke up. I have used these lozenges for two nights now, and they work! I put one lozenge in the back of my mouth on each side, next to my last molar. The tan side of the lozenge makes it adhere to the tooth so that there isn&#x27;t a choking hazard. I did notice a slight increase in saliva production right away, but not a bothersome amount. I was worried that I&#x27;d drool on my pillow, but that didn&#x27;t happen! Both mornings so far, I woke up with a pleasant minty taste in my mouth and no dry mouth. I will continue using this product! It is also notable that I have experienced no irritation or other side effects from their use.</li>
            <li> I am a dental hygienist and highly recommend this product for anyone suffering from dry mouth issues.  Great for reducing the germ type that can lead to decay and making a ph positive saliva for a healthier mouth!!!</li>
            <li> I much prefer the mint ones to the mint free ones. I find them helpful and refreshing during the day and even overnight.</li>
            <li> Xylimelts answers a real need!  I suffer a &#x27;dry mouth.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;These light tasting mint sticks to the roof of my mouth and slowly dissolves leaving my mouth&lt;br /&gt;  dress and moist.  The added benefit is its lack of cause of tooth decay.&lt;br /&gt;What a great find!</li>
            <li> Expensive and don&#x27;t last as long as stated, but they do work.</li>
            <li> To the bathroom all night!These really work and No fear of choking with the coating on back that makes them adhere..anywhere in the mouth that is comfortable.Great for daytime use as well.I stick them on the roof of my mouth and nobody can tell it is there! Great product!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed! I could not even get them to stick to my gums, so I don&#x27;t know if they work.</li>
            <li> I keep buying these xylimelts, because they work !!!  Great invention !!!  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I will never go without them at night!!  They are great.</li>
            <li> Bought a selection of anti-dry-mouth products, after getting 2 of my 4 lifetime cavities after starting new medications.  and this is one of my favorites. It has one adhesive side &amp; a Tums like texture, which means it dissolves without a lot of saliva even when affixed in the cheek area.  Good for overnight, I also use when reading or watching TV. I&#x27;m quite sensitive to most fake sweeteners and this doesn&#x27;t bother me at all - no headache, no 6 hour foul aftertaste - so the experience is rather pleasant all around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes it gets stuck to my tooth instead of my gums, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me and still works.</li>
            <li> I have had dry mouth for years.&lt;br /&gt;Other products over the past few years did not help.&lt;br /&gt;The dentist gave me a sample of Xylimelts and I was sold! The only slight difficulty I had was learning how to place it on the gum.&lt;br /&gt;Now it is easy and Xylimelts keep my mouth moist for the day.</li>
            <li> They work well - I have sleep apnea and use a CPAP machine to sleep and they keep my mouth from drying out and leave no after taste.Only problem is they only work for four hours or so. Five stars if they lasted all night. I put one between my cheek and gums and it sticks immediately.</li>
            <li> Not quite as good as I had hoped.  But pretty good.</li>
            <li> My husband uses these every night and sometimes during the day. Really works well with his dry mouth condition. Absorbs excess saliva and reduces coughing.</li>
            <li> Work really well and have a pleasant taste!</li>
            <li> nice to wake up with a moist mouth</li>
            <li> It actually made sores in my mouth!</li>
            <li> I have sleep apnea and so I have a machine that helps me breathe. Since I breathe through my mouth, it gets uncomfortably dry. These, plus my heated humidifier, help a lot at reducing the discomfort. Recently, I ran out and had to sleep a few nights without my Xylimelts and woke up several times in the night for water. Once my Xylimelts arrived, I slept through the night again.</li>
            <li> Best product I have ever used for my dry mouth problem.</li>
            <li> My former review is below.  I stopped putting this on my outer gum, and rather stuck it to the roof of my mouth - just to one side of center where it feels natural  I have not had any trouble, since.&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I attached one to my lower gum, and it worked fine. But that evening, I did the same thing, and a canker sore developed in the exact spot and lasted for a few days.  Your results may vary, but it made me wary to try this again, as a \\&quot;stick-on\\&quot;. You can use a regular xylitol mint, but there are much cheaper choices then, as a regular mint.</li>
            <li> I suffer from dry mouth due to side effects of medications.  I have tried the Biotene gums, toothpaste, gel, rinse but always felt they were not very effective.  My dentist recommended that I try these, and I am glad he did.  They do not get rid of my dry mouth completely, but they do lessen it to a significant degree.  They also tend to last for a while, so you don&#x27;t feel like you need to use it every 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> Xylimelts have been my life saver.......I used to get so dry throat sleeping I would wake up choking .&lt;br /&gt;Good for day and night .</li>
            <li> These work...okay.  I have a full-face CPAP mask and have horrible dry mouth.  They don&#x27;t last an entire 8 hours for me, so I still wake up feeling parched.  For the first 6 hours or so, they sort of moisten my mouth - more like gargling with a gel toothpaste or something.  The last time I used them, I woke up choking because my saliva was souper thick.  Yeah, kind of gross.</li>
            <li> tried it once and it was ok really sticks to gums.</li>
            <li> Works just as they said .  Actually sticks to my cheek or gums . Keeps my mouth moist for a couple of hours and the price is right .</li>
            <li> I took a chance and ordered this product but am disappointed.  It is close to the description given but in execution, it is lacking.  I ordered it to complete a free shipping order.    Amazon was offering a certain product I had been wanting but would allow only 1 package to be purchased and furthermore, did not offer any other of the products offered by Emerald Forest at the same price with free shipping--there was another product that I wanted but it cost more plus I would have had to pay almost 7 dollars to ship.  Disappointed in the overall experience.</li>
            <li> Using an oral appliance for sleep apnea provided much needed sleep, but it also created awful dry mouth.  Dry mouth made me wake up early whether I wanted to or not.  I went back to the dentist who fitted my appliance - She gave me a sample of this product to see if it wold help me with the morning dry mouth problem.  It worked great!  I&#x27;ve been using the product for over a month now and could not be happier.  It eliminated my dry mouth completely. Benefit, I&#x27;m now able to sleep in late in the morning like I use to do way back in college days whenever I want to. Great product.</li>
            <li> These mints are really good and really work with dry  mouth but beware they are very expensive. I am a senior  citizen and at nights in particular suffer with dry  mouth.  I can at times use five of these at night.  My pharmacy charges $8.00 for 40 so if I had to have  them every night, I would be paying over $30.00 a month.  With regular health care costs higher and higher,  there is no way I could justify spending so much to  get me t hrough dry mouth nights. I am hoping that some  other company will come out with something for dry  mouth at a cheaper price(they should probably hurry it  up as I,m not getting any younger fast!).</li>
            <li> These tabs are very good for anyone with dry mouth. Highly recommended by my dentist.  My dentist is extremely good, has extra credentials thru the military and is my son.  I have added issues due to chemo.  Great product.</li>
            <li> These mints work great.  I usually only use them at night.  I put one mint on each side and when morning rolls around my mouth still has a slight mint taste.  No more dry mouth with the awful taste that can result from it.  I have been using these for months and can&#x27;t imagine sleeping without them.</li>
            <li> Keeps mouth hydrated for about four hours each use.</li>
            <li> I have severe dry mouth. I was not impressed with the Biotin my dentist recommended and it lasted one 1 minute or two. Plus it was expensive. I searched your site and discovered XyliMelts. It is wonderfull. it last over 3 hours in your mouth while you are sleeping. Biotin can hide itself.</li>
            <li> The ingredients in these mints immediately made my teeth ache, and I don&#x27;t have especially sensitive teeth, just the normal sensitivity of a 70 year old. Moreover, the flavor is not very agreeable. It&#x27;s neither sweet nor minty, but tastes more like a Tums.</li>
            <li> The Xylimelt Mints really ease dry mouth.  Glad I tried them, not much else really helped.</li>
            <li> In Dentistry we frequently recommend Xylimelts to patients for dry mouth problems.  However, they are extremely effective for patients who are being treated for Cancer and for autoimmune problems.  The Xylimelts are fantastic for healing and preventing mouth ulcers and sores.  They are much more effective than the baking soda rinses the physicians recommend.</li>
            <li> I love these!!  I use them during the day and always at night!!  My mouth stays moist!!</li>
            <li> Sticks to roof of mouth or jaw and keep mouth moist for several hours.This helps keep mouth moist when using drugs that cause dry mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Keeping mouth moist cuts down on dental problems.</li>
            <li> I thought there was NO solution. I have had an exceedingly bad problem with dry mouth for years, after having come out of cancer treatment twice and having been given a regimen of drugs that would make a desert of a lake. As well, the dry mouth is so bad that I often have difficulty simply *speaking,* and end up sounding like a drunk as I try to be articulate and stumble through teeth-sticking, tongue gymnastics. I have tried all the toothpastes, gum, mouthwashes, sprays, and other melts and lozenges, but NOTHING did the trick - as soon as the lozenges melted, that was the end of relief. This was an extremely frustrating state to live with. A 50 year old never having had a cavity, I was BUMMED when I got three of them as a result of this cruel dry-mouth punishment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Xylimelts are the answer to my prayers. They do everything that the information states. I would say that you have to get used to sticking it to the teeth/gums; I put it on the upper back gum/molar. It seems to need a full 20 seconds of holding the mint there for it to stick well. It feels a bit rough there until it smooths out with some melting. After that it&#x27;s fine, as long as you don&#x27;t fool with it with your tongue. The melt lasts an hour, two if you are very calm (asleep or not talking/moving the mouth). It continually emits a really pleasant mint taste into the mouth, and makes it fresh and very pleasant. When I sleep with these, although they are gone when I wake, my mouth is relieved, moist and fresh. It stimulates a wetter, nicer mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the ultimate, GREAT breath mint, also. Had I known about these when I was dating, I would have been thrilled...to know that for hours, my mouth would have been mint-fresh...ahhh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say enough about these little things that have been a life-changer for me.</li>
            <li> When sleeping and it gives me 4 hours of uninterrupted sleep.  Without these I wake about every hour with very dry mouth.  This has helped this condition while improving sleep.</li>
            <li> I recently tried Xylimelts for the first time.  I had been waking up at night or in the morning with my mouth so dry it was awful.  I&#x27;ve tried other things, but this is the best.  I have received about 50% - 75% relief with my problem.  I just wish it lasted a little longer; then it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> I like these mints because they are sugar-free, stick to the roof of my mouth so I don&#x27;t swallow during the night.  The only problem I can see is the taste when they get down to the bottom of the mint - yuk!  The other is that they could be just a little bigger.  Cost is a little high as well.</li>
            <li> Great, for me, at night. Use 2 and they last 4-5 hours. Only complaint is they create a thick coating on my tongue but, after a few days I no longer notice it. Can&#x27;t do them in the daytime...way too distracting.</li>
            <li> Prior to this, I was quite disappointed with the dry mouth gums, mouthwashes, toothpastes, and mints out there. To save everyone the trouble, DO NOT buy Biotene. Their products are complete garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now here&#x27;s where I hail XyliMelts as the savior to dry mouth (which is good for potential buyers because I&#x27;m not a one time review robot that plugs the products incessantly for their company, but that&#x27;s another rant for another day). These mints have allowed me to literally smile more again. It&#x27;s a little hard to explain sometimes but essentially my upper gums/teeth are so dry that I can&#x27;t lift my gums up to smile effectively. That alone has been worth the price of these things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then sometimes it&#x27;s the little things. I tend to get dry mouth in movies, a lot. It doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s a horror film or a comedy and it makes me miserable. I was without my drymouth mints last night because I&#x27;d forgotten to order 2 boxes a few days ago and that part stunk. Then if you have anxiety like me , whether it&#x27;s hanging around friends or going on dates, there&#x27;s plenty of \\&quot;cotton\\&quot; mouth to go around for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They aren&#x27;t an end-all cure and I don&#x27;t use them like they say to. I pretty much put them anywhere in my mouth and just roll them around, lol. Yet, that&#x27;s effective and this is probably one of the more effective products I&#x27;ve used for dry mouth. With the current market for dry mouth sufferers right now, these XyliMelts are just hands down the best you can get. I tried this on a whim because nothing else had worked, I hope they work for you too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Travis</li>
            <li> Very helpful. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> My mouth is always extremely dry due to a number of prescription medications that I must take.  This has been going on for years, and has led to the slow destruction of my teeth.  My dentist has recommended that I use chewing gum containing xylitol for a few years now to combat my dry mouth, and I have done so, however this has produced only limited results.&lt;br /&gt;On a recent visit she gave me a trial package of Xylimelts.  They worked so well, that I was compelled to purchase this box of them on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use them every night, but when I do, the results are profound–instead of waking with my mouth &amp;#34;glued&amp;#34; shut, I now wake up in the morning with a moist mouth and a pleasant yet, subtle mint taste.  My greatest hope is that with continued use, the decay/destruction of my teeth will either slow, or cease.</li>
            <li> The only product that really helped my wife&#x27;s dry mouth during the night. None of the other dry mouth products even came close...</li>
            <li> I use a CPAP every night so dry mouth is always a problem.  They do work but not as advertised.  They&#x27;re suppose to last for most of the night.     The very longest I had one last was 3 hours with the shortest being just over an hour.    But thy will keep you from getting dry mouth as long as they last.</li>
            <li> I have night time dry mouth. My dentist recommended these. Very effective. Only issue is that one tablet lasts about 4 hours so you may have to reapply during the night to cover 8 hours of sleep. However, it took care of my problem so well that I&#x27;ve ordered more! Love it!</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist for dry mouth during the night, and it really helps!</li>
            <li> These are the best solution for dry mouth problems (especially sleeping at night or public speaking).  The discs adhere to the roof of the mouth &amp; do not come loose.  They last me for hours.  They&#x27;re a little pricey but so worth it!</li>
            <li> Terrible overnight dry mouth issues. These tabs resolved.</li>
            <li> Perhaps Xylimelts Mints might work for some people but only if their dry mouth is not as extensive as mine is/was.  I was not producing any saliva at all, therefore no moisture was available to dissolve the tablets.  Unfortunately it does require a certain amount of moisture to dissolve the tablets to allow them to encourage the production of saliva.  I gave this product one star but I actually consider it useless.</li>
            <li> Tried Bioten &amp; lozenges, these are the only things that have worked for my dry mouth problems.</li>
            <li> Use this product daily to help with dry mouth issues.</li>
            <li> I THINK THESE LITTLE BEAUTIES HAVE HELPED SAVE MY LIFE.  WHEN YOU HAVE NO SALIVA, YOUR THROAT STICKS TOGETHER AT NIGHT, BREATHING IS SO DIFFICULT.  DURING THE DAY, IT IS DIFFICULT TO HAVE A CONVERSATION, BUT THESE WONDERFUL, LITTLE MINTS HAVE MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE FOR ME.  I HOPE I NEVER HAVE TO BE WITHOUT THEM.</li>
            <li> These mints work better for dry mouth than anything else I have found.  I will continue to use them, escically. @ night !</li>
            <li> A bone marrow transplant patient with a graft vs host problem has a dry mouth condition that is rated severe. This stuff works wonders.</li>
            <li> Good product...good service.</li>
            <li> Very good product of which I have ordered often. Most likely will continue to order as long as I have this dry mouth problem.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t sleep without them</li>
            <li> I liked this best out of the non-prescription helps to a very dry mouth. I tried just about everything, and this helped the most. I ended up needing pilocarpine because I have Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome, and that has really helped. But if you don&#x27;t have Sjogren&#x27;s or it hasn&#x27;t been diagnosed yet, this helps get you through the day and night. If yours is severe so that you can hardly talk or swallow meat, it&#x27;s time to get your eyes tested for dryness, and to see if you have Sjogren&#x27;s, because there is help out there for you. If you&#x27;re a non-Sjogren&#x27;s person, this is a great help for you.</li>
            <li> My Dental Hygienist recommended these because I have chronic dry mouth from my medications.  I was skeptical but tried them and they work amazingly well! They stay in place all night, taste great, and I only need one to keep my mouth nice and moist all night.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband who is a cancer patient and suffers a terribly dry mouth. The dentist recommended them for him, but boy are they hard to find. You can find the lozenge type at retail stores, but they lack the little concavity on the back side that makes them suction onto your gums and stay in place overnight. These help with keeping his mouth moist overnight as well as improving his breath in the morning. The only real drawback is the expense; they are $$$$</li>
            <li> Love this product. Keeps my mouth moist all night.  Don&#x27;t know how I got along without it.  Easy to use.  Adheres well.  A little expensive but worth the money.</li>
            <li> THEY WORK GREAT FOR DRY MOUTH.  SEAMLESS TRANSACTION...</li>
            <li> It helps my dry mouth, especially at night. It does kind of &amp;#34;gum up&amp;#34; my invisalign trays. I would think it would do the same for any plastic retainers. but still worth it!</li>
            <li> If you suffer from dry mouth, and mine is severely dry to the point of lots of dental problems.  You will want XyliMelts!  These little tablets stick to the side of your jaw and dry mouth disappears!  They are FAR BETTER than any Biotene product.  When I go to bed, I put one on each side of my mouth and when I get up in the morning, my mouth is moist.  This is a first in about 15 years, so I am definitely sold on XyliMelts.</li>
            <li> I use them when I wake up in the middle of the night with cotton mouth. I just put one in the side of my mouth by my teeth and it stays put.They are effective for the rest of the night.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with this product!  It has totally eliminated my &amp;#34;dry mouth&amp;#34; problems.  So easy to use and one tablet lasts all night,  One night I forgot to put one in my mouth and I had &amp;#34;dry mouth&amp;#34; problems all night and my mouth felt like a desert when i woke up.  I&#x27;ll never forget it again!  Yesterday I asked my dentist what he thought of them and he said, &amp;#34;Excellent product&amp;#34; and emphasized that they could be helpful in fighting decay.  I&#x27;ve been giving them to all my friends and they love them, too, and I&#x27;ve just ordered more for myself, since I&#x27;ve been giving so many away to my friends.  I am so grateful that another friend told me about these mints, and I&#x27;m happy to pass the word along.</li>
            <li> I had been fighting the dry mouth situation for several years. The medications you have to take will often cause that. The dentist recommended this item but I was not only skeptical of its effectiveness but concerned about sleeping with a tablet in my mouth. I did some limited trial methods while awake and finally decided it would be safe enough under the tongue. However this mint does seem to stay secure at other locations. More dependent on your personal comfort with the placement. I was pleasantly surprised at the results and will attest to the reduction of dry mouth condition. Worth a try for sure.</li>
            <li> Love, love this product for helping to relieve my dry mouth at night.  At first, I was worried about swallowing it at night while sleeping but that hasn&#x27;t happened.  I use CPAP and awakened several times with dry mouth...not since using this product.  Please don&#x27;t ever stop selling these!!</li>
            <li> I use Xylimelts at night and they really help to keep my mouth moist.  I have tried other products and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> The product met all my expectations to remedy my&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dry mouth.  However, I can no longer use it because it caused prolonged diarrhea.</li>
            <li> My husband just can&#x27;t stand to sleep without Xylimelts.  His CPAP dries his mouth and throat, even when using the humidifier.  The Xylimelts make a huge difference in his sleeping comfort.  He has tried other &amp;#34;solutions,&amp;#34; but these work the best and are the most pleasant to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a CPAP, but I also enjoy Xylimelts when I sleep.  They help me sleep through the night without waking up in the wee hours with cotton mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re also pretty nifty when I have to teach training classes for my job.  They help keep my throat from getting dried out from talking so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are expensive, but completely worth it.</li>
            <li> These mints are great.  When your mouth is dry at night or throughout the day, you can talk and have them in your mouth without anyone knowing.  They stick lightly to areas in your mouth.  They are great!</li>
            <li> I purchased these as a result of a suggestion at a Sjogren&#x27;s support group meeting.  They have been a life-saver!  When I am going to be talking for some time, or I&#x27;m going out of the house for awhile, I put one of these in my mouth and no longer feel a dry throat begging for water.  Since I have crowns, they don&#x27;t stick to my teeth, but that doesn&#x27;t matter at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have a pleasant taste - I chose the natural flavor.  And the added benefit is it helps my normally smelly breath!</li>
            <li> I feel that this product doesn&#x27;t last long enough compared to &amp;#34;OraMoist&amp;#34;.  OraMoist lasts all night.  Xylimelts maybe last about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have dry mouth due to taking a number of meds. When I had my dental appointment I was told about this product from the hygienist.&lt;br /&gt;I have been very happy with how this works.  Since I have been taking it I haven&#x27;t woken up with dry mouth. I only need to take it at night.&lt;br /&gt;The taste is pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend Xylimelts to anyone that is having a problem with dry mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Try it, the only thing you have to loose is your dry mouth.</li>
            <li> This is the only remedy for extreme dry mouth I gave found. I would wake up several times a night because my tongue and mouth were so dry. No more since I discovers this product. I always order way ahead so I don&#x27;t run out.  Works great for public speaking and job interviews too!</li>
            <li> The product is the best remedy I&#x27;m aware of.  So, why not five stars?  Because I wish it were better.  There are days when I keep popping them; then there are days when a couple is enough.</li>
            <li> I have dry mouth and I use an AutoPAP.  Fortunately, the AutoPAP has a humidification unit coupled with a heated hose.  One of these per night alleviates most of my dry mouth.</li>
            <li> would be better if didn&#x27;t stick to part of mouth.  Just need a losenge to suck on, don&#x27;t like the concept</li>
            <li> These little tabs are miraculous - no more night time cotton mouth.  For me, one tab nightly lasts most of the night.  I highly recommend these. : )</li>
            <li> Helps for Dry Mouth resulting from radiation for throat cancer.  We had trouble finding something that worked and these do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best product I have tried! I am a singer and when I tuck a tablet in the corner of my mouth, I don&#x27;t have to worry if I am going to make it through the performance without my lips and gums sticking together! In addition, I can get through the day and night without the embarrassing effects of dry mouth while I am trying to talk to people while I am working, and as a sales professional, I have to talk (and listen) all day.</li>
            <li> This is  a wonderful product.  I no longer wake up several times a night to get a a drink of water.</li>
            <li> THEY ARE JUST GREAT (FIVE STARS) - THEY WERE RECOMENDED BY OUR DENTIST AND MY HUSBAND IS USING THEM EVERYDAY</li>
            <li> Had allergic reaction,Red lump on cheek  in location of where discs were placed inside mouth.</li>
            <li> Very clandestine- sometimes I for get I have one in my mouth.  I consider it a bonus that it gives me fresh breath. I use other Xylitol products, too.  My dental hygienist is over the moon. ONE CAUTION: XYLITOL KILLS DOGS!</li>
            <li> My dentists had some free samples. I bought some through Amazon and has been a great asset. I had tried another popular product, but didn&#x27;t get the results that Orahealth Xylimelts gave me.</li>
            <li> These are the best dry mouth solution...EVER!</li>
            <li> This is the second large order I have placed for Orahealth Xylimelts Mints.  I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I use these at night for sleeping.  They help to reduce the dryness I have in my mouth.  Hopefully they are good for my teeth/crowns also.  I have ordered them twice from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other products to relieve this condition, no others were palatable.&lt;br /&gt;XyliMelts have a pleasant mint flavor while hydrating my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Anytime my friends talk of issues with dry mouth, I share my product. Many of them use it now.</li>
            <li> I had been using Biotene at night for my dry mouth problem. But, I had to take the Biotene pretty often during the night. These Xylimelts last at least 4 hours and I can sleep so much better. I am so happy that my new dentist recommended Xylimelts to me. I was getting so discouraged.</li>
            <li> Great for dry mouth caused by medications, especially at night. Disolves slowly, tastes great and gum side adheres to cheek comfortably.</li>
            <li> XyliMelts really work to keep my mouth from being dry. I used to have a very dry mouth while I slept. Now I use only one disc each night for the past 9 months,and whenever I wake up, my mouth is moist. This is a great product. I heard about it from my dentist and I have told others about how easy it is to use. They love it, too.</li>
            <li> I always have some on hand and carry in my purse. It is better than chomping on gum to freshen your breath. Excellent product! No complaints at all!I don&#x27;t know how anyone could NOT like this product! It&#x27;s great to use a bedtime, too!</li>
            <li> Great product, great delivery service, reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I have Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome, which causes extreme dryness of my nose, eyes, and mouth.  I used to wake up 2-3 times a night, having to get a drink, rinse my mouth, and try to get back to sleep.    Xylimelts are the perfect product for this.  They have a concave adhesive surface on one side and you can stick it to your cheek across from your gumline.  The instructions say use two, but I only need one to keep my mouth moist enough to sleep all night.  Once you get it stuck, it will stay in place until it is gone or until you decide to remove it.  The adhesive dissolves, too.  For an adult, they are small enough not to create a choking hazard, but I would check with a doctor before using them with a sleeping child.  Xylimelts have a pleasant, minty taste that lasts a very long time.  The ingredient, xylitol, which stimulates saliva, also freshens breath and helps prevent bacterial growth and tooth decay.  It is also used in mouthwash and as an artificial sweetener in some hard candy.  This was not my first order for these.  This time, I ordered 3 boxes at once to take advantage of free shipping.  I will buy more when I run out.  They are that good.</li>
            <li> This product is GREAT, creates saliva flow, and helps me fall back to sleep when my CPAP machine dries out my mouth and wakes me up.  It also produced a better check up with my hygeniest with less plaque that is caused by dry mouth.[[ASIN:B001A40M1M Orahealth Xylimelts Mints, 80-Count Boxes]]    Don&#x27;t make the mistake of ordering the original (the one with the picture of the tree bark on the box).  Make sure you get the Mint.  There is a world of difference in the way it works and it has a pleasant taste.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on the recommendation of one of my online groups.  My CPAP use was drying out my mouth while I slept, and as a consequence, I was getting tooth decay.  I have had a little difficulty getting the tablets to stick to molars on either side of my mouth, but now, into my second box of Xyliments, I think that I&#x27;ve got it fairly down pat.  I prefer the non-peppermint to the peppermint flavors.  The non-peppermint ones have a slightly sweet almost vanilla flavor, so I know that there&#x27;s something in my mouth.  Will these keep my mouth sufficiently moist to ward off further tooth decay?  Only time will tell.</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve found for chronic dry mouth. My dentist recommended these. Other methods I tried promoted decay along gumlines.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended I try these.  They are the answer to my mouth dryness at night.  I&#x27;ve tried gels and still wake during the mouth barely able to open my mouth.  And the price is certainly better than the gels I&#x27;ve tried (even the ones I bought from the dentist at a hefty price).</li>
            <li> I have been using these for some time to treat dry mouth at night due to using cpap.  They are wonderful.  Keep my mouth moist and are completely gone in the morning.  No need to scrape off residue as you do with other xylitol discs.</li>
            <li> These do work but sometimes they fall off during the night.</li>
            <li> Xylimelts work for me.  I used it when I had dry mouth resulting from taking prescription pain medicine.  It tastes good and it lasted for about six hours before melting away in my mouth as I slept.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My mom orders these for her chronic dry mouth, she said she has tried EVERYTHING and these offer the most relief. The only thing she wishes is that they had more flavors.</li>
            <li> Keeps mouth moist, much better to wake up to!!</li>
            <li> Work just as they claim.</li>
            <li> These work great @ keeping your mouth moist. I use to get sores in my mouth from have a dry mouth. Big plus they taste great and freshen you breath. Something that is had to do with a dry mouth. I will be ordering more today. The price is reasonable to.</li>
            <li> My mom used these while undergoing chemotherapy (R-CHOP), which often leads to gum problems. She put in one mint every night before going to bed, and then another one if she wakes up during the night. Worked wonders for her -- she did not have any problems with her gums or teeth. And the chemo worked! :-)</li>
            <li> XyliMelts really worked to solve my night dry mouth problem. I use a CPAP and tho it has a humidifier, the air pressure still dried me out.  These tablets really solved that.  I don&#x27;t need the tablet every night, but I&#x27;ve taken to using one each night anyway, so I don&#x27;t wake up needing one.  Occasionally I have some slightly crusty drool residue when I awake in the morning, but it is slight and not really a problem; certainly worth it for the sleep comfort I get. A side benefit I discovered is that they help me when I&#x27;m having trouble with slow digestion (a hazard of age); even tho I might have dinner early, 3 hrs later I can often feel my meal has still not digested enough for going to bed. Placing a XyliMelts tab on my gums after dinner creates more saliva which helps my digestion.</li>
            <li> This product may only work if you have saliva in your mouth to dissolve and circulate it.  If you have severe dry mouth (as is my case) it is completely useless.  I recommend going with a spray like Oasis.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Xylimelts in a mint flavor and the mint is a mild spearmint, and not too bad, I just have to get used to it.  They seem to work best when I sleep  on my back.</li>
            <li> Keeps mouth from drying up too much. Slight after taste in morning.</li>
            <li> You did a great job and I was very pleased  Thank you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ann Hill</li>
            <li> XyliMelts has been an amazing help.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I wish it did not dissolve so quickly. i found this product to be very helpful in the short run say about one hour. I showed my dentist what I was taking and she agreed that it was a good product for me. She also suggested that I chew sugarless gum as some brands contain Xylitrol and this has been proved to prevent tooth decay in European studies.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s every thing I expected.</li>
            <li> I only get fair results. Also, they don&#x27;t seem to stick to my gums as they are supposed to. Would not buy again.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer Biotien mouth wash.&lt;br /&gt;F.</li>
            <li> I have continuous dry mouth due to the many medications I take.  Nothing had really worked before.  My Dad recommended Xylimelts.  They really take care of the problem.</li>
            <li> When I used them at night, I found one on my pillow and the product, which was supposed to help with dry mouth didn&#x27;t seem to last long.</li>
            <li> Xylimelts met all expectations. I would recommend them to anybody for dry mouth. They sure get the job done. You should get some right away.</li>
            <li> I use Biotene mouthwash morning and night and was hoping that these tablets would hydrate my mouth and gums in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problems:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a while for them to stick to your gums, and even then they fall loose.&lt;br /&gt;Whichever tooth it&#x27;s stuck to feels sensitive after only 2-3 minutes of having it your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Your mouth will be just as dry as ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the original (blue bottle) Biotene has been reformulated, so unless Biotene&#x27;s new PBF formula (in the green bottle) with ingredients SIMILAR (but not identical) to the original blue Biotene formula compares, looks like I&#x27;m out of options for dry mouth.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s dentist wants my husband to use this before he puts on his BiPAP each night.  Apparently the enamel in on his teeth becomes more vulnerable to tooth decay bacteria when he has dry mouth.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful pills if you have dry mouth.  Helps one sleep through the night with out mouth wash every hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have Sjogrens Syndrome  Ilove  this pill and would tell everyone it is wonderful...Please don,t take it away.</li>
            <li> In my experience, they don&#x27;t last the whole night, but the taste is pleasant, and if you use two at a time they work best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application is sometimes tricky, because they don&#x27;t always stick to your tooth immediately. But once they&#x27;re in, the usually stay in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have awakened to find myself in the middle of chewing on them, however. Not much I can do about that, I suppose.</li>
            <li> Taking meds doesn&#x27;t necessarily dry your mouth. They do change the enzymes in your saliva and that can cause decay. I paid $20 for 20 tabs at the pharmacy. This was a great find. They seem to work on nights I feel dry from asthma med.  Do they help decay? I won&#x27;t know for years. I&#x27;m a former dental assistant.</li>
            <li> Waking up in the morning with severe dry mouth is a real bummer. Now I put two mints in my mouth just before turning out the lamp to go to sleep and I wake up without the pain and discomfort of feeling parched. I was skeptical, but now I am a believer!</li>
            <li> The product has always been great.  I find it hard to find in stock at Rite Aid or Walgreens and have ended up with product that isn&#x27;t as good when I try what they have in stock.  I ordered from Amazon, and it came packed in a box with my other purchases.  When I opened the shipping box both boxes of Xylimelts were open with the product pulled out and sitting it the box separately....I don&#x27;t know why this was done.  There was plenty of room in the box.  I am alarmed to have the product opened like this due to tampering.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it from the store if the seal was broken.</li>
            <li> Really works for dry mouth problems; far better than Biotene, etc.</li>
            <li> Perfect for dry mouth.  I only have dry mouth at night.  These help tremendously!!</li>
            <li> These little things have been a Godsend to me.  I used to wake up several times a night with cotton mouth due to medications.  One of these on my gums and I am good all night.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about others, but these require two hours plus to melt in my mouth.  I have to be careful not to start them within two hours of a meal.</li>
            <li> Works better than other products I have tried. Was recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li> I have been using these day and night. They really do adhere and stay put. They dissolve slowly enough that one lasts all night for me. Glad to have gotten a sample from my dentist.</li>
            <li> They work.  I have dry mouth all the time due to meds i must take. Use these at night instead of drinking water</li>
            <li> I like the way the mints have a concave side that keeps them in place through the night. I&#x27;m usually awake after five hours and normally some of the mint is unmelted and still in place. I wish they were less expensive but the best costs more.</li>
            <li> Not perfect but very good!</li>
            <li> Expensive, but really work well.  Have sleep apnea machine and these helped my dry mouth.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended these to use at night for my extreme dry mouth.  It is great to find something I can have in my mouth all the time without damaging my teeth with sugar.</li>
            <li> After working with all sorts of toothpastes, gels, mouthwashes my doctor recommended this product.  It is heaven-sent.  I am very satisfied!</li>
            <li> I admit I was pretty hopeful about these. They don&#x27;t feel comfortable anywhere in my mouth, and the last little bit stuck to the gum doesn&#x27;t melt away, it just stays stuck there until I pull it off, even if it&#x27;s been in my mouth all night.</li>
            <li> They help me make it through the night. I used to get up about every 90 minutes or so because my mouth was so dry. Now I sleep through the night.</li>
            <li> Excellent! No longer wake during the night to drink water.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist.  They help.  Forget that you even have them in your mouth.  Yes I recommend to folks with dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Great idea, doesn&#x27;t work for me. They will not stay in position. Impossible for me to attach.</li>
            <li> these are 15 dollars from dentist. why so expensive online. they do work very well. better than anything else ve tried</li>
            <li> My husband has suffered with dry mouth for a long time, caused my two medications that he takes. We have tried so many products, spray and rinses and nothing worked.  My dentist gave me a sample of XYLIMELTS and from the first night my husband felt they really worked.  The tablet is easy to use, it attaches to either your gums or teeth and isn&#x27;t uncomfortable during sleep.  Great product that will help so many people that suffer with dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice it soothing dry mouth.  I guess it worked . I didn&#x27;t notice much of an affect on dry mouth from use of a CPAP machine</li>
            <li> Good product. Helps with chronic dry mouth.</li>
            <li> This is my third order of Xylimelts Mints that I have purchased and I am so glad that there is a product like this available for people like me who suffer extreme dry mouth.  One tab lasts at least 2 hours, sometimes more.  This has become a regular part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li> This is a review for the product.  I haven&#x27;t purchased it through Amazon yet, but will be doing so later this week so that I can get the larger 80 count supplies as it&#x27;s cheaper on here than where I can get it locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These were recommended to me by my dental hygienist when she found out that everything else I had tried either didn&#x27;t work, or I had allergic reactions to.  I would absolutely recommend these to anyone who suffers from EXTREME dry mouth due to medical issues and medication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I hate chewing gum, I&#x27;m someone who would go through a few packs a day in an effort to keep my mouth semi-moist.  Ever wake up at night with gum stuck in your hair?  Not a pretty picture.  I share that only because the people with extreme dry mouth will know where I&#x27;m coming from.  That&#x27;s been me for years now.  My mouth is so dry, that if you were to stick me in a room without something to suck on and/or some water I would start getting anxious pretty quickly.  In fact, I don&#x27;t go anywhere without a bottle of water.  If I can&#x27;t have my water, I don&#x27;t go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using these for 5 days now, however I haven&#x27;t chewed a single piece of gum in those five days.  Unlike most of the reviews I&#x27;ve read, I do seem to go through a few more at night and during the day than what I read.  But I do also have that severe of a dry mouth and am very aware and sensitive to it, so perhaps I want my mouth to be more moist than some. I don&#x27;t know. We all have our preferences.  Because this is such a big deal to me, I know it is to others as well, so I will share how much I use them thus far in an effort to give anyone who might be thinking, &amp;#34;But what if my mouth is even dryer?&amp;#34; or something like that an idea of how much might be used to try and relieve it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At bedtime, I use two. I place one on the roof of my mouth and one on the outside of my jaw between my gumline and cheek.  Once my wisdom tooth extraction is healed (fun experience after 40)  I&#x27;ll likely do both on the roof of my mouth though as I do notice that my cheek doesn&#x27;t care for the tablet.  I think it&#x27;s because of the very slight abrasive quality of it, not because of the chemical compound.  The roof of my mouth doesn&#x27;t have the same reaction.  These will last me half the night.  I wake up in the middle of the night and the one on my roof will have melted where the one at my cheek will still have about 1/3 left.  Likely because I tend to rub my tongue against the one of my roof as I feel the need to moisten my mouth.  I don&#x27;t wake up in the middle of the night needing to drink water from the dryness, though I do usually sort of swish my mouth out before adding the second pair because I have found that I don&#x27;t care for the &amp;#34;slippery&amp;#34; feeling it leaves on the inside of my cheek where saliva has pooled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the day is really dependent upon what I&#x27;m doing as to how many I use.  By experience, I&#x27;ve actually used more when in situations where I&#x27;m not talking and alone than I have when in those where I am talking and with others. So I&#x27;m likely not needing them as much when alone, just am more aware of the desire not to have a dry mouth or will rub my tongue against them and make them melt more swiftly.  I only use one at a time during the day.  Yesterday I was out and in a 6 hour time period filled with constant conversation, I used 3.  But, I barely drank any water and even left my water behind at one point.  Unheard of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as I don&#x27;t have any unforeseen long-term reactions to this product, it is hands down the best thing I have found when it comes to chronic dry mouth due to medical conditions and medications.  I would go as far as to say that for me, this will be life changing in a positive way.  I haven&#x27;t tried the mint free type yet, but will be ordering some of those soon as I would prefer mint free if they work just as good.  I also haven&#x27;t tried the other brand of these I&#x27;ve seen at CVS, only because it has many more ingredients in it and I&#x27;m trying to be hyper aware of what I put in my body.  These have the least amount of ingredients of anything I have found and as the package states they CONTAIN NO: animal products, fermentable sugar, corn protein, colors, dyes, artificial flavors, preservatives, nuts, wheat, rice, gluten, soy, egg, fish, shellfish, milk, or yeast.  While that doesn&#x27;t take care of all my concerns, it takes care of some of the biggest and is certainly better than what I had been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who is desperate for relief from dry mouth.  There&#x27;s nothing that has come close to comparison for me.</li>
            <li> This is everyting the 4 to 5 star reviews said it was.  My wife at night has a towel under her head near the mouth.</li>
            <li> These work well if you&#x27;re on a mouth drying medication. My dentist recommends to prevent tooth decay.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about whether the tablet would really stick, but they REALLY STICK! I usually put it on the outside of one of my molars or the gums beneath them. The dry mouth is definitely better and I wake up with minty fresh breath!</li>
            <li> My wife uses these nightly. Says they certainly provide oral moisture.</li>
            <li> Living in the desert simply makes dry mouth a more regular occurrence for me.  My hygienist suggested the XyliMelts and provided a couple of sample tablets.  The result was having moisture throughout the night; no dryness in my mouth.  That&#x27;s why I ordered there here and found delivery speedy and continuing use a success.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for anyone with dry mouth.  If you use a C-PAP machine, these can be used either before putting the mask on, or in the morning after brushing teeth in the morning.  Excellent product!</li>
            <li> Everything satisfactory.</li>
            <li> Xlimelts really work for someone who suffers from dry mouth. I have Diabetes and sleep with a C-pap Machine and they works so well that I have recommended them to friends and now they are using them. My son-in-law, a periodontist, was the oned who got me some to try and they worked. Amazon has the best price for them also.</li>
            <li> This product is a great help for those with dry mouth; it&#x27;s easy to use, especially when you&#x27;re on the go</li>
            <li> As far as I can find there are only two products that work like this. Xylimelts and OraMoist. Both are time release patches that release Xylitol. From what I can determine both release 500 mg of Xylitol, although Xylimelts may release only 250 mg, 500 in total when two are used, as recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have radiation induced dry mouth and have been looking for ways to alleviate it at night when it is the worst. I tried OraMoist first but the recommended one patch did not last long enough. When I read that Xylimelt recommended using two, I tried using two OraMoist patches and found that they lasted through the night but produced a very sticky saliva that was unpleasant, although much better than the dry mouth. Then I tried the XyliMelts and found that I liked them better in that they did not produce the same stickiness. While they don&#x27;t seem to last as long, most do make it through the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a big difference in the ingredients which must account for the stickiness in the OraMoist patches.  Xylimelts contain only Xylitol, vegetable gum, cellulose gum, stearate of calcium/magnesium and mild natural peppermint. OraMoist contains Xylitol, stearate of magnesium, lemon flavor and twelve other chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, for my condition the Mint did, initially, caused a minor burning sensation, but, after the first time they no longer did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found that experimentation can determine what works best for you. I stopped using two at a time and found that one at a time worked better. Location in the mouth also seemed to affect the dissolve rate. Upper jaw, and in the far back, seems to dissolve slower than lower jaw towards the front. There is also inconsistency in the dissolve rate between tabs. I&#x27;ve had a few completely dissolve within 45 minutes. Others last through the night. Most last from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m but sometimes I need to use a second tab around 2 a.m.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A cup of water by the bedside to take gentle sips to reactivate the tab and for quick swallows to rinse down excessive goo in the throat is a big help. There is a bit of a balancing act that is necessary for optimal usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite these minor problems, this is the most effective solution that I&#x27;ve found to night time dry mouth problems.ivate the tab and for quick swallows to rinse down excessive goo in the throat is a big help. There is a bit of a balancing act that is necessary for optimal usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite these minor problems, this is the most effective solution that I&#x27;ve found to night time dry mouth problems.</li>
            <li> They work really well for dry mouth! I have the problem from taking medication and they help a great deal!</li>
            <li> Great for dry mouth even at night!</li>
            <li> these are great....they really help!</li>
            <li> I use them at bedtime.  Helps a lot. I only use one at a time. I think they are a little pricey.</li>
            <li> After completing 35 rounds of radiation for tongue cancer,I was left with very little saliva production. Dry mouth is an under statement. Night time is the worst. Up every hour,hour and a half for a drink and rinse. The XyliMelts have changed my life.I use 2 tabs at bed time, I sleep through the nite ,and my mouth and tongue are not dried out and stuck together when I wake up..The tabs stay in place and cause me no discomfort or worry. If you have dry mouth , give them a try,I hope you get as much relief as I do.</li>
            <li> Its doesn&#x27;t really help to well.</li>
            <li> I purchased these because I use a c-pap machine nightly. Numerous times during the night I would wake up and have to drink some water because my mouth was very dry. I&#x27;ve been told this is due to me mouth breathing. I now tuck one of these between my upper lip and gums and have no more dry mouth problem. I think for me it reminds me to keep my mouth closed. I&#x27;m very happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will mention here my husband tried them but didn&#x27;t care for them. He uses a full face c-pap mask,while I use a nasal mask. Also, I purchased the mint ones.</li>
            <li> Bought them for my wife, she loves them. And this with the best deal buying them on Amazon</li>
            <li> The XyliMelts caused a sore on the inside of my wife&#x27;s mouth.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS HELPFUL FO DRY MOUTH.  IT DOES CREATE AN ADDITIONAL PROBLEM BECAUSE IT THICKEENS THE MOISTURE IT CREATES THEREFORE MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT TO SWALLOW.</li>
            <li> Nice alternative to keeping your mouth moist.  No constant spraying or putting paste in your mouth like other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each tab last at least 1 1/2 to 2 hrs depending on how you use them.  I can&#x27;t be without them and have a constant supply on .</li>
            <li> TERRIFIC PRODUCT. MY DENTIST RECOMMNEDED THIS PRODUCT TO ME, FOR DRY MOUTH, WHICH ALSO CAUSED ME TO HAVE A CHRONIC SEVERE DRY COUGH. BEFORE USNG ZYLIMELTS, I USED TO WAKE  UP SEVERAL TIME A NIGHT WITH  A CHRONIC DRY COUGH, [CAUSED FROM LACK OF SALIVA], DRY MOUTH. NOW I JUST SLEEP WITH ZYLIMELTS IN MY MOUTH [THEY ADHERE TO MY GUMS] AND I NO LONGER WAKE UP WITH A DRY COUGH. ALSO  THIS PRODUCT HAS DECREASED THE AMOUNT OF CAVITIES I GET, DUE TO DRY MOUTH, [LESS SALIVA], MY DENTIST INFORMED ME THAT CHRONIC DRY MOUTH, WAS THE CAUSE OF INCREASED CAVITIES [EVEN THOUGH I TOOK EXCELLANT CARE OF MY TEETH], I WAS STILL PRONE TO INCREASED CAVITIES.THE COST OF SAVING ONE TOOTH, [CAUSED FROM DRY MOUTH]  CAN COST 2,500-3,500! BY USING ZYLIMELTS I HAVE SAVED SO MUCH MONEY IN DENTAL BILLS.  BEST OF ALL THIS PRODUCT ZYLIMELTS HAS MADE MY LIFE SO MUCH EASIER, AS I USED TO HAVE A CHRONIC DRY COUGH, AND HAD TO CARRY  WATER WITH ME EVERY WHERE I WENT. NOW I CAN SPEAK IN FRONT OF PEOPLE, WITHOUT THE  ANNOYING, EMBARRASING, CHRONIC DRY COUGH, THAT I HAD FOR  MANY YEARS. NOW I  JUST PUT A ZYLIMELT IN MOUTH  [THEY ADHERE TO MY GUMS]  AND I NO LONGER HAVE TO CARRY WATER WITH ME EVERY PLACE I GO. I HAVE SPOKEN TO OTHER M.D.&#x27;S ABOUT THIS PRODUCT AND THEY ARE ALL IN AGREEMENT THAT THIS IS AN EXCELLANT, SAFE, AND NESSESARY  PRODUCT, FOR PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC DRY MOUTH, AND BEING A NURSE FOR 35 YEARS I AGREE!! I WILL CONTINUE TO USE THIS PRODUCT. IT HAS BEEN LIFE CHANGING. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS  PRODUCT TO ANYONE THAT HAS CHRONIC DRY MOUTH,  AND THIS 5 STAR SELLER*************************</li>
            <li> Love these things. keep them in my bag, car and end table.</li>
            <li> For my condition they work the best: CPAP user with sleep apnea and extreme dry mouth condition.</li>
            <li> Amazing product !My RA doctor recommended it. During the night I used to wake myself up because I couldn&#x27;t swallow and panicked. Not anymore. I use them every time I sleep and even during the day if I&#x27;m having dry mouth problems. I had a &amp;#34;double-whammy&amp;#34; because my psychiatric meds really dry out my mouth. And a dry mouth can lead to TOOTH DECAY, so even my dentist is happy!&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> In the morning, I wake up with my mouth moist instead of DRY!  It&#x27;s amazing how it sticks to my gum inside my mouth and stays there.</li>
            <li> I have a dry mouth only during the night ever since I contracted mumps. Mumps is a inflammation of the salivary glands. I try to brush, floss and rinse before going to sleep but I still got bad breath in the morning. I have used biotene toothpaste and mouthwash which helps during the day but it still did not help during the night. Then I tried xylimelts. I take two tablets and stick them next to top teeth in the rear. They slowly release xylitol that kills germs overnight and sweetness of it seems to help with saliva production as well. Now I wake up with fresh, wet mouth.</li>
            <li> I have been using a C-Pap for 3 years and my mouth would get unbearably dry, I tried several products before I discovered XyliMelts.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I did not read the instructions well (you know how that is) until I had been using it for some time. HOWEVER, I READ THEM AGAIN AND FOUND OUT I WAS NOT USING THE PRODUCT CORRECTLY....ONCE I STARTED USING IT THE RIGHT WAY IT HAS BEEN WONDERFUL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY RECOMMEND XYLIMELTS FOR ANYONE USING A C-PAP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maidee</li>
            <li> wow, these are great for some of us with dry mouth....really work well and what a great idea.</li>
            <li> These are the best mints for dry mouth, hands down. Plus there&#x27;s no chemicals in them.</li>
            <li> I absolutely would recommend this product to anyone who has a problem with dry mouth overnight.  I was getting up at least once a night with coughing spells and either got a cough drop or cough syrup.  Since a friend&#x27;s dentist gave her some XyliMelts samples and she shared with me, I have slept through comfortably.  I have spread the word to my dentist and all friends who have need of such a product.  Thank you for this.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for my husband who have dentures. He couldn&#x27;t hold it in his mouth at night while wearing his C-pap. My sister, who has a CPAP also but has her own teeth, thinks it is very good for keeping your mouth moist at night.</li>
            <li> I Have dry mouth from meds and have cavities as a result, I&#x27;ve been looking for a product to help and this is it! My dentist thinks they&#x27;re great too. I put two in at night and no more dry mouth!</li>
            <li> Use these when I go to bed to leave in my mouth while I sleep.  They were recommended by a friend who said that they helped her received wonderful reviews at dental visits.  Amazon Prime shipping is great.</li>
            <li> Pros: I sleep with my mouth wide open and always wake up with very dry mouth and sore throat. Drinking water during the night didn&#x27;t help. I tried Biotene and that didn&#x27;t help, either, it seemed as if made it worse actually. These pills are great, easy to apply and they do create lots of saliva. Waking up is more pleasant, and there is no need to sip water throughout the night. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with sticking them to gums. I use only one at night , on the gum all the way in the back.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Flavor. It&#x27;s like super sweet minty, feels like I&#x27;ve been chewing fresh gum all night.  But it is worth it. I will try non-minty ones</li>
            <li> MY WIFE USES IT.  SHE SAYS THEY SHOULD BE SMALLER MAYBE OVAL INSTEAD OF ROUND. THEY ONLY LAST ABOUT 4 HRS., BUT THAT WORKS FOR NOW.  WILL KEEP TRYING OTHER THINGS.</li>
            <li> Very long  lasting and convenient to use. Taste is good as well. This is the only product I have found that works.</li>
            <li> Very helpful for dry mouth.</li>
            <li> No financial interest in this product!  This product was recommended by my ENT doctor due to the fact I suffer from a dry mouth from the autoimmune disease Sjogrens Syndrome.  It is the better than Biotiine products for oral dryness.  I hight recommend Xylimelts for anyone suffering from oral dryness!</li>
            <li> I have a condition called burning mouth in addition to dry mouth.  The Zylimelts have helped me so much at night to keep my mouth wet &amp; also take my mind off the burning mouth.  I also use them during the day &amp; when I am shopping as my mouth seems to get so dry going in &amp; out of stores.</li>
            <li> Have terrible dry mouth at night!!!  Tried using other products before bed, did not work.  Reading reviews for other product found that other people were using Xylimelts with success, decided to try them.  Now I wake up and my mouth does NOT feel like the desert!  I can not remember the wonderful feeling of being able to swallow when I first wake up!  Wonderful!!!</li>
            <li> These do help with a dry mouth, but only for a short time.  They are still better than competitive products.</li>
            <li> Mom has problems with dry mouth. She uses these over night, and reports they are WONDERFUL! Best thing she&#x27;s ever used. Highly recommend if you have the condition.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipper</li>
            <li> This is the only product that provided me some relief the only reason I gave it a 4 is because I end up using alot of them and the cost is too high but when I need relief while teaching they work</li>
            <li> I have dry mouth related to Sjorgren&#x27;s syndrome.  These lozenges do a wonderful job keeping my mouth moist overnight.  I&#x27;ve tried many brands and Xylimelts are the best!</li>
            <li> I like the premise of this product but wish it would last longer than the 3 hours max because I sleep longer than 3 hours!  I use this at night. I use this in conjunction with Biotene Gel and seems to work better.</li>
            <li> Use these every night!</li>
            <li> Had cancer surgery and Radiation that messed up my salivary glands etc,  always had very dry mouth and tried many products like Biotene.  These are the only little tabs that work,  Put in your mouth when you go to bed and your mouth stays moist all night, wonderful little tabs.</li>
            <li> i had a radical neck dissection and radiation for tonsil cancer and both my radiation oncologist and dentist said I have the worst dry mouth they have ever seen. I have tried many products in the 20 months since I finished radiation and these are the only things that work. They also protect against decay which is a big issue with dry mouth.&lt;br /&gt;  Jeanne M. Eagle Lake Resort, CA</li>
            <li> it works for sleep.  word word word word word word word word: a wordy sentence.  enough and four more words.</li>
            <li> awesome product for people using CPAP with dry mouth problems Highly recommend this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product for help with dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Use them nitely...helps me sleep thru the night .</li>
            <li> my husband has dry mouth syndrome and this works; he has tried many other gums; sprays and this is the best.</li>
            <li> only product I found to help dry mouth!!!Take it before going to bed and let it dissolve slowly. Highly recommend it..</li>
            <li> Works great. Stays put next to cheek and gum. I don&#x27;t have dry mouth at night anymore (a side effect of my RX). I prefer the mint. It is not real strong flavor - just right. I&#x27;d recommend to any one.</li>
            <li> For overnite relief of severe dry mouth...these are wonderful. No more congested throat or painful tongue. Like the mint flavor best.</li>
            <li> If you have dry mouth at night, this is the ticket.  It is the only thing that I have found that really takes care of the problem at night.</li>
            <li> I like everything about the Mints: they ease my continual dry mouth, they taste good and they sit on my gum while I talk or sing and don&#x27;t get in my way.  I&#x27;m so glad someone invented them!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it, the only way I could use was when I stuck two together and made a pill that I could dissolve and then spit out the sticky stuff.  A plain sugar free hard candy, or mint, works just as well!</li>
            <li> I hate waking up in the middle of the night with my tongue stuck to the roof of my mouth.  This seems to happen a lot since I suffer with allergies and have a tendency to sleep with my mouth open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I need to use 2 XyliMelts during the night to keep my mouth from totally drying up, but generally I only need to use one.  I pop it into my mouth right before I get into bed and position it where I want it to stick.  Within a few seconds it is secure and I don&#x27;t have to worry about swallowing it while I am asleep.  The XyliMelts have a pleasant minty taste that I can still taste in the morning when I get up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the way the product works and have been using it for about a year now.</li>
            <li> Love,love,love these for dry mouth symptoms. between meds and mouth breathing at night, I had terrible dry mouth. These Xylimelts  are the perfect solution. I highly recommend them for anyone battling dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my Mother who is 93 and was suffering from a dry mouth at night so much so that she was very wakeful all thru the night and had to drink water frequently which disturbed her sleep. She has had great relief with these and we will reorder. She does wake up once or twice but a sip of water helps and she falls back asleep. Very glad we found something to help~</li>
            <li> Works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Keep my mouth comfortably moist all night!</li>
            <li> I have been using xylimints for years..</li>
            <li> No more available this product at any local Pharmacy stores- only on Amazon and we are so happy to find it eventually. Of course, I would recommend it for my friends.</li>
            <li> i really could not sleep at night without them.....they make my life better</li>
            <li> These really work and last almost the entire night.  Especially if you put them way in the back of your mouth on the outside of your teeth.  It really helps keep my mouth from getting parched.  I recommend them.  I prefer the mint-free, but either the mint or mint-free work well.  The mint-free ones are just less obvious in your mouth because the flavor is not as noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have to use a C Pap machine at night time and it was giving me a very bad dry mouth.  The Xylimelts  mints seem to be taking care of the dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Xylimelts work well for my dry mouth.  They won&#x27;t rot your teeth. I like the mint ones the best</li>
            <li> These really help. I usually have a route canal and crown done every time I go to the dentist. Thankfully, this time I only had two small cavities. I have a sever dry mouth, especially at night. I use these along with biotene, and it&#x27;s really helped.</li>
            <li> I have  been using these for a few months now at night. One in each cheek at bedtime and no more CPAP dry mouth!</li>
            <li> I use a CPAP at night when I sleep.  Even with the water humidified, I often awaken with a dry mouth.  Once I discovered these gems, I have much less of a dry mouth problem.  I use two at a time.  My dentist has assured me that they are not harmful to my teeth.  So glad I found these!</li>
            <li> IT WORKS FOR HOURS. I USE IT NIGHTLY FOR DRY MOUTH. I RECOMMEND IT. I WISH I HAD HEARD OF THIS YEARS AGO.</li>
            <li> I take medication which causes dry mouth so my dentist recommended this product.  It is absolutely wonderful!  The instructions say to put one tablet between cheek and gums with white side toward cheek before going to bed.  One side sticks to the gums so you don&#x27;t swallow it and choke and it moisturizes your mouth all night which lessens the chance of tooth decay, as it slowly dissolves.</li>
            <li> Both dentists I have been to recommend Bioteen for dry mouth.  These are great during the day preventing dry mouth. Made with xylitol makes me feel better since I have read research showing xylitol is good for preventing cavities.</li>
            <li> My dry mouth issues have improved substantially. I don&#x27;t have to use them daily anymore just at night. I recommended then to my sister who absolutely loves them</li>
            <li> It works. I wanted to eliminate dry mouth I have been pleased as punch. It worked on the first night. Thank uou</li>
            <li> I just got diagnosed with Sjogrens and was looking for something to help my extreme dry mouth.  I bought these upon the recommendation of some other people on Facebook....but found that they did not produce saliva and they were just plain annoying in my mouth.  You stick the adhesive side to your gum/tooth and then sleep with it in your mouth all night......no way.  It bothered me and did not work well enough to continue.  And the price is really steep.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Great for dry mouth.  I have dry mouth due to prescriptions I take.  I started using these melts several months ago and was so happy that they really helped with my dry mouth issues.</li>
            <li> These are great for dry mouth.  They will stick to your gum and slowly dissolve while sleeping.  Also refreshing.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time for my dry mouth that I get with my CPAP machine and it helps.</li>
            <li> My wife get dry mouth when she has to speak publicly and these really work for her. She is going to them all the time now!!</li>
            <li> My dentist, who&#x27;s been around the block a couple of times and has always had wise and frugal advice, recommended these to me. The result has been great. The tablet stays put, melts at a rate of hours, tastes minty but not powerful, stimulates saliva and has eliminated my mouth dryness since I began using it. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks. I usually like to wait to rate a product like this until I&#x27;ve had more time to see if there is a down side but so far it has worked so well I thought I&#x27;d go ahead and pass along my experience with it. My wife is very particular about ingredients and found nothing she was concerned about for me in this product. I don&#x27;t really have allergies (no concerns about ingredients) so others may find concern in the vague vegetable gums ingredient but it hasn&#x27;t been a problem for me. I recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I started using Xylimelts about a year ago. It is such a pleasure not have dry mouth. I use them primarily&lt;br /&gt;When I work out and at bedtime. My usual source no longer carries them. I found them on Amazon&lt;br /&gt;And stocked up!</li>
            <li> For anyone who knows what it&#x27;s like to have your CPAP machine remove every molecule of water from your mouth (despite the machine&#x27;s humidifier), I think this is real progress. Forget putting &amp;#34;biotene gel behind your upper incisiors.&amp;#34; This actually works. Recommended for CPAP sufferers everywhere.</li>
            <li> I really like how long this moisturizers my mouth at night. I have dry mouth and burning tongue so the mint was nice and mild so I could tolerate it.</li>
            <li> I am a head and neck cancer survivor of 10 years. I have suffered from extreme nighttime dry mouth due to radiation. I loved the idea of this mint sticking in place and keeping my teeth lubricated. I used it before bed and it worked just fine. I finally got relief. Only one hitch, the liquid the mint created dripped into my throat while I was laying down.  Long story short, it caused annoying post nasal drip hacking cough.</li>
            <li> My dentist gave me a sample of these to combat waking up with a painfully dry mouth (thanks, Diabetes!) at my last checkup, and the three tablets I had worked pretty well. Sure, I woke up with a minty slime that was hard to get out of my [[ASIN:B0036WTV2C dental protector]], but it was better than feeling like I had sand in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I jumped right in and bought the 80-pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By night 14, I noticed my teeth felt much more sensitive, even though I was paying attention and rotating where I was putting the tablet each night. (Incidentally, I never tacked them to my teeth, as one of the recommended placements)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By night 20, my teeth straight up hurt. I was about to go to the dentist, but decided to stop using Xylimelts to make sure it wasn&#x27;t the cause. Within three days, everything was back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My guess is that it has something to do with having sensitive teeth, since pain doesn&#x27;t seem to be a very common complaint with this product. Regardless, my experience wasn&#x27;t too great.</li>
            <li> The only decent dry mouth product I&#x27;ve used is MedActive lozenges. This product works no better than a tic tac. And no matter what people are saying, the effect does not outlast the mint.&lt;br /&gt;Way too expensive for what it does.</li>
            <li> We found this product after my husband was treated for throat cancer with radiation. Treatment was successful (thank you lord) and these help with the resulting mouth and throat dryness. Excellant product!</li>
            <li> I use these almost every night as I not only use a CPAP which often makes the air around my mouth drier but just b/c of the winter the dryness in the air is ugly at night. Just pop one in your mouth when you lay down and it sticks to the side and helps create saliva flow all through the night. Sometimes I need to pop a new one in midway through the night but it just takes a second. Xylimelts are a mouth/teeth.gum saver!</li>
            <li> My husband received some samples from his dentist.  He uses a CPAP with oxygen, plus he has the dryness of Parkinson&#x27;s and all that medication.  Between this and ACT mouthwash he is receiving much needed relief.</li>
            <li> Great, but my still a bit dry due to food &amp; environmental allergies... But they help with two</li>
            <li> I sleep with my mouth open due to allergies. My bedroom is hot, so I&#x27;ve a fan on in summer and winter.  Had been waking up with a sock in mouth taste in my mouth...dry as the desert.  That&#x27;s bad for your teeth and your throat. Two of these in my mouth and I wake up with some saliva left!  Love how it &amp;#34;sticks&amp;#34; to your mouth. Great flavor: not overpowering.  This has become a nightly routine.</li>
            <li> I would recommend you try a small box of these before you buy the larger box that is less money per lozenge.  These are far better than nothing, but far less than ideal too.  I&#x27;m off to look for alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;- minty flavor is refreshing and helps with drymouth bad breath&lt;br /&gt;- it sort of helps keep the saliva level up in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;- the amount of additional saliva is marginal at best.&lt;br /&gt;- you have to keep the lozenge in the bottom of your month to to get any&lt;br /&gt;- the lozenges are very big.  I&#x27;m a big boy with big teeth, but they are too big to really adhere to a tooth, and generally end up at the bottom of my mouth in the crease.&lt;br /&gt;- they are awful sweet.  If you don&#x27;t like sugary foods, you won&#x27;t enjoy the flavour of these.  They say to use 2 at night.  I can only stand to use one.</li>
            <li> I buy these mints for a relative who says they are wonderful. She has a serious dry-mouth problem, and she uses them all the time, and say they really help her. The order always arrives promptly, and undamaged, and i have ordered them multiple times.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  I use them mostly at night.  My mouth stays moist the entire night.  Before Xylimelts, I would wake up every 2 to 3 hours with a very dry mouth.  It&#x27;s great to be able to sleep 7 hours straight.</li>
            <li> you will have to ask the wife</li>
            <li> I bought these for my mother who has suffered from dry mouth for two years. Recommended to her by her doctor, it took her a while to mention it, as she had tried nearly every other product on the market. It has literally been like magic for her!  An answer to a prayer.</li>
            <li> I have an illness called Sjogrens&#x27;, a form of arthritis. It drys your joints out. It drys your eyes out. It dries your mouth out. Xyliments help keep my mouth moist which helps my mouth, gums and teeth. They are great for cotton mouth for sure. They have helped improve my teeth and gums. Excellent product! I am so pleased with them I order them every month. They are like tabs that stick to your gums, so during the night you  put them in and go to sleep. In the morning, no dry mouth. They have been a life saver to me. Thank you very much! Susan</li>
            <li> my husband has terrible dry mouth, possibly due to another medication.  He says this is the best relief he&#x27;s found.  He sticks one on each side of his mouth (on teeth, I think) and it slowly keeps his mouth moist through the night. the mint is very mild, he usually does not like mint, but does not mind this at all.</li>
            <li> Really does the job of reducing dry mouth at night or anytime.  Due to several medications and a c-pac for sleep apnea, I would wake up during the night feeling that my throat was closing in but not with 1 Xylimelts Mint. The only con is the price.</li>
            <li> Had to use two disks during the night instead of one of the Biotene brand. Did ok for the moisture</li>
            <li> Bought them for somebody, they use them all the time.</li>
            <li> These work really well</li>
            <li> This product has been very helpful to me at night.  I have serious dry-mouth problems due to various medications I take regularly. One of these at bedtime allows me to sleep without being awakened by the dry mouth.  I don&#x27;t use it during the day so don&#x27;t know how effective it might be for that purpose.</li>
            <li> My husband has dry mouth from medications he takes, so Xylimelts is the only way he can sleep comfortably at night without periodically waking to sip water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read great reviews for this product, especially for cancer patients who have had head and neck radiation and is dealing with dry mouth. I am 6 months post-radiation to the head and neck and is still having severe dry month. Talking to someone for a few minutes would result in my lips sticking to my gums so I had to find a solution. I ran across this product through reading online forums about cancer and dry mouths and thought I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it&#x27;s a good product, but it just wasn&#x27;t for me. It didn&#x27;t produce the results that I was expecting. It definitely produced some saliva, but not enough to where the XyliMelts would &amp;#34;flow&amp;#34; or taste right. It just made it pasty and I didn&#x27;t like that feeling in my mouth, especially if I didn&#x27;t have any water around. While, this is a good product, it just was not for me. I found greater result with just chewing Xylitol gum, which induced saliva production and didn&#x27;t give that pasty taste/feeling in my mouth.</li>
            <li> The best for dry mouth!</li>
            <li> A good product, recommended by my dentist, for dry mouth.  I use it daily.  Hoping I will keep my natural teeth longer.</li>
            <li> Finally a product that works for severe dry mouth at night.  Forget all other products.  This is used even for those patients that have had injury to salivary gland due to radiation therapy.  Great Product</li>
            <li> I suffer greatly from dry mouth... I have tried everything...rinses, gum, toothpaste, etc... but nothing works as well as this product!!!</li>
            <li> I pop one of these slow melting mints in my mouth between cheek and gum. It has a side that sticks to the gum, so it does not slip around in your mouth, or fall out if you open your mouth. I leave one on my nightstand to replace it, if it totally melts. Usually, one will last between 3-4 hours for me. I am a retired dental hygienist and trust the Xylitol products not to produce decay, unlike sugar based mints. Xylitol is a natural sweetener and is known to make teeth harder, so I use them with confidence.</li>
            <li> These are terrific at alleviating dry mouth while sleeping.  Just wish they were not so expensive.</li>
            <li> I have used the non minty ones in the past and they were great, but these! Oh man they were so minty I couldn&#x27;t sleep. :(. Going back to the non minty ones ASAP. Wish I could return these...</li>
            <li> I had throat cancer and suffer from dry mouth, especially at night.&lt;br /&gt;Each night I use two and tape my mouth shut preventing me from breathing&lt;br /&gt; through my mouth. Works like a charm. Thank you Xylimelts.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as expected and at great price.</li>
            <li> Do the trick for dryness</li>
            <li> I had very dry mouth due to health problems, woke up several times a night with dry mouth and trouble breathing.&lt;br /&gt;Ordered the Xylimelts, got here very quickly.  Took one at bed time, woke up about 4 hours later with slightly dry mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Took a second one and slept through the night.  Since then I have only taken one per night and slept well.  Sometimes my mouth is slightly dry when I wake up,but really great making it through the night.  Normally place the Xylimelt in the left side of the mouth between cheek and gum near the back of the mouth.  Works Great, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Best product for nighttime relief of dry mouth with CPAP therapy</li>
            <li> These are wonderful.  If your mouth is open much when you sleep theses help great.</li>
            <li> This has helped with my dry mouth problem will order again</li>
            <li> They do what they are supposed to do - keep your mouth from drying out at night - plus at my last dentist visit the hygenist said there was an improvement in my gums and teeth.</li>
            <li> These really help!  My throat and mouth used to get extremely dry at night, but these really help with no sugars, and adhere nicely to my gums without discomfort.</li>
            <li> works well for dry mouth.  Helps especially when you have to go to the dentist to have work done.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> This is the only product my dentist recommends for dry mouth.  Nothing else works.  I love these for when I cannot have water handy.  They definately work!</li>
            <li> These lozenges work great.  I&#x27;ve used them for over a year and highly recommend them.  I&#x27;ve found that they are most comfortable when I stick them to the roof of my mouth.  I bought mine from SPEC Sales - they had the best pricing and I received my delivery very quickly.</li>
            <li> Awesome for dry mouth during the night while asleep.  They stick to the side of the mouth to prevent swallowing during sleep.  I don&#x27;t know I I survived without them!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t imagine getting a good night&#x27;s sleep without XyliMelts.  Oral cancer left me with serious dry mouth.  Just one in my cheek enables me to sleep for hours in comfort.  I showed these to my oral surgeon who is now recommending them to all his patients.  Great product!!!</li>
            <li> Chronic dry mouth? Get Xylimelts!  Dentist recommended.</li>
            <li> The xylimelts came proptly as promised.  I use them every night and am very happy with the product.  Thank you.  E.M.</li>
            <li> Got this for my mom because she has dry mouth as an alternative to Biotene gel. She said it wasn&#x27;t nearly as helpful and she asked me to order the Biotene.</li>
            <li> This is about the 3rd order of these mints that we have received and we will keep reordering them. A little pricey but they do the job as described. My wife uses them every night to counteract the effects of the meds she is taking. It was recommended to her by her doctor.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time,</li>
            <li> Love it.  helps a lot.</li>
            <li> I really love the taste of these mints.They are slow to dissolve and will stay lodged against the teeth without moving..so would be safe for night time..if you have problems with dry mouth at night.I love the research that spoke of doctors using these for antibacterial properties before pt.s have surgeries.I like the fact that xylitol is decay inhibiting...so a great product all wrapped up into one super little mint.I will repurchase these.These are a great option to control breath issues as well even if you dont suffer from dry mouth.I use them while at work for a flavorful mint without the sugar...why not fight drymouth,breath issues,fight cavities and germs all in one step!By the way..I am very conservative in  my spending and feel these are really worth the .22/mint.I love them so  much I will occassionally share..lol</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product for dry mouth. It has a nice mint flavor and helps keep the mouth moist. Would recommend it to anyone that has dry mouth. My dry mouth is due to medication. I use them about 3 or 4 times a day.</li>
            <li> Solution to my problem!</li>
            <li> This is the best I have tried for dry mouth symptoms.  Will reorder.</li>
            <li> I bought the mint ones. My meds dry my mouth out and feels and tastes awful. These do work puts saliva in my mouth. I will continue to purchase</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this item works like it does. I have suffered with dry mouth and throat at night from night time medication for a long time. I have tried sprays, etc. and nothing lasted. My dental hygienist told me about this item, even gave me a sample. She showed me how and where to place it in my mouth. I was skeptical that night, got the tablet placed where she told me to. It worked! I wish it lasted a whole 7 or 8 hours but 4 hours is about the longest it will work. It is well worth the money and have put it on my subscribe and save so I will automaticaly get it.</li>
            <li> I like that these last so long.  I also like that I can order a large box of these at a time vs.a smaller quantity at the store.</li>
            <li> Just got it and tried it out last night.  Seems to work as advertised.  I didn&#x27;t wake up due to a dry mouth for the first time in years.</li>
            <li> These melts actually suction very well to the palate or the vestibule. I have used these during the day while I&#x27;m working,  I&#x27;m a dental hygienist, I can suction one in and it keeps my mouth from being too dry during patient treatment. They also will last the entire night.</li>
            <li> I did not like the mints.</li>
            <li> Terrible stuff..  I threw them away</li>
            <li> My medicine gives me dry mouth so much that I dislike meetings away from my desk knowing I will have to speak during the meetings. Water does not help in the long run, so I searched for something like this and found these. They sit nicely wherever you want them and I place mine on the roof of my mouth. They almost outlast a meeting if it does not go too long, and I plan to keep these on hand.</li>
            <li> They work. I use them every night when I go to bed.</li>
            <li> These work very well but they just don&#x27;t last during the day. I do find they last me longer at night although I&#x27;m not sure how that actually works. They are also pretty expensive which means I don&#x27;t use them as much as I would find beneficial.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get them to stick like they&#x27;re suppose to......... However, they&#x27;re not overpowering and they do help with dry mouth a lot better than a typical mint or hard candy.</li>
            <li> I use it a few times a day, sure help the burning in my mouth.  Love the service that Orahelath promotes.  I will continue to buy this from them</li>
            <li> I tried a number of different dry mouth options including washes, sprays and tablets and these were disappointing. You are instructed to stick them behind your molars, against your cheek. Well, they do stick there, but they cause that part of my mouth to get really dry! And then the mint that &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; from them, doesn&#x27;t really do anything for me. I get the idea is to cause your mouth to salivate, but it doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> They work better than anything I have tried.  Will be reordering.</li>
            <li> I am a CPAP user and had trouble with dry mouth overnight. These mints work wonders and keep my mouth moist all night. I use two overnight. I will definitely buy again when I run low!</li>
            <li> Keeps your mouth moist all night.</li>
            <li> Has worked well most of the time in the evening and night.  The main problem is finding the right place so that my apnea gear doesn&#x27;t press against the tablet.  But it definitely helps to keep moisture in my mouth.  It is the best product I have found that does the trick.</li>
            <li> Work really well for the entire night</li>
            <li> I use a Cpap breathing machine and wake up several times in the night because of a desert dry mouth.  Not good.  The Xylimelts correct that problem.  Amazing!</li>
            <li> I used to buy these at the Health Food Store and they stopped carrying them.&lt;br /&gt;I was so glad to find them on Amazon.  I love these.  If you have a CPAP&lt;br /&gt;machine or a mouth appliance they work great to help keep your mouth moisturized.</li>
