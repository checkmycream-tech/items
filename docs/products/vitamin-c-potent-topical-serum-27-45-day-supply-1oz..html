            <li>Awesome!</li>
            <li>However, it has been great for my skin.</li>
            <li>Order this product before from Natrual Skinshop and loved it.</li>
            <li>I should have known better than to purchase a product that had no reviews!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m glad I did!  </li>
            <li>Now I am using the incredible Nicole Bryl skincare (available on her website) and it&#x27;s wonderful, albeit very pricy.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to wear it under my makeup and that is fine with me, still getting great results.</li>
            <li>Well, that&#x27;s even more amazing then.  </li>
            <li>If anyone has info, would greatly appreciate an update - manufacturing company, I hope you are hearing us and will give us back the original!!!</li>
            <li>Will probably be ordering more in a month or so.</li>
            <li>I should have known better then to purchase a product that doesn&#x27;t offer a return policy unless the item is defective.</li>
            <li>my skin tone is more even now</li>
            <li>i used it,  smelled great,  but really didn&#x27;t notice that it had made any difference</li>
            <li>I ordered it from Amazon who sold it at a better price.</li>
            <li>Love the smell.  </li>
            <li>Love the feeling I get</li>
            <li>I feel it&#x27;s an excellent product for the low cost.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Love it :)</li>
            <li>I love how i look now.</li>
            <li>I even ordered more and i would like to make a correction: even though the bottle expires in 90days (according to the seller)</li>
            <li>&amp; I was completely satisfied w/</li>
            <li>and I see diminishing fine lines.</li>
            <li>it goes away rather quickly now :)</li>
            <li>Delivery on this item was fantastic.</li>
            <li>It truly brightens and smooth my skin.  </li>
            <li>and the results are still looking fabulous...</li>
            <li>Anyhow I trusted it thinking it would give me the same great results</li>
            <li>The best part of this for me is the even skin tone, my face is brighter and not dull looking (a face scrub also helps make that possible), and if I do start to get a blemish on my face</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true - the formula has changed (as noted on the source seller&#x27;s website).  </li>
            <li>This product smells and feel fresh when it is applied.  </li>
            <li>The old formula was a bit orange / brown and thinner - and absorbed better.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s even more hilarious is that the old bottle &amp; the new bottle have the EXACT list of ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have used other vitamin c serums that I enjoyed much more.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s original formula improved my skin&#x27;s tone &amp; texture and I received multiple compliments on my skin - and converted many friends to the product.</li>
            <li>Love this,but the first bottle I got,the serum was clear  </li>
            <li>that I think about it (there is huge difference between natural Vit C &amp; sythetic Vit C you can check that out for yourself).</li>
            <li>This is the first vitamin C serum I have used</li>
            <li>I have purchased this from groupon and it is my first vit c serum.</li>
            <li>THEY CHANGED THE FORMULA in the Crx Vitamin C 27% Potent Topical Serum.</li>
            <li>I remember it smelling very citrusy the first time I bought it.</li>
            <li>and this is pretty close to it and much cheaper.</li>
            <li>A bit sticky, but definitely see a difference in my skin right away-I&#x27;m sold!!</li>
            <li>I hope they revert back to the original formula, and will be the first on board if so...</li>
            <li>I use this product twice a day and believe me, I have seen a huge  difference in my facial skin.</li>
            <li>It also leaves my skin very sticky.</li>
            <li>I really like this product start every morning with it .</li>
            <li>Thanks Shirl Schaub</li>
            <li>and this one is  very milky in color.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care so much about the formula, but rather</li>
            <li>Vitamin C is one of the most essential ingredients for mature skin.  </li>
            <li>I bought two bottles of this through a Groupon special back in October 2013.  </li>
            <li>That tells me the new formula is a much cheaper inferior product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>If you are prone to getting pimples or have sensitive skin like me, I do not recommend this product at all!!</li>
            <li>I am being honest &amp; trying to save some people the headache of wasting their money on an shoddy product.</li>
            <li>Whereas the old version, brightened my skin, faded dark spots, plumped me up, gave me a healthy even skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I was told that the chemist was &amp;#34;out of the office&amp;#34; when I asked for a new list of ingredients.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it I am 47 years old</li>
            <li>90days are for them to make more money but keep using the serum until bottle its empty!!!!</li>
            <li>It left huge patches of dry skin all over my face for almost a week until I could get it under control.</li>
            <li>LET ME BE COMPLETELY CLEAR ABOUT MY REVIEW, it in noway, shape or form pertains to the seller, naturalskinshop.com.</li>
            <li>It is now a clear gel &amp; it smells like chemicals.</li>
            <li>This does have a clear consistency, and it&#x27;s aloe like.  </li>
            <li>People have noticed and frequently ask what I have had had \\&quot;done\\&quot; to my skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this does not irritate it.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;crows feet&amp;#34; near my outer eyes and the bags under my eyes have nearly disappeared.  </li>
            <li>When I received the product it had leaked inside the box and when I opened it today it smelled old.</li>
            <li>I just bought 2 bottles  thru Groupon and only paid $27.99 so much cheaper than thru Amazon.</li>
            <li>There were times where i was too busy with finals</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t glide on my skin like the old version used to.</li>
            <li>this is just not delivering the results of the old formula.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Going forward, I&#x27;m just going to buy one bottle at a time and store it in a cool, dark place.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t finish the first bottle until about a month ago (I told you I use it sparingly), and when I went to open the second bottle, I noticed that it had leaked out and was already a sticky orange color.  </li>
            <li>When I opened the new bottle I noticed that it wasn&#x27;t the same</li>
            <li>I have lost money and thrown away several bottles because even keeping it in a cool dark place does not work.</li>
            <li>I highly doubt the potency of the new formula &amp; it definitely contains synthetic Vitamin C, it&#x27;s certainly NOT natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend looking at other brands.</li>

            <li> I have used other serums or creams and this is the only product that actually worked.</li>
            <li> Much to my sadness and frustration, it is now the consistency of aloe vera and (at least in my experience) has zero potency.  </li>
            <li> adn feels firm and soft.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t understand why reviewer said it didn&#x27;t dry, unless too much is being used; it takes very little!</li>
            <li> but it never seems to dry.  </li>
            <li> I hope it doesn&#x27;t burn your skin, dry your skin out &amp; cause all kinds of redness, blemishes &amp; breakouts.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using this product every single one of my family members and  my co-workers want to know what I did to my face.  </li>
            <li> It arrived and the bottle tops were loose, and some of the contents spilled out.  </li>
            <li> I only use a little bit around my eyes and lips.  </li>
            <li> The tiny little crows feet are as noticeable anymore.</li>
            <li> I realized that the skin there is just as delicate as your face, so we definitely need to take care of it the same way!</li>
            <li> Bottle arrived (not from Amazon) with cap partially unscrewed and 1/4 of the bottles serum had leaked out.</li>
            <li> Please trust me, this is NOT the same product at all, it has been negatively altered &amp; it no longer does what it claims to do at all.</li>
            <li> (yes potency goes down after 30 days</li>
            <li> It has a shelf life of approximately 30 days so if you were to order it only order one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reading other reviews now that state that it loses its potency after 30-days after opening the bottle.  </li>
            <li> NO more sour Vitamin C taste on my lips, just a sticky, stinky, gluey mess.</li>
            <li> They do last a long time and  do not go bad.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve been using it for the past month and it still seems to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more like a cover up</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a better product whatsoever, it&#x27;s garbage.</li>
            <li> the smell was bad, at least me it was (I have an overly sensitive Olfactory Nerve).</li>
            <li> That is shady in itself!</li>
            <li> It smells bad enough that I hesitate before putting any on.</li>
            <li> I started to use this product and within 2 days, my face was broken out all over with pimples.</li>
            <li> My face stays a very uncomfortable tacky sticky mess all night!  </li>
            <li> but I was unable to leave a review</li>
            <li> It was a awkward robotic/trained reply.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> After using this product on my face for like 2 weeks, my skin turned out like porcelain. But the container does not seem sturdy. I put this in the basket and it tilted a bit and the content was leaked out.</li>
            <li> This is the first vitamin C serum I have used so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to. However, it has been great for my skin. People have noticed and frequently ask what I have had had \\&quot;done\\&quot; to my skin. I have sensitive skin and this does not irritate it.</li>
            <li> I should have known better than to purchase a product that had no reviews!  I wanted a Vitamin C and Hyaluronic acid serum to use on my face after using my dermaroller.  I apply this serum but it never seems to dry.  My face stays a very uncomfortable tacky sticky mess all night!  I can&#x27;t wait to wash it off in the morning.  I would have to say that I do NOT recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Bottle arrived (not from Amazon) with cap partially unscrewed and 1/4 of the bottles serum had leaked out. It smells bad enough that I hesitate before putting any on. It also leaves my skin very sticky. I have used other vitamin c serums that I enjoyed much more. I&#x27;d highly recommend looking at other brands.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product. I use it twice a day and I see diminishing fine lines. It is sticky but it dries.  In the morning I suggest apply face powder to cover it. I have used other serums or creams and this is the only product that actually worked.</li>
            <li> I really like this product start every morning with it . Will probably be ordering more in a month or so. Thanks Shirl Schaub</li>
            <li> Can tell a difference after using this product. Don&#x27;t understand why reviewer said it didn&#x27;t dry, unless too much is being used; it takes very little!</li>
            <li> I started to use this product and within 2 days, my face was broken out all over with pimples. It has oil in it which blocks up your pores. If you are prone to getting pimples or have sensitive skin like me, I do not recommend this product at all!! If I could return it, I would. I should have known better then to purchase a product that doesn&#x27;t offer a return policy unless the item is defective. That is shady in itself!</li>
            <li> Delivery on this item was fantastic. although the company says it has a shelf life for 90 days. This is totally untrue. I have lost money and thrown away several bottles because even keeping it in a cool dark place does not work. It has a shelf life of approximately 30 days so if you were to order it only order one.</li>
            <li> I bought two bottles of this through a Groupon special back in October 2013.  I had never heard of Vitamen C Serum before this, but after reading some of the reviews, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I did!  It definitely works.  I only use a little bit around my eyes and lips.  Once in the morning after my shower and again at night before bed.  The &amp;#34;crows feet&amp;#34; near my outer eyes and the bags under my eyes have nearly disappeared.  Also, my eyelids seem to be tighter than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this stuff sparingly and have had the same two bottles since last October (7 months as of this writing).  I&#x27;m reading other reviews now that state that it loses its potency after 30-days after opening the bottle.  Well, that&#x27;s even more amazing then.  I didn&#x27;t finish the first bottle until about a month ago (I told you I use it sparingly), and when I went to open the second bottle, I noticed that it had leaked out and was already a sticky orange color.  However, I&#x27;ve been using it for the past month and it still seems to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going forward, I&#x27;m just going to buy one bottle at a time and store it in a cool, dark place.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this product from Amazon but I came here to purchase my second bottle.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 months now (yes potency goes down after 30 days but I am not just going to toss it) my skin tone is more even now and I haven&#x27;t broke out since using this stuff, which is great!  I only use it at night after washing my face.  I haven&#x27;t been able to wear it under my makeup and that is fine with me, still getting great results. I also put it on my neck and just recently started putting it on my chest as well.  I realized that the skin there is just as delicate as your face, so we definitely need to take care of it the same way! The tiny little crows feet are as noticeable anymore. The best part of this for me is the even skin tone, my face is brighter and not dull looking (a face scrub also helps make that possible), and if I do start to get a blemish on my face it goes away rather quickly now :)</li>
            <li> People comment on my skin, and I give some credit to this product.</li>
            <li> To clarify, I was a devoted follower of this product and never wanted to be without it - it&#x27;s original formula improved my skin&#x27;s tone &amp; texture and I received multiple compliments on my skin - and converted many friends to the product. WELL - THE FORMULA HAS CHANGED!  Much to my sadness and frustration, it is now the consistency of aloe vera and (at least in my experience) has zero potency.  I hope they revert back to the original formula, and will be the first on board if so...If anyone has info, would greatly appreciate an update - manufacturing company, I hope you are hearing us and will give us back the original!!! Now I am using the incredible Nicole Bryl skincare (available on her website) and it&#x27;s wonderful, albeit very pricy.</li>
            <li> i used it,  smelled great,  but really didn&#x27;t notice that it had made any difference</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using this product every single one of my family members and  my co-workers want to know what I did to my face.  I use this product twice a day and believe me, I have seen a huge  difference in my facial skin. It truly brightens and smooth my skin.  My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t buy an additional two bottles when Groupons had in on sale for 19.00 for two, I am almost done with my second bottle and the price here for one bottle is making me  cringe. But I truly like the results so.....</li>
            <li> I use it every day for about 3 months now, my skin getting brighter, it takes time I guess, but it works.</li>
            <li> Order this product before from Natrual Skinshop and loved it. I ordered it from Amazon who sold it at a better price. When I received the product it had leaked inside the box and when I opened it today it smelled old. I remember it smelling very citrusy the first time I bought it. I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.  Love the feeling I get when applied and following with my regular moisturizer.  I feel it&#x27;s an excellent product for the low cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year and I LOVE it. It makes my skin glow. Family and friends are always complimenting my skin. I just bought 2 bottles  thru Groupon and only paid $27.99 so much cheaper than thru Amazon. They do last a long time and  do not go bad. I have used the obagi as well and this is pretty close to it and much cheaper. I use this evrery in morning. Highly recommend it I am 47 years old and nobody ever guesses my age. Love it :)</li>
            <li> Awesome Vitam C serum!!! I have purchased this from groupon and it is my first vit c serum. I used it with derma roller and it cleared my face withing a month. I love how i look now. I even ordered more and i would like to make a correction: even though the bottle expires in 90days (according to the seller) my bottle it has been close to a year. There were times where i was too busy with finals so i would forget using it and i have used the same opened bottle i did months ago and the results are still looking fabulous... 90days are for them to make more money but keep using the serum until bottle its empty!!!! I love this product!</li>
            <li> LET ME BE COMPLETELY CLEAR ABOUT MY REVIEW, it in noway, shape or form pertains to the seller, naturalskinshop.com. It has to do w/ the product &amp; the product only. THEY CHANGED THE FORMULA in the Crx Vitamin C 27% Potent Topical Serum. I had been using this product for well over 7 months &amp; I was completely satisfied w/ the results hence the reason for another order. I ordered from skinganic.com but I was unable to leave a review so I figured Amazon was the way to go since I am trying to help others. I ordered another batch in Jan, 2015. When I opened the new bottle I noticed that it wasn&#x27;t the same, it was a different color &amp; the smell was bad, at least me it was (I have an overly sensitive Olfactory Nerve). Anyhow I trusted it thinking it would give me the same great results BUT IT BURNED MY SKIN. It left huge patches of dry skin all over my face for almost a week until I could get it under control. Blemishes started popping up as well. I talked to a unhelpful rep at skinganics who just wanted me to know, repeatedly, that the the formula had been changed &amp; it would stay the same moving forward. It was a awkward robotic/trained reply. Please trust me, this is NOT the same product at all, it has been negatively altered &amp; it no longer does what it claims to do at all. It is now a clear gel &amp; it smells like chemicals. NO more sour Vitamin C taste on my lips, just a sticky, stinky, gluey mess. It doesn&#x27;t glide on my skin like the old version used to. I was told that the chemist was &amp;#34;out of the office&amp;#34; when I asked for a new list of ingredients. Coincidence? No more like a cover up (I suppose the Chemist for Crx works at skinganics too, hehehehe). What&#x27;s even more hilarious is that the old bottle &amp; the new bottle have the EXACT list of ingredients. That tells me the new formula is a much cheaper inferior product. I highly doubt the potency of the new formula &amp; it definitely contains synthetic Vitamin C, it&#x27;s certainly NOT natural. Heck it was probably a syntheticVitamin C to begin w/ now that I think about it (there is huge difference between natural Vit C &amp; sythetic Vit C you can check that out for yourself). I wonder why they changed the formula? My guess is that it saves them money. It&#x27;s not a better product whatsoever, it&#x27;s garbage. I hope it doesn&#x27;t burn your skin, dry your skin out &amp; cause all kinds of redness, blemishes &amp; breakouts. I am being honest &amp; trying to save some people the headache of wasting their money on an shoddy product.</li>
            <li> It arrived and the bottle tops were loose, and some of the contents spilled out.  But I do like the product!</li>
            <li> Love this,but the first bottle I got,the serum was clear  and this one is  very milky in color. Don&#x27;t know whats up with that.</li>
            <li> The price for the product, is great!!! This C Serum makes all the difference in the world. I will continue my  purchases with Naturalskinshop!! Thank you</li>
            <li> Awesome! I recommend this product. Give it a 4.5 stars.</li>
            <li> I repeated buy this product. Vitamin C is one of the most essential ingredients for mature skin.  My skin glows adn feels firm and soft.  This product smells and feel fresh when it is applied.  Bravo!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true - the formula has changed (as noted on the source seller&#x27;s website).  This does have a clear consistency, and it&#x27;s aloe like.  The old formula was a bit orange / brown and thinner - and absorbed better.  I don&#x27;t care so much about the formula, but rather the results.  I have to say, this is just not delivering the results of the old formula.  This is simple doing nothing.  Whereas the old version, brightened my skin, faded dark spots, plumped me up, gave me a healthy even skin tone.  This does...well, nothing.</li>
            <li> A bit sticky, but definitely see a difference in my skin right away-I&#x27;m sold!!</li>
