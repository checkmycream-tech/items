            <li>I also need to mention the:Very good serviceI. Prompt delivery!</li>

            <li>good for antiaging.</li>
            <li>it makes your face feel good afterward.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>yo have to get your own gel aloa vera or ultrasonic and use water for it to work..  </li>
            <li>so you&#x27;ll keep it anyway and provide your own batteries and gel.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I liked this thing, but it didn&#x27;t do a lot in terms of changing the muscle tone of my face.</li>
            <li>I was looking forward to using this unit and when I tried to use it using the best batteries, it absolutely did nothing.</li>
            <li>and glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li>but it seems to do about what Suzanne somers faceaster does except this is more compact and better for travel..</li>
            <li>I  noticed that my skin is more toned.</li>
            <li>Interesting and useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I could get one that works, I&#x27;m sure I would like it and use it.</li>
            <li>I would not say it works magic</li>
            <li>Wish there had been more detailed instructions with the product.</li>
            <li>I quickly saw that being able to customize the power and programs was much better.  </li>
            <li>on high you can feel it really good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;By the way, you do need conductive gel for this to work, and aloe vera works just fine.</li>
            <li>I have found that Oloe vera juice mixed with hyaluronic acid powder( i buy it in capsules) works great as a solution for glide and  </li>
            <li>so it is important to use the product as it is intended.</li>
            <li>So, I learned that the concept of muscle toning was sound, and bit the bullet.</li>
            <li>Not as solid as NuFace, but for the price, this is good.</li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly, but without the promised included batteries and gel.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very surprised with this one as it has a similar lift effect as my beloved time machines.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great toy to practice with if you&#x27;re thinking about a more expensive unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it works pretty well</li>
            <li>but then really only pay $10 that will be ok?</li>
            <li>Because this unit turned out to be a good practice opportunity before I decided to invest in one of the more expensive muscle toners.</li>
            <li>Any advice appreciated.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see this really working, why give it any stars at all?</li>
            <li>Thanks to the seller.</li>
            <li>I looked up NuFace and wasn&#x27;t ready to spend over 200.00 for it</li>
            <li>the high setting.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes, but using the product I don&#x27;t feel any sensation.</li>
            <li>but it is enough  to make me smile .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using for a few months--the only thing to concern me was how quickly the &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; wore off from the contacts because they are a coated metal rather than a material such as copper or brass that cleans up better.</li>
            <li>use low to start at first..</li>
            <li>I used the Connie Stevens &amp;#34;time machine&amp;#34; for many years, when the last one died after 20 years I tried numerous facial toners.</li>
            <li>So far I have not noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>my zapper I  had for nearly 15 years</li>
            <li>So far I think works.  </li>
            <li>Hint: if the gel starts to dry out, don&#x27;t add more gel...get a small spritz bottle from the dollar store, fill it with water, close your eyes, and spritz your face.</li>
            <li>You can easily carry it with you because it is very small.  </li>
            <li>I start using , is too early to see the benefits now, maybe later because this is not a result from one day to another one.</li>

            <li> I read that a bruised bone can take months to heal completely, so I used the little massager on the bruised area twice a day for a month.</li>

            <li> Works as expected.  </li>

            <li> i bought this cause its small for travel. works aaround the eye area like Suzanne somers facemaster. exercises the muscles. has differen settings hi to low . and use water and like ultrasonic gel... on high you can feel it really good. use low to start at first.. it works pretty well and glad I bought it.  good for antiaging. mine came with instructions. yo have to get your own gel aloa vera or ultrasonic and use water for it to work..  it makes your face feel good afterward. haven&#x27;t used it that long but it seems to do about what Suzanne somers faceaster does except this is more compact and better for travel..</li>
            <li> I  bought this about 4 weeks ago. I  have used it about 3 times per week. I  noticed that my skin is more toned. It seems as if the wrinkles are diminishing and my face is uplifted.( i use it on my face as well as my hands) It is not a big change but it is enough  to make me smile . Seems to have quite a bit of  power and gets &amp;#34; zappy&amp;#34;.at the high setting. So i usually use it at the halfway mark. I have found that Oloe vera juice mixed with hyaluronic acid powder( i buy it in capsules) works great as a solution for glide and  also transfer of the current.  I also need to mention the:Very good serviceI. Prompt delivery!</li>
            <li> Horrible product!  Couldn&#x27;t even feel the power...</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly, but without the promised included batteries and gel.  I have yet to try it out and see how it works.</li>
            <li> This product came 3 weeks after I ordered it. When I got it there were no batteries included, there is also no feeling of tingling when tested below the lip or above the eye brow. Something tells me that those men that gave it 5 stars are from that company that sells it in China. Do not reccomend it, will return it.</li>
            <li> I start using , is too early to see the benefits now, maybe later because this is not a result from one day to another one.</li>
            <li> I used the Connie Stevens &amp;#34;time machine&amp;#34; for many years, when the last one died after 20 years I tried numerous facial toners. I&#x27;m very surprised with this one as it has a similar lift effect as my beloved time machines. I&#x27;ve been using for a few months--the only thing to concern me was how quickly the &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; wore off from the contacts because they are a coated metal rather than a material such as copper or brass that cleans up better. The discoloration has not affected the micro current, so I still recommend for the price and power.</li>
            <li> The unit arrived without the batteries and gel.  They advertised that both were included.  I guess they&#x27;ll just think it&#x27;s not worth it to return so you&#x27;ll keep it anyway and provide your own batteries and gel.&lt;br /&gt;I may end up liking how the unit works, but now I have a bad taste about the thing.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like being duped.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe if I say I&#x27;ll pay twenty dollars for it but then really only pay $10 that will be ok?</li>
            <li> I had high hopes, but using the product I don&#x27;t feel any sensation. I thought it would lift and tighten, but it doesn&#x27;t. Not worthwhile at all.</li>
            <li> So far I have not noticed a difference. Looking forward to a change. Wish there had been more detailed instructions with the product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the photo of the English manual and the blurry, unreadable &amp;#34;instructions&amp;#34; in the last photo - the outside is in English, the inside entirely in Korean. I have no idea how to use it. If anyone does know, can they post instructions here in the comments. I got a microcurrent facial recently and it definitely did something, so I was hopeful for this product, but microcurrent is basically the same as microwaving your face- and you are exposing yourself to a form of radiation- so it is important to use the product as it is intended. Any advice appreciated.</li>
            <li> works well until I can afford to get the microcurrent EGG</li>
            <li> my zapper I  had for nearly 15 years finally stopped working and this thing is great. I wish I had gotten it weeks ago!</li>
            <li> Ok...I hope this is helpful. I liked this thing, but it didn&#x27;t do a lot in terms of changing the muscle tone of my face. A little, but not much. It&#x27;s just too small and lacks settings you can customize. The readout for the current strength is VERY hard to read. I did experience \\&quot;retinal flashing\\&quot; when it was too close to my eyes, and that could freak some people out. I&#x27;m not a doctor, so I cant tell if that&#x27;s bad or harmless. Anyway...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I didn&#x27;t see this really working, why give it any stars at all? Because this unit turned out to be a good practice opportunity before I decided to invest in one of the more expensive muscle toners. It&#x27;s strange to see your facial muscles contract. When you do your forehead, you will feel it in your scalp because those muscles are attached there, but you learn that they NEED to be worked to get the toning results you&#x27;re obviously are looking for. I ended up googling a picture of the facial muscles, and could now see what was happening when I zapped myself. Interesting and useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; So, I learned that the concept of muscle toning was sound, and bit the bullet. I forked out for the (I don&#x27;t want to say, bc I don&#x27;t want people to think I&#x27;m a rep of that company) and I LOVE IT! I wasn&#x27;t freaked out by the sensations, like a lot of reviewers were. I quickly saw that being able to customize the power and programs was much better.  I use it almost every day, and I def see results, especially my cheekbones and around my eyes. Anyway...that&#x27;s what I think of this $20 unit. It&#x27;s a great toy to practice with if you&#x27;re thinking about a more expensive unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, you do need conductive gel for this to work, and aloe vera works just fine. Hint: if the gel starts to dry out, don&#x27;t add more gel...get a small spritz bottle from the dollar store, fill it with water, close your eyes, and spritz your face. The water rehydrates the gel, and you&#x27;re back in business!</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to using this unit and when I tried to use it using the best batteries, it absolutely did nothing. It did not work. It has so movement at all! They described it as such a low movement that you won&#x27;t even know it&#x27;s on. It was not on because it doesn&#x27;t work! Another rip off although Amazon did refund my money, but I don&#x27;t feel like the hassle of going to the post office to return it, nor do I feel like paying overseas shipping cost. If I could get one that works, I&#x27;m sure I would like it and use it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t order this product for it&#x27;s supposed effect on wrinkles, I ordered it after reading an article that micro current aids in healing bruised bones.  I had taken a fall and landed on the heel of my hand; nothing was broken, but the diagnosis was a badly bruised bone at the base of my thumb. I read that a bruised bone can take months to heal completely, so I used the little massager on the bruised area twice a day for a month. It still hurts occasionally, but I credit this item with speeding the healing process.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it and used it and see no difference. Sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  I use all over for toning while relaxing in the evening.  Conducts with aloe vera gel well.  After one month, I see a plumping affect which I believe is the result of lift.  Will continue to peruse other tools from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Not as solid as NuFace, but for the price, this is good. You can easily carry it with you because it is very small.  Thanks to the seller.</li>
            <li> Bought this product when my sister told me about NuFace.  I looked up NuFace and wasn&#x27;t ready to spend over 200.00 for it so I decided to try and version of the technology without the price tag.  So far I think works.  I would not say it works magic but it does help lift for a temporary period.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product  Does as advertised .</li>
            <li> broke soon after i got it on traveling. would buy again but to leave at home</li>
            <li> This item  broke just after a week.</li>
