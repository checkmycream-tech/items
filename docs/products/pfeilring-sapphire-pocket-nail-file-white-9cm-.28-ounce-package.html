            <li>one of the best files I have found in a long time</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s working great so far.  </li>
            <li>Not much to say, this is a perfect nail file.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smaller than the picture leads you to believe, which is great.  </li>

            <li>The only reason I paid so much for this file is because I let the name of it (sapphire) fool me into thinking it was an excellent material like the diamond nail files.</li>

            <li>This file is so much better than a standard emery board.</li>

            <li>This file has a gravel-like surface with tiny crystal that is a better than a regular file with grooves and grids.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d highly recommend for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you round off the pointed end with a metal file or grinder , you could even safely keep this file in your wallet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ships from and sold by Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I had a Revlon diamond file for years -- finally wore off the diamonds and bought a new one</li>
            <li>rough grit on one side, fine on the other.</li>
            <li>-- what few abrasive particles it had fell off the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I had been looking for a long time for a file that had good cutting properties.  </li>

            <li> and I just hope my Pfeilring nail files last for a long long time, because it&#x27;s harder all the time to get a decent nail file.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good functional file, but a little awkward for my big hands.  </li>
            <li> The file section is only 2\\&quot; long, with an added 3/8\\&quot; long point.  </li>
            <li> tiny nail file is only 3 11/16\\&quot; long, and 3/8\\&quot; wide.  </li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected - 3 3/4&amp;#34; but my fault for not knowing what 9 cm was.</li>

            <li> Smaller than I expected, but it works as expected</li>

            <li> These are small, which can be a good or bad thing, depending on what you need.</li>
            <li> Not at all what we expected.  </li>
            <li> Filing on one side and smoothing on the other.</li>
            <li> My nails grow every 3-5 days and get abnormally sharp, even after I used the filer that came on a nail clipper.</li>
            <li> The sapphire stays where it needs to be, as opposed to some other file material.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve done a lot of work on my nails -- fingers and toes both-- and the files are as sharp as ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sharp and small enough to carry in my handbag.</li>
            <li> This seems to knock off some of the grit to leave a less aggressive surface.</li>
            <li> Takes the rough edges off!!!</li>
            <li> A little small for my tastes, but is marketed as for a purse.  </li>
            <li> File is really small.</li>
            <li> The packaging does act as sort of a case, but it&#x27;s clumsy.</li>
            <li> VERY SMALL BUT</li>
            <li> and it is terrible at filing the nail.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> German quality, that&#x27;s all you need to know about a nail file. These are small, which can be a good or bad thing, depending on what you need. I love it.</li>
            <li> First, let me say that I&#x27;m an old guy who has never gotten a manicure and I can&#x27;t say if this is professional grade but it&#x27;s well made and works great for me. It&#x27;s also compact and sturdy and will survive being stuffed in a medicine cabinet or, I assume, dropped in a purse.</li>
            <li> Small and very light weight nail file.  Somewhat coarse grit.  You can reduce the level of grit somewhat by stoking the file on a steel object several times.  This seems to knock off some of the grit to leave a less aggressive surface. I tried the file. It works great!  It&#x27;s now a part of my travel pack.</li>
            <li> Great litte nail file to carry with you&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> A little small for my tastes, but is marketed as for a purse.  Leaves nails very smooth.</li>
            <li> I expected this nail file to be of much better quality... Especially being that I paid about $15 for this tiny pocket nail file. The file itself was very gritty and it is terrible at filing the nail. The only reason I paid so much for this file is because I let the name of it (sapphire) fool me into thinking it was an excellent material like the diamond nail files. The only decent thing about it is it&#x27;s small size that fits great in ur purse or wallet. It&#x27;s not worth the price to ship it back so I&#x27;ll just keep it in my purse for emergencies.</li>
            <li> Overpriced, but a nice item.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected, but it works as expected</li>
            <li> What I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Fantastic little nail file. Smaller than I expected - 3 3/4&amp;#34; but my fault for not knowing what 9 cm was. Despite the size it works wonderfully and is my favorite nail file. Planning to order the next larger size. Filing on one side and smoothing on the other. It doesn&#x27;t break the nails, but works the way a file should. It is much more costly than other files, but is truly the case you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I bought this for travel.  It&#x27;s smaller than the picture leads you to believe, which is great.  I have tried the throw-away emery boards and they just don&#x27;t work like this does.  Very high quality and I&#x27;d highly recommend for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only check this file for flying - I do not put it in my carry-on as I am worried about scrutiny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working great so far.  I hope it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This file is so much better than a standard emery board. It lasts so much longer. For my use the shorter pocket size was good but if you use regularly for fingernails you should consider the longer version.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male for starts, and this is a great product! My nails grow every 3-5 days and get abnormally sharp, even after I used the filer that came on a nail clipper. It was becoming a hassle to use the old filer so I purchased this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great filer, the sapphire makes it appear like it will never get too worn. Definitely recommend, I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll be using a clipper to clip my nails anymore as I can just file them. Don&#x27;t have to worry about injuring S/Os so 5/5 stars</li>
            <li> This file has a gravel-like surface with tiny crystal that is a better than a regular file with grooves and grids. Made in Germany.</li>
            <li> Like these so well that I have several. Does a great job of filing nails. Wish it had a case. I made a case out of Grissom grain ribbon.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for one that I have carried for 31 years. Believe me, this is a great product! I also have the trimmer scissors with the curved blades and the slanted end tweezers. Very nice set.</li>
            <li> This type of file would be better suited for trimming horses hoof&#x27;s  than finger nails. Extremity coarse.</li>
            <li> I have not used this much, but so far it does a great job.  It is short, and I like a longer one, but with this caveat I can recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a piece of garbage. The seller is obviously having friends and family write reviews, because the first time I tried to use it, the sides of the metal top peeled off. I have never seen anything like it- not sure how cheaply made something has to be made for this to happen.</li>
            <li> one of the best files I have found in a long time</li>
            <li> These are really well made sapphire files that do an excellent job on finger and toe nails.  I have had similar files in the past and these are just as great and just as well made as the older versions.  I cannot see carrying around those cheap wood files or every using the cut metal files.&lt;br /&gt;I can recommend to anyone the files who wants something a lot better than the cheap dime store fingernail files.</li>
            <li> Not at all what we expected.  We thought it was 9 inches, not 9 centimeters.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best nail files ever.  The sapphire stays where it needs to be, as opposed to some other file material.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great file. Works very well. Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> Pfeilring Sapphire Pocket Nail File, White, 9cm (3 11/16\\&quot;), .28-Ounce Package, by Pfeilring.&lt;br /&gt;This tiny nail file is only 3 11/16\\&quot; long, and 3/8\\&quot; wide.  The file section is only 2\\&quot; long, with an added 3/8\\&quot; long point.  It is a bit small for guys with large hands to hold onto, but it does the intended job very quickly.  I found myself holding onto the 1 5/16\\&quot; plastic handle and 11/16\\&quot; of the file, leaving me 1 1/16\\&quot; of file, plus the 3/8\\&quot; point to work with. The sapphire coating seems more durable than the diamond coated files of other companies. If you round off the pointed end with a metal file or grinder , you could even safely keep this file in your wallet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ships from and sold by Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Distributed by: Swissco, LLC, NY, NY  10016.  UPC Code: 7 69898 11119 8.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manufactured by: Muller &amp; Schmidt Pfeilringwerk, GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Sudetenstrasse 5, 42653 Solingen; web: pfeilring.com; made in Germany.</li>
            <li> works well, worth the money</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a long time for a file that had good cutting properties.  It does what I want it to do quickly.  I will also order the larger size.</li>
            <li> and I just hope my Pfeilring nail files last for a long long time, because it&#x27;s harder all the time to get a decent nail file. I had a Revlon diamond file for years -- finally wore off the diamonds and bought a new one -- what few abrasive particles it had fell off the first time I used it. Same with another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I got two Pfeilrings, one long, one short, and they do the most amazing job, whipping out a crack or notch from overeager gardening in a couple of swipes, shaping 10 nails very quickly. So quickly I don&#x27;t quite understand how they leave the filed end so smooth, but they do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve done a lot of work on my nails -- fingers and toes both-- and the files are as sharp as ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to see if a [[ASIN:B008DRY59Y Dremel 8100-N/21 8-Volt Max Cordless Rotary Tool]] will round the pointed end -- not so much for the airlines as to keep the file I want to carry in my purse from poking holes in it. The packaging does act as sort of a case, but it&#x27;s clumsy.</li>
            <li> Takes the rough edges off!!!</li>
            <li> File is really small. It files very well but easy to misplace. Should be longer.</li>
            <li> Not much to say, this is a perfect nail file. Sharp and small enough to carry in my handbag.</li>
            <li> Great for fingernails. rough grit on one side, fine on the other. WAY too short for toenails IMHO - but I did not buy this for toenails.</li>
            <li> my wife loves it, great file, expect a long life, bought the other sizes. length indicated is total length including the handle</li>
            <li> VERY SMALL BUT WELL MADE AND DURABLE. WORKS WELL. FAST SHIPPING. I RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> Being metric-challenged, I did not realize 9cm is only 3.5 inches.  A regular emery board is 4.5 inches.  It&#x27;s a good functional file, but a little awkward for my big hands.  As a comparison, a standard business card is 3.5 inches wide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was my mistake for not checking - so I just want to point it out so you don&#x27;t make the same mistake.</li>
            <li> it cuts through my nail like nothing, very effective and i would recommend it to anyone that needs a nail file</li>
            <li> If you want a very small file to fit in a small case, this will do the job nicely.</li>
