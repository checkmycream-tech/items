    <ol>
            <li>Awesome is all I have to say</li>
            <li>im very very happy</li>
            <li>Look awesome in person.</li>
            <li>Looks great!</li>
            <li>But for the price &amp; quantity, it&#x27;s the best decision you could make via Amazon &amp; this company.</li>
            <li>I must say these eyelashes are THE BEST!</li>
            <li>not the greatest quality you can find.</li>
            <li>And you get a ton for a great price!</li>
            <li>I bought these for an art project,  they worked perfectly for that.</li>
            <li>Very good lashes for the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to keep the remaining pairs for when I work on clients for photoshoots because they give good definition, but I won&#x27;t be using them on myself anymore!</li>
            <li>Very glad I made this purchase!</li>
            <li>The lashes looked great.</li>

            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>It was great.</li>
            <li>but I am extremely happy with these.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re really great.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re great except for they don&#x27;t come pre-cut and arched</li>
            <li>RedCherry - all great lashes).</li>
            <li>and not something i was happy with getting in the mail.</li>
            <li>The eyelashes are a very nice style but they are synthetic material</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>Good product and great price.</li>
            <li>oh so loving it!</li>
            <li>The quality of the lashes was excellent and I enjoyed the variety.</li>
            <li>Have to say you get for you paid for Quality isn&#x27;t good, but I would say if you&#x27;re looking to learn how to put on lashes I would buy maybe these</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good to use cheaper lashes to learn how to put them on then</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Since the band isn&#x27;t sturdy, I can&#x27;t even give a good description of these lashes.</li>
            <li>The package of eyelashes came in good time.</li>
            <li>Good for the price.</li>
            <li>the item is good and the price is good.</li>
            <li>these eyelashes look exactly as pictured, are very beautiful, look amazing and durable!</li>
            <li>I was so happy when I saw the price, but I should have known better.</li>
            <li>What a great deal I got when I purchased them &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>But for the most part they where great.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wearing them right now and they look superb.</li>
            <li>Love them and would purchase again!</li>
            <li>I keep buying them when I run out :) Use them every day!</li>
            <li>I love them!</li>
            <li>I love them!</li>
            <li>If you wear these out-- have your glue handy.   </li>
            <li>So I recommend ordering this set and buying your own glue either online or at a store.</li>
            <li>i cant find this kind of deal anywhere just have to buy the eyelash glue</li>
            <li>but the hairs are lined together nice.</li>
            <li>I liked the look of them when they were in the package.</li>
            <li>they are nice to work with</li>
            <li>However, once it was on, it stay on until I took it off, and it look my own lashes.</li>
            <li>just like the first time there perfect stay on way better</li>
            <li>very cute i love these lashes alot of people</li>
            <li>good and easy to work it.</li>
            <li>But I still love them wear them all the time I need to buy more!</li>
            <li>very cheap quality,I could not even use it.</li>
            <li>These eyelashes are, in my opinion, stunning for the price.</li>
            <li>Mind you the case comes with many.</li>
            <li>I also bought the glue from Revlon and it seems to work better than my Lash Grip glue.</li>
            <li>I would order this product again &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>and I love the quality and texture, plus you can&#x27;t beat the price compared to beauty store bought.</li>
            <li>love them had to share with my Sister IN-LAW</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>She put them on and fell in love.</li>
            <li>i really love them</li>

            <li>i love them</li>
            <li>i love them :)</li>
            <li>I love the way they look.</li>
            <li>However for a joke/gag gift they were ok.</li>
            <li>And to top it off this shipping</li>
            <li>but i love them.</li>
            <li>Love , Love , LOVE them.</li>
            <li>love it♡</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t look too cheaply made once they are put on!</li>
            <li>I will purchase more....</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>The lashes are ok, they look like plastic.</li>
            <li>Love these lashes.</li>
            <li>i am glad that it got here on time.</li>
            <li>As always I love these lashes.</li>
            <li>Love them,</li>
            <li>They are ok anyway..</li>
            <li>Love these lashes</li>
            <li>I will stick with store bought lashes from now on as I have literally not been able to put these on for an outing since I bought them.</li>
            <li>but the quality is great and shipped fast.</li>
            <li>but other wise these are good! :)</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re pretty good lashes.</li>
            <li>So worth the buy and wait!!</li>
            <li>The eyelashes are super nice</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fantastic because it makes the lashes more durable.</li>
            <li>good quality, lashes itself look like real hair, just not on your eyes.</li>
            <li>Super great quality and hold very well bought 5 box&#x27;s this time.</li>
            <li>or so they were indeed worth it! :)</li>
            <li>I tryed to wear these on my birthday they were cool looking!</li>
            <li>but I have those days where they tear really easily</li>
            <li>They came through the mail very quickly (In 3 days).</li>
            <li>And makes for easy storage.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply .</li>
            <li>The best way to wear these is to apply them far out towards the corner of your eye and use lots of mascara to shape and blend them with your real lashes.</li>
            <li>makes it easy to pick up and to handle without bending lashies.</li>
            <li>The pretty picture of the 10 pairs of eyelashes sitting erectly in a nice box was NOT what showed up at my door step.</li>
            <li>so they have that shiny plastic look but for the price they are fine.</li>
            <li>But everything else was fine.</li>
            <li>so I guess there fine.</li>
            <li>gives that bold look !</li>
            <li>I received these lashes very quickly and off the bat I was already excited.</li>
            <li>HUGE BUSINESS</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll probably find that you need to trim them in order to make them fit your eyes.</li>
            <li>I had to trim them in order for them to fit my eyes</li>
            <li>seprately :) i love love these will definitely be buying more</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the buy. :)</li>
            <li>I can see why they were so cheap.</li>
            <li>i got these obviously because the price and they looked great</li>
            <li>The only thing I was not too happy about was the part where you apply the glue.</li>
            <li>These eyelashes are comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>They are cheap, and if you can get them to work for you then</li>
            <li>Cheap plastic eyelashes don&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li>You too will like and enjoy.</li>
            <li>People would ask me if those were my real lashes!!!</li>
            <li>but you can easily fix them with a bit of mascara  to blend them in but for the most part their pretty soft and cute !</li>
            <li>I was so excited</li>
            <li>they are long and beautiful and go on pretty easily</li>
            <li>this right here is maddness!</li>
            <li>Cheap but not even worth it.</li>
            <li>i love them sooo much</li>
            <li>Theyre the perfect thickness if u like thick eye lashes.</li>
            <li>For the price that I paid, the quality was not bad...</li>
            <li>Not bad at all.</li>
            <li>I ordered the same thing several times cause they last long and they r very deserving of a good review perfect thicknesses and length .  </li>
            <li>I like them though, for super special events.</li>
            <li>The box was a little bent out of shape; however, the lashes were beautiful and full.</li>
            <li>i wanted to get some for a more daily routine to wear more often  </li>
            <li>I gave 4 stars because they look to &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; i was hoping they were more realistic..</li>
            <li>So glad I&#x27;m able to purchase them at a low price.</li>
            <li>Great price, but not worth it.</li>
            <li>I normally dont use a pair of lashes more than once</li>
            <li>Would look good for gyaru or doll looks, but definitely not a natural look.</li>
            <li>But for my shows, they are perfect and will last a long time.</li>
            <li>my first purchases were these !</li>
            <li>You will need your own tube of glue to adhere them on with (I recommend Duo, as one good tub of glue will last a long time).</li>
            <li>These are okay, they don&#x27;t stick easily with regular eyelash glue.</li>
            <li>These beautiful lashes are better than most expensive ones!</li>
            <li>I suppose it would be fine if you cut them up and used them more as individual lashes, because you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>say if you know how to put on lashes then you won&#x27;t have any problem there not for the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; girls I bought bundles of lashes why because they&#x27;re cheap good for everyday and durable for cleaning ...</li>
            <li>Looks great in photos but but to wear everyday like I would have liked to was not possible.</li>
            <li>To my surprise they where more natural feeling then not.</li>
            <li>They do not feel natural, but they are OK.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not really expertly good at applying lashes, don&#x27;t purchase these.</li>
            <li>My favorite so far.</li>
            <li>my natural lashes with mascara look alot better and longer than wearing these.</li>
            <li>I saved a lot, and it was well worth it..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lashes stay looking fresh.</li>
            <li>These lashes look fine upon first glance but have a very \\&quot;fake\\&quot; looking shine to them.</li>
            <li>They just aren&#x27;t so right.</li>
            <li>you can slip it right off the skin when done .</li>
            <li>but you have to trim them, but they get the job done with the right glue</li>
            <li>and arrived right on time</li>
            <li>They look real and are extremely beautiful, they aren&#x27;t too heavy and don&#x27;t fall apart on you.</li>
            <li>defanitly gonna get more in the future and only these kind.</li>
            <li>BUT i was really satisfied with the purchase their not heavy at all their good for an everyday look</li>
            <li>knock these lashes because they are not human hair but to me they suit me just fine!</li>
            <li>/&gt;i dont like them very much</li>
            <li>I was a little aprehensive when I ordered this product just because, its a good price.</li>
            <li>When I opened the box the lashed looked exactly how they do in the icon photo.</li>
            <li>I was very happened when I opened my package but even happier when I tried them on!</li>
            <li>Great quality,  but slow shipping</li>
            <li>It was exactly as it was stated online.</li>
            <li>i absolutely adore the way that these lashes look on me!  </li>
            <li>I was scared because this was the first time I&#x27;ve bought lashes of Amazon</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT IS EXACTLY</li>
            <li>A bit long, but so easy to cut and shape!</li>
            <li>The lashes are too stiff and not of good quality.</li>
            <li>They went on very nicely, but they were so thick</li>
            <li>overall they&#x27;re pretty good quality, and only $2.</li>
            <li>Lashies are easy to remove carefully and to clean and to reuse.</li>
            <li>i really love these lashes and yes you can reuse them at least once or twice more</li>
            <li>They are silky, long &amp; quite sexy ; )  </li>
            <li>This is an extremely good deal for such a low price, I intend to continue buying them.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I ordered this product at such a reasonable price..  </li>
            <li>First, the lashes are very unnatural in appearance.</li>
            <li>These are long, feathery and gal looking :3</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pretty decent quality.</li>
            <li>probably not going to wear them much.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s to be expected i love them</li>
            <li>so i&#x27;m not going to complain much, I do like</li>
            <li>really crashed and v</li>
            <li>I really like them</li>
            <li>This is Second time i ordered them i got 2 packs since they r so cheap and</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear lashes much so</li>
            <li>Very flexable.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>They stick really well</li>
            <li>its really hard&lt;br /&gt;its dificult to apply&lt;</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ve got a ton of lashes for a few bucks and to be honest</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say these are good for costumes or fun events, but NOT for formals or anything in daylight as the false lash will be visible.</li>
            <li>I normally like short to medium lashes to give it more of a natural look..</li>
            <li>double sided was unique.</li>
            <li>Bit other than that they are ok.</li>
            <li>cheap but still good to use I use this to cosplay and they are thick and long</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn one pair so far 3 times and have even put mascara on them the first time and they are still good to go for at least another use or two.</li>
            <li>These ended up being a little bit more dramatic than I&#x27;d anticipated/wanted, but they&#x27;re good for a bold eye or event like prom.</li>
            <li>And also gives my eyes a whole new look.</li>
            <li>If only the product had been so lucky.</li>
            <li>They are long which is a good thing because you can cut them down to your size of eye.</li>
            <li>they came earlier then what i had expected so that was a plus, i tried them same day and they look amazing!</li>
            <li>These where okay, the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the fact that it is hard to fit the shape of your eye.</li>
            <li>they are thick and amazing for the price</li>
            <li>I love the eyelashes, they last long too.  </li>
            <li>But overall It&#x27;s definitely worth the wait.</li>
            <li>they are nice and thick</li>
            <li>I bought these because of the good value and because I was tired of spending $6 every two weeks on the drugstore lashes.</li>
            <li>They were what I needed, would of liked a little fuller lash but close enough.</li>
            <li>so I got a new curler</li>
            <li>They are very soft too.</li>
            <li>These eyelashes are sooo soft!</li>
            <li>boy am i glad i did.they got here in just three days a day before the earliest expected day since i went for the standard shipping.i was suprised at how soft and flexible they</li>
            <li>They are definitely not an everyday lash!  </li>
            <li>I have over 15 years of eye-lash application experience and this was the first time I could not properly apply them.</li>
            <li>Due to my eyelashes are very short LOVE</li>
            <li>Use a little mascara and you will be fine.</li>
            <li>I certainly know we can not blame USPS because as I stated earlier, the package it came in was completely in tack.</li>
            <li>Clear band has tips on end.</li>
            <li>Instead of mimicking the natural lash pattern, it&#x27;s as if someone cut a series of triangles with a pair of scissors.</li>
            <li>Arrived completely smashed.</li>
            <li>too shiny doesn&#x27;t look natural as I thought they may</li>
            <li>Lashes were very plastic like, unlike the 100% human hair ones I&#x27;m used to buying.</li>
            <li>haha, overall 5 star</li>
            <li>but they were soft and flexible.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve use one pair so far and they have lasted 2 weeks already.</li>
            <li>They do not blend in with your natural lashes.</li>
            <li>They are soft, natural curl.</li>
            <li>If you want natural looking lashes, these aren&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>I use Duo Adhesive and rarely experience this problem with other lashes--</li>
            <li>For the most noticeable effect with false eyelashes to be had at the cheapest price, I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>First off ill admit i wasnt to sure on these</li>
            <li>But, when I review the lashes some of the lashes had dry glue stuck on them and it was kind of hard to take off because I didn&#x27;t want to ruin them.</li>
            <li>These lashes are not true to size in picture, they are Huge &amp; they came in the box all bent into different shapes &amp; sized</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the item took more than two weeks to arrive.</li>
            <li>so it came sooner then expected, when i opened it, it was in a cute little box and was neatly packaged i use these lashes for everyday glam and for Halloween, their so fun.</li>
            <li>I ordered these eyelashes and got some very thin and cheap looking ones that look nothing like the picture!!</li>
            <li>I am surprised that the average user rating of these lashes is so high!</li>
            <li>I love my false eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Way to fake looking, I love lashes and tried to ignore all the other reviews but they were right, they suck.</li>
            <li>Also if you are not careful and don&#x27;t have the proper eyelash curler, instead of getting a U or C shape, you can get something like this ] which is what happened to me</li>
            <li>I use just the tips of my finger nails to remove dried glue on glue, after remove dried glue I use a soft smooth cotton cloth to wipe any glue dust off.</li>
            <li>full &amp;&amp; thick.</li>
            <li>i would so buy these again and recommend them to my friends, as a teen who loves wearing falsies i do love these their dramatic and</li>

            <li> Looks great!</li>
            <li> But for the price &amp; quantity, it&#x27;s the best decision you could make via Amazon &amp; this company.</li>
            <li> I must say these eyelashes are THE BEST!</li>
            <li> not the greatest quality you can find.</li>
            <li> And you get a ton for a great price!</li>

            <li> Very good lashes for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to keep the remaining pairs for when I work on clients for photoshoots because they give good definition, but I won&#x27;t be using them on myself anymore!</li>
            <li> Very glad I made this purchase!</li>

            <li> and not something i was happy with getting in the mail.</li>

            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> Good product and great price.</li>
            <li> oh so loving it!</li>
            <li> The quality of the lashes was excellent and I enjoyed the variety.</li>
            <li> Have to say you get for you paid for Quality isn&#x27;t good, but I would say if you&#x27;re looking to learn how to put on lashes I would buy maybe these</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good to use cheaper lashes to learn how to put them on then</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Since the band isn&#x27;t sturdy, I can&#x27;t even give a good description of these lashes.</li>
            <li> The package of eyelashes came in good time.</li>
            <li> Good for the price.</li>
            <li> the item is good and the price is good.</li>
            <li> these eyelashes look exactly as pictured, are very beautiful, look amazing and durable!</li>
            <li> I was so happy when I saw the price, but I should have known better.</li>
            <li> What a great deal I got when I purchased them &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> But for the most part they where great.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wearing them right now and they look superb.</li>
            <li> Love them and would purchase again!</li>
            <li> I keep buying them when I run out :) Use them every day!</li>
            <li> I love them!</li>
            <li> I love them!</li>
            <li> If you wear these out-- have your glue handy.   </li>
            <li> So I recommend ordering this set and buying your own glue either online or at a store.</li>
            <li> i cant find this kind of deal anywhere just have to buy the eyelash glue</li>
            <li> but the hairs are lined together nice.</li>
            <li> I liked the look of them when they were in the package.</li>
            <li> they are nice to work with</li>
            <li> However, once it was on, it stay on until I took it off, and it look my own lashes.</li>
            <li> just like the first time there perfect stay on way better</li>
            <li> very cute i love these lashes alot of people</li>
            <li> good and easy to work it.</li>
            <li> But I still love them wear them all the time I need to buy more!</li>
            <li> very cheap quality,I could not even use it.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are, in my opinion, stunning for the price.</li>
            <li> Mind you the case comes with many.</li>
            <li> I also bought the glue from Revlon and it seems to work better than my Lash Grip glue.</li>
            <li> I would order this product again &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> and I love the quality and texture, plus you can&#x27;t beat the price compared to beauty store bought.</li>
            <li> love them had to share with my Sister IN-LAW</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> She put them on and fell in love.</li>

            <li> i love them :)</li>
            <li> I love the way they look.</li>
            <li> However for a joke/gag gift they were ok.</li>
            <li> And to top it off this shipping</li>
            <li> but i love them.</li>
            <li> Love , Love , LOVE them.</li>
            <li> love it♡</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t look too cheaply made once they are put on!</li>
            <li> I will purchase more....</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> The lashes are ok, they look like plastic.</li>
            <li> Love these lashes.</li>
            <li> i am glad that it got here on time.</li>
            <li> As always I love these lashes.</li>
            <li> Love them,</li>
            <li> They are ok anyway..</li>
            <li> Love these lashes</li>
            <li> I will stick with store bought lashes from now on as I have literally not been able to put these on for an outing since I bought them.</li>
            <li> but the quality is great and shipped fast.</li>
            <li> but other wise these are good! :)</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re pretty good lashes.</li>
            <li> So worth the buy and wait!!</li>
            <li> The eyelashes are super nice</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s fantastic because it makes the lashes more durable.</li>
            <li> good quality, lashes itself look like real hair, just not on your eyes.</li>
            <li> Super great quality and hold very well bought 5 box&#x27;s this time.</li>
            <li> or so they were indeed worth it! :)</li>
            <li> I tryed to wear these on my birthday they were cool looking!</li>
            <li> but I have those days where they tear really easily</li>
            <li> They came through the mail very quickly (In 3 days).</li>
            <li> And makes for easy storage.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply .</li>
            <li> The best way to wear these is to apply them far out towards the corner of your eye and use lots of mascara to shape and blend them with your real lashes.</li>
            <li> makes it easy to pick up and to handle without bending lashies.</li>
            <li> The pretty picture of the 10 pairs of eyelashes sitting erectly in a nice box was NOT what showed up at my door step.</li>
            <li> so they have that shiny plastic look but for the price they are fine.</li>
            <li> But everything else was fine.</li>
            <li> so I guess there fine.</li>
            <li> gives that bold look !</li>
            <li> I received these lashes very quickly and off the bat I was already excited.</li>
            <li> HUGE BUSINESS</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll probably find that you need to trim them in order to make them fit your eyes.</li>
            <li> I had to trim them in order for them to fit my eyes</li>
            <li> seprately :) i love love these will definitely be buying more</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the buy. :)</li>
            <li> I can see why they were so cheap.</li>
            <li> i got these obviously because the price and they looked great</li>
            <li> The only thing I was not too happy about was the part where you apply the glue.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> They are cheap, and if you can get them to work for you then</li>
            <li> Cheap plastic eyelashes don&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> You too will like and enjoy.</li>
            <li> People would ask me if those were my real lashes!!!</li>
            <li> but you can easily fix them with a bit of mascara  to blend them in but for the most part their pretty soft and cute !</li>
            <li> I was so excited</li>
            <li> they are long and beautiful and go on pretty easily</li>
            <li> this right here is maddness!</li>
            <li> Cheap but not even worth it.</li>
            <li> i love them sooo much</li>
            <li> Theyre the perfect thickness if u like thick eye lashes.</li>
            <li> For the price that I paid, the quality was not bad...</li>
            <li> Not bad at all.</li>
            <li> I ordered the same thing several times cause they last long and they r very deserving of a good review perfect thicknesses and length .  </li>
            <li> I like them though, for super special events.</li>
            <li> The box was a little bent out of shape; however, the lashes were beautiful and full.</li>
            <li> i wanted to get some for a more daily routine to wear more often  </li>
            <li> I gave 4 stars because they look to &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; i was hoping they were more realistic..</li>
            <li> So glad I&#x27;m able to purchase them at a low price.</li>
            <li> Great price, but not worth it.</li>
            <li> I normally dont use a pair of lashes more than once</li>
            <li> Would look good for gyaru or doll looks, but definitely not a natural look.</li>
            <li> But for my shows, they are perfect and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> my first purchases were these !</li>
            <li> You will need your own tube of glue to adhere them on with (I recommend Duo, as one good tub of glue will last a long time).</li>
            <li> These are okay, they don&#x27;t stick easily with regular eyelash glue.</li>
            <li> These beautiful lashes are better than most expensive ones!</li>
            <li> I suppose it would be fine if you cut them up and used them more as individual lashes, because you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> say if you know how to put on lashes then you won&#x27;t have any problem there not for the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; girls I bought bundles of lashes why because they&#x27;re cheap good for everyday and durable for cleaning ...</li>
            <li> Looks great in photos but but to wear everyday like I would have liked to was not possible.</li>
            <li> To my surprise they where more natural feeling then not.</li>
            <li> They do not feel natural, but they are OK.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not really expertly good at applying lashes, don&#x27;t purchase these.</li>
            <li> My favorite so far.</li>
            <li> my natural lashes with mascara look alot better and longer than wearing these.</li>
            <li> I saved a lot, and it was well worth it..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lashes stay looking fresh.</li>
            <li> These lashes look fine upon first glance but have a very \\&quot;fake\\&quot; looking shine to them.</li>
            <li> They just aren&#x27;t so right.</li>
            <li> you can slip it right off the skin when done .</li>
            <li> but you have to trim them, but they get the job done with the right glue</li>
            <li> and arrived right on time</li>
            <li> They look real and are extremely beautiful, they aren&#x27;t too heavy and don&#x27;t fall apart on you.</li>
            <li> defanitly gonna get more in the future and only these kind.</li>
            <li> BUT i was really satisfied with the purchase their not heavy at all their good for an everyday look</li>
            <li> knock these lashes because they are not human hair but to me they suit me just fine!</li>
            <li> /&gt;i dont like them very much</li>
            <li> I was a little aprehensive when I ordered this product just because, its a good price.</li>
            <li> When I opened the box the lashed looked exactly how they do in the icon photo.</li>
            <li> I was very happened when I opened my package but even happier when I tried them on!</li>
            <li> Great quality,  but slow shipping</li>
            <li> It was exactly as it was stated online.</li>
            <li> i absolutely adore the way that these lashes look on me!  </li>
            <li> I was scared because this was the first time I&#x27;ve bought lashes of Amazon</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS EXACTLY</li>
            <li> A bit long, but so easy to cut and shape!</li>
            <li> The lashes are too stiff and not of good quality.</li>
            <li> They went on very nicely, but they were so thick</li>
            <li> overall they&#x27;re pretty good quality, and only $2.</li>
            <li> Lashies are easy to remove carefully and to clean and to reuse.</li>
            <li> i really love these lashes and yes you can reuse them at least once or twice more</li>
            <li> They are silky, long &amp; quite sexy ; )  </li>
            <li> This is an extremely good deal for such a low price, I intend to continue buying them.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I ordered this product at such a reasonable price..  </li>
            <li> First, the lashes are very unnatural in appearance.</li>
            <li> These are long, feathery and gal looking :3</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty decent quality.</li>
            <li> probably not going to wear them much.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s to be expected i love them</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m not going to complain much, I do like</li>
            <li> really crashed and v</li>
            <li> I really like them</li>
            <li> This is Second time i ordered them i got 2 packs since they r so cheap and</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear lashes much so</li>
            <li> Very flexable.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> They stick really well</li>
            <li> its really hard&lt;br /&gt;its dificult to apply&lt;</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve got a ton of lashes for a few bucks and to be honest</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say these are good for costumes or fun events, but NOT for formals or anything in daylight as the false lash will be visible.</li>
            <li> I normally like short to medium lashes to give it more of a natural look..</li>
            <li> double sided was unique.</li>
            <li> Bit other than that they are ok.</li>
            <li> cheap but still good to use I use this to cosplay and they are thick and long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn one pair so far 3 times and have even put mascara on them the first time and they are still good to go for at least another use or two.</li>
            <li> These ended up being a little bit more dramatic than I&#x27;d anticipated/wanted, but they&#x27;re good for a bold eye or event like prom.</li>
            <li> And also gives my eyes a whole new look.</li>
            <li> If only the product had been so lucky.</li>
            <li> They are long which is a good thing because you can cut them down to your size of eye.</li>
            <li> they came earlier then what i had expected so that was a plus, i tried them same day and they look amazing!</li>
            <li> These where okay, the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the fact that it is hard to fit the shape of your eye.</li>
            <li> they are thick and amazing for the price</li>
            <li> I love the eyelashes, they last long too.  </li>
            <li> But overall It&#x27;s definitely worth the wait.</li>
            <li> they are nice and thick</li>
            <li> I bought these because of the good value and because I was tired of spending $6 every two weeks on the drugstore lashes.</li>
            <li> They were what I needed, would of liked a little fuller lash but close enough.</li>
            <li> so I got a new curler</li>
            <li> They are very soft too.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are sooo soft!</li>
            <li> boy am i glad i did.they got here in just three days a day before the earliest expected day since i went for the standard shipping.i was suprised at how soft and flexible they</li>
            <li> They are definitely not an everyday lash!  </li>
            <li> I have over 15 years of eye-lash application experience and this was the first time I could not properly apply them.</li>
            <li> Due to my eyelashes are very short LOVE</li>
            <li> Use a little mascara and you will be fine.</li>
            <li> I certainly know we can not blame USPS because as I stated earlier, the package it came in was completely in tack.</li>
            <li> Clear band has tips on end.</li>
            <li> Instead of mimicking the natural lash pattern, it&#x27;s as if someone cut a series of triangles with a pair of scissors.</li>
            <li> Arrived completely smashed.</li>
            <li> too shiny doesn&#x27;t look natural as I thought they may</li>
            <li> Lashes were very plastic like, unlike the 100% human hair ones I&#x27;m used to buying.</li>
            <li> haha, overall 5 star</li>
            <li> but they were soft and flexible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use one pair so far and they have lasted 2 weeks already.</li>
            <li> They do not blend in with your natural lashes.</li>
            <li> They are soft, natural curl.</li>
            <li> If you want natural looking lashes, these aren&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> I use Duo Adhesive and rarely experience this problem with other lashes--</li>
            <li> For the most noticeable effect with false eyelashes to be had at the cheapest price, I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> First off ill admit i wasnt to sure on these</li>
            <li> But, when I review the lashes some of the lashes had dry glue stuck on them and it was kind of hard to take off because I didn&#x27;t want to ruin them.</li>
            <li> These lashes are not true to size in picture, they are Huge &amp; they came in the box all bent into different shapes &amp; sized</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the item took more than two weeks to arrive.</li>
            <li> so it came sooner then expected, when i opened it, it was in a cute little box and was neatly packaged i use these lashes for everyday glam and for Halloween, their so fun.</li>
            <li> I ordered these eyelashes and got some very thin and cheap looking ones that look nothing like the picture!!</li>
            <li> I am surprised that the average user rating of these lashes is so high!</li>
            <li> I love my false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Way to fake looking, I love lashes and tried to ignore all the other reviews but they were right, they suck.</li>
            <li> Also if you are not careful and don&#x27;t have the proper eyelash curler, instead of getting a U or C shape, you can get something like this ] which is what happened to me</li>
            <li> I use just the tips of my finger nails to remove dried glue on glue, after remove dried glue I use a soft smooth cotton cloth to wipe any glue dust off.</li>
            <li> full &amp;&amp; thick.</li>
            <li> i would so buy these again and recommend them to my friends, as a teen who loves wearing falsies i do love these their dramatic and</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like these, they were far too thick and didn&#x27;t stick very well.</li>
            <li> and I had to do A LOT of work to at least bend right.</li>
            <li> They are full and long but it was hard to match up a pair, because they were all different due to them being handmade.</li>
            <li> Also, the lash strip does not mimic the natural curve of an average eye.</li>
            <li> but, thats pretty common with a lot of falsies.</li>
            <li> Very upset with the packaging all squished, smashed and beat up not okay</li>
            <li> Unfortuantely, these pair of lashes only come long.</li>
            <li> My only problem is it takes long to deliver being that it coming from another country.  </li>
            <li> the one started coming off while i was waiting in the place, and they are quiet long so..</li>
            <li> if you wear fake lashes everyday, they may be good for you, especially for special occasions and stuff, but other than that, too dramatic for me.</li>
            <li> Will definitely continue to buy as long as they continue to sell!</li>
            <li> However, I found that the lashes are beyond bold and dramatic-- they look like something that does not belong on a human face.</li>
            <li> Super thin and took forever  to get here.</li>
            <li> I tried on four of five separate occasions to wear them and every single time was a total disaster.</li>
            <li> however, i cut them to the shape that I want and find that one pair could last long!!</li>
            <li> that is long, but some of the eye lashes were different sizes, there&#x27;s one larger than the other.</li>
            <li> Little long but easily fixed one fell apart as I pulled it form the package</li>
            <li> The little yellow envelope was still sealed, not crushed, or bent,</li>
            <li> They come in this little white card board box with Chinese or Japanese writing on then.</li>
            <li> Plus the fibers are synthetic, and so they shine in the light and look rather fake.</li>
            <li> As long as you didn&#x27;t tug them off, you were alright.  </li>
            <li> I just wanted to see how long I could wear them for and surprise, they&#x27;re still usable.   </li>
            <li> Because the adhesive strips are so long, it messes up all of your eye makeup.</li>
            <li> they come from a long ways</li>
            <li> but some came  earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not surprised how they showed up.</li>
            <li> You have to cut them because they come on a long thread.</li>
            <li> The front of the lash kept lifting &amp;&amp; it wouldn&#x27;t stick after numerous tries with glue from MAC.</li>
            <li> Took too long to arrive at my house.</li>
            <li> and not natural looking at all.</li>
            <li> I wear them everyday and they look so natural.  </li>
            <li> I went through them with nail nippers and sort of thinned them out, but the band is so thick it didn&#x27;t really make a difference.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at the quality of these lashes in comparison to what I usually buy at Duane Reade.  </li>
            <li> but just noticeable enough, as my other Ardell and Revlon lashes(I bought all 3 for sampling purposes)</li>
            <li> These are way to long!</li>
            <li> also  maybe  its not to hard for me to put them on because i use weave glue its really strong and keeps them more in place and isn&#x27;t a nasty mess like normal glue</li>
            <li> I even waited for the glue to dry halfway</li>
            <li> They are incredibly straight, and even after having them twisted around the makeup brush, they would not form to the shape of my natural eyelash line.</li>
            <li> it being the first time I buy false lashes</li>
            <li> Very fluffy and very long, to much for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a perfomer, so they are great for the stage, if you want an everyday or casual look, these are going to be too dramatic for you.</li>
            <li> Other lashes bought online are more expensive because they come with small tubes of glue.</li>
            <li> I disliked several things about this product:   </li>
            <li> You can even get them wet</li>
            <li> but that was expected.</li>
            <li> Got my eyelashes before expected.</li>
            <li> I expected them to feel like plastic</li>
            <li> However, when I opened the package I find the box crushed, all lashes flattened and smashed.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the long wait.</li>
            <li> although they arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Received on expected arrival date.</li>
            <li> I have had this pack for  a few months and still have plenty left to use.</li>
            <li> Too long of eyelashes for me, I don&#x27;t normally wear false lashes so maybe its just me.</li>
            <li> I was pretty annoyed how it took over a month &amp; a half to arrive.</li>
            <li> yet so so so disappointed... check out my blog for more [...]</li>
            <li> Three out of the ten pack where not able used.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for very bold, very thick long lashes--but I didn&#x27;t want them to look blatantly fake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d read somewhere that you had to be very careful</li>
            <li> The second issue I ran into with these lashes is that they are very stiff and ill-fitting.</li>
            <li> the little box was crushed</li>
            <li> ugly and cheap looking</li>
            <li> no they don&#x27;t look real but they are not supposed to their fake lashes</li>
            <li> definitely recommend these to any one who loves thick eyelashes.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not they are poor quality,  they just do not look natural at all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t have very long eyelashes naturally, but these eyelashes look so fake on me that I just could not bring myself to walk out of the door with them on.</li>
            <li> the lashes wouldn&#x27;t stay down.</li>
            <li> a down side is</li>
            <li> They took forever to arrive, and when they finally did, I was never able to apply them!</li>
            <li> From the product image, it was immediately clear that these lashes are dramatic.</li>
            <li> My only complaint here is that the artificial hair is intensely shiny.</li>
            <li> i honestly do not know why it takes that long</li>
            <li> Not too long, not too thick.</li>
            <li> If you like an eye brightening effect that isn&#x27;t too long or thick, then these are for you.</li>
            <li> so have a little patience with the shipment</li>
            <li> Box was smashed a little</li>
            <li> the lash strip a little bit.</li>
            <li> they arnt over dramatic n super fake looking</li>
            <li> It is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It looked as though it fell off the truck and he ran over it a few times before delivering it to me.</li>
            <li> Such a poor choice.</li>
            <li> Had to put a few coats on before it even started to stay on.    </li>
            <li> They are dramatic enough to make a noticeable effect and yet at the same time you can wear them without 100% looking like you have false eyelashes on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just super disappointed...</li>
            <li> And if the box is bent makes all the other lashes hard to curl when trying to put on.</li>
            <li> however they are a bit stiff</li>
            <li> The lash bands were bent out of shape on some of them, and they were stiff.</li>
            <li> Not sure when I received them because I dandt checked the mail in a few days.</li>
            <li> This shows me that the shipper cared very little about the product they produced and sent to their buyer.</li>
            <li> this is really hard for me to wear because it is so heavy.</li>
            <li> i must say that i nver really have anything bad to say but</li>
            <li> I noticed they weren&#x27;t entirely too fake looking cooking</li>
            <li> they are not so big that they look fake</li>
            <li> It was too small.</li>
            <li> They DO NOT feel hard or stiff.</li>
            <li> and I promise you&#x27;ll be covered for at least 1 and a half!</li>
            <li> Very plastic and stiff :(</li>
            <li> They are not suitable for bridal work at all.</li>
            <li> it is to hard to keep it on my lashes, tried using everything</li>
            <li> The rim of the lashes were extremely thick and plastic like, which I believe made them hard to put on.</li>
            <li> I know they are cheap, but I am never going to wear them because they look so horrible on my eyes.</li>
            <li> so I was, considering I have &#x27;man hands&#x27; but noticed they weren&#x27;t THAT delicate.</li>
            <li> Obviously this product is made from artificial hair.</li>
            <li> You will probably get a least a dozen uses out of each pair these lashes.</li>
            <li> i got mine so late</li>
            <li> kinda sucks though</li>
            <li> ,I put them on and they stay for at least two days.</li>
            <li> Also the strips to which the hairs are attached are incredibly thick, thus noticeable.</li>
            <li> way.. to thick for anyone&#x27;s tastes.</li>
            <li> It is rather thick</li>
            <li> Cheep looking, phony - lash band too thick</li>
            <li> Too thick.</li>
            <li> These lashes have a thick synthetic band that does NOT bend along the shape of your eye like quality lashes will (MAC, ModLash,</li>
            <li> ive bought a few times I believe... and they got worse each time.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing false eyelashes a few times a week for years now and I could not get these to work!</li>
            <li> These are so fake looking, very drag queen!  </li>
            <li> it makes it almost impossible to apply the lashes especially if you are a beginner.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking at these for serious use then look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> wasted my money on this bc they just look tooo fake plus it does not want to stay on my eyelids</li>
            <li> very thick</li>
            <li> These are the absolute worst.</li>
            <li> They are not great at all and irritate Eyes</li>
            <li> Worse lashes ever...</li>
            <li> and you could tell I was wearing false lashes.</li>
            <li> VERY DRAMATIC and heavy!</li>
            <li> It came in a really weird funky box.</li>
            <li> They look completely fake.</li>
            <li> and I feel like that makes it difficult to glue them on and have them stay on.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> They are horribly too long and don&#x27;t bend well.</li>
            <li> but i just hate that the tracks are so thick , its a bit of  hassle to put on</li>
            <li> They were very difficult to put on</li>
            <li> I have never even worn them because of this. :( :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed this came  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed :(</li>
            <li> I hate the band the lashes come on..</li>
            <li> AS STATED, I JUST HATED THE LASHES</li>
            <li> For the price, it would be a horrible choice to pass these up.</li>
            <li> Horrible. ..</li>
            <li> and the packaging was horrible</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Awesome is all I have to say</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are, in my opinion, stunning for the price. I&#x27;m wearing them right now and they look superb. Not too long, not too thick. My only complaint is that the item took more than two weeks to arrive.</li>
            <li> I know they are cheap, but I am never going to wear them because they look so horrible on my eyes. It is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I received these lashes very quickly and off the bat I was already excited. I&#x27;d read somewhere that you had to be very careful peeling these lashes off the casing so I was, considering I have &#x27;man hands&#x27; but noticed they weren&#x27;t THAT delicate. As long as you didn&#x27;t tug them off, you were alright.  The packaging looked the way it those in the pictures. The brand isn&#x27;t known, there were just some chinese symbols on the box cover.   The lashes looked great. I noticed they weren&#x27;t entirely too fake looking cooking but just noticeable enough, as my other Ardell and Revlon lashes(I bought all 3 for sampling purposes) weren&#x27;t too visible, might as well not wear any. I&#x27;ve worn one pair so far 3 times and have even put mascara on them the first time and they are still good to go for at least another use or two. Mind you the case comes with many. I just wanted to see how long I could wear them for and surprise, they&#x27;re still usable.   For the price, it would be a horrible choice to pass these up. You&#x27;ve got a ton of lashes for a few bucks and to be honest I might continue to buy, in bulk.  Now, they do not come with glue but it&#x27;s not a big deal. I also bought the glue from Revlon and it seems to work better than my Lash Grip glue. It&#x27;s also got a precision applicator tube. Bought it here --&gt;  [...]  I suggest you also buy this with your product.</li>
            <li> I ordered these lashes on October 11th and I received them on October 17th (about a Week)  They come in this little white card board box with Chinese or Japanese writing on then. When I opened the box the lashed looked exactly how they do in the icon photo. They DO NOT feel hard or stiff. To my surprise they where more natural feeling then not. I would order this product again &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> I was a little aprehensive when I ordered this product just because, its a good price. I was very happened when I opened my package but even happier when I tried them on! These eyelashes are sooo soft!</li>
            <li> They were very difficult to put on</li>
            <li> Good product and great price. They do not feel natural, but they are OK. Thank you!</li>
            <li> they came earlier then what i had expected so that was a plus, i tried them same day and they look amazing! defanitly gonna get more in the future and only these kind.</li>
            <li> Horrible. ..very cheap quality,I could not even use it.</li>
            <li> Have to say you get for you paid for Quality isn&#x27;t good, but I would say if you&#x27;re looking to learn how to put on lashes I would buy maybe these it&#x27;s good to use cheaper lashes to learn how to put them on then buy something more expensive and ruin them.</li>
            <li> These are the absolute worst. They took forever to arrive, and when they finally did, I was never able to apply them! I have been wearing false eyelashes a few times a week for years now and I could not get these to work! They are incredibly straight, and even after having them twisted around the makeup brush, they would not form to the shape of my natural eyelash line. Also the strips to which the hairs are attached are incredibly thick, thus noticeable. I tried on four of five separate occasions to wear them and every single time was a total disaster. Because the adhesive strips are so long, it messes up all of your eye makeup. It came in a really weird funky box. I would not recommend. I was so happy when I saw the price, but I should have known better.</li>
            <li> First off ill admit i wasnt to sure on these but i figured for the price id try them out n boy am i glad i did.they got here in just three days a day before the earliest expected day since i went for the standard shipping.i was suprised at how soft and flexible they are.also they arnt over dramatic n super fake looking either.overall their great n for the price theres no way u can beat them im very very happy i got these will deffinitly buy again</li>
            <li> I gave it a four because.I&#x27;ve ordered the lashes before and I love the quality and texture, plus you can&#x27;t beat the price compared to beauty store bought. What I don&#x27;t like is the amount of time it takes. for delivery, almost a month. I end up going to the beauty store anyway just to have some lashes until mine get here.</li>
            <li> I am surprised that the average user rating of these lashes is so high! I disliked several things about this product:   First, the lashes are very unnatural in appearance. I was hoping for very bold, very thick long lashes--but I didn&#x27;t want them to look blatantly fake. From the product image, it was immediately clear that these lashes are dramatic. However, I found that the lashes are beyond bold and dramatic-- they look like something that does not belong on a human face. Instead of mimicking the natural lash pattern, it&#x27;s as if someone cut a series of triangles with a pair of scissors. Unless you are trying to achieve a very eccentric look, you probably won&#x27;t appreciate these lashes. They are definitely not an everyday lash!  The second issue I ran into with these lashes is that they are very stiff and ill-fitting. You&#x27;ll probably find that you need to trim them in order to make them fit your eyes. Also, the lash strip does not mimic the natural curve of an average eye. As a result, the lashes will probably lift and peel at the corners of your eye. I use Duo Adhesive and rarely experience this problem with other lashes-- however it was a constant issue with this product. If you wear these out-- have your glue handy.   Obviously this product is made from artificial hair. That&#x27;s fantastic because it makes the lashes more durable. You will probably get a least a dozen uses out of each pair these lashes. You can even get them wet and it&#x27;s no big deal. My only complaint here is that the artificial hair is intensely shiny. This is another thing that adds to the definitively faux appearance of the lashes.   The bottom line is that you get what you pay for. You are getting a lot of lashes for your money, but they aren&#x27;t quality lashes. I definitely won&#x27;t purchase these again.</li>
            <li> I order these all the time because i like the way they look and they are not expensive but the box they come in is always squished when i get it and some of the eyelashes are messed up and it usually takes a month to get them with regular shipping.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t worn these out yet but i have tried them on. I had to trim them in order for them to fit my eyes but, thats pretty common with a lot of falsies. They&#x27;re pretty decent quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a perfomer, so they are great for the stage, if you want an everyday or casual look, these are going to be too dramatic for you. But for my shows, they are perfect and will last a long time. Good product.</li>
            <li> love them had to share with my Sister IN-LAW SO she can purchase!!!</li>
            <li> Unfortuantely, these pair of lashes only come long. I normally like short to medium lashes to give it more of a natural look.. however, i cut them to the shape that I want and find that one pair could last long!!</li>
            <li> For the most noticeable effect with false eyelashes to be had at the cheapest price, I highly recommend these. I have ordered some others on Amazon.com but these are the only ones which are noticeable enough to wear, and which I will be reordering in bulk. They are dramatic enough to make a noticeable effect and yet at the same time you can wear them without 100% looking like you have false eyelashes on. You will need your own tube of glue to adhere them on with (I recommend Duo, as one good tub of glue will last a long time). Other lashes bought online are more expensive because they come with small tubes of glue. So I recommend ordering this set and buying your own glue either online or at a store.</li>
            <li> Arrived completely smashed.</li>
            <li> Look awesome in person. Love them and would purchase again! :)  They was longer on the ends and I just trimmed them to the length I wanted.</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted these for her 21st birthday which was the 24th of October She put them on and fell in love.</li>
            <li> too shiny doesn&#x27;t look natural as I thought they may</li>
            <li> i really love these lashes and yes you can reuse them at least once or twice more they are not so big that they look fake i really love them they make my eyes look great</li>
            <li> they are thick and amazing for the price i cant find this kind of deal anywhere just have to buy the eyelash glue seprately :) i love love these will definitely be buying more</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re pretty good lashes. good quality, lashes itself look like real hair, just not on your eyes. Would look good for gyaru or doll looks, but definitely not a natural look. if you wear fake lashes everyday, they may be good for you, especially for special occasions and stuff, but other than that, too dramatic for me. probably not going to wear them much.</li>
            <li> Very good lashes for the price. A bit long, but so easy to cut and shape! Definitely worth the buy. :)</li>
            <li> Great quality,  but slow shipping</li>
            <li> I bought these as introductory eyelashes. They were a great price. They took forever to get here but that was expected. I hate the band the lashes come on.. it makes it almost impossible to apply the lashes especially if you are a beginner. Since the band isn&#x27;t sturdy, I can&#x27;t even give a good description of these lashes. They just aren&#x27;t so right. And they are way.. way.. way.. to thick for anyone&#x27;s tastes. very thick but the hairs are lined together nice. If you&#x27;re not really expertly good at applying lashes, don&#x27;t purchase these. If you don&#x27;t like the totally overdone look, don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> i must say that i nver really have anything bad to say but this right here is maddness! i ordered on oct 6 and they said i should have gotten on the 28th i honestly do not know why it takes that long but whatever any way its the 6th of nov i still havent received it yet they said that they would refund it but i havent gotten that yet so so so disappointed... check out my blog for more [...]</li>
            <li> The eyelashes are a very nice style but they are synthetic material so they have that shiny plastic look but for the price they are fine. I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li> Got my eyelashes before expected. So thats a plus!  Very glad I made this purchase! I give it a two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Lashes were very plastic like, unlike the 100% human hair ones I&#x27;m used to buying. The rim of the lashes were extremely thick and plastic like, which I believe made them hard to put on. I have over 15 years of eye-lash application experience and this was the first time I could not properly apply them. No matter which glue I used (strip lash glue, individual semi-permanent, or permanent) the lashes wouldn&#x27;t stay down. The lashes are too stiff and not of good quality. I can see why they were so cheap.</li>
            <li> Super thin and took forever  to get here. But you get what you pay  for I guess.</li>
            <li> These beautiful lashes are better than most expensive ones! My favorite so far. :) Although they took about a month or so they were indeed worth it! :)</li>
            <li> wasted my money on this bc they just look tooo fake plus it does not want to stay on my eyelids my natural lashes with mascara look alot better and longer than wearing these. dont bother</li>
            <li> love the lashes I don&#x27;t care with others say if you know how to put on lashes then you won&#x27;t have any problem there not for the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; girls I bought bundles of lashes why because they&#x27;re cheap good for everyday and durable for cleaning ...they come from a long ways so have a little patience with the shipment but some came  earlier than expected. Thanks</li>
            <li> They are not great at all and irritate Eyes</li>
            <li> I ordered these lashes the end of September and i got them about 2-3 weeks later so it came sooner then expected, when i opened it, it was in a cute little box and was neatly packaged i use these lashes for everyday glam and for Halloween, their so fun. i love them they come in different sizes in the box, i did have to trim the edges but that&#x27;s to be expected i love them they are long and beautiful and go on pretty easily i would so buy these again and recommend them to my friends, as a teen who loves wearing falsies i do love these their dramatic and no they don&#x27;t look real but they are not supposed to their fake lashes haha, overall 5 star i love them :)</li>
            <li> good and easy to work it. a lot so I don&#x27;t have to worry about running out oh so loving it!</li>
            <li> very cute i love these lashes alot of people knock these lashes because they are not human hair but to me they suit me just fine! Its all about how you put them on if you are use to putting lashes on these will be no different!</li>
            <li> These are way to long! They look completely fake. I have never even worn them because of this. :( :(</li>
            <li> These where okay, the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the fact that it is hard to fit the shape of your eye. I tried a lot and it will come staight and I had to do A LOT of work to at least bend right. I was 1 dollar and something so i&#x27;m not going to complain much, I do like that is long, but some of the eye lashes were different sizes, there&#x27;s one larger than the other.</li>
            <li> I got these lashes because i haven&#x27;t gotten some in forever i wanted to get some for a more daily routine to wear more often  i got these obviously because the price and they looked great a down side is i got mine so late and the packaging was horrible the little box was crushed BUT i was really satisfied with the purchase their not heavy at all their good for an everyday look an  idk why  people say they look like plastic i don&#x27;t see it but you can easily fix them with a bit of mascara  to blend them in but for the most part their pretty soft and cute ! i recommend you get these! also  maybe  its not to hard for me to put them on because i use weave glue its really strong and keeps them more in place and isn&#x27;t a nasty mess like normal glue you can slip it right off the skin when done .</li>
            <li> I ordered the same thing several times cause they last long and they r very deserving of a good review perfect thicknesses and length .  I would tell others</li>
            <li> The lashes are stiff,ichy,and wont even stick with glue. I even waited for the glue to dry halfway so it was &amp;#34;stickier&amp;#34;. It still popped off the eyelid. Cheap but not even worth it.</li>
            <li> I ordered these eyelashes and got some very thin and cheap looking ones that look nothing like the picture!!</li>
            <li> The package of eyelashes came in good time. It was exactly as it was stated online. I look forward to using them</li>
            <li> it is to hard to keep it on my lashes, tried using everything but nothing seems to work for this.</li>
            <li> For the price that I paid, the quality was not bad... Not bad at all. I expected them to feel like plastic but they were soft and flexible. The only thing I was not too happy about was the part where you apply the glue. It is rather thick and I feel like that makes it difficult to glue them on and have them stay on. I had to glue and re glue around three times to actually have them stick and stay. But I&#x27;m starting to suspect that i might not be doing it correctly or something.. Who knows..  But everything else was fine.</li>
            <li> Little long but easily fixed one fell apart as I pulled it form the package but that&#x27;s my fault</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are comfortable to wear. I love the way they look. What a great deal I got when I purchased them &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Three out of the ten pack where not able used. But for the most part they where great. I will reorder</li>
            <li> I thought they were a bit flimsy. But I still love them wear them all the time I need to buy more!</li>
            <li> I bought these as a joke gift for a friend and with the price I&#x27;m not surprised how they showed up. It looked as though it fell off the truck and he ran over it a few times before delivering it to me. Luckily only one pair was damaged. They looked like they could be of actual use. But it didn&#x27;t come with any glue or anything and they can&#x27;t just be stuck on. If you&#x27;re looking at these for serious use then look elsewhere. However for a joke/gag gift they were ok.</li>
            <li> They were too shiny and plasticky looking. Tried to use them up in photo shoots, but had to edit out the shine. They are not suitable for bridal work at all. Will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> i absolutely adore the way that these lashes look on me!  They are silky, long &amp; quite sexy ; )  I was very surprised at the quality of these lashes in comparison to what I usually buy at Duane Reade.  Will definitely continue to buy as long as they continue to sell!</li>
            <li> I like them they are nice and thick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed this came  really crashed and v the box was sticky !!! On of the lashes had a 2 inch lash sticking out of it! And to top it off this shipping took like a month ! I&#x27;m just super disappointed...</li>
            <li> I really like them but I have those days where they tear really easily and that makes one pair gone. And if the box is bent makes all the other lashes hard to curl when trying to put on.</li>
            <li> I was pretty annoyed how it took over a month &amp; a half to arrive. And the box it came in was squished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall they&#x27;re pretty good quality, and only $2. You have to cut them because they come on a long thread. If you like an eye brightening effect that isn&#x27;t too long or thick, then these are for you.</li>
            <li> i love them sooo much but i just hate that the tracks are so thick , its a bit of  hassle to put on but i love them. Theyre the perfect thickness if u like thick eye lashes. Love , Love , LOVE them. definitely recommend these to any one who loves thick eyelashes.</li>
            <li> People would ask me if those were my real lashes!!! And also gives my eyes a whole new look. Due to my eyelashes are very short LOVE THIS PRODUCT !!! I keep buying them when I run out :) Use them every day!</li>
            <li> Box was smashed a little</li>
            <li> These are so fake looking, very drag queen!  Very fluffy and very long, to much for everyday use. Did not like them</li>
            <li> My package arrived in tack. The little yellow envelope was still sealed, not crushed, or bent, no damage. However, when I opened the package I find the box crushed, all lashes flattened and smashed. Such a poor choice. I ordered a bunch of products at once and this was the last one to ship. It almost seems as though they dug this box out of a hole underneath a crate. The pretty picture of the 10 pairs of eyelashes sitting erectly in a nice box was NOT what showed up at my door step. This is not a storefront I plan on doing business with again. I certainly know we can not blame USPS because as I stated earlier, the package it came in was completely in tack. If only the product had been so lucky. This shows me that the shipper cared very little about the product they produced and sent to their buyer. HUGE BUSINESS NO NO!</li>
            <li> I bought these because of the good value and because I was tired of spending $6 every two weeks on the drugstore lashes. I liked the look of them when they were in the package. They went on very nicely, but they were so thick I felt like I was wearing a lampshade over my eyes. Plus the fibers are synthetic, and so they shine in the light and look rather fake. I went through them with nail nippers and sort of thinned them out, but the band is so thick it didn&#x27;t really make a difference. I&#x27;m disappointed :( I&#x27;m going to keep the remaining pairs for when I work on clients for photoshoots because they give good definition, but I won&#x27;t be using them on myself anymore!</li>
            <li> I gave 4 stars because they look to &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; i was hoping they were more realistic..</li>
            <li> Just got them yesterday  love it♡</li>
            <li> Looks great! Would buy again!</li>
            <li> they are nice to work with they don&#x27;t look too cheaply made once they are put on!</li>
            <li> After I finally received these eyelashes, waiting MONTHS for them -- I attempted to wear a pair, &amp;&amp; I didn&#x27;t even bother again. The eyelashes didn&#x27;t even stick like they&#x27;re suppose to!!! The front of the lash kept lifting &amp;&amp; it wouldn&#x27;t stick after numerous tries with glue from MAC. I just tossed the rest of the lashes in the garbage. Obviously you GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR! Don&#x27;t bother with these. Definitely not worth the long wait.</li>
            <li> Very plastic and stiff :(</li>
            <li> I will not order these anymore....although they arrived sooner than expected. They are horribly too long and don&#x27;t bend well. Looks great in photos but but to wear everyday like I would have liked to was not possible. Great price, but not worth it.</li>
            <li> These are not the pair you&#x27;ll find at the beauty supply store. But for the price &amp; quantity, it&#x27;s the best decision you could make via Amazon &amp; this company. I will purchase more....I have 2 sets of 10 already.</li>
            <li> They came through the mail very quickly (In 3 days). They look real and are extremely beautiful, they aren&#x27;t too heavy and don&#x27;t fall apart on you. This is an extremely good deal for such a low price, I intend to continue buying them.</li>
            <li> What would I do without them. I love my false eyelashes. So glad I&#x27;m able to purchase them at a low price. If u haven&#x27;t tried them u have to be on something lol.</li>
            <li> I must say these eyelashes are THE BEST! 10 pairs for $3? You can not pass it up! The time frame from there to here kinda sucks though, buy 2 packs and I promise you&#x27;ll be covered for at least 1 and a half!</li>
            <li> I love the eyelashes, they last long too.  My only problem is it takes long to deliver being that it coming from another country.  But overall It&#x27;s definitely worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Good for the price. flexible but you have to trim them, but they get the job done with the right glue</li>
            <li> the item is good and the price is good. and you can wear this eyeladhes when you go a party，it&#x27;s nice！</li>
            <li> i lovee these lashes. my first purchases were these ! full &amp;&amp; thick. gives that bold look ! love it</li>
            <li> I love these. It was great. When I first received the package it seemed small but the way they place the lashes double sided was unique. And makes for easy storage. The quality of the lashes was excellent and I enjoyed the variety.</li>
            <li> Cheep looking, phony - lash band too thick</li>
            <li> The eyelashes are super nice however they are a bit stiff you nee to trip dow the lash strip a little bit. Bit other than that they are ok. I dont think I would buy again.</li>
            <li> The lashes are ok, they look like plastic. Use a little mascara and you will be fine. Everyone likes them so I guess there fine.</li>
            <li> They were what I needed, would of liked a little fuller lash but close enough. The color was spoton for me</li>
            <li> Too thick. Doesn&#x27;t stick well.</li>
            <li> Love these lashes. Easy to apply . Would purchase these a again. Received on expected arrival date. Very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> i have not tried it yet.... i am glad that it got here on time. will have to edit review once i have tried it.</li>
            <li> Way to fake looking, I love lashes and tried to ignore all the other reviews but they were right, they suck. The band is to big, you can&#x27;t bend the product, and they are way to shiny looking.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I was scared because this was the first time I&#x27;ve bought lashes of Amazon but I am extremely happy with these. I&#x27;ve use one pair so far and they have lasted 2 weeks already. 💕</li>
            <li> These are long, feathery and gal looking :3 If you are into Lolita or Gyaru I would reccomend these. They are very soft too.</li>
            <li> It was too small. However, once it was on, it stay on until I took it off, and it look my own lashes.</li>
            <li> they came in a couple weeks earlier then the estimation and they&#x27;re really great. Cant wait to try them on for events</li>
            <li> As always I love these lashes. Super great quality and hold very well bought 5 box&#x27;s this time. Love them,</li>
            <li> This is Second time i ordered them i got 2 packs since they r so cheap and just like the first time there perfect stay on way better then others ive tried will b buyin again</li>
            <li> VERY DRAMATIC and heavy! I don&#x27;t wear lashes much so this is really hard for me to wear because it is so heavy. Feels like boulders on my eyelids x_x. I like them though, for super special events.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re great except for they don&#x27;t come pre-cut and arched so i have to do that myself.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS EXACTLY AS STATED, I JUST HATED THE LASHES ONCE I SAW IN TANGIBLE FORM.</li>
            <li> These lashes have a thick synthetic band that does NOT bend along the shape of your eye like quality lashes will (MAC, ModLash, RedCherry - all great lashes). These lashes look fine upon first glance but have a very \\&quot;fake\\&quot; looking shine to them. They do not blend in with your natural lashes. I&#x27;d say these are good for costumes or fun events, but NOT for formals or anything in daylight as the false lash will be visible. The best way to wear these is to apply them far out towards the corner of your eye and use lots of mascara to shape and blend them with your real lashes.</li>
            <li> these eyelashes look exactly as pictured, are very beautiful, look amazing and durable! and arrived right on time i would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> Took too long to arrive at my house. Too long of eyelashes for me, I don&#x27;t normally wear false lashes so maybe its just me. Don&#x27;t buy if you wear glasses.</li>
            <li> Worse lashes ever... I don&#x27;t understand why they are completely different than what is advertised. Never will buy them again.</li>
            <li> cheap but still good to use I use this to cosplay and they are thick and long they last along time if you reuse them.</li>
            <li> They are full and long but it was hard to match up a pair, because they were all different due to them being handmade. The lash bands were bent out of shape on some of them, and they were stiff. Also if you are not careful and don&#x27;t have the proper eyelash curler, instead of getting a U or C shape, you can get something like this ] which is what happened to me so I got a new curler and I got them to curl instead of denting. The shape of these lashes are spiky, so if you like gyaru makeup styles then you will like these, if you can work around the cons.</li>
            <li> not the greatest quality you can find. and not natural looking at all. They are ok anyway.. i would wear them maybe to a dress up party or something...</li>
            <li> Amazing! Love these lashes I wear them everyday and they look so natural.  I&#x27;m a makeup artist and can use These lashes for any occasion</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like these, they were far too thick and didn&#x27;t stick very well. Also if you&#x27;re a woman with smaller eyes like mine - don&#x27;t purchase these.</li>
            <li> These are okay, they don&#x27;t stick easily with regular eyelash glue. Had to put a few coats on before it even started to stay on.    Update 11/4/14: Made my 5th and final attempt two days ago to use these. I couldn&#x27;t get them to shape to my eye, or stay on at all. They are cheap, and if you can get them to work for you then all the power to you. I will stick with store bought lashes from now on as I have literally not been able to put these on for an outing since I bought them.</li>
            <li> I tryed to wear these on my birthday they were cool looking! But i think because i didn&#x27;t get enough glue on them the one started coming off while i was waiting in the place, and they are quiet long so.. but other wise these are good! :)</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t feel like human hair eye lashes that you could get from your local beauty supply store, but they would do.</li>
            <li> These lashes are not true to size in picture, they are Huge &amp; they came in the box all bent into different shapes &amp; sized</li>
            <li> The box was a little bent out of shape; however, the lashes were beautiful and full. I haven&#x27;t tried putting any of them all yet but the quality is great and shipped fast. I wasn&#x27;t expecting until 8/26 they arrived on 8/14</li>
            <li> These ended up being a little bit more dramatic than I&#x27;d anticipated/wanted, but they&#x27;re good for a bold eye or event like prom. I still wear them when I want to feel glamorous.  And you get a ton for a great price! Can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when my lashes came in, they look just like the picture. But, when I review the lashes some of the lashes had dry glue stuck on them and it was kind of hard to take off because I didn&#x27;t want to ruin them.</li>
            <li> I bought these for an art project,  they worked perfectly for that. I would not recommend wearing these though,  it&#x27;s not they are poor quality,  they just do not look natural at all. I suppose it would be fine if you cut them up and used them more as individual lashes, because you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> ive bought a few times I believe... and they got worse each time.</li>
            <li> I ordered these on Aug 31st, received last night. Not sure when I received them because I dandt checked the mail in a few days. Anyhoo I got them in about 2 weeks. They are soft, natural curl. Do not feel like plastic. They are long which is a good thing because you can cut them down to your size of eye. Very flexable. I love them! I will try on today</li>
            <li> I am so glad I ordered this product at such a reasonable price..  I saved a lot, and it was well worth it.. Thanks</li>
            <li> Very upset with the packaging all squished, smashed and beat up not okay and not something i was happy with getting in the mail.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t have very long eyelashes naturally, but these eyelashes look so fake on me that I just could not bring myself to walk out of the door with them on.</li>
            <li> Cheap plastic eyelashes don&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> They go with different eye looks.</li>
            <li> ugly and cheap looking</li>
            <li> Took a while to arrive,but I always reorder before I get to low.....They stick really well,I put them on and they stay for at least two days.</li>
            <li> Always my go-to lashes when I need some lashes, and they make my eyes pop if I double them up. So worth the buy and wait!!</li>
            <li> its really hard&lt;br /&gt;its dificult to apply&lt;br /&gt;i dont like them very much but i guess its the glue i have</li>
            <li> Clear band has tips on end. makes it easy to pick up and to handle without bending lashies. I trim the tips off. the tip is just that a tip of lash band.&lt;br /&gt;Lashes stay looking fresh. Lashies are easy to remove carefully and to clean and to reuse. I use just the tips of my finger nails to remove dried glue on glue, after remove dried glue I use a soft smooth cotton cloth to wipe any glue dust off. I have a ring dish that has lid. I keep lash of week in and keep it on bth room sink. I always have lashes on when I start the start of my day. You too will like and enjoy.</li>
            <li> If you want natural looking lashes, these aren&#x27;t it. I bought these it being the first time I buy false lashes and you could tell I was wearing false lashes.</li>
            <li> I normally dont use a pair of lashes more than once but I have with these. I have had this pack for  a few months and still have plenty left to use. They last all night and dont fall off. I love them!</li>
