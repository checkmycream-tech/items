            <li>This lip balm feels great (not greasy at all), keeps my lips smooth, and the best part is there are no petroleum products in the balm itself.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;m sticking with Lip Ivo, the best, and good old Chapstick.</li>
            <li>I liked this product.</li>
            <li>i used to use Loving Naturals</li>
            <li>this is as good or better</li>
            <li>I am kind of picky about lip balms and had built up quite a collection of them over time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than Burt&#x27;s, but not as good as EcoLips</li>
            <li>and he really liked it too.</li>
            <li>THE most amazing &amp;#34;chapstick&amp;#34; ever.</li>
            <li>At first this stuff worked great for months as a lip moisterizer.</li>
            <li>one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Ana Mardollt many children would find the scent</li>
            <li>This is my favorite lip balm.</li>
            <li>This delivers better than any I have tried.</li>
            <li>Have been pleased with product performance.  </li>
            <li>B002VFAV6U Burt&#x27;s Bees]] which also made my lips peel, and many many others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>My favorite lip balm.  </li>
            <li>and then if you can get it apart, you&#x27;re stuck with glue around the top.</li>
            <li>This does better then most things.  </li>
            <li>I also love Dr Bronner&#x27;s Sun Dogs Magic Balm.</li>
            <li>My local Target quit carrying it and when they clearanced their remaining stock, I bought it all.  :D</li>
            <li>This stuff goes on so nice and smooth</li>
            <li>I love the fact it is odorless, organic and made with ingredients you can read and pronounce.  </li>
            <li>I love the texture of this lip balm, and the fact that it is unscented and unflavored.</li>
            <li>My favorite lip balm.</li>
            <li>When i became more concerned about what i used on my body i picked up this chapstick at Target(who</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, has no taste or smell, and nourishes my lips with healthy ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Other than the packaging the lip balm is excellent!</li>
            <li>, this will start the healing process very quickly and sooth them.  </li>
            <li>The lip balm goes on smooth and feels extremely nice, but I did have to apply more Dr. Bronner&#x27;s lip balm the most frequently - 8 to 9 times a day in a nine hour</li>
            <li>it is my absolute favorite thing!</li>
            <li>If you want a bubble gum, fruity lip balm then this is not for you, however If you are looking for soft, supple lips than this is your new best friend.</li>
            <li>As for application, Hugo Naturals goes on smoothly</li>
            <li>I went on Accutance back in 2005 (which worked great).</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and lasts for a while.</li>
            <li>I also really don&#x27;t like flavored lip balm, so I was thrilled to find this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and creamy without being greasy and makes my lips feel fantastic.</li>
            <li>The ones with a smell are a bit cheaper and you get free shipping</li>
            <li>About 2 years ago I developed some kind of allergy to most brands, peeling and chapped and sore lips.  </li>
            <li>I first found this lip balm at Target and fell in love with how easily it goes on and</li>
            <li>The scent is a mixed-bag - I would probably describe it as \\&quot;cheerful\\&quot; smelling, but it feels overwhelming, particularly right after application.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to products, especially those with added oils or fragrances, so to find this was wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I often cycle for long distances in the Texas heat and never have it get too greasy or run like I&#x27;ve experienced with Carmex.</li>
            <li>, that is pretty much magic in a tube).  </li>
            <li>I originally found this lip balm at Target and they stopped carrying it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy I ordered all of them and will use them all (except perhaps the Hugo Naturals, due to my unique allergy issues) until they&#x27;re gone...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy I ordered all of them and will use them all (except perhaps the Hugo Naturals, due to my unique allergy issues) until they&#x27;re gone...</li>
            <li>(And if that doesn&#x27;t make my life sound exciting, I don&#x27;t know what will, ha.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>B001JAH2M4 Hugo Naturals Lip Balm, Vanilla &amp; Sweet Orange]] - 3 Stars&lt;br /&gt;Hugo</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;Vanilla and Sweet Orange\\</li>
            <li>but it makes a good backup if I misplace the Naked (purple).         </li>
            <li>I have issues with too much beeswax making my lips peel - this is ok.</li>
            <li>I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s as a whole and this product did not disappoint.</li>
            <li>It is my new favorite.</li>
            <li>It works great as a moisturizer under lipstick or gloss because it has a bland taste.</li>
            <li>But all I want is a good lip balm because my lips are dry.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I was looking for and will order again!</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s only lip balm, but it really is the best product I&#x27;ve been able to find for long term use and real relief.</li>
            <li>Bronner&#x27;s little purple stick of lip balm isn&#x27;t perfect, but it&#x27;s about as near as I could find in \\&quot;natural\\&quot; lip balms.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s USDA Certified Organic (as opposed to the more flimsy \\&quot;Natural\\&quot; moniker) and - according to their website, at least - the company is certified as a Fair Trade company.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s all natural and Organic.</li>
            <li>I would always get a newer, better balm and toss my old one.</li>
            <li>my lips are fairly jacked about half the time.  </li>
            <li>My lips are sensitive and chap easily.  </li>
            <li>B001ET729S Dr. Bronner&#x27;s &amp; Sun Dog&#x27;s Magic Organic Lip Balm, Naked]] - 5 Stars</li>
            <li>and I am still completely rash free.</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite lip balm for several years.  </li>
            <li>I when to buy another one once my first tube was almost out</li>
            <li>so I was happy to at least find this one on here.</li>
            <li>It works great in not only preventing dry, chapped lips</li>
            <li>This is hands down my favorite lip balm!</li>
            <li>Once I stumbled on this stuff I threw pretty much all of them away.  </li>
            <li>Okay, maybe I am a bit obsessed, but this stuff is true magic.</li>
            <li>Lasts long, not sticky, healing and clean!</li>
            <li>, I decided to try out three different \\&quot;natural\\&quot; lip balms available on Amazon, this one included, and limit myself to one lip balm a day, recording my observations and frequency of use in a 9-hour work day.</li>
            <li>how reasonably priced this stuff is--</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>But the ingredient really is in there.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t soak in too fast (but fast enough that it&#x27;s not sitting on the surface of my lips for forever) and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.  </li>
            <li>Been using for several months now and have been alergic free.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think I will every try another lip balm.</li>
            <li>I really noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another thing i really like is that its \\&quot;naked,\\</li>
            <li>Far better than nothing and a vast improvement over the chapstick stuff.</li>
            <li>The ingredients list is short and clean.</li>
            <li>It is sold for 3.50$ at my local store so this is not a bad deal for me.    </li>
            <li>Considering i use chapstick many time through out the day, ive noticed i need it less while using Dr. Bronners.</li>
            <li>The ingredient list is 10+ items long, but you can visit their website to download a complete list of ingredients in their products, which is nice if you have a specific allergy or additive you&#x27;re trying to avoid.</li>
            <li>When I recently ran out of lip balm (I&#x27;m an avid user), I wanted to look into something a little more \\&quot;green\\&quot; - organic, if possible, and paraben free.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product -</li>
            <li>Surely you can make it a little easier.</li>
            <li>They are a bit pricey but worth the extra for safety sake.</li>
            <li>I bite my lips compulsively so especially during the winter (which living in Minnesota is pretty much 6 months of the year)</li>
            <li>I used to love this lip balm, but the new version (blue container rather than purple) seems to be different despite a similar ingredient list.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice smooth lip balm, not waxy, &amp; I like that it has only organic ingredients &amp; nothing that might be questionable health-wise.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to pinpoint exactly what ingredients are the problem, but very common ingredients like lanolin and beeswax seem to cause me problems.</li>
            <li>only thing that I&#x27;ve found that will help in the long run with the chronic dryness is more water than I want to drink on a daily basis and Bronner&#x27;s lip balm.</li>
            <li>The tape around the top is so hard to get off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used it around my nose during a cold when my runny nose is chapped;; works great for that as well.</li>
            <li>It keeps my lips soft and moist.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I keep forgetting to look it up, but so far I haven&#x27;t noticed any altered state of mind after application....</li>
            <li>I used Blistex for years and years and then suddenly developed an alergic reaction.</li>
            <li>One of my friends isn&#x27;t wild about it because she thinks it smells to earthy.</li>
            <li>I really cant rave about this stuff enough just buy it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I seemed to have constant dry, chapped lips while I was pregnant.  </li>
            <li>This is the first and only lip balm (so far) that has actually worked for me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, does not turn into a greasy oil slick when you put it on, and there is no smell to this product - a point I really enjoy.</li>
            <li>The only reason for four stars is that I dread opening a new one.</li>
            <li>My whole life I&#x27;ve dealt with chronic dry and chapped lips.</li>
            <li>Unscented and unflavored, this is a gentle yet emollient balm that heals and prevents dry, chapped lips.  </li>
            <li>Nearly tasteless, completely odorless and feels good on.  </li>
            <li>Actual application is smooth and application times are the least frequent - 7 times each day, within the nine hour testing period.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought this from whole foods in the past but they quit carrying &amp;#34; naked &amp;#34; kind  (or at least the one I go to did).</li>
            <li>I also needed something that wouldn&#x27;t irritate my incredibly sensitive skin allergies (which is why I tend to go for unflavored/unscented/uncolored personal care items).</li>
            <li>Many of the lip balms I tried actually made the condition worse.</li>
            <li>&quot; flavor has a nice, mild scent to it, but there&#x27;s a slight \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; at application that I found slightly unpleasant - perhaps a reaction on my part to the citrus additives?</li>
            <li>The long ingredient list (13+ items) notes which ingredients were certified organic and which ones weren&#x27;t, and you can visit their website for a complete ingredients list for each flavor of lip balm they offer.</li>
            <li>This nearly flavorless, entirely unscented lip balm keeps my lips moisturized for a long time!</li>
            <li>Very sad, because it used to be my absolute favorite and now I think I will need to start shopping around for a different balm.</li>

            <li> The scent is a mixed-bag - I would probably describe it as \\&quot;cheerful\\&quot; smelling, but it feels overwhelming, particularly right after application.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to products, especially those with added oils or fragrances, so to find this was wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I often cycle for long distances in the Texas heat and never have it get too greasy or run like I&#x27;ve experienced with Carmex.</li>
            <li> , that is pretty much magic in a tube).  </li>
            <li> I originally found this lip balm at Target and they stopped carrying it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy I ordered all of them and will use them all (except perhaps the Hugo Naturals, due to my unique allergy issues) until they&#x27;re gone...</li>

            <li> The \\&quot;Vanilla and Sweet Orange\\</li>
            <li> but it makes a good backup if I misplace the Naked (purple).         </li>
            <li> I have issues with too much beeswax making my lips peel - this is ok.</li>
            <li> I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s as a whole and this product did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> It is my new favorite.</li>
            <li> It works great as a moisturizer under lipstick or gloss because it has a bland taste.</li>
            <li> But all I want is a good lip balm because my lips are dry.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I was looking for and will order again!</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s only lip balm, but it really is the best product I&#x27;ve been able to find for long term use and real relief.</li>
            <li> Bronner&#x27;s little purple stick of lip balm isn&#x27;t perfect, but it&#x27;s about as near as I could find in \\&quot;natural\\&quot; lip balms.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s USDA Certified Organic (as opposed to the more flimsy \\&quot;Natural\\&quot; moniker) and - according to their website, at least - the company is certified as a Fair Trade company.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s all natural and Organic.</li>
            <li> I would always get a newer, better balm and toss my old one.</li>
            <li> my lips are fairly jacked about half the time.  </li>

            <li> B001ET729S Dr. Bronner&#x27;s &amp; Sun Dog&#x27;s Magic Organic Lip Balm, Naked]] - 5 Stars</li>
            <li> and I am still completely rash free.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite lip balm for several years.  </li>
            <li> I when to buy another one once my first tube was almost out</li>
            <li> so I was happy to at least find this one on here.</li>
            <li> It works great in not only preventing dry, chapped lips</li>
            <li> This is hands down my favorite lip balm!</li>
            <li> Once I stumbled on this stuff I threw pretty much all of them away.  </li>
            <li> Okay, maybe I am a bit obsessed, but this stuff is true magic.</li>
            <li> Lasts long, not sticky, healing and clean!</li>
            <li> , I decided to try out three different \\&quot;natural\\&quot; lip balms available on Amazon, this one included, and limit myself to one lip balm a day, recording my observations and frequency of use in a 9-hour work day.</li>
            <li> how reasonably priced this stuff is--</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> But the ingredient really is in there.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t soak in too fast (but fast enough that it&#x27;s not sitting on the surface of my lips for forever) and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.  </li>
            <li> Been using for several months now and have been alergic free.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think I will every try another lip balm.</li>
            <li> I really noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing i really like is that its \\&quot;naked,\\</li>
            <li> Far better than nothing and a vast improvement over the chapstick stuff.</li>
            <li> The ingredients list is short and clean.</li>
            <li> It is sold for 3.50$ at my local store so this is not a bad deal for me.    </li>
            <li> Considering i use chapstick many time through out the day, ive noticed i need it less while using Dr. Bronners.</li>
            <li> The ingredient list is 10+ items long, but you can visit their website to download a complete list of ingredients in their products, which is nice if you have a specific allergy or additive you&#x27;re trying to avoid.</li>
            <li> When I recently ran out of lip balm (I&#x27;m an avid user), I wanted to look into something a little more \\&quot;green\\&quot; - organic, if possible, and paraben free.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product -</li>
            <li> Surely you can make it a little easier.</li>
            <li> They are a bit pricey but worth the extra for safety sake.</li>
            <li> I bite my lips compulsively so especially during the winter (which living in Minnesota is pretty much 6 months of the year)</li>
            <li> I used to love this lip balm, but the new version (blue container rather than purple) seems to be different despite a similar ingredient list.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nice smooth lip balm, not waxy, &amp; I like that it has only organic ingredients &amp; nothing that might be questionable health-wise.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to pinpoint exactly what ingredients are the problem, but very common ingredients like lanolin and beeswax seem to cause me problems.</li>
            <li> only thing that I&#x27;ve found that will help in the long run with the chronic dryness is more water than I want to drink on a daily basis and Bronner&#x27;s lip balm.</li>
            <li> The tape around the top is so hard to get off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it around my nose during a cold when my runny nose is chapped;; works great for that as well.</li>
            <li> It keeps my lips soft and moist.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I keep forgetting to look it up, but so far I haven&#x27;t noticed any altered state of mind after application....</li>
            <li> I used Blistex for years and years and then suddenly developed an alergic reaction.</li>
            <li> One of my friends isn&#x27;t wild about it because she thinks it smells to earthy.</li>
            <li> I really cant rave about this stuff enough just buy it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I seemed to have constant dry, chapped lips while I was pregnant.  </li>
            <li> This is the first and only lip balm (so far) that has actually worked for me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight, does not turn into a greasy oil slick when you put it on, and there is no smell to this product - a point I really enjoy.</li>
            <li> The only reason for four stars is that I dread opening a new one.</li>
            <li> My whole life I&#x27;ve dealt with chronic dry and chapped lips.</li>
            <li> Unscented and unflavored, this is a gentle yet emollient balm that heals and prevents dry, chapped lips.  </li>
            <li> Nearly tasteless, completely odorless and feels good on.  </li>
            <li> Actual application is smooth and application times are the least frequent - 7 times each day, within the nine hour testing period.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this from whole foods in the past but they quit carrying &amp;#34; naked &amp;#34; kind  (or at least the one I go to did).</li>
            <li> I also needed something that wouldn&#x27;t irritate my incredibly sensitive skin allergies (which is why I tend to go for unflavored/unscented/uncolored personal care items).</li>
            <li> Many of the lip balms I tried actually made the condition worse.</li>
            <li> &quot; flavor has a nice, mild scent to it, but there&#x27;s a slight \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; at application that I found slightly unpleasant - perhaps a reaction on my part to the citrus additives?</li>
            <li> The long ingredient list (13+ items) notes which ingredients were certified organic and which ones weren&#x27;t, and you can visit their website for a complete ingredients list for each flavor of lip balm they offer.</li>
            <li> This nearly flavorless, entirely unscented lip balm keeps my lips moisturized for a long time!</li>
            <li> Very sad, because it used to be my absolute favorite and now I think I will need to start shopping around for a different balm.</li>
            <li> I only wish it had a little natural spf protection.</li>
            <li> I had chronically very dry cracked lips and have tried some home remedies suggested by friends, as well as commercial lip balms.  </li>
            <li> Expensive and not, I am a huge lip balm fan.</li>
            <li> , you probably can&#x27;t go wrong with any of these lip balms - I recommend all of them over the non-natural, paraben-containing brands available.</li>
            <li> , you probably can&#x27;t go wrong with any of these lip balms - I recommend all of them over the non-natural, paraben-containing brands available.</li>
            <li> Be careful, the melt point is low.</li>
            <li> It no longer lasts as long, and doesn&#x27;t feel as hydrating.  </li>
            <li> And, of course, all other things being equal, I prefer a lip balm that lasts as long as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> especially when you compare it to other organic brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently switched my beauty items to all natural and have been sorely disappointed with the options available for lip balm.</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Naked formulation has so far been just what I&#x27;ve been looking for--and I&#x27;ve been looking hard.  </li>
            <li> Whether or not that is a bad thing will depend entirely on the user - I can imagine that many children would find the scent</li>
            <li> Only four stars because AMAZON.com raised the price from $10.40 to $17.94 in only a few months.</li>
            <li> It was below freezing and very dry.  </li>
            <li> I have used it on other parts of my body too, in a pinch (my hands, my stretched earlobes before putting in my jewelry)</li>
            <li> I only wish it stayed on my lips a little longer, but that&#x27;s always been my wish for all lip balms.</li>
            <li> i just want some lip moisture and this is one of the only brands that has a plain version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what ingredient I&#x27;m allergic to in other brands, but Dr Bronner&#x27;s has never caused me a problem.  </li>
            <li> I am Extremely Grateful for this product.  </li>
            <li> I keep trying other kinds out of habit</li>
            <li> I have mildly sensitive skin elsewhere, but for some reason my lips are crazy hyper sensitive.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive lips, seriously TRY THIS!</li>
            <li> To Carrots also sports the USDA Certified Organic label, albeit with an odd \\&quot;95%</li>
            <li> product lasts for hours after an application, even during heavy activity.</li>

            <li> I tried Vasaline, to messy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure, though, if the application times were less because the lip balm lasted longer than its compatriots or if it was because I was dreading the wash of bright-cheerful-melon scent.</li>

            <li> I have tried at least a hundred lip balms over the years, and while I have found others that worked, the manufactures either changed the formula, causing me to break out or were eventually discontinued.</li>

            <li> I am one of those people who&#x27;s convinced I&#x27;m &amp;#34;addicted&amp;#34; to lip balm.  I always carry a &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; in my pocket; every day when I put on my jewelry I also put my &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; in my pocket then.  About 2 years ago I developed some kind of allergy to most brands, peeling and chapped and sore lips.  I found Dr Bronner&#x27;s by happenstance at a store one day and tried it b/c it said &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; - and have been using it ever since!  I don&#x27;t know what ingredient I&#x27;m allergic to in other brands, but Dr Bronner&#x27;s has never caused me a problem.

It&#x27;s USDA Certified Organic (as opposed to the more flimsy \\&quot;Natural\\&quot; moniker) and - according to their website, at least - the company is certified as a Fair Trade company. The \\&quot;Naked\\&quot; version is almost completely scentless and tasteless (although they do sell scented and flavored ones for people who like that sort of thing) and the ingredients list is refreshingly short - a mere 5 ingredients, perfect for the allergenically inclined. The lip balm goes on smooth and feels extremely nice, but I did have to apply more Dr. Bronner&#x27;s lip balm the most frequently - 8 to 9 times a day in a nine hour period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001JAH2M4 Hugo Naturals Lip Balm, Vanilla &amp; Sweet Orange]] - 3 Stars&lt;br /&gt;Hugo Naturals doesn&#x27;t sport the USDA Certified Organic label, but several of the ingredients on the ingredient list have \\&quot;Organic\\&quot; in the title (although \\&quot;Certified\\&quot; is nowhere to be found, so I&#x27;m not sure how to take that). The ingredient list is 10+ items long, but you can visit their website to download a complete list of ingredients in their products, which is nice if you have a specific allergy or additive you&#x27;re trying to avoid.

Furthermore, I noticed that after wearing the lip balm for awhile, the tip of my tongue started to itch irritably, to the point where I found myself gnawing on my tongue to &#x27;scratch&#x27; it. This irritation occurred on all of my \\&quot;Hugo Naturals Days\\&quot;, but not with the other lip balms, and since I cycled the days randomly I suspect that the relationship was a causal one. As for application, Hugo Naturals goes on smoothly and I had to reapply 7-8 times in a nine hour period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001EWETC8 Yes To Carrots Lip Butter, Melon]] - 4 Stars&lt;br /&gt;Yes To Carrots also sports the USDA Certified Organic label, albeit with an odd \\&quot;95% Organic\\&quot; disclaimer just above it. The long ingredient list (13+ items) notes which ingredients were certified organic and which ones weren&#x27;t, and you can visit their website for a complete ingredients list for each flavor of lip balm they offer. I bought the \\&quot;Melon\\&quot; flavor on the theory that it would be the mildest, but I notice that the \\&quot;Melon\\&quot; flavor also contains a good dose of citrus orange extract. I didn&#x27;t notice a tingle or an irritation with this lip balm, however, which was a relief. The scent is a mixed-bag - I would probably describe it as \\&quot;cheerful\\&quot; smelling, but it feels overwhelming, particularly right after application. Actual application is smooth and application times are the least frequent - 7 times each day, within the nine hour testing period. I&#x27;m not sure, though, if the application times were less because the lip balm lasted longer than its compatriots or if it was because I was dreading the wash of bright-cheerful-melon scent.

            <li> THE most amazing &amp;#34;chapstick&amp;#34; ever. I&#x27;ve bought this from whole foods in the past but they quit carrying &amp;#34; naked &amp;#34; kind  (or at least the one I go to did). Anyway I loved being able to buy the 6 pack one. This will not disappoint, i tried others and have always come back to this it is my absolute favorite thing!</li>
            <li> The only chapstick I have found that is currently on the market that does not give me a rash! I have mildly sensitive skin elsewhere, but for some reason my lips are crazy hyper sensitive. I have tried at least a hundred lip balms over the years, and while I have found others that worked, the manufactures either changed the formula, causing me to break out or were eventually discontinued. I have never been able to pinpoint exactly what ingredients are the problem, but very common ingredients like lanolin and beeswax seem to cause me problems. I am on my 8th or so tube of this and I am still completely rash free. If you have sensitive lips, seriously TRY THIS!</li>
            <li> My lips tend to get so irritated by allergens that I actually have to go see a dermatologist every so often to get prescription help.  Very few balms don&#x27;t irritate me, yet living out here in the desert, it&#x27;s hard for me to go without a moisturizer.  Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Naked formulation has so far been just what I&#x27;ve been looking for--and I&#x27;ve been looking hard.  My daughter found it at a health food shop in Truth or Consequences, NM, and recommended that I give it a try.  I&#x27;m so glad she found it!  It has been a godsend since Blistex&#x27;s Good Sense has been discontinued.  Love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lip balm. I don&#x27;t want flavors and am allergic to peppermint and menthol. But all I want is a good lip balm because my lips are dry. This delivers better than any I have tried.Without any silly scents or flavors.</li>
            <li> I went on Accutance back in 2005 (which worked great). This is basically my lifeblood and if I forget my Naked chapstick at home it is almost as bad as running out of gas on the side of the freeway.   This stuff goes on great, and I carry it with me wherever I go.    It is sold for 3.50$ at my local store so this is not a bad deal for me.    I don&#x27;t care for the Peppermint (blue) but it makes a good backup if I misplace the Naked (purple).         TRY IT!</li>
            <li> At first this stuff worked great for months as a lip moisterizer. However, there is something in it that triggered an allergic response, and I had to stop using it. I&#x27;m sticking with Lip Ivo, the best, and good old Chapstick.</li>
            <li> This has got to be the best lip balm I have ever had!  I am very sensitive to products, especially those with added oils or fragrances, so to find this was wonderful.  It works great in not only preventing dry, chapped lips but if I don&#x27;t use it for a while and my lips do start to crack and peel, this will start the healing process very quickly and sooth them.  Thank you Dr. Bronner!</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s is a name you can trust in providing products that DON&#x27;T contain harmful or unnecessary chemicals. They are a bit pricey but worth the extra for safety sake.</li>
            <li> This has been my go-to lip balm for about a year now. It has no scent, which is key for me. It goes on smoothly and lasts for a while. I&#x27;m still shocked at how reasonably priced this stuff is--especially when you compare it to other organic brands. I keep a stick of this balm in about five different places in my house. It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find in the store... This is all I will use!</li>
            <li> Received promptly and well.  Have been pleased with product performance.  Will reorder!</li>
            <li> My whole life I&#x27;ve dealt with chronic dry and chapped lips. For years I dealt with [[ASIN:B0000VLX2I ChapStick]] but it never actually solved my problem, just made it easier to deal with. Eventually I began to experiment in search of chapped lip relief and I tried [[ASIN:B0018MLZMQ Nivea]] which I found too greasy, [[ASIN:B004X67G36 Carmex]] which smelled strong and made my lips peel horribly, [[ASIN:B002VFAV6U Burt&#x27;s Bees]] which also made my lips peel, and many many others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I&#x27;ve found that will help in the long run with the chronic dryness is more water than I want to drink on a daily basis and Bronner&#x27;s lip balm. It&#x27;s lightweight, does not turn into a greasy oil slick when you put it on, and there is no smell to this product - a point I really enjoy. I like the fact that there is only 5 ingredients (jojoba seed oil, avocado oil, beeswax, hemp seed oil, and tocopherol) and none of them are chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product lasts for hours after an application, even during heavy activity. I often cycle for long distances in the Texas heat and never have it get too greasy or run like I&#x27;ve experienced with Carmex. I highly recommend this product - I know it&#x27;s only lip balm, but it really is the best product I&#x27;ve been able to find for long term use and real relief.</li>
            <li> I had chronically very dry cracked lips and have tried some home remedies suggested by friends, as well as commercial lip balms.  This was the very best.  Bye bye cracked sore lips.  Nearly tasteless, completely odorless and feels good on.  Amazing stuff! Many of the lip balms I tried actually made the condition worse.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite lip balm for several years.  It keeps my lips soft and moist.  I&#x27;ve also used it around my nose during a cold when my runny nose is chapped;; works great for that as well.</li>
            <li> Very, very good.  Unscented and unflavored, this is a gentle yet emollient balm that heals and prevents dry, chapped lips.  I will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> I like this lip balm. No flavor or scent. I tried the ginger one and didn&#x27;t like it so I ordered this one and I like this one the best.</li>
            <li> My favorite lip balm.  I like that it has simple ingredients.  I only wish it had a little natural spf protection.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a no-nonsense organic lip balm and found this. I have trusted Dr. Bronner products for years so had no problem ordering this. It is exactly what I was looking for and will order again!</li>
            <li> This nearly flavorless, entirely unscented lip balm keeps my lips moisturized for a long time! It never cakes up, is non-irritable, and isn&#x27;t greasy, sticky or heavy. The ingredients list is short and clean. This is the first and only lip balm (so far) that has actually worked for me.  (Note: I purchased one stick at a local health food store, I didn&#x27;t actually purchase the pack shown here.)</li>
            <li> This is the best lip balm I have ever used!  The only reason for four stars is that I dread opening a new one. The tape around the top is so hard to get off. Surely you can make it a little easier. It shreds and then if you can get it apart, you&#x27;re stuck with glue around the top. Other than the packaging the lip balm is excellent!</li>
            <li> I liked this product. It works great as a moisturizer under lipstick or gloss because it has a bland taste. Only four stars because AMAZON.com raised the price from $10.40 to $17.94 in only a few months. The LEMON-LIME has a great taste too.</li>
            <li> This lip balm feels great (not greasy at all), keeps my lips smooth, and the best part is there are no petroleum products in the balm itself.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so difficult to find an unscented lip balm! I have been pleased with every Dr. Bronner&#x27;s product I&#x27;ve purchased, and this was no exception!</li>
            <li> have had chapped lips for years. This does better then most things.  The &amp;#34;naked&amp;#34; is best for me.</li>
            <li> The best lip balm there is. Period.</li>
            <li> The lip balm I received from Amazon doesn&#x27;t have anything about Sun Dog on it so I don&#x27;t know what that&#x27;s about.... but it&#x27;s nice smooth lip balm, not waxy, &amp; I like that it has only organic ingredients &amp; nothing that might be questionable health-wise. One ingredient does intrigue me: Cannabis Sativa Seed Oil.  Not sure what it is &amp; I keep forgetting to look it up, but so far I haven&#x27;t noticed any altered state of mind after application.... haha. Just kidding.  But the ingredient really is in there. I&#x27;m addicted to lip balm... &amp; found out that my previous lip balms had some very questionable ingredients via the GoodGuide &amp; SkinDeep apps, so here I am, trying something new.  And I like it.</li>
            <li> I recently had to go to NY in freezing weather.  It was below freezing and very dry.  My lips wanted to crack and chap but I kept them lubed with this product and survived my 10 day Ordeal with perfect lips.  I am Extremely Grateful for this product.  I also love Dr Bronner&#x27;s Sun Dogs Magic Balm.</li>
            <li> hydrates well and no smell, great stuff!  i used to use Loving Naturals but it seems they are out of business?  this is as good or better</li>
            <li> I used to use a bunch of different lip balms.  I bite my lips compulsively so especially during the winter (which living in Minnesota is pretty much 6 months of the year) my lips are fairly jacked about half the time.  I am kind of picky about lip balms and had built up quite a collection of them over time.  Once I stumbled on this stuff I threw pretty much all of them away.  (I only use this and Neosporin Lip Health which nothing can EVER replace, that is pretty much magic in a tube).  I keep trying other kinds out of habit but I always come back to this product.  It goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t soak in too fast (but fast enough that it&#x27;s not sitting on the surface of my lips for forever) and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.  I have used it on other parts of my body too, in a pinch (my hands, my stretched earlobes before putting in my jewelry) and it worked just as well.  My local Target quit carrying it and when they clearanced their remaining stock, I bought it all.  :D</li>
            <li> Good moisturizing lip balm.  Be careful, the melt point is low.</li>
            <li> I used Blistex for years and years and then suddenly developed an alergic reaction. I tried Vasaline, to messy. I tried Burt&#x27;s Bee, still alergic. Dr. Bonner&#x27;s is the answer. Been using for several months now and have been alergic free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve probably tried every lip balm ever created. I&#x27;ve recently switched my beauty items to all natural and have been sorely disappointed with the options available for lip balm. I also really don&#x27;t like flavored lip balm, so I was thrilled to find this. It&#x27;s smooth and creamy without being greasy and makes my lips feel fantastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than Burt&#x27;s, but not as good as EcoLips - I have issues with too much beeswax making my lips peel - this is ok. Far better than nothing and a vast improvement over the chapstick stuff.</li>
            <li> I seemed to have constant dry, chapped lips while I was pregnant.  I originally found this lip balm at Target and they stopped carrying it.  This stuff goes on so nice and smooth and I felt like it actually healed the severe &amp;#34;chapping&amp;#34; that I got while I was pregnancy which was hormone related. I love the fact it is odorless, organic and made with ingredients you can read and pronounce.  I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s as a whole and this product did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> I love the texture of this lip balm, and the fact that it is unscented and unflavored. It is my new favorite.</li>
            <li> My lips are sensitive and chap easily.  Other lip balms irritate my skin or make me uncomfortable with the chemical ingredients.  This is perfect lip balm.  It goes on smooth, has no taste or smell, and nourishes my lips with healthy ingredients.  I bought 12 because they are hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is the best I have yet to find! I love that it&#x27;s all natural and Organic. I first found this lip balm at Target and fell in love with how easily it goes on and how well it hydrates and lasts. I when to buy another one once my first tube was almost out and they didn&#x27;t carry it anymore. I also let my husband use it and he really liked it too. So I looked for them on Amazon. The ones with a smell are a bit cheaper and you get free shipping but my husband won&#x27;t use those so I was happy to at least find this one on here. Since I had to pay shipping I was very happy to find out that they sent it to me priority and it got to me within 2 working days. I really don&#x27;t think I will every try another lip balm. I am perfectly happy with this stuff! And trust me I have tried a lot of different ones! Expensive and not, I am a huge lip balm fan. I don&#x27;t used anything else on my lips so a good one  is very important!</li>
            <li> My favorite lip balm.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, pleasant texture, no taste, no smell - works really well. Neutral packaging, good for kids as well as adults.</li>
            <li> This is hands down my favorite lip balm! One of my friends isn&#x27;t wild about it because she thinks it smells to earthy. If you want a bubble gum, fruity lip balm then this is not for you, however If you are looking for soft, supple lips than this is your new best friend. I have never finished an entire lip balm before this one. I would always get a newer, better balm and toss my old one. I think I am on my third one now. I keep one at work, one in my purse, one in my nightstand and one in the bathroom. Okay, maybe I am a bit obsessed, but this stuff is true magic.</li>
            <li> I used to love this lip balm, but the new version (blue container rather than purple) seems to be different despite a similar ingredient list.  It no longer lasts as long, and doesn&#x27;t feel as hydrating.  Very sad, because it used to be my absolute favorite and now I think I will need to start shopping around for a different balm.</li>
            <li> Almost no flavor, lightweight feel, perfect lip balm!</li>
            <li> I was using horrible Blistex, yuck! When i became more concerned about what i used on my body i picked up this chapstick at Target(who no longer carries it.) I was amazed! I really noticed a difference. My lips were no longer \\&quot;chapped\\&quot; and didn&#x27;t start to \\&quot;burn\\&quot; when the chaptick wore off like they did with other crap chapsticks. Considering i use chapstick many time through out the day, ive noticed i need it less while using Dr. Bronners. I really cant rave about this stuff enough just buy it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing i really like is that its \\&quot;naked,\\&quot; i don&#x27;t like flavors or scents or colors... i just want some lip moisture and this is one of the only brands that has a plain version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY IT!!</li>
            <li> Bronner&#x27;s again!  The only lip balm my husband will use.  Lasts long, not sticky, healing and clean!</li>
