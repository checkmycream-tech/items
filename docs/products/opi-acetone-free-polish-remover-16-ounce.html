            <li>I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>so I was very happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for those of us who looove to do nail art :D</li>
            <li>A good product that arrived on time.</li>
            <li>it is by far the best polish remover</li>
            <li>This polish remover is very quick!</li>
            <li>Mild scent which is perfect and works really well.</li>
            <li>This is a non-acetone remover which is better for your nails.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to be more eco-friendly, which is why I bought this nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>If you are going to use it make sure you have adequate ventilation as it has a very strong chemical odor that lingers.</li>
            <li>Even though it is gentle on the nails, it  still effectively removes nail polish : )</li>
            <li>The smell is really strong and I wasn&#x27;t expecting that.</li>
            <li>I should&#x27;ve known considering how strong the smell of this stuff was that it wasn&#x27;t what they advertised.  </li>
            <li>This is the best nail polish remover, hands down.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because it was acetone free and wanted to use it to strip paint from my plastic miniatures.  </li>
            <li>Acetone free remover should not affect plastic/resin miniatures.  </li>
            <li>It does have a strong odor but worth the temporary discomfort.  </li>
            <li>It does the job or removing polish quickly from your nails and doesn&#x27;t harm your nails in the process.  </li>
            <li>Remover\\&quot;, which is even more expensive, but has excellent reviews.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s strong but gentle.</li>
            <li>This version is much safer to use as it acetone free.</li>
            <li>There are far too many companies out there these days willing to use terms like \\&quot;all</li>
            <li>It works more quickly, yet more gently, than every other remover I have tried.</li>
            <li>Very gentle on nails.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased acetone free remover before, and in addition to being gentle on my nails, it had a decent smell.</li>
            <li>I thought I was going to be able to remove my polish inside the house with my fiance in the same room.</li>
            <li>It removes glitter polishes much more quickly and less abrasively than pure acetone.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is it has a really strong odor.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find the large bottles in any stores where OPI is sold</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Acetone removes this polish very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work nearly as fast as acetone removers, but it&#x27;s much much gentler on my nails and hands, so</li>
            <li>All polish remover has a smell, but this one is intense.</li>
            <li>I have to flush the cotton balls or the whole bathroom</li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t expecting that.</li>
            <li>difference is significant enough for me to decide not to use this product.</li>
            <li>Acetone, in my opinion, is a decent alternative if used in a well-ventilated area</li>
            <li>have fragile nails, and these are mild and doing the job</li>
            <li>natural\\&quot; without mentioning the fact that natural can be toxic!!</li>
            <li>The only nail polish I use now is Scotch Naturals water-based polishes, which as far as I&#x27;m concerned, are the very best, strongest polishes I have ever used (and I&#x27;ve used expensive stuff like Mac, Chanel, Clinique, etc., which haven&#x27;t lasted any longer than cheap brands: with proper application, including base and top coat, Scotch lasts and lasts!!!)</li>
            <li>This brand seems gentle enough, and effective, but it has that familiar harsh chemical smell of ordinary remover.</li>
            <li>It is hard to find this product, so I am really glad to have found this &amp; would buy this again &amp; from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>It is soft with my brushes and my nails.</li>
            <li>I discovered this at my local TJ Maxx and soon realized it was well worth the extra price.</li>
            <li>next time I&#x27;ll try \\&quot;Tate&#x27;s The Natural Miracle - Odorless Nail Polish</li>
            <li>The soy-based polish removers, as safe as they are, simply don&#x27;t remove nail polish well: if you apply 4 coats like I do (base, 2 coats of color, top), it takes forever to get it off using a soy-based remover.</li>
            <li>You use less than the cheaper removers and it&#x27;s gentle.</li>

            <li> but I don&#x27;t care as long as it removes my polish and doesn&#x27;t hurt my nail</li>

            <li> There are fake and real products out there.</li>
            <li> This is seriously the only nail polish remover I use.</li>
            <li> Well, it still reeks heavily of chemicals.</li>
            <li> I think I got the fake one because the bottle and sticker label is different and so is the cap.</li>

            <li> There are fake and real products out there. I think I got the fake one because the bottle and sticker label is different and so is the cap. The smell is really strong and I wasn&#x27;t expecting that. It still works like any other nail polish remover so I&#x27;ll still give it a three star.</li>
            <li> Brought the bottle with me to my manicurist.  Was tone it was basically the same ingredients as the acetone she uses...just a different name.  Also, it seems not to have helped my nails at all!</li>
            <li> I have purchased acetone free remover before, and in addition to being gentle on my nails, it had a decent smell. This brand seems gentle enough, and effective, but it has that familiar harsh chemical smell of ordinary remover. For the price, I expected a neutral fragrance. And i bought the larger size for the economy. Oh well.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Quality product.</li>
            <li> This is the best nail polish remover, hands down. This is seriously the only nail polish remover I use. It works more quickly, yet more gently, than every other remover I have tried. It doesn&#x27;t leave my fingers feeling dried out and crusty and my nails actually feel stronger when I use it. It removes glitter polishes much more quickly and less abrasively than pure acetone. The only downfall is the extreme smell. If you are going to use it make sure you have adequate ventilation as it has a very strong chemical odor that lingers.</li>
            <li> Very gentle on nails.  Very suitable for weak, thin nails. Even though it is gentle on the nails, it  still effectively removes nail polish : )</li>
            <li> If you look up the ingredients in this remover at SkinDeep.org, you will see that it contains ingredients that are far more dangerous than acetone. I am sticking with plain old, non-scented, no-color-added acetone because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The soy-based polish removers, as safe as they are, simply don&#x27;t remove nail polish well: if you apply 4 coats like I do (base, 2 coats of color, top), it takes forever to get it off using a soy-based remover. The only nail polish I use now is Scotch Naturals water-based polishes, which as far as I&#x27;m concerned, are the very best, strongest polishes I have ever used (and I&#x27;ve used expensive stuff like Mac, Chanel, Clinique, etc., which haven&#x27;t lasted any longer than cheap brands: with proper application, including base and top coat, Scotch lasts and lasts!!!) Acetone removes this polish very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Acetone, in my opinion, is a decent alternative if used in a well-ventilated area and you don&#x27;t stick your nose right down on the cotton ball and inhale deeply; use common sense with ALL chemicals AND READ YOUR LABELS, RESEARCH THE INGREDIENTS. There are far too many companies out there these days willing to use terms like \\&quot;all natural\\&quot; without mentioning the fact that natural can be toxic!! SkinDeep.org will give you all the information about chemicals in all beauty/hygiene products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compare ethyl lactate, an ingredient in Opi&#x27;s no acetone remover:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;with acetone:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference is significant enough for me to decide not to use this product.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well, but stinks to high heaven. It doesn&#x27;t work nearly as fast as acetone removers, but it&#x27;s much much gentler on my nails and hands, so I&#x27;m going to continue to use it.</li>
            <li> All went well.  A good product that arrived on time.</li>
            <li> This is a non-acetone remover which is better for your nails. It is hard to find this product, so I am really glad to have found this &amp; would buy this again &amp; from the manufacturer. I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it was acetone free and wanted to use it to strip paint from my plastic miniatures.  Acetone free remover should not affect plastic/resin miniatures.  I used this to strip the paint from a ~$50 miniature and watch it eat through the plastic before I could save it...  I should&#x27;ve known considering how strong the smell of this stuff was that it wasn&#x27;t what they advertised.  Lesson learned and feel extremely cheated by this product (plus out $50 on my now glob of plastic).</li>
            <li> This version is much safer to use as it acetone free. Mild scent which is perfect and works really well.</li>
            <li> I discovered this at my local TJ Maxx and soon realized it was well worth the extra price. You use less than the cheaper removers and it&#x27;s gentle. I couldn&#x27;t find the large bottles in any stores where OPI is sold so I was very happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It does the job or removing polish quickly from your nails and doesn&#x27;t harm your nails in the process.  So it&#x27;s strong but gentle.</li>
            <li> it is by far the best polish remover I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fragile nails, and these are mild and doing the job well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some may have problem with the smell but I don&#x27;t care as long as it removes my polish and doesn&#x27;t hurt my nail</li>
            <li> I believe this has helped in the process for me finally having nails!  It does have a strong odor but worth the temporary discomfort.  I put the used cotton balls in a zip lock baggy to dispose of.</li>
            <li> It is soft with my brushes and my nails. It is perfect for those of us who looove to do nail art :D</li>
            <li> This polish remover is very quick! It takes off all types of polish in an instant. The only drawback is it has a really strong odor. All polish remover has a smell, but this one is intense. I have to flush the cotton balls or the whole bathroom will smell like paint thinner and give me a headache.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to be more eco-friendly, which is why I bought this nail polish remover. Because it&#x27;s acetone-free I thought I was going to be able to remove my polish inside the house with my fiance in the same room. Well, it still reeks heavily of chemicals. I really wasn&#x27;t expecting that. next time I&#x27;ll try \\&quot;Tate&#x27;s The Natural Miracle - Odorless Nail Polish Remover\\&quot;, which is even more expensive, but has excellent reviews.</li>
