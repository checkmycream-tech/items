            <li> but the front right one sucks.  </li>

            <li> Stinks that the front right slot is so short</li>
            <li> Well priced compared to other items.</li>
            <li> I have my mini travel eyeshadow brush set standing in there only because it looks weird empty.  </li>

            <li> Great t hold my brushes</li>
            <li> Holds my brushes perfectly and looks good on the counter.  Each section is a different height. I use the shortest for some short travel brushes I have and they fit perfectly. Good buy.</li>
            <li> This organizer holds ALL my brushes with room to spare! Love that there are three separate holders. I love the wavy look! Will be ordering another one for my eye liners!</li>

            <li> Bought 2 - arrived just fine.  The back middle and front left compartments are awesome...but the front right one sucks.  Too short for much of anything.  I have my mini travel eyeshadow brush set standing in there only because it looks weird empty.  In my 2nd one, i have a mini bronzer brush and mini sample fan brush..other than that,t he other 2 compartments elegantly display all of my face and eye brushes quite well .  Stinks that the front right slot is so short; if it wasn&#x27;t, I think I only needed one of these.</li>
            <li> This one organizer cleaned up my messy, cluttered corner of brushes. And turned it into something organized and pretty! It holds all my brushes perfectly and I love it. It makes getting ready in the morning 100 times easier!</li>
            <li> I bought two, one for my mom and one for myself. Boy was I right about this item. It makes your makeup station look a lot more organized and just gorgeous overall! Great quality!! FYI it is not a crystal base but still looks nice.</li>
            <li> The product just is what it is, I love the appearance and it holds a lot.  Well priced compared to other items.</li>

            <li> I was looking for a compact brush organizer that would fit on a narrow shelf in the bathroom.  This works well, and still has room for my daily-use brushes and pencils.  It is perfect for keeping my shorter pencils and brushes separate from the taller things and easier to find.  The acrylic seems durable and looks nice.  Good purchase.</li>
