    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>&quot; fits the flavor/strength perfectly.</li>
            <li>Great product, delivered as promised.</li>
            <li>used this in my WaterPik with great results as well.</li>
            <li>The flavor is great.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant minty flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have problems with both and am happy to have a refreshing feeling rinse that does not cause me problems.</li>
            <li>so I welcome an alcohol free</li>
            <li>At my sophisticated age, ;-) , this is the BEST oral rinse ever!</li>
            <li>Pleasant taste and smooth texture, Not too overpowering at all and does wonders for any plaque you may have</li>
            <li>also prefer a stronger, more astringent mouthwash with fluoride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not so sure about the &#x27;over 50&#x27; thing.  </li>
            <li>This does not leave the burning feeling that many leave in your mouth.</li>
            <li>Crest has probably the best mouthwash out there as its not alcohol based so the effects are longer lasting.  </li>
            <li>I feel like this Pro-Health does a better job in that area</li>
            <li>When I told him I believed it worked better and helped more, he told me to continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I think the \\&quot;50 and over\\&quot; thing is nothing more than a gimmick on Crest&#x27;s part.</li>
            <li>Crest Pro-Health Smooth Mint Mouth Rinse falls into the category of refreshing, alcohol-free mouth washes.  </li>
            <li>It is very mild but still feels nice and fresh.</li>
            <li>Listerine is a bit more sweet and leaves nice fresh breath for way longer.</li>
            <li>I think most of the Crest mouth rinses work against these issues so what makes this special for people over 50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have used Plax (ok), Listerine (mediciney aftertaste), and mouthwash like Scope (sweet) and thought I would give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and minty (as advertised), and doesn&#x27;t have the alcohol burn (it does not contain</li>
            <li>main problem I have with this mouthwash, however, is that it seems to leave a film of some kind on my teeth.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;This rinse was selected for people over 50 because it is alcohol-free and provides a unique sensation.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice a unique sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No burning sensation (no alcohol) and obviously contains ingredients that are good for oral hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say this claim is true.</li>
            <li>It is just simply a smooth mint flavor, just like the bottle says, that makes your mouth taste and feel fresh.</li>
            <li>I noticed it - it&#x27;s not bad, but it&#x27;s there</li>
            <li>My orthodontist recommended this on account of the gaps I get from my braces, to clean good and disinfect the loose gum area and to help the irritation/inflammation.</li>
            <li>At first taste, the Crest Pro-Health for old folks seems pretty good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Probably it kills germs more effectively than typical mouthwash brands or models.  </li>
            <li>This mouthwash is strong enough to do what it should - give better breath and help protect against gingivitis and plaque, but it has no alcohol.</li>
            <li>taste is peppermint and it is strong enough to affect your taste buds for a time afterwards - as most mouthwashes do.</li>
            <li>Initial minty taste is fine (glad I brush afterwards), but aftertaste lingers forever and is not pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>While this doesn&#x27;t stand out from the rest of the Crest pro health line, I do really like the Crest Pro Health for Life smooth mint flavor.</li>
            <li>There is no harsh alchohol taste, no nasty after taste.</li>
            <li>This Crest \\&quot;Pro-Health For Life\\&quot; mouthwash is OK tasting and does freshen up my breath, but I have not noticed any significant improvement in my gum health since starting to use it.</li>
            <li>Seeing as you&#x27;re supposed to use the product two times a day, you&#x27;re pretty much refreshing your temporary taste change regularly!</li>
            <li>wish Crest would better explain how this is different from the products geared toward people under fifty.  </li>
            <li>I wonder why it is targeted just for those over 50, since it would seem younger children would be better off using this mouthwash.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I need more than a third capful.</li>
            <li>- the wintergreen is a much better and more long lasting mouth rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does the job - strong, yet gentle enough.</li>
            <li>However, I do not think that using antibiotic agents on or in the body on a regular basis in the absence of an infection is a good practice because it interferes with normal, helpful bacteria and can cause health problems.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the biggest advantage over some other brands, but nothing will take the place of good general oral cleaning and maintenance.  </li>
            <li>so my dentist really wants me to use some sort of dental rinse.</li>
            <li>It does not have the bitter alcohol flavor that  many alcohol flavored mouth rinses have.</li>
            <li>Crest has a very extensive line of alcohol free mouthwashes; none of which give you that burning sensation that you are use to if you use Listerine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After 1 bottle I really don&#x27;t notice</li>
            <li>The trick though in my experience is to use it at night and don&#x27;t use too much.  </li>
            <li>The inflammation goes away much quicker.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and like I said, the inflammation, soreness and redness goes away much faster.&lt;br</li>
            <li>me, this product is very beneficial, while being gentle.</li>
            <li>Normally, I fill it up half way with warm water and the rest of the way with Listerine.</li>
            <li>I make sure to rinse with water after rinsing with it, and doing that ensures I don&#x27;t have too much of a lingering aftertaste (it still does linger a little bit, though).</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This version is alcohol free and is geared toward people 50 and older but has the same active ingredient as the Pro Health Invigorating Clean Invigorating Mint  alcohol based mouth rinse.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now really, given that we are adults-over-50, can&#x27;t we just have clear mouth wash.  </li>
            <li>really prefer a mouthwash that doesn&#x27;t put my tastebuds out of action for hours at a time.  </li>
            <li>I will stop using it and see if my taste returns to normal.  </li>
            <li>while I would recommend this mouthwash for people with gingivitis, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for everyday use for people with healthy teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>In my case, it definitely did help with gum problems and for that reason I will continue to use it regularly.just like the bottle says, that makes your mouth taste and feel fresh.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using it, your breath is definitely minty fresh...</li>
            <li>The gum line at two specific teeth was always more red than any other area, even though it was never actually painful or swollen.</li>
            <li>When he looked in my mouth in order to determine the adjustments for my braces during that visit, he mentioned to me that 2 particular areas look better than usual.</li>
            <li>The goldfish I ate a few hours after even tasted sweet and not at all salty!</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s not a bad product--I just don&#x27;t think it should be marketed specifically at a certain age range without a better explanation or different active ingredient than other Crest products.</li>
            <li>There are directions for 6 years old and up on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is not harsh at all, but still effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If that is the only reason it seems like other Crest Pro Health alcohol free products would work</li>
            <li>particular mouthwash has a pleasant enough minty flavor, but it is  weak even compared to the other Crest products in this line.</li>
            <li>Research has shown that it has a small beneficial effect in treat gingivitis and preventing plaque and it is generally regarded as safe when used for short periods of time.  </li>
            <li>This is likely a product that will take several months to show any real health improvement</li>
            <li>I am not sure what \\&quot;a unique sensation\\&quot; has to do with being over fifty.  </li>
            <li>At first, I was afraid I had some kind of illness, but now I am thinking the loss of taste is due to using this rinse.  </li>
            <li>This formula will not irritate dry mouths or sensitive teeth.</li>

            <li> This formula will not irritate dry mouths or sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> that Crest markets this to people over 50, when it has the exact same active ingredient (and percentage of it) as the other Crest mouthwashes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It is a subtle mint flavor, yet still leaves your mouth feeling fresh. \\&quot;Smooth\\</li>
            <li> Not the worse I&#x27;ve ever tasted, but not strong and refreshing enough for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am troubled that the only reason Crest lists for this being for people over 50 is it has no alcohol and has a unique sensation.</li>
            <li> Because that&#x27;s the only active ingredient: Cetylpyridinium Chloride.  </li>
            <li> No alcohol!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may think alcohol helps to kill germs, and maybe it does, but my medication causes me to have very dry mouth in the morning</li>
            <li> I wil report back in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> olf mother uses this and raves about it after years spent being a listerine user.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it nearly as much as other Crest Pro-Heath products</li>
            <li> Other reviews have noted a sort of &#x27;numbing&#x27; sensation, post-use, which is part of the ingredients and not a surprise.</li>
            <li> active ingredient is 0.07%  cetylpyridinium chloride, a quaternary ammonium cation antiseptic.  </li>
            <li> Oral microbiology in particular is complex and disturbing the natural balance of microorganisms could cause harmful species to proliferate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That said, the mouthwash seems to work fine, and the flavor isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> No particular advantages for older users, it has an unpleasant taste, and it just seems a like cheesey to market it as such.</li>
            <li> Yes, this product is less harsh feeling than other mouthwashes.</li>
            <li> I have used this for less than a week and my ability to taste has been dramatically altered.  </li>
            <li> , I have noticed a slight aftertaste even 10 minutes after rinsing.</li>
            <li> The worse thing is the bitter aftertaste lingering until I eat something so for quite a while obviously.</li>
            <li> I find it a little disingenuous</li>
            <li> I have tried a few of the Crest Pro Health products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of nasty, and it takes vigorous rinsing to get rid of it.</li>
            <li> old+ (I&#x27;m not sure what age has to do with mouthwashes) is mediocre.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I don&#x27;t mind the product, I&#x27;m not sure about the long-term numbingness and would probably not use this regularly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have breakfast about 20 minutes after rinsing with this and brushing and my food doesn&#x27;t taste right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> BUT there&#x27;s a weird chemical after-taste that lasts and lasts; which my husband and myself found to be unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For instance people of any age can have plaque, bad breath and inflamed gums.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent product. Highly recommend it. Use  it twice a day after brushing and a water-pic.</li>
            <li> At my sophisticated age, ;-) , this is the BEST oral rinse ever! Everything Crest says it does, it will do and it&#x27;s the only mouthwash I will use now.</li>
            <li> Yes, this product is less harsh feeling than other mouthwashes. No, I would not recommend it to anyone. I won&#x27;t even give away my unused portion to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;I only used this product 3 times. After each time I felt like my taste buds were affected. Crest states that CPC is the ingredient causing this temporary taste change, but it is also what causes 12+ hour protection. Seeing as you&#x27;re supposed to use the product two times a day, you&#x27;re pretty much refreshing your temporary taste change regularly! The goldfish I ate a few hours after even tasted sweet and not at all salty! Yuck!! I will not continue using this mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I have problems with my teeth so my dentist really wants me to use some sort of dental rinse. I have tried a few of the Crest Pro Health products. This version is alcohol free and is geared toward people 50 and older but has the same active ingredient as the Pro Health Invigorating Clean Invigorating Mint  alcohol based mouth rinse. It does not have fluoride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish Crest would better explain how this is different from the products geared toward people under fifty.  For instance people of any age can have plaque, bad breath and inflamed gums. I think most of the Crest mouth rinses work against these issues so what makes this special for people over 50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find this sentence on the back label of the bottle. \\&quot;This rinse was selected for people over 50 because it is alcohol-free and provides a unique sensation.\\&quot;  I am not sure what \\&quot;a unique sensation\\&quot; has to do with being over fifty.  If that is the only reason it seems like other Crest Pro Health alcohol free products would work the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the taste of this product. It does not have the bitter alcohol flavor that  many alcohol flavored mouth rinses have. I don&#x27;t notice a unique sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am troubled that the only reason Crest lists for this being for people over 50 is it has no alcohol and has a unique sensation. For this reason I gave this three stars.</li>
            <li> Crest has a very extensive line of alcohol free mouthwashes; none of which give you that burning sensation that you are use to if you use Listerine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular mouthwash has a pleasant enough minty flavor, but it is  weak even compared to the other Crest products in this line. The easiest way to describe it is watered-down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main problem I have with this mouthwash, however, is that it seems to leave a film of some kind on my teeth. It&#x27;s kind of nasty, and it takes vigorous rinsing to get rid of it.</li>
            <li> I got this and passed it along to my husband and mother, and neither of them can figure out why it&#x27;s marketing to the over 50 crowd. I&#x27;m not quite there (yet), but I tried it. I don&#x27;t like it nearly as much as other Crest Pro-Heath products - the wintergreen is a much better and more long lasting mouth rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both my husband and mother think the over 50 thing is a gimmick. Neither would buy it themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a fan of Crest Pro-Health products, but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t be buying this one. No particular advantages for older users, it has an unpleasant taste, and it just seems a like cheesey to market it as such.</li>
            <li> I have used this for less than a week and my ability to taste has been dramatically altered.  I didn&#x27;t even think about this causing such a thing until I looked back and remembered that I had started using it.  At first, I was afraid I had some kind of illness, but now I am thinking the loss of taste is due to using this rinse.  I will stop using it and see if my taste returns to normal.  I wil report back in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health Smooth Mint Mouth Rinse falls into the category of refreshing, alcohol-free mouth washes.  It has a pleasant minty flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The active ingredient is 0.07%  cetylpyridinium chloride, a quaternary ammonium cation antiseptic.  Research has shown that it has a small beneficial effect in treat gingivitis and preventing plaque and it is generally regarded as safe when used for short periods of time.  However, I do not think that using antibiotic agents on or in the body on a regular basis in the absence of an infection is a good practice because it interferes with normal, helpful bacteria and can cause health problems.  Oral microbiology in particular is complex and disturbing the natural balance of microorganisms could cause harmful species to proliferate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also prefer a stronger, more astringent mouthwash with fluoride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while I would recommend this mouthwash for people with gingivitis, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for everyday use for people with healthy teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> I do like this product.  No alcohol!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may think alcohol helps to kill germs, and maybe it does, but my medication causes me to have very dry mouth in the morning so I welcome an alcohol free product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the lack of alcohol, your mouth feels clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not so sure about the &#x27;over 50&#x27; thing.  After 1 bottle I really don&#x27;t notice a change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;MEF</li>
            <li> Pleasant taste and smooth texture, Not too overpowering at all and does wonders for any plaque you may have, I have noticed a slight aftertaste even 10 minutes after rinsing.</li>
            <li> My fav mouthwash is Listerine no alcohol. Crest one for 50 years old+ (I&#x27;m not sure what age has to do with mouthwashes) is mediocre. Not the worse I&#x27;ve ever tasted, but not strong and refreshing enough for me. The worse thing is the bitter aftertaste lingering until I eat something so for quite a while obviously. I wouldn&#x27;t buy.&lt;br /&gt;My Listerine is a bit more sweet and leaves nice fresh breath for way longer.</li>
            <li> Great product, delivered as promised. Amazon and it&#x27;s partners always deliver.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash is strong enough to do what it should - give better breath and help protect against gingivitis and plaque, but it has no alcohol. I wonder why it is targeted just for those over 50, since it would seem younger children would be better off using this mouthwash. There are directions for 6 years old and up on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is peppermint and it is strong enough to affect your taste buds for a time afterwards - as most mouthwashes do. This does not leave the burning feeling that many leave in your mouth. It does the job - strong, yet gentle enough.</li>
            <li> Crest has probably the best mouthwash out there as its not alcohol based so the effects are longer lasting.  That&#x27;s the biggest advantage over some other brands, but nothing will take the place of good general oral cleaning and maintenance.  My 76 year olf mother uses this and raves about it after years spent being a listerine user.</li>
            <li> I felt like all germs got destroyed when I used this mouthwash.  The only time I like to use it is at night because otherwise I literally cannot taste food but instead keep tasting this mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably it kills germs more effectively than typical mouthwash brands or models.  The trick though in my experience is to use it at night and don&#x27;t use too much.  I don&#x27;t think I need more than a third capful.</li>
            <li> I have used Plax (ok), Listerine (mediciney aftertaste), and mouthwash like Scope (sweet) and thought I would give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Initial minty taste is fine (glad I brush afterwards), but aftertaste lingers forever and is not pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;- Unfortunately, I have breakfast about 20 minutes after rinsing with this and brushing and my food doesn&#x27;t taste right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- No burning sensation (no alcohol) and obviously contains ingredients that are good for oral hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not something I&#x27;d likely use again.</li>
            <li> This is probably the \\&quot;smoothest\\&quot; tasting mouthwash I have ever used. It is a subtle mint flavor, yet still leaves your mouth feeling fresh. \\&quot;Smooth\\&quot; fits the flavor/strength perfectly. It is not harsh at all, but still effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mouthwash claims to help with inflammation and soreness of the gums. I&#x27;d say this claim is true. I wear braces and do get inflamed/sore gums from time to time. Crest Pro-Health For Life has helped with that. It actually soothes the gums. The inflammation goes away much quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this in my WaterPik with great results as well. Normally, I fill it up half way with warm water and the rest of the way with Listerine. My orthodontist recommended this on account of the gaps I get from my braces, to clean good and disinfect the loose gum area and to help the irritation/inflammation. I feel like this Pro-Health does a better job in that area - it feels like it is soothing the sore spots and like I said, the inflammation, soreness and redness goes away much faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did ask my orthodontist about using this mouthwash, if it would be beneficial to me in regards to the gum issues, since this product is meant for people over 50 years of age - I am only 36. He said it definitely could not hurt to try and would probably work well since it is made for gum issues. He told me to let him know how it goes. When I told him I believed it worked better and helped more, he told me to continue to use it. When he looked in my mouth in order to determine the adjustments for my braces during that visit, he mentioned to me that 2 particular areas look better than usual. The gum line at two specific teeth was always more red than any other area, even though it was never actually painful or swollen. Since I started using the Pro-Health, that redness has gone away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, this product is very beneficial, while being gentle. There is no harsh alchohol taste, no nasty after taste. It is just simply a smooth mint flavor, just like the bottle says, that makes your mouth taste and feel fresh. In my case, it definitely did help with gum problems and for that reason I will continue to use it regularly.just like the bottle says, that makes your mouth taste and feel fresh.

            <li> This Crest \\&quot;Pro-Health For Life\\&quot; mouthwash is OK tasting and does freshen up my breath, but I have not noticed any significant improvement in my gum health since starting to use it. This is likely a product that will take several months to show any real health improvement but I find that it does effect my sense of taste, so will not use it anymore when this bottle is empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH</li>
            <li> While this doesn&#x27;t stand out from the rest of the Crest pro health line, I do really like the Crest Pro Health for Life smooth mint flavor. The flavor is great. It is very mild but still feels nice and fresh. There is no burning. This formula will not irritate dry mouths or sensitive teeth. I have problems with both and am happy to have a refreshing feeling rinse that does not cause me problems.</li>
            <li> At first taste, the Crest Pro-Health for old folks seems pretty good.  There&#x27;s no alcohol and consequently there is none of the tingly sensation some of us are accustomed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it, your breath is definitely minty fresh... BUT there&#x27;s a weird chemical after-taste that lasts and lasts; which my husband and myself found to be unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the non-pro-health side, it&#x27;s a chemical concoction.  It contains \\&quot;propylparaben\\&quot; which is know to mimic estrogen.  It also contains Red 33, which can be found in Cutex Nail Polish remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now really, given that we are adults-over-50, can&#x27;t we just have clear mouth wash.  Or whatever color the Cetylpyridinium Chloride gives the liquid.  Because that&#x27;s the only active ingredient: Cetylpyridinium Chloride.  (also used in some pesticides because it fights fungus.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t recommend.&lt;br /&gt;I really prefer a mouthwash that doesn&#x27;t put my tastebuds out of action for hours at a time.  Also, my dentist insists that I use something with Floride to protect my tooth enamel, which this product doesn&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li> I find it a little disingenuous that Crest markets this to people over 50, when it has the exact same active ingredient (and percentage of it) as the other Crest mouthwashes I&#x27;ve used. As someone who is under age 50, I figured I&#x27;d give this a try to see if I notice any differences, and I did not. I think the \\&quot;50 and over\\&quot; thing is nothing more than a gimmick on Crest&#x27;s part. That said, the mouthwash seems to work fine, and the flavor isn&#x27;t bad. I make sure to rinse with water after rinsing with it, and doing that ensures I don&#x27;t have too much of a lingering aftertaste (it still does linger a little bit, though). Overall, it&#x27;s not a bad product--I just don&#x27;t think it should be marketed specifically at a certain age range without a better explanation or different active ingredient than other Crest products.</li>
            <li> Other reviews have noted a sort of &#x27;numbing&#x27; sensation, post-use, which is part of the ingredients and not a surprise. I noticed it - it&#x27;s not bad, but it&#x27;s there and I can&#x27;t say I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the flavor, though. It&#x27;s smooth and minty (as advertised), and doesn&#x27;t have the alcohol burn (it does not contain alcohol).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my 40s, so not quite the age group for the product, but close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I don&#x27;t mind the product, I&#x27;m not sure about the long-term numbingness and would probably not use this regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I did, I would use this at night, but not in the morning before eating. The numbness definitely affects taste for a while after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I use all sorts of Crest products, and will continue to do so, even if it&#x27;s not this one.</li>
