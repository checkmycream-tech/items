            <li>Happy with this product!</li>
            <li>Great toothbrushes for my boys.</li>
            <li>Great, well made toothbrush.</li>
            <li>great product.</li>
            <li>Great idea and great product.</li>
            <li>The bamboo feels good in the hand.</li>
            <li>Good for my health and the environment, it is a win-win.</li>
            <li>Feels great and looks even better.  </li>
            <li>Love these for my grandchildren!</li>
            <li>and I love that it&#x27;s bamboo (not plastic)!</li>
            <li>Toothbrush are nice, but plastic packaging is not ecofriendly...</li>
            <li>Great eco friendly toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I love the handle.</li>
            <li>We Love this brand just need to get more of them.  </li>
            <li>Top quality toothbrush.</li>
            <li>now the kids love them as well....  </li>
            <li>so they are not the best brushers, but I couldn&#x27;t get these toothbrushes to last more than a week for either of them</li>
            <li>I really love this brush.</li>
            <li>and they feel and look better too.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>Most excellent. ... been using them for a few years.....</li>
            <li>However, the size and fit is perfect for my &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; little kids (ages 7 and 9).  </li>
            <li>Work great, last 3 months +</li>
            <li>My great-grand father from my mother side would rinse his mouth with freshly made milk from the farm cow and his teeth are always strong and perfect.</li>
            <li>The great thing is these are biodegradable and will return back to the Earth without incident.</li>
            <li>The company also doesn&#x27;t test on animals which is important for me.</li>
            <li>I love knowing that my kids are using more natural materials in their mouths.</li>
            <li>Two for $7, not bad.</li>
            <li>I wanted a less plastic options, and while the bamboo was great, the bristles started falling out after one or two uses.</li>
            <li>It feels so comfortable in hand - and the bristles are perfect for our baby&#x27;s first toothbrush - not too stiff and not too soft.</li>
            <li>These are great little brushes.  </li>
            <li>Going for a more natural approach I wanted to try to see if it is the tooth brush that was causing the teeth damages.</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of bristles.</li>
            <li>My preschool daughter likes them and they&#x27;re just the right size.</li>
            <li>Might isn&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li>perfect size for my small mouth and soft bristles don&#x27;t hurt my gums</li>
            <li>Very gentle on the teeth and reaches those pockets of holes I have.</li>
            <li>sure enough there was a chemically taste to the bristles, hopefully that dissipates soon, otherwise would have given 5 stars.</li>
            <li>The brush head hasn&#x27;t shown wear and I&#x27;m ready to replace for our monthly rotation!</li>
            <li>Supporting companies like this one tells other companies &amp;#34;Hey we need to change and be better.&amp;#34; It will also be better for your teeth.</li>
            <li>A rinse of hot water is sufficient enough to clean these out thoroughly.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping these toothbrushes would work out for my kids.</li>
            <li>My siblings don&#x27;t look after their teeth as well as I do, yet I have teeth which are constantly always being filled in, drilled and altered, while theirs have no issue at all.</li>
            <li>Nice but one cracked after a few weeks</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love these, but the bristles are just too firm.</li>
            <li>Plus they are pretty much the same price and have held up so far for our 2 year old!</li>
            <li>We had to dig them out of my 2 year old mouth.</li>
            <li>My almost 2 yr old and 4 yr old get help from me to brush</li>
            <li>I noticed my teeth aren&#x27;t as sensitive as it use to be</li>
            <li>These are the perfect size for a little guys mouth and they are bamboo much better than the plastic crap that is infiltrating the bellies of marine life and leaching chemicals into our waters!</li>
            <li>The toothbrushes are already breaking down within the first week.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy handles and narrow head makes brushing teeth in small mouths easy.</li>
            <li>Recently though I&#x27;m trying a different route and going natural to see if it&#x27;ll work.</li>

            <li> my son likes it!  Happy with this product!</li>
            <li> Love these for my grandchildren! They like them too.</li>
            <li> I love the handle. It feels so comfortable in hand - and the bristles are perfect for our baby&#x27;s first toothbrush - not too stiff and not too soft.</li>
            <li> Loves these as an alternative to the plastic ones you buy with the characters on them. Plus they are pretty much the same price and have held up so far for our 2 year old!</li>
            <li> Purchased for our daughter and she loves them.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrushes for my boys. Will order again.</li>
            <li> We Love this brand just need to get more of them.  Has no odd taste like some other Bamboo products.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Top quality toothbrush. Feels great and looks even better.  The fact that you&#x27;re not adding to our plastic problem is an added bonus</li>
            <li> Great, well made toothbrush. Lasts longer than the standard kids toothbrushes and I love that it&#x27;s bamboo (not plastic)!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love these, but the bristles are just too firm.</li>
            <li> Most excellent. ... been using them for a few years..... now the kids love them as well....  great product.</li>
            <li> Kids love the size and colors, they complained about a weird taste so I tried it out and sure enough there was a chemically taste to the bristles, hopefully that dissipates soon, otherwise would have given 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Nice but one cracked after a few weeks</li>
            <li> Kids are not fond of the &amp;#34;odor&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;taste&#x27; of the toothbrush.  However, the size and fit is perfect for my &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; little kids (ages 7 and 9).  The brush head hasn&#x27;t shown wear and I&#x27;m ready to replace for our monthly rotation! Not sure if we&#x27;ll get these again as the children really were not a fan of the taste/odor. I&#x27;m not sure if they would ever get used to it.</li>
            <li> perfect size for my small mouth and soft bristles don&#x27;t hurt my gums</li>
            <li> Toothbrush are nice, but plastic packaging is not ecofriendly...</li>
            <li> Very sturdy handles and narrow head makes brushing teeth in small mouths easy.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping these toothbrushes would work out for my kids. I wanted a less plastic options, and while the bamboo was great, the bristles started falling out after one or two uses. My children are 4 and 2 so they are not the best brushers, but I couldn&#x27;t get these toothbrushes to last more than a week for either of them so it didn&#x27;t seem like a defect, just not a goo product.</li>
            <li> These are the perfect size for a little guys mouth and they are bamboo much better than the plastic crap that is infiltrating the bellies of marine life and leaching chemicals into our waters!</li>
            <li> Terrible. Within a week of use both toothbrushes (we bought a 2 pack) lost their bristles. We had to dig them out of my 2 year old mouth.</li>
            <li> Great idea and great product. Just the right amount of bristles. The bamboo feels good in the hand.</li>
            <li> Great eco friendly toothbrushes. Work great, last 3 months +</li>
            <li> Not as sturdy as I wanted. My almost 2 yr old and 4 yr old get help from me to brush but the bristles got all smooshed after a week. My 4 yr was left alone brushing and he bit the head and cracked it. The bristles started falling out and I had to throw it away. I was sent a 10% off coupon for my next order so I will probably try this brad for myself and see how they hold up.</li>
            <li> i have 4 kids &amp; I bought 2 packages. The toothbrushes are already breaking down within the first week. Not a good purchase. Will not order again.</li>
            <li> These are great little brushes.  My preschool daughter likes them and they&#x27;re just the right size.</li>
            <li> I love knowing that my kids are using more natural materials in their mouths. I didn&#x27;t find these to be any less in quality than other brushes. My toddler doesn&#x27;t seem bothered like with other brushes. So far so good!</li>
            <li> I really love this brush. Very gentle on the teeth and reaches those pockets of holes I have. I will always have bad teeth, it is a genetic flaw I have. My siblings don&#x27;t look after their teeth as well as I do, yet I have teeth which are constantly always being filled in, drilled and altered, while theirs have no issue at all. Recently though I&#x27;m trying a different route and going natural to see if it&#x27;ll work. My great-grand father from my mother side would rinse his mouth with freshly made milk from the farm cow and his teeth are always strong and perfect. He would also use water and salt. Going for a more natural approach I wanted to try to see if it is the tooth brush that was causing the teeth damages. I saw these and saw how inexpensive they were for what they were. Two for $7, not bad. The great thing is these are biodegradable and will return back to the Earth without incident. Good for my health and the environment, it is a win-win. The company also doesn&#x27;t test on animals which is important for me. I believe unnecessary testing is an excuse for humans to feel powerful, when in fact it only demonstrate how weak they truly are. Might isn&#x27;t right. Also the same people who harm other species are also inclined to harm the weakest members of our society. That is why I support companies that don&#x27;t harm the weakest members of our planet, other species and ecosystem. Supporting companies like this one tells other companies &amp;#34;Hey we need to change and be better.&amp;#34; It will also be better for your teeth. I noticed my teeth aren&#x27;t as sensitive as it use to be and they feel and look better too. A rinse of hot water is sufficient enough to clean these out thoroughly. The packaging is recyclable so that is a plus too.</li>
