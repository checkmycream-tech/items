            <li>also works great  so happy with this order</li>
            <li>This razor makes my husband happy.  </li>
            <li>and I was really happy with the replacement.</li>
            <li>so Amazon is a great way to save some cash.</li>
            <li>It is a joy when things are designed well, perform their task reliably, and in this case can have replacement parts that restore the like-new functionality.  </li>
            <li>I think it works great.</li>
            <li>Great job Braun.</li>
            <li>Great replacement.</li>
            <li>Works great and You can use it for two years or longer.</li>
            <li>I have been using Braun electric razors for more than 45 years and this 9000 Series Foil is the best and smoothest they have ever made.</li>
            <li>Metal thickness not as good as OEM.</li>
            <li>Fit and works perfectly</li>
            <li>PRODUCT IS GOOD, PRICE IS GOOD,</li>
            <li>SERVICE AND SHIPPING IS GOOD.</li>
            <li>good item for the money works</li>
            <li>I get a good shave</li>
            <li>Once every 6 months is good.  </li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>He did think it did a good job when working.</li>
            <li>It was great for about a month, but I soon found it was not doing an effective job</li>
            <li>It was delivered on time and in good condition, thank you.</li>
            <li>Good merchant to buy from.</li>
            <li>The replacement foil and cutter installed perfectly, worked great and reminded my why I liked the razor in the first place.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still an amazing product</li>
            <li>Replacing this 9000 series head every 18 months, per Braun&#x27;s recommendation, is not cost effective for the user.</li>
            <li>After 3+ weeks - I can honestly say that it shaves better/closer.  </li>
            <li>One great thing is that when traveling you can clean these with water.</li>
            <li>No problems, but a better price than most stores!</li>
            <li>Shipping time was good with free option.</li>
            <li>Found it on this site at a good price and with free shipping.</li>
            <li>This foil with cutter blades was an exact replacement for my 9000 series Braun Pulsonic shaver, which provides the best quality shave from an electric shaver that I have experienced so far.</li>
            <li>series 7 is a pefect match to the Braun Plusonic shaver but still not as good as the original.</li>
            <li>But what good is a clean razor if it doesn&#x27;t do the job?</li>
            <li>I now get a very good shave with this new replacement head.</li>
            <li>While I also use a blade in the mornings sometime this is a great 2nd shave in the day or an excellent first.  </li>
            <li>I know these products are great (though very high priced)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>I will say the shaver head seems to pull you hair more than the stock one on the pulstronic.  </li>
            <li>For some reason is very noisy but otherwise works great.</li>
            <li>i needed a replacement and this was the best deal on the net.  </li>
            <li>I was thoroughly pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Once I got it in a shape which looked ok</li>
            <li>Most years thereafter Braun has improved its high-end shaver.</li>
            <li>Fast Service, Great Purchase.</li>
            <li>Been a Pulsonic shaver now some 4 years and am thoroughly satisfied.</li>
            <li>The price was great and the seller shipped it FAST.</li>
            <li>overall it does the job i need it to and fits in my Braun perfectly.  </li>
            <li>It enables an OK workday shave.</li>
            <li>Totally pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>Fits perfect and brought the performance back to \\&quot;day 1\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It cuts great and it seems like my razor is brand new again.  </li>
            <li>Easy transaction, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>This is the second replacement foil that I bought for my Braun 9595 Pulsonic and both times it was the correct one and fit and works perfectly.</li>
            <li>The foils really provide a great, smooth shave.</li>
            <li>He used his new razor for the first time this morning and said it was the best he&#x27;s had.</li>
            <li>I ordered this replacement blade and my razor is like new with a great and smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I found the Perfect replacement for my old shaver&#x27;s foil and it was very convenient to order on line and have it delivered at a competitive</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is still going strong after almost 2 1/2 years...</li>
            <li>Now I have a Pulsonic shaver with two heads that I don&#x27;t really find very satisfying.</li>
            <li>I returned to using the original, which was much more comfortable in spite of the time in use.  </li>
            <li>The Braun 9595 is hands down the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used and</li>
            <li>Of course he has not used the replacement head yet but he loved his gift and loves his new razor.  </li>
            <li>, this is just like the original foil and the razor is as good as new.</li>
            <li>The replacement foils are the cheap ones made in the Chec Republic.</li>
            <li>The replacement was thankfully available through Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>They are all 7S series that fit the 9000.  </li>
            <li>search for Series 7 head and buy it because nothing else is available for our shavers.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I hesitated getting this replacement foil since I read reviews saying that it wasn&#x27;t as good as the old foil.  </li>
            <li>The original lasted 18 months and still cuts fine.  </li>
            <li>but we NEED TO KNOW if the blades need replacing every 6 mos to get the same quick &amp; perfect shave we start with when new !!</li>
            <li>and you will get back the smooth easy shave that you paid good money for when you bought a Braun.</li>
            <li>go over &amp; over the same area&#x27; to get the perfect shave when the blades were new.</li>
            <li>Problem is I cannot find that original shaver head anywhere.  </li>
            <li>Also I couldn&#x27;t find the original one.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I have purchased 3 of these since I bought my original Razor.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used mine yet as I&#x27;m on the original one that came with the razor.</li>
            <li>I purchased this replacement head after 18 months of shaving with the original.</li>
            <li>not like the original, but it works.  </li>
            <li>I had wanted to replace the foil on my razor for months, but kept on reading about how the replacements were nothing like the original foils sold with the Braun electronic razors.  </li>
            <li>The supplied newer version of the cutter seems to work as well as the original.  </li>
            <li>I do not see a significant difference.  </li>
            <li>These are original replacements.</li>
            <li>My original Braun head wore out after 7 years.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product after reading the reviews and deciding to get the original pulsonic 9000 replacement not the newer/cheaper series 7 model.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s original god forsaken blister packaging.  </li>
            <li>I used the replacement on my pulsonic razor and it works as well as when it was new nice close shave for an electric razor..</li>
            <li>One can flush the shaver clean with tap water when traveling or away from the cleaning/charging unit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my 3rd Braun, and is by far the best yet.</li>
            <li>Much greener and much more comfortable than razors.</li>
            <li>Clean shaves and close to the skin.</li>
            <li>but it is definitely just as good.</li>
            <li>The prices on the Braun accessories are about as good as I could find on the &#x27;net.   </li>
            <li>Convenient service---shipped right to the home for free.</li>
            <li>Razor shaves better and seeems like new!  </li>
            <li>The head is an exact fit for my Braun pulsonic 7 series shaver.  </li>
            <li>Overall very pleased with product. . . . . .</li>
            <li>I used to own the older style Braun Foil shaver similar to the 360 series that is reviewed in Consumer Reports and is top rated.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s what was on my original braun pulsor razor that I bought when it first came out.</li>
            <li>Smooth comfortable shave with new foil.    </li>
            <li>Overall, these have been very good foils, giving me the closest shave over formerly owned shavers.</li>
            <li>It was well worth it</li>
            <li>so I could replace them more frequently, maybe we should all grow beards.</li>
            <li>Probably better if the seller would make that clear or change the picture on the website.  </li>
            <li>The simple fact is the original Pulsonic head was too good and lasted far longer than any head I have tried</li>
            <li>When I first opened this replacement I saw that the finish of the middle row of the blade was no longer the blue anodized finish and the outer finish went away from the brilliant chrome finish to a matte silver painted finish.</li>
            <li>right.  </li>
            <li>The replacement foil and cutter cartridge was easy to install and it made the razor perform like new.</li>
            <li>Its amazing that it lasted so long.</li>
            <li>It is a genuine Braun replacement foil and cutterblock and the razor now shaves like new.  </li>
            <li>This is the genuine article to restore like new performance to your Braaun Pulsonic.  </li>
            <li>For some reason my original razor had a rigid blade system but this one nicely moves up and down with the contours of my face and cuts pretty well for electric.</li>
            <li>Easy to install in place of 18 month old shaver 9000 Foil and Cutterblock.  </li>
            <li>Obviously, everyone hasn&#x27;t had the same experience, but here&#x27;s hoping that you get a great shave</li>
            <li>Very straight forward.</li>
            <li>You get the better quality foil with a new razor but your only choice for a replacement foil is the cheap ones.</li>
            <li>quality it had when the original head was new.</li>
            <li>Not great but very good.</li>
            <li>Got exactly what I needed, will visit again.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I ordered</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve replaced the foil (2yrs+).  </li>
            <li>- this looks exactly like the stock shaver head on my 9595 when I bought it.</li>
            <li>it was the first time you used it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Braun electric shavers since my first purchase in Vienna in 1988.</li>
            <li>This is not possible now.&lt;br /&gt;Overall better.</li>
            <li>, the replacement shaver head made it better, but still not enough for me.  </li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for..</li>
            <li>at first i would have to argue that this is not an OEM replacement.  </li>
            <li>The product description was sufficient for me to get the correct part on the first attempt...which isn&#x27;t always the case.</li>
            <li>I was charged the higher price and then sent the series 7 model.  </li>
            <li>A THREE STAR IS THAT LONGEVITY IS NOT THAT GOOD, SPECIFICALLY IF YOU HAVE A HEAVY BEARD.</li>
            <li>I really wanted the older type screen/blade because it is a better design and shaves better, but I got the &#x27;other&#x27; instead.  </li>
            <li>I would say it was better than my old foil was brand new</li>
            <li>I replaced my old original braun head that came with the shaver with this.</li>
            <li>The Braun shaver series in my opinion is far superior than any other shaver on the market.</li>
            <li>Amazon.com makes it easy to replace parts of the razor that needs changing regularly.  </li>
            <li>Then they claimed it was Amazon&#x27;s fault for not updating the picture, even though the description clearly states there is a newer version available and links to the new version.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much to say about this.  </li>
            <li>The seller was fast with processing an order and delivered by the promised date.</li>
            <li>Thanks braun.</li>
            <li>I have been shaving whole head since &#x27;98.</li>
            <li>Very fare price through Amazon.</li>
            <li>The shaver head was shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Still as close a shave, just lots more repetition to get the same complete coverage.    </li>
            <li>Received very quickly very easy transaction and price less than what the stores were selling a replacements for.</li>
            <li>They sent me a different look head than what was pictured and what my Pulsonic originally had</li>
            <li>I bit on two different ones, and when I returned them with pictures of the original  pictured foil vs. what I recieved, the vendors were resistent and denied it was a bait and switch.  </li>
            <li>this is not the original Pulsonic blue stripe head.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased with my first replacement I came back to the same place for another one.  </li>
            <li>Functions basically same as original though painted plastic instead of metal.  </li>
            <li>The older style foil head gives a faster, closer shave and is much preferred by me.</li>
            <li>; foil is the foil that Braun currently manufactures for the old Pulsonic shavers (e.g. the 595), i.e. it will fit and work -- I personally just find that the old foil worked better.</li>
            <li>I clean the blades every 6-10 shaves in the solution (9000 series) but by the 4th month the shaves went from AMAZING to noticibly less... by 6 months I&#x27;m replacing them because I&#x27;m back to the old &#x27;</li>
            <li>I had the Series 7 in my shaver for three week now and it works good for now but in a few more week it will dull up</li>
            <li>I ordered the replacement foil for my Braun Pulsonic electric razor and received the new one within  a week!  </li>
            <li>Try the older style 360 series.</li>
            <li>I can confirm KANE&#x27;s finding: you most likely won&#x27;t get the item pictured (the &amp;#34;orginal Pulsonic&amp;#34; foil), but the current Braun drop-in replacement (the &amp;#34;Series 7&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>written in it, the comb cutter isn&#x27;t blue, and the pattern is a more standard</li>
            <li>I read the reviews about receiving the newer model instead of the older one pictured</li>
            <li>The older screen had a sort of &#x27;honeycomb&#x27; pattern in it which the newer &#x27;replacement&#x27; blades don&#x27;t have...</li>
            <li>Also, I guess the older one was referred to as Pulsonic, whereas the newer one is not.</li>
            <li>Also use the Braun Fluid, I think it really helps keep everything working right and seems to keep the blades sharper.</li>
            <li>Price is too high.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to say that it works as well as the previous foil when new.  </li>
            <li>am writing this review because no real info is available to us about it.</li>
            <li>It did take a full 2 weeks off everyday use to break my skin into using this product but was worth it.</li>
            <li>Normally the blades on an electric are used up in 6 months on my razors.</li>
            <li>well worth it since they last a lot longer.</li>
            <li>This is just a replacement head, part of normal maintenance required.</li>
            <li>This replacement foil does what they say it will do and it works well and cuts as well as the new one did.</li>
            <li>Cuts like it&#x27;s brand new again.</li>
            <li>Makes shaver shave like new.</li>
            <li>but I found out that it utilizes some new tech from Braun</li>
            <li>The razor is like new after replacement.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time as discribed, new in manufacture packaging.</li>
            <li>this is the new 9000 series</li>
            <li>If you surf for &amp;#34;Braun 9095&amp;#34; you can pick up the newest model with, obvilously, a new foil, for ~ 350 to 800.</li>
            <li>Replaced the foil on my razor and it&#x27;s like brand new.  </li>
            <li>Made my shaver just like new again.</li>
            <li>This is a brand new product, in</li>
            <li>Seems to work fine for shaving though it is less than a month.</li>
            <li>I got moved into this product through the slick advertising by Braun that appeals to techies like me, thinking that anything that vibrates at supersonic speed must be better.</li>
            <li>When you first change on the foil and cutterblock it doesn&#x27;t really shave close at all and takes a few days to re-adjust itself before you get a close shave again, but ultimately it does return to the original quality of shave.</li>
            <li>This is definitely not the same cutter as the original that came with the shaver.</li>
            <li>The new block and foil provided a noticeably less comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>Braun products are always top of the line and work well and last far longer than heads supplied by other manufacturers.</li>
            <li>It has made my old shaver new again.</li>
            <li>The replacement was certainly an improvement and he&#x27;ll know next time it pulls to check it.</li>
            <li>The 9000 series are advertised as a significant improvement over previous models.</li>
            <li>and I recommend you do this if yours is 12-18 months old.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cut any closer than the old one.  </li>
            <li>The only issue is that after a month of use or so, it doesn&#x27;t get as close a shave as using a real razor.</li>
            <li>I am a 6-year frequently returning customer of Amazon, but regrettably, I feel like Amazon or whoever else sold this product to me has robbed $30 of my money.</li>
            <li>Because of my frustration with the razor, I decided to replace the foil, etc., way early to see if that made a difference.</li>
            <li>Since my foil was three years old, I had to get this replacement.  </li>
            <li>like I have so far.</li>
            <li>But, after a couple of months of the old foil pinching and pulling, i read some of the reviews on here, and gave in and bought this one.  </li>
            <li>I still get a faster, closer shave from my old 2000 series Braun shaver.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d specifically ordered (and paid more for - only a few dollars</li>
            <li>The first replacement, if not better than the original, could not be told apart - shiny high quality material, durable and long lasting.</li>
            <li>I had my razor for quite sometime, maybe over 2 years and the blades needed to be changed as it was getting pretty rough on my face.</li>
            <li>Hi, I ordered this particular item from a third party seller (Senneca River) because I wanted the replacement head with the \\&quot;blue\\&quot; strip and as shoppers of this item probably know the newer version of this does not have that and apparently has some issues.  </li>
            <li>I recently purchased this new shaver head through Amazon.</li>
            <li>Replace the foil in your Braun shaver to get back like new shaving performance.  </li>
            <li>It brought my shave back to new condition and it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair like everyone else</li>
            <li>New foil and cutters make a big differece.</li>
            <li>Also the side trimmer is not user friendly as in past models.  </li>
            <li>I was shocked to find that the fit of the be replacement was no where as precise as it use to be but something I could live with.</li>
            <li>The way they are designed, they will break beyond repair if bent or crushed as they certainly will be in an envelope.</li>
            <li>I live abroad, it&#x27;s now pointless trying to send it back, wait for it to be delivered to the seller and then have another foil sent back, with the strong possibility that it&#x27;ll be the same foil anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but they don&#x27;t plan on changing anything in the near future.</li>
            <li>Beware its not the &amp;#34;blue Bar&amp;#34; blades (the zig zag bar through the middle is blue on a new razor) that comes with the razor.</li>
            <li>Works great, cuts my whiskers, wish these were less expensive</li>
            <li>Compared to other sources the price is very competitive.</li>
            <li>Important to change at least annually (possibly sooner).  </li>
            <li>After having an earlier model Braun shaver that I loved, the Series 7 (790cc) shaver was a big disappointment from a features &amp; ergonomic perspective.  </li>
            <li>These simply do not last or stay sharp anywhere near as long as the older Braun foils.  </li>
            <li>The foil does not have the same openings, and patterns, and the part in general does not have the same shine or feel.</li>
            <li>I have a tough beard, and while disposable razors (or disposable razor heads) work fine, I don&#x27;t like the hassle and the once-in-a-while nick.    </li>
            <li>After 18 months of daily use the previous blade still worked but cut much slower.</li>
            <li>If you sometimes wait a few days before shaving, the foil wears out more quickly when cutting a longer beard.</li>

            <li> also works great  so happy with this order</li>
            <li> This razor makes my husband happy.  </li>
            <li> and I was really happy with the replacement.</li>
            <li> so Amazon is a great way to save some cash.</li>
            <li> It is a joy when things are designed well, perform their task reliably, and in this case can have replacement parts that restore the like-new functionality.  </li>
            <li> I think it works great.</li>
            <li> Great job Braun.</li>
            <li> Great replacement.</li>
            <li> Works great and You can use it for two years or longer.</li>
            <li> I have been using Braun electric razors for more than 45 years and this 9000 Series Foil is the best and smoothest they have ever made.</li>
            <li> Metal thickness not as good as OEM.</li>
            <li> Fit and works perfectly</li>
            <li> PRODUCT IS GOOD, PRICE IS GOOD,</li>
            <li> SERVICE AND SHIPPING IS GOOD.</li>
            <li> good item for the money works</li>
            <li> I get a good shave</li>
            <li> Once every 6 months is good.  </li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> He did think it did a good job when working.</li>
            <li> It was great for about a month, but I soon found it was not doing an effective job</li>
            <li> It was delivered on time and in good condition, thank you.</li>
            <li> Good merchant to buy from.</li>
            <li> The replacement foil and cutter installed perfectly, worked great and reminded my why I liked the razor in the first place.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still an amazing product</li>
            <li> Replacing this 9000 series head every 18 months, per Braun&#x27;s recommendation, is not cost effective for the user.</li>
            <li> After 3+ weeks - I can honestly say that it shaves better/closer.  </li>
            <li> One great thing is that when traveling you can clean these with water.</li>
            <li> No problems, but a better price than most stores!</li>
            <li> Shipping time was good with free option.</li>
            <li> Found it on this site at a good price and with free shipping.</li>
            <li> This foil with cutter blades was an exact replacement for my 9000 series Braun Pulsonic shaver, which provides the best quality shave from an electric shaver that I have experienced so far.</li>
            <li> series 7 is a pefect match to the Braun Plusonic shaver but still not as good as the original.</li>
            <li> But what good is a clean razor if it doesn&#x27;t do the job?</li>
            <li> I now get a very good shave with this new replacement head.</li>
            <li> While I also use a blade in the mornings sometime this is a great 2nd shave in the day or an excellent first.  </li>
            <li> I know these products are great (though very high priced)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> I will say the shaver head seems to pull you hair more than the stock one on the pulstronic.  </li>
            <li> For some reason is very noisy but otherwise works great.</li>
            <li> i needed a replacement and this was the best deal on the net.  </li>
            <li> I was thoroughly pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Once I got it in a shape which looked ok</li>
            <li> Most years thereafter Braun has improved its high-end shaver.</li>
            <li> Fast Service, Great Purchase.</li>
            <li> Been a Pulsonic shaver now some 4 years and am thoroughly satisfied.</li>
            <li> The price was great and the seller shipped it FAST.</li>
            <li> overall it does the job i need it to and fits in my Braun perfectly.  </li>
            <li> It enables an OK workday shave.</li>
            <li> Totally pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Fits perfect and brought the performance back to \\&quot;day 1\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It cuts great and it seems like my razor is brand new again.  </li>
            <li> Easy transaction, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is the second replacement foil that I bought for my Braun 9595 Pulsonic and both times it was the correct one and fit and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> The foils really provide a great, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> He used his new razor for the first time this morning and said it was the best he&#x27;s had.</li>
            <li> I ordered this replacement blade and my razor is like new with a great and smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I found the Perfect replacement for my old shaver&#x27;s foil and it was very convenient to order on line and have it delivered at a competitive</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is still going strong after almost 2 1/2 years...</li>
            <li> Now I have a Pulsonic shaver with two heads that I don&#x27;t really find very satisfying.</li>
            <li> I returned to using the original, which was much more comfortable in spite of the time in use.  </li>
            <li> The Braun 9595 is hands down the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used and</li>
            <li> Of course he has not used the replacement head yet but he loved his gift and loves his new razor.  </li>
            <li> , this is just like the original foil and the razor is as good as new.</li>
            <li> The replacement foils are the cheap ones made in the Chec Republic.</li>
            <li> The replacement was thankfully available through Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> They are all 7S series that fit the 9000.  </li>
            <li> search for Series 7 head and buy it because nothing else is available for our shavers.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I hesitated getting this replacement foil since I read reviews saying that it wasn&#x27;t as good as the old foil.  </li>
            <li> The original lasted 18 months and still cuts fine.  </li>
            <li> but we NEED TO KNOW if the blades need replacing every 6 mos to get the same quick &amp; perfect shave we start with when new !!</li>
            <li> and you will get back the smooth easy shave that you paid good money for when you bought a Braun.</li>
            <li> go over &amp; over the same area&#x27; to get the perfect shave when the blades were new.</li>
            <li> Problem is I cannot find that original shaver head anywhere.  </li>
            <li> Also I couldn&#x27;t find the original one.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I have purchased 3 of these since I bought my original Razor.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used mine yet as I&#x27;m on the original one that came with the razor.</li>
            <li> I purchased this replacement head after 18 months of shaving with the original.</li>
            <li> not like the original, but it works.  </li>
            <li> I had wanted to replace the foil on my razor for months, but kept on reading about how the replacements were nothing like the original foils sold with the Braun electronic razors.  </li>
            <li> The supplied newer version of the cutter seems to work as well as the original.  </li>
            <li> I do not see a significant difference.  </li>
            <li> These are original replacements.</li>
            <li> My original Braun head wore out after 7 years.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after reading the reviews and deciding to get the original pulsonic 9000 replacement not the newer/cheaper series 7 model.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s original god forsaken blister packaging.  </li>
            <li> I used the replacement on my pulsonic razor and it works as well as when it was new nice close shave for an electric razor..</li>
            <li> One can flush the shaver clean with tap water when traveling or away from the cleaning/charging unit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my 3rd Braun, and is by far the best yet.</li>
            <li> Much greener and much more comfortable than razors.</li>
            <li> Clean shaves and close to the skin.</li>
            <li> but it is definitely just as good.</li>
            <li> The prices on the Braun accessories are about as good as I could find on the &#x27;net.   </li>
            <li> Convenient service---shipped right to the home for free.</li>
            <li> Razor shaves better and seeems like new!  </li>
            <li> The head is an exact fit for my Braun pulsonic 7 series shaver.  </li>
            <li> Overall very pleased with product. . . . . .</li>
            <li> I used to own the older style Braun Foil shaver similar to the 360 series that is reviewed in Consumer Reports and is top rated.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what was on my original braun pulsor razor that I bought when it first came out.</li>
            <li> Smooth comfortable shave with new foil.    </li>
            <li> Overall, these have been very good foils, giving me the closest shave over formerly owned shavers.</li>
            <li> It was well worth it</li>
            <li> so I could replace them more frequently, maybe we should all grow beards.</li>
            <li> Probably better if the seller would make that clear or change the picture on the website.  </li>
            <li> The simple fact is the original Pulsonic head was too good and lasted far longer than any head I have tried</li>
            <li> When I first opened this replacement I saw that the finish of the middle row of the blade was no longer the blue anodized finish and the outer finish went away from the brilliant chrome finish to a matte silver painted finish.</li>
            <li> right.  </li>
            <li> The replacement foil and cutter cartridge was easy to install and it made the razor perform like new.</li>
            <li> Its amazing that it lasted so long.</li>
            <li> It is a genuine Braun replacement foil and cutterblock and the razor now shaves like new.  </li>
            <li> This is the genuine article to restore like new performance to your Braaun Pulsonic.  </li>
            <li> For some reason my original razor had a rigid blade system but this one nicely moves up and down with the contours of my face and cuts pretty well for electric.</li>
            <li> Easy to install in place of 18 month old shaver 9000 Foil and Cutterblock.  </li>
            <li> Obviously, everyone hasn&#x27;t had the same experience, but here&#x27;s hoping that you get a great shave</li>
            <li> Very straight forward.</li>
            <li> You get the better quality foil with a new razor but your only choice for a replacement foil is the cheap ones.</li>
            <li> quality it had when the original head was new.</li>
            <li> Not great but very good.</li>
            <li> Got exactly what I needed, will visit again.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I ordered</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve replaced the foil (2yrs+).  </li>
            <li> - this looks exactly like the stock shaver head on my 9595 when I bought it.</li>
            <li> it was the first time you used it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Braun electric shavers since my first purchase in Vienna in 1988.</li>
            <li> This is not possible now.&lt;br /&gt;Overall better.</li>
            <li> , the replacement shaver head made it better, but still not enough for me.  </li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for..</li>
            <li> at first i would have to argue that this is not an OEM replacement.  </li>
            <li> The product description was sufficient for me to get the correct part on the first attempt...which isn&#x27;t always the case.</li>
            <li> I was charged the higher price and then sent the series 7 model.  </li>
            <li> A THREE STAR IS THAT LONGEVITY IS NOT THAT GOOD, SPECIFICALLY IF YOU HAVE A HEAVY BEARD.</li>
            <li> I really wanted the older type screen/blade because it is a better design and shaves better, but I got the &#x27;other&#x27; instead.  </li>
            <li> I would say it was better than my old foil was brand new</li>
            <li> I replaced my old original braun head that came with the shaver with this.</li>
            <li> The Braun shaver series in my opinion is far superior than any other shaver on the market.</li>
            <li> Amazon.com makes it easy to replace parts of the razor that needs changing regularly.  </li>
            <li> Then they claimed it was Amazon&#x27;s fault for not updating the picture, even though the description clearly states there is a newer version available and links to the new version.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much to say about this.  </li>
            <li> The seller was fast with processing an order and delivered by the promised date.</li>
            <li> Thanks braun.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving whole head since &#x27;98.</li>
            <li> Very fare price through Amazon.</li>
            <li> The shaver head was shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Still as close a shave, just lots more repetition to get the same complete coverage.    </li>
            <li> Received very quickly very easy transaction and price less than what the stores were selling a replacements for.</li>
            <li> They sent me a different look head than what was pictured and what my Pulsonic originally had</li>
            <li> I bit on two different ones, and when I returned them with pictures of the original  pictured foil vs. what I recieved, the vendors were resistent and denied it was a bait and switch.  </li>
            <li> this is not the original Pulsonic blue stripe head.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased with my first replacement I came back to the same place for another one.  </li>
            <li> Functions basically same as original though painted plastic instead of metal.  </li>
            <li> The older style foil head gives a faster, closer shave and is much preferred by me.</li>
            <li> ; foil is the foil that Braun currently manufactures for the old Pulsonic shavers (e.g. the 595), i.e. it will fit and work -- I personally just find that the old foil worked better.</li>
            <li> I clean the blades every 6-10 shaves in the solution (9000 series) but by the 4th month the shaves went from AMAZING to noticibly less... by 6 months I&#x27;m replacing them because I&#x27;m back to the old &#x27;</li>
            <li> I had the Series 7 in my shaver for three week now and it works good for now but in a few more week it will dull up</li>
            <li> I ordered the replacement foil for my Braun Pulsonic electric razor and received the new one within  a week!  </li>
            <li> Try the older style 360 series.</li>
            <li> I can confirm KANE&#x27;s finding: you most likely won&#x27;t get the item pictured (the &amp;#34;orginal Pulsonic&amp;#34; foil), but the current Braun drop-in replacement (the &amp;#34;Series 7&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> written in it, the comb cutter isn&#x27;t blue, and the pattern is a more standard</li>
            <li> I read the reviews about receiving the newer model instead of the older one pictured</li>
            <li> The older screen had a sort of &#x27;honeycomb&#x27; pattern in it which the newer &#x27;replacement&#x27; blades don&#x27;t have...</li>
            <li> Also, I guess the older one was referred to as Pulsonic, whereas the newer one is not.</li>
            <li> Also use the Braun Fluid, I think it really helps keep everything working right and seems to keep the blades sharper.</li>
            <li> Price is too high.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to say that it works as well as the previous foil when new.  </li>
            <li> am writing this review because no real info is available to us about it.</li>
            <li> It did take a full 2 weeks off everyday use to break my skin into using this product but was worth it.</li>
            <li> Normally the blades on an electric are used up in 6 months on my razors.</li>
            <li> well worth it since they last a lot longer.</li>
            <li> This is just a replacement head, part of normal maintenance required.</li>
            <li> This replacement foil does what they say it will do and it works well and cuts as well as the new one did.</li>
            <li> Cuts like it&#x27;s brand new again.</li>
            <li> Makes shaver shave like new.</li>
            <li> but I found out that it utilizes some new tech from Braun</li>
            <li> The razor is like new after replacement.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time as discribed, new in manufacture packaging.</li>
            <li> this is the new 9000 series</li>
            <li> If you surf for &amp;#34;Braun 9095&amp;#34; you can pick up the newest model with, obvilously, a new foil, for ~ 350 to 800.</li>
            <li> Replaced the foil on my razor and it&#x27;s like brand new.  </li>
            <li> Made my shaver just like new again.</li>
            <li> This is a brand new product, in</li>
            <li> Seems to work fine for shaving though it is less than a month.</li>
            <li> I got moved into this product through the slick advertising by Braun that appeals to techies like me, thinking that anything that vibrates at supersonic speed must be better.</li>
            <li> When you first change on the foil and cutterblock it doesn&#x27;t really shave close at all and takes a few days to re-adjust itself before you get a close shave again, but ultimately it does return to the original quality of shave.</li>
            <li> This is definitely not the same cutter as the original that came with the shaver.</li>
            <li> The new block and foil provided a noticeably less comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> Braun products are always top of the line and work well and last far longer than heads supplied by other manufacturers.</li>
            <li> It has made my old shaver new again.</li>
            <li> The replacement was certainly an improvement and he&#x27;ll know next time it pulls to check it.</li>
            <li> The 9000 series are advertised as a significant improvement over previous models.</li>
            <li> and I recommend you do this if yours is 12-18 months old.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut any closer than the old one.  </li>
            <li> The only issue is that after a month of use or so, it doesn&#x27;t get as close a shave as using a real razor.</li>
            <li> I am a 6-year frequently returning customer of Amazon, but regrettably, I feel like Amazon or whoever else sold this product to me has robbed $30 of my money.</li>
            <li> Because of my frustration with the razor, I decided to replace the foil, etc., way early to see if that made a difference.</li>
            <li> Since my foil was three years old, I had to get this replacement.  </li>
            <li> like I have so far.</li>
            <li> But, after a couple of months of the old foil pinching and pulling, i read some of the reviews on here, and gave in and bought this one.  </li>
            <li> I still get a faster, closer shave from my old 2000 series Braun shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d specifically ordered (and paid more for - only a few dollars</li>
            <li> The first replacement, if not better than the original, could not be told apart - shiny high quality material, durable and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I had my razor for quite sometime, maybe over 2 years and the blades needed to be changed as it was getting pretty rough on my face.</li>
            <li> Hi, I ordered this particular item from a third party seller (Senneca River) because I wanted the replacement head with the \\&quot;blue\\&quot; strip and as shoppers of this item probably know the newer version of this does not have that and apparently has some issues.  </li>
            <li> I recently purchased this new shaver head through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Replace the foil in your Braun shaver to get back like new shaving performance.  </li>
            <li> It brought my shave back to new condition and it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair like everyone else</li>
            <li> New foil and cutters make a big differece.</li>
            <li> Also the side trimmer is not user friendly as in past models.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked to find that the fit of the be replacement was no where as precise as it use to be but something I could live with.</li>
            <li> The way they are designed, they will break beyond repair if bent or crushed as they certainly will be in an envelope.</li>
            <li> I live abroad, it&#x27;s now pointless trying to send it back, wait for it to be delivered to the seller and then have another foil sent back, with the strong possibility that it&#x27;ll be the same foil anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t plan on changing anything in the near future.</li>
            <li> Beware its not the &amp;#34;blue Bar&amp;#34; blades (the zig zag bar through the middle is blue on a new razor) that comes with the razor.</li>
            <li> Works great, cuts my whiskers, wish these were less expensive</li>
            <li> Compared to other sources the price is very competitive.</li>
            <li> Important to change at least annually (possibly sooner).  </li>
            <li> After having an earlier model Braun shaver that I loved, the Series 7 (790cc) shaver was a big disappointment from a features &amp; ergonomic perspective.  </li>
            <li> These simply do not last or stay sharp anywhere near as long as the older Braun foils.  </li>
            <li> The foil does not have the same openings, and patterns, and the part in general does not have the same shine or feel.</li>
            <li> I have a tough beard, and while disposable razors (or disposable razor heads) work fine, I don&#x27;t like the hassle and the once-in-a-while nick.    </li>
            <li> After 18 months of daily use the previous blade still worked but cut much slower.</li>
            <li> If you sometimes wait a few days before shaving, the foil wears out more quickly when cutting a longer beard.</li>
            <li> The seller gave me a hard time on the return, first claiming that I should have checked with them prior to ordering to see which item I would actually get.</li>
            <li> I find this new shaver to be an improvement over previous Braun shavers.  </li>
            <li> Actually should have replaced this on my shaver LONG ago.  </li>
            <li> I got this to replace my 18 month old previous one.</li>
            <li> Then I shaved with it and found out it cuts my facial hair worse than the old head I&#x27;m replacing; turns out that Braun&#x27;s proprietary OptiFoil design is no longer being used which was the main reason why I bought this $300+ electric razor.</li>
            <li> Naturally not covered under 2 year warranty.  </li>
            <li> the only thing to be careful here is that the replacement part you will get is a &#x27;newer&#x27; version of the blades, and don&#x27;t look like the one pictured.  </li>
            <li> but I found that to be so minor</li>
            <li> Simple product, not terribly much to review..</li>
            <li> As a few other reviews have stated, this item is NOT the older braun shaver head (the one with the BLUE strip down the middle and reading PULSONIC on it).</li>
            <li> I live in a small town</li>
            <li> On the other hand, I had a third I kept.  </li>
            <li> Just know they really are not very effective after 5 or 6 months, much less a year+ out.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item from the 3rd party vendor &amp;#34;Seneca River Trading&amp;#34; a few days ago I thought I had found a vendor selling old stock at a slight surcharge as one can find &amp;#34;Series 7&amp;#34; foils cheaper.</li>
            <li> Then I went ahead with the replacement and the new unit needs to be forced on.</li>
            <li> A must have when your old cutter gets dull.</li>
            <li> Not much else to say.</li>
            <li> Not much to say here</li>
            <li> Not much else to say.</li>
            <li> so this product is not available locally.  </li>
            <li> And for the amount of money spent on the shaver and the replacement foils it should be.</li>
            <li> 4 stars instead of 5 due to cost.</li>
            <li> I figured I would get the refund then buy the other shaver head at Target.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t go and try to search it on fleebay or any other sites.  </li>
            <li> Other reviewers said it pulls whiskers</li>
            <li> The newer shaver head that shipped can be found from other sellers at a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> the replacement blades are the same as the one that came with the unit, so I can expect at least a year out of the blades.</li>
            <li> so you are forced to replace it sooner than the Blue stripped</li>
            <li> The biggest let down was the Pulsonic 9000 Series Foils (with the blades made by Gillette).  </li>
            <li> Another $30 down the drain.</li>
            <li> Quality has gone down over the years.</li>
            <li> Typical of MRP products.</li>
            <li> I replace these every year or year and a half.</li>
            <li> I think for clarity the picture should show the item that is shipped not the previous version I thought I was ordering.  </li>
            <li> Half way threw shave cartridge needs to be shaken out.</li>
            <li> ; foil can be identified by the writing &amp;#34;Pulsonic&amp;#34; on its sides, the blue tint of the comb cutter in the center, and the circular looking cut out pattern in the actual cutting foils.</li>
            <li> and I was at first mad about it</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Seneca River Trading didn&#x27;t have old stock and send me a &amp;#34;Series 7&amp;#34; foil.</li>
            <li> the replacement arrived in a few days and was on my razor that night.</li>
            <li> To my surprise though, this time, I received a blade which was made from the lowest possible metal quality, was already broken</li>
            <li> Mine typically get noticeably dull within a matter of weeks (and not the months that are claimed) ...</li>
            <li> Mine was sent in a bubble envelope and was crushed and broken upon receipt.  </li>
            <li> It should actually be changed every 18 months but no one follows that, they&#x27;ll just use it until it&#x27;s uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> but I am pretty disappointed that what was pictured was not what was shipped to me.</li>
            <li> However it is too small</li>
            <li> The past models let you use the side trimmer to cut neck hairs - when needed.</li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned thats playing dirty using this picture when they know it&#x27;s not what they&#x27;re selling.</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and decided to replace my cutting foil and shaving block.  </li>
            <li> and I do not have a heavy or tough beard.  </li>
            <li> At least once a year, replace your Braun&#x27;s foil and head.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the 9000 Pulsonic Replacement Foil after reading a lot of negative comments on the newer 70S / 7000 Replacement Foil here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I have never used an electric razor becuase they pull my hairs as I try to shave or don&#x27;t shave all the hair because my hairs are too thick.</li>
            <li> My husband dropped his shaver on the floor and not realizing he had broken a piece, continued to shave and couldn&#x27;t figure out why it was pulling so hard.  </li>
            <li> My husband has a tough beard.  </li>
            <li> and I am getting extremely poor and irritating shaves.</li>
            <li> This shaver (which was for my son) has already broken.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure I understand all the bad reviews</li>
            <li> Either way it gets the job done and wasn&#x27;t too expensive.  </li>
            <li> and I missed the return window because I was ill.</li>
            <li> There expensive but</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with the head or the shaver.  </li>
            <li> It seems like nowadays everyone is taking cost cutting measures</li>
            <li> Wrong!</li>
            <li> and it isn&#x27;t bad....</li>
            <li> The foil it replaced was falling apart and so bad that it literally fell apart the day this arrived.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in this workmanship.  </li>
            <li> and I was disappointed to find out that Braun is one of those companies.</li>
            <li> Disappointed beyond belief..,</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in that.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This replacement foil does what they say it will do and it works well and cuts as well as the new one did.</li>
            <li> Great store, lots of selections. Got exactly what I needed, will visit again. Thanks so much. Bruce P. Reinhard</li>
            <li> I know these products are great (though very high priced)  Mine was sent in a bubble envelope and was crushed and broken upon receipt.  These things need to be shipped in a well padded box, not an envelope.  The way they are designed, they will break beyond repair if bent or crushed as they certainly will be in an envelope.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000Q6UPZI Braun Replacement Pulsonic 9000 Series Foil]] I recently purchased this new shaver head through Amazon. The product order was correct and it was delivered on time.. I now get a very good shave with this new replacement head. I would recommend this product this product to anyone using a 9000 series Braun shaver.</li>
            <li> Pros: Gets the job done. Smooth comfortable shave with new foil.    Con: Price is too high. Typical of MRP products.</li>
            <li> Replace the foil in your Braun shaver to get back like new shaving performance.  This does the job.  Not much else to say.</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and decided to replace my cutting foil and shaving block.  It was well worth it and I recommend you do this if yours is 12-18 months old.  Cuts like it&#x27;s brand new again.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement foil for the Braun electric razors.  The foil is replaced on a yearly basis and maintained by the use of the Braun Lemon Scented razor maintanance / Cleaning Solution.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much to say about this.  It is a genuine Braun replacement foil and cutterblock and the razor now shaves like new.  4 stars instead of 5 due to cost.</li>
            <li> I clean the blades every 6-10 shaves in the solution (9000 series) but by the 4th month the shaves went from AMAZING to noticibly less... by 6 months I&#x27;m replacing them because I&#x27;m back to the old &#x27;go over &amp; over the same area&#x27; to get the perfect shave when the blades were new. Still as close a shave, just lots more repetition to get the same complete coverage.    Anyone else experiencing the same ?  It&#x27;s still an amazing product but we NEED TO KNOW if the blades need replacing every 6 mos to get the same quick &amp; perfect shave we start with when new !!</li>
            <li> Important to change at least annually (possibly sooner).  If you sometimes wait a few days before shaving, the foil wears out more quickly when cutting a longer beard.</li>
            <li> The seller was fast with processing an order and delivered by the promised date. Had no problems with the product at all. Overall A+ experience.</li>
            <li> I received the correct replacement head for my Braun shaver. It&#x27;s working the way it should. I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> Seems to work fine for shaving though it is less than a month. Will have to see about longevity. Metal thickness not as good as OEM. Stamps and markings not as OEM</li>
            <li> I bought this despite the review that says it isn&#x27;t the same shaver head.  When I got it I could immediately tell it was different.  The foil is a different patter and the middle is not blue it is silver.  I emailed the seller and they said I could return it for a refund.  I figured I would get the refund then buy the other shaver head at Target.  Problem is I cannot find that original shaver head anywhere.  They are all the same as this one.  Since this was cheaper I just kept it and am using it now.  I will say the shaver head seems to pull you hair more than the stock one on the pulstronic.  I think it has something to do with the foil pattern.  Either way it gets the job done and wasn&#x27;t too expensive.  Also I couldn&#x27;t find the original one.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS. THE ONLY REASON I RATED IT A THREE STAR IS THAT LONGEVITY IS NOT THAT GOOD, SPECIFICALLY IF YOU HAVE A HEAVY BEARD. PRICE HAS TO DROP, TOO EXPENSIVE.&lt;br /&gt;ANTHONY.H&lt;br /&gt;BURLINGTON, MA.</li>
            <li> I replace these every year or year and a half. Makes shaver shave like new. German made so it is a quality product.</li>
            <li> I replaced my old original braun head that came with the shaver with this. The shaving went back to the feel/quality it had when the original head was new.</li>
            <li> Excellent service and pricing. I would recomend this to anyone shopping for a replacement. It arrived in a timely manner also.</li>
            <li> I got this to replace my 18 month old previous one. After 18 months of daily use the previous blade still worked but cut much slower. Its amazing that it lasted so long. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I used to own the older style Braun Foil shaver similar to the 360 series that is reviewed in Consumer Reports and is top rated. I got moved into this product through the slick advertising by Braun that appeals to techies like me, thinking that anything that vibrates at supersonic speed must be better. Wrong! The older style foil head gives a faster, closer shave and is much preferred by me. Now I have a Pulsonic shaver with two heads that I don&#x27;t really find very satisfying. Replacing this 9000 series head every 18 months, per Braun&#x27;s recommendation, is not cost effective for the user. It doesn&#x27;t cut any closer than the old one.  Considering a Braun shaver? Try the older style 360 series.</li>
            <li> I had my razor for quite sometime, maybe over 2 years and the blades needed to be changed as it was getting pretty rough on my face. I ordered this replacement blade and my razor is like new with a great and smooth shave. It should actually be changed every 18 months but no one follows that, they&#x27;ll just use it until it&#x27;s uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> They sent me a different look head than what was pictured and what my Pulsonic originally had and I was at first mad about it but I found out that it utilizes some new tech from Braun so I tried it out. I would say it was better than my old foil was brand new but it is definitely just as good. It brought my shave back to new condition and it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair like everyone else is saying. Give it a try.</li>
            <li> I ordered the replacement foil for my Braun Pulsonic electric razor and received the new one within  a week!  It was exactly what I ordered and I couldn&#x27;t have been happier with the Amazon merchant!!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve replaced the foil (2yrs+).  The razor is like new after replacement.</li>
            <li> For some reason is very noisy but otherwise works great.</li>
            <li> Not much to say here - this looks exactly like the stock shaver head on my 9595 when I bought it. The manual says to change every 19 months. Not much else to say.</li>
            <li> At least once a year, replace your Braun&#x27;s foil and head.  It makes your electric razor like it was the first time you used it.  Way to go Braun!</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for my shaver. Overall, these have been very good foils, giving me the closest shave over formerly owned shavers.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time as discribed, new in manufacture packaging. Works great would order from vendor again. Price was the best and quality great!</li>
            <li> Fit and works perfectly</li>
            <li> I have purchased 3 of these since I bought my original Razor.  Just replace it once a year and you will get back the smooth easy shave that you paid good money for when you bought a Braun.</li>
            <li> Shopped the internet and found the best description on Amazon.com.  Bought on-line using Amazon prompts. Very straight forward. Shipped via USPS within one week. Packaging was very good for this item.  No charge for shipping. Easy to install in place of 18 month old shaver 9000 Foil and Cutterblock.  Very satisfied with about one month use of of this product!</li>
            <li> When you first change on the foil and cutterblock it doesn&#x27;t really shave close at all and takes a few days to re-adjust itself before you get a close shave again, but ultimately it does return to the original quality of shave.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000Q6UPZI Braun Replacement Pulsonic 9000 Series Foil and Cutterblock]]  PRODUCT IS GOOD, PRICE IS GOOD, SERVICE AND SHIPPING IS GOOD. I WILL BY FROM YOU AGAIN.</li>
            <li> this was what we were looking for we tried  to find this in stores but could not find it and this was the best priced one also works great  so happy with this order</li>
            <li> The cutter I got does not look like the one in the photo. The foil does not have the same openings, and patterns, and the part in general does not have the same shine or feel. This is definitely not the same cutter as the original that came with the shaver. This must be a counterfeit part.&lt;br /&gt;Returning it today.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 9000 Pulsonic Replacement Foil after reading a lot of negative comments on the newer 70S / 7000 Replacement Foil here on Amazon.  When my replacement foil arrived it was the 70S / 7000 Replacement Foil instead of the 9000 Replacement Foil I&#x27;d specifically ordered (and paid more for - only a few dollars but still).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I live abroad, it&#x27;s now pointless trying to send it back, wait for it to be delivered to the seller and then have another foil sent back, with the strong possibility that it&#x27;ll be the same foil anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware - you may not  be getting actually what you asked for.  If you can, buy one in a store where you can actually see that it is a 9000 Replacement Foil!</li>
            <li> good item for the money works well I would reamend this product and seller I get a good shave this is the new 9000 series</li>
            <li> My husband has a tough beard.  This razor makes my husband happy.  Amazon.com makes it easy to replace parts of the razor that needs changing regularly.  Once every 6 months is good.  Good price. Convenient service---shipped right to the home for free.</li>
            <li> I have never used an electric razor becuase they pull my hairs as I try to shave or don&#x27;t shave all the hair because my hairs are too thick. With that being said this product is very good.  Not great but very good. It did take a full 2 weeks off everyday use to break my skin into using this product but was worth it. It will shave all my hairs and hasn&#x27;t pulled a hair yet.  The only issue is that after a month of use or so, it doesn&#x27;t get as close a shave as using a real razor. It takes about the same amount of time to shave and I don&#x27;t get razor burn also.  Overall I would give this razor 4.5 stars out of 5.</li>
            <li> I can confirm KANE&#x27;s finding: you most likely won&#x27;t get the item pictured (the &amp;#34;orginal Pulsonic&amp;#34; foil), but the current Braun drop-in replacement (the &amp;#34;Series 7&amp;#34; foil).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;Pulsonic&amp;#34; foil can be identified by the writing &amp;#34;Pulsonic&amp;#34; on its sides, the blue tint of the comb cutter in the center, and the circular looking cut out pattern in the actual cutting foils. The &amp;#34;Series 7&amp;#34; foil has &amp;#34;Series 7&amp;#34; written in it, the comb cutter isn&#x27;t blue, and the pattern is a more standard 50%-offset pattern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I ordered this item from the 3rd party vendor &amp;#34;Seneca River Trading&amp;#34; a few days ago I thought I had found a vendor selling old stock at a slight surcharge as one can find &amp;#34;Series 7&amp;#34; foils cheaper. Unfortunately, Seneca River Trading didn&#x27;t have old stock and send me a &amp;#34;Series 7&amp;#34; foil. I had to file an Amazon A-Z claim to get the issue resolved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: The &amp;#34;Series 7&amp;#34; foil is the foil that Braun currently manufactures for the old Pulsonic shavers (e.g. the 595), i.e. it will fit and work -- I personally just find that the old foil worked better.</li>
            <li> i needed a replacement and this was the best deal on the net.  don&#x27;t go and try to search it on fleebay or any other sites.  the replacement arrived in a few days and was on my razor that night.</li>
            <li> Fraud!!! You will not receive the product pictured. You will receive the newer version which you can buy elsewhere at a lower price.</li>
            <li> Hi, I ordered this particular item from a third party seller (Senneca River) because I wanted the replacement head with the \\&quot;blue\\&quot; strip and as shoppers of this item probably know the newer version of this does not have that and apparently has some issues.  Well despite this picture of this item showing the blue strip, what arrived was the newer version of the head that does NOT have the strip.  Haven&#x27;t tried it out yet but I am pretty disappointed that what was pictured was not what was shipped to me.</li>
            <li> I purchased a replacement foil for this shaver about a year ago from a different seller and it \\&quot;Pulsonic\\&quot; on the head (as in the photo) I was thoroughly pleased with my purchase. I recently purchased another foil, but from a different seller and thought I was getting a \\&quot;Pulsonic\\&quot; brand item. It has \\&quot;Series 7\\&quot; on the foil and I am getting extremely poor and irritating shaves. I would not but from this seller again.</li>
            <li> After having an earlier model Braun shaver that I loved, the Series 7 (790cc) shaver was a big disappointment from a features &amp; ergonomic perspective.  The biggest let down was the Pulsonic 9000 Series Foils (with the blades made by Gillette).  These simply do not last or stay sharp anywhere near as long as the older Braun foils.  Mine typically get noticeably dull within a matter of weeks (and not the months that are claimed) ... and I do not have a heavy or tough beard.  I will not buy another Braun shaver (or the foils that go in them) again in the future.</li>
            <li> I used this product only for 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using my Braun for over 3 years now. In this period I replaced the blade only once and I was really happy with the replacement. The first replacement, if not better than the original, could not be told apart - shiny high quality material, durable and long lasting. To my surprise though, this time, I received a blade which was made from the lowest possible metal quality, was already broken \\&quot;in the package\\&quot;. I thought I had to assemble them myself. Once I got it in a shape which looked ok, I used it and I was about to break my glasses with the flying parts. I am a 6-year frequently returning customer of Amazon, but regrettably, I feel like Amazon or whoever else sold this product to me has robbed $30 of my money. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> While I have used this shaver and foils for a year now I have found they actually last 5 months or so. That said, it&#x27;s still the best foil and shaver yet.  One great thing is that when traveling you can clean these with water. While I also use a blade in the mornings sometime this is a great 2nd shave in the day or an excellent first.  Just know they really are not very effective after 5 or 6 months, much less a year+ out.</li>
            <li> After having only used the 9595 for 9 months with TLC, the  silver front \\&quot;Pulsonic\\&quot; fell off  foil and cutter cassette and cannot be put back on. Naturally not covered under 2 year warranty.  Disappointed in this workmanship.  My hubby loves the razor.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used mine yet as I&#x27;m on the original one that came with the razor. Normally the blades on an electric are used up in 6 months on my razors. The Braun 9595 is hands down the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used and the replacement blades are the same as the one that came with the unit, so I can expect at least a year out of the blades. Also use the Braun Fluid, I think it really helps keep everything working right and seems to keep the blades sharper.</li>
            <li> This shaver (which was for my son) has already broken.  Very disappointed in that.  He did think it did a good job when working.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Braun Razors for years.  This series of Razor and replacement foil and cutter block lasts longer than any that I&#x27;ve had.  The original lasted 18 months and still cuts fine.  I am very impressed with this unit.</li>
            <li> A must have when your old cutter gets dull. Very good quality product. Thanks braun.</li>
            <li> I purchased the high-end Braun series 9000 razor in the summer of 2008. I decided to spend a lot to accomplish a lot. I have a tough beard, and while disposable razors (or disposable razor heads) work fine, I don&#x27;t like the hassle and the once-in-a-while nick.    Until the Braun, I was a three-head electric razor fan. But they weren&#x27;t getting the job done. So I took the plunge.    Don&#x27;t do it.    It was great for about a month, but I soon found it was not doing an effective job and I often have to finish things off with a disposable. Ain&#x27;t supposed to work that way, folks, not with a $200-plus razor. I know, I&#x27;m reviewing the replacement foil and cutterblock. That&#x27;s part of the problem. Braun says replace it every 18 months or so. Because of my frustration with the razor, I decided to replace the foil, etc., way early to see if that made a difference. Another $30 down the drain. It didn&#x27;t help.    What I do like: The Braun razors&#x27; cleaning system. But what good is a clean razor if it doesn&#x27;t do the job?</li>
            <li> I read the reviews about receiving the newer model instead of the older one pictured but I took a chance and ordered one anyway from Shaver Outlet Inc. I also received the newer model. The seller gave me a hard time on the return, first claiming that I should have checked with them prior to ordering to see which item I would actually get. I don&#x27;t know why I shouldn&#x27;t expect to receive the one pictured. Then they claimed it was Amazon&#x27;s fault for not updating the picture, even though the description clearly states there is a newer version available and links to the new version.</li>
            <li> I put in the model # of my husbands razor and this is the foil that came up. However it is too small and I missed the return window because I was ill. Now I&#x27;m stuck with it.</li>
            <li> Works great, cuts my whiskers, wish these were less expensive so I could replace them more frequently, maybe we should all grow beards.</li>
            <li> Beware its not the &amp;#34;blue Bar&amp;#34; blades (the zig zag bar through the middle is blue on a new razor) that comes with the razor. The replacement foils are the cheap ones made in the Chec Republic. Your whiskers get caught and snag constantly. I called Braun customer service and they recognize there have been a lot of complaints but they don&#x27;t plan on changing anything in the near future. You get the better quality foil with a new razor but your only choice for a replacement foil is the cheap ones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this forever. I have extra one.This is one of the best shavers I have known.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;Sung K.</li>
            <li> This is the genuine article to restore like new performance to your Braaun Pulsonic.  Local price is up to $43 so Amazon is a great way to save some cash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Braun electric shavers since my first purchase in Vienna in 1988. Most years thereafter Braun has improved its high-end shaver. I anticipate another advance this Christmas season - and, I&#x27;ll buy it.    I purchased this replacement head after 18 months of shaving with the original.</li>
            <li> This is the second replacement foil that I bought for my Braun 9595 Pulsonic and both times it was the correct one and fit and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is just a regular replacement of the worn blades. It was delivered on time and in good condition, thank you.</li>
            <li> I live in a small town so this product is not available locally.  Compared to other sources the price is very competitive. Shipping time was good with free option.</li>
            <li> We recently gave the Braun 700 Series Razor to my husband as a Father&#x27;s Day Gift. Of course he has not used the replacement head yet but he loved his gift and loves his new razor.  He used his new razor for the first time this morning and said it was the best he&#x27;s had.</li>
            <li> This foil with cutter blades was an exact replacement for my 9000 series Braun Pulsonic shaver, which provides the best quality shave from an electric shaver that I have experienced so far.</li>
            <li> Quality has gone down over the years. On my 2nd shaver. They last years. I have been shaving whole head since &#x27;98. Lots to shave, big head too.</li>
            <li> The replacement was thankfully available through Amazon.com.  Razor shaves better and seeems like new!  New foil and cutters make a big differece.</li>
            <li> None of the 9000 series foils pictured on Amazon are what the is shown.  They are all 7S series that fit the 9000.  I bit on two different ones, and when I returned them with pictures of the original  pictured foil vs. what I recieved, the vendors were resistent and denied it was a bait and switch.  On the other hand, I had a third I kept.  Eventually, you get used to it and it isn&#x27;t bad....not like the original, but it works.  If you surf for &amp;#34;Braun 9095&amp;#34; you can pick up the newest model with, obvilously, a new foil, for ~ 350 to 800.</li>
            <li> Needed a replacement part for my shaver. Found it on this site at a good price and with free shipping. Did not have to go to the mall. Easy transaction, I&#x27;m satisfied. BT.</li>
            <li> Fast Service, Great Purchase.</li>
            <li> this is not the original Pulsonic blue stripe head. The Pilsonic heads have been discontinued by Braun. So you will get the Series 7 head instead.&lt;br /&gt;The series 7 is a pefect match to the Braun Plusonic shaver but still not as good as the original. I had the Series 7 in my shaver for three week now and it works good for now but in a few more week it will dull up so you are forced to replace it sooner than the Blue stripped original.&lt;br /&gt;I am writing this review because no real info is available to us about it. So I found out for you what was going on. The simple fact is the original Pulsonic head was too good and lasted far longer than any head I have tried and Braun decided they were losing profits.&lt;br /&gt;just search for Series 7 head and buy it because nothing else is available for our shavers.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and product is as advertised.</li>
            <li> I found the Perfect replacement for my old shaver&#x27;s foil and it was very convenient to order on line and have it delivered at a competitive price.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q6UPZI/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title</li>
            <li> The Braun shaver series in my opinion is far superior than any other shaver on the market. And for the amount of money spent on the shaver and the replacement foils it should be. There expensive but well worth it since they last a lot longer.</li>
            <li> I have shaved with a Braun for 15+ years.  I find this new shaver to be an improvement over previous Braun shavers.  Positives: Big improvement is in design.  The pulsonic is slimmer and easier to hold when shaving.  After 3+ weeks - I can honestly say that it shaves better/closer.  One can flush the shaver clean with tap water when traveling or away from the cleaning/charging unit. Negatives: It is noisier when shaving and when cleaning. Also the side trimmer is not user friendly as in past models.  The past models let you use the side trimmer to cut neck hairs - when needed. This is not possible now.&lt;br /&gt;Overall better.</li>
            <li> the only thing to be careful here is that the replacement part you will get is a &#x27;newer&#x27; version of the blades, and don&#x27;t look like the one pictured.  I really wanted the older type screen/blade because it is a better design and shaves better, but I got the &#x27;other&#x27; instead.  Got my money back.  Probably better if the seller would make that clear or change the picture on the website.  The older screen had a sort of &#x27;honeycomb&#x27; pattern in it which the newer &#x27;replacement&#x27; blades don&#x27;t have...you can see it if you look closely on the left side/edge of the picture...that&#x27;s the big difference.  Also, I guess the older one was referred to as Pulsonic, whereas the newer one is not.</li>
            <li> The replacement foil and cutter cartridge was easy to install and it made the razor perform like new.</li>
            <li> I used the replacement on my pulsonic razor and it works as well as when it was new nice close shave for an electric razor..</li>
            <li> Received item in a timely manner, as described, at a good price and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> It is a joy when things are designed well, perform their task reliably, and in this case can have replacement parts that restore the like-new functionality.  The replacement foil and cutter installed perfectly, worked great and reminded my why I liked the razor in the first place.</li>
            <li> I have been using Braun electric razors for more than 45 years and this 9000 Series Foil is the best and smoothest they have ever made. Very fare price through Amazon. Com. Good merchant to buy from.</li>
            <li> I have now bought two of these over the last 18 months.  You should replace them every 12-18.  I was so pleased with my first replacement I came back to the same place for another one.  It cuts great and it seems like my razor is brand new again.  I am not sure I understand all the bad reviews I think it works great.</li>
            <li> I hesitated getting this replacement foil since I read reviews saying that it wasn&#x27;t as good as the old foil.  Since my foil was three years old, I had to get this replacement.  I&#x27;m glad to say that it works as well as the previous foil when new.  Obviously, everyone hasn&#x27;t had the same experience, but here&#x27;s hoping that you get a great shave like I have so far.</li>
            <li> Functions basically same as original though painted plastic instead of metal.  Other reviewers said it pulls whiskers but I found that to be so minor it was no problem.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised on the Pulsonic. No problems, but a better price than most stores! Simple product, not terribly much to review..</li>
            <li> Been a Pulsonic shaver now some 4 years and am thoroughly satisfied. The foils really provide a great, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Replaced the foil on my razor and it&#x27;s like brand new.  Close shave.  Received very quickly very easy transaction and price less than what the stores were selling a replacements for.</li>
            <li> The shaver head was shipped fast. The head is an exact fit for my Braun pulsonic 7 series shaver.  There is nothing wrong with the head or the shaver.  I have a coarse beard/subble, but also have sensative skin and cant use the razor.  It is a pitty because the razor was around $250.  All said and done though, the replacement shaver head made it better, but still not enough for me.  My girlfriend loves it for her legs though.  She states that it shaves as well as a blade for her.  The price was great and the seller shipped it FAST.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for.. I have been to 5 different local stores looking for a replacement foil for my electric razor and found it here instead thank you for saving me from buying another electric razor for the time being.</li>
            <li> My husband dropped his shaver on the floor and not realizing he had broken a piece, continued to shave and couldn&#x27;t figure out why it was pulling so hard.  The replacement was certainly an improvement and he&#x27;ll know next time it pulls to check it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this replacement as recommended after 18 months of using my Braun shaver.  The new block and foil provided a noticeably less comfortable shave.  After 6 to 8 months of use the replacement foil fell apart.  I returned to using the original, which was much more comfortable in spite of the time in use.  It is still going strong after almost 2 1/2 years... though it may soon be necessary to replace.  Unless Amazon gets this quality issue handled, I will have to purchase it elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I had wanted to replace the foil on my razor for months, but kept on reading about how the replacements were nothing like the original foils sold with the Braun electronic razors.  But, after a couple of months of the old foil pinching and pulling, i read some of the reviews on here, and gave in and bought this one.  Have no fear, this is just like the original foil and the razor is as good as new.</li>
            <li> As a few other reviews have stated, this item is NOT the older braun shaver head (the one with the BLUE strip down the middle and reading PULSONIC on it). The only reason I purchased from this seller was specifically because I wanted the item pictured. The newer shaver head that shipped can be found from other sellers at a cheaper price. I wished I would have read one of these reviews before purchasing, hope it helps you avoid the same mistake I made. Only reason they got 2 stars was for prompt shipping. As far as I&#x27;m concerned thats playing dirty using this picture when they know it&#x27;s not what they&#x27;re selling.</li>
            <li> Thise foil works well.  at first i would have to argue that this is not an OEM replacement.  overall it does the job i need it to and fits in my Braun perfectly.  It just didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; right.  have gotten used to it since then.....no problems</li>
            <li> Made my shaver just like new again. aaa aaa aaa aaa aaa aaa aaa aaa aaa aaa aaa aaa aaa</li>
            <li> This is just a replacement head, part of normal maintenance required. This is the second head I have had to buy.</li>
            <li> The supplied newer version of the cutter seems to work as well as the original.  I think for clarity the picture should show the item that is shipped not the previous version I thought I was ordering.  I returned it in protest and the received a timely refund but had to pay shipping to return it.</li>
            <li> The prices on the Braun accessories are about as good as I could find on the &#x27;net.   The 9000 series are advertised as a significant improvement over previous models. I do not see a significant difference.  I still get a faster, closer shave from my old 2000 series Braun shaver.</li>
            <li> I replace the blades once a year. These are original replacements. Easy to use. Just snaps on and off for replacement or cleaning.</li>
            <li> It has made my old shaver new again. It does its job perfectly, with no problems. It enables an OK workday shave.</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the best in the Braun line. It&#x27;s my 3rd Braun, and is by far the best yet. Great job Braun.</li>
            <li> Fits and works. My original Braun head wore out after 7 years. Much greener and much more comfortable than razors.</li>
            <li> For some reason my original razor had a rigid blade system but this one nicely moves up and down with the contours of my face and cuts pretty well for electric.</li>
            <li> Great replacement. Clean shaves and close to the skin. Easy to clean. I recommend as a replacement foil head for the Braun series.</li>
            <li> Works great and You can use it for two years or longer. I have been using this series for years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen alot of reviews saying they are looking for the replacement head with the blue strip and hexagonal cutouts. This is definitely the one with those features.  It&#x27;s what was on my original braun pulsor razor that I bought when it first came out.</li>
            <li> Half way threw shave cartridge needs to be shaken out. Overall very pleased with product. . . . . .</li>
            <li> Totally pleased with the product. Fits perfect and brought the performance back to \\&quot;day 1\\&quot;. The product description was sufficient for me to get the correct part on the first attempt...which isn&#x27;t always the case.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after reading the reviews and deciding to get the original pulsonic 9000 replacement not the newer/cheaper series 7 model.  I was charged the higher price and then sent the series 7 model.  This is a bait and switch situation and I am faced with shipping charges both ways and I still have no way of getting what I ordered.</li>
            <li> Braun products are always top of the line and work well and last far longer than heads supplied by other manufacturers.</li>
            <li> Actually should have replaced this on my shaver LONG ago.  This is a brand new product, in it&#x27;s original god forsaken blister packaging.  Saved a bit of money through this deal.  Timing was perfect.  The foil it replaced was falling apart and so bad that it literally fell apart the day this arrived.</li>
            <li> It seems like nowadays everyone is taking cost cutting measures and I was disappointed to find out that Braun is one of those companies. When I first opened this replacement I saw that the finish of the middle row of the blade was no longer the blue anodized finish and the outer finish went away from the brilliant chrome finish to a matte silver painted finish. Aesthetics? Yes but still not a deal breaker for me. Then I went ahead with the replacement and the new unit needs to be forced on. I was shocked to find that the fit of the be replacement was no where as precise as it use to be but something I could live with. Then I shaved with it and found out it cuts my facial hair worse than the old head I&#x27;m replacing; turns out that Braun&#x27;s proprietary OptiFoil design is no longer being used which was the main reason why I bought this $300+ electric razor. Disappointed beyond belief..,</li>
