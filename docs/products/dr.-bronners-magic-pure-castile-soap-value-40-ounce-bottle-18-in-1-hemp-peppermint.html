            <li>I love the peppermint scent.  </li>
            <li>My skin is nice and smooth and feels so much better when I use this soap.</li>
            <li>but I feel the peppermint cleans better.</li>
            <li>Love the smell especailly mix with my rosemary extract.</li>

            <li>I love you</li>
            <li>Love its versilitality</li>
            <li>I love the peppermint -- it tingles and is refreshing.  </li>
            <li>In that way it&#x27;s more eco-friendly than most soaps you can get on the market these days, and easier on your wallet as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great uses:&lt;br /&gt;(1) Surface Cleaner - cuts on grease decently and leaves a great minty smell about the house.&lt;br /&gt;(2)</li>
            <li>Love this to clean my kitchen/floors</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t, please head to a high-altitude lake with this soap in hand, and discover the peppermint-tingly-magic of this fine product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and this is by far the best bath product I have used so far!</li>
            <li>Cuts grease, great dish detergent, only needs a drop in a quart of water.</li>
            <li>Cleans well and smells natural and good.</li>
            <li>We have also used it to clean fruit as directed on the bottle.</li>
            <li>wash my hands wash my face and even use it in the shower I haven&#x27;t felt this clean before  </li>
            <li>And i still have a mostly full bottle.</li>
            <li>Very Minty peppermint, I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping, packed well.  </li>
            <li>I love this soap , I got sensitive  </li>
            <li>It clean everything had stainless on part of shorts</li>
            <li>,  the tingle as well in a hot shower wakes you up and invigorates, and it&#x27;s real soap</li>
            <li>Awesome soap but expensive, there are cheaper alternatives like black soap if you want to be environmentally friendly and know it&#x27;s safe to use on your skin unlike most soaps that have harsh detergents and other chemicals that may or may not be safe</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost better to have one of these bottles next to the the toilet than a smart phone.</li>
            <li>In love and its my everyday soap.</li>
            <li>note - this product was actually recommended by my doctor ( primary care physician) for overall health!</li>
            <li>Found a recipe to include it in as part of a natural shampoo.</li>
            <li>Being all natural, I am please, because I am allergic to everything</li>
            <li>Large bottle lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>skin and the peppermint shower makes half the house smells fresh</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a thick consistancy, so you just have to be careful.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> It is humongous! Tried this 2-3 years ago and I loved the smell. Still the same after all these years. Thank you!</li>
            <li> A standby favorite of mine.  I love the peppermint scent.  Very refreshing.</li>
            <li> This is our third bottle. Last a very long time, peppermint oil wakes you up in they morning and has a slight tingle on your skin. We have also used it to clean fruit as directed on the bottle.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal and Dr Bronner&#x27;s soaps are the best.  My skin is nice and smooth and feels so much better when I use this soap.</li>
            <li> Best camping and environmentally friendly soap around.</li>
            <li> Cleans well and smells natural and good. Disinfects flip flops and floors as well.</li>
            <li> Smells great, and leaves you with a very clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Very good soap.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again</li>
            <li> The best soap ever. And the crazy philosophy all over the bottle really gets you thinking about the world and your place in it. It&#x27;s almost better to have one of these bottles next to the the toilet than a smart phone.</li>
            <li> Been using this soap for 20 years, truly an all-in one soap.</li>
            <li> Great for hair and body!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best.  Have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, I also have tea tree scent but I feel the peppermint cleans better.</li>
            <li> Works amazing... I&#x27;ve made window cleaner, an everyday cleaner, bathroom cleaner, furniture polish/dusting, And i still have a mostly full bottle. Love the smell especailly mix with my rosemary extract.</li>
            <li> ...My crotch feels like a candy cane...</li>
            <li> Peppermint is my favorite flavor. It gives you tingles.</li>
            <li> Great for everything.  Found a recipe to include it in as part of a natural shampoo. DO NOT use it alone in hair!  Cuts grease, great dish detergent, only needs a drop in a quart of water. Also use as a hand soap diluted. Great peppermint scent.</li>
            <li> Quality soap that I use daily.</li>
            <li> You know the magic contained within! If you don&#x27;t, please head to a high-altitude lake with this soap in hand, and discover the peppermint-tingly-magic of this fine product.&lt;br /&gt;***Side note - this product was actually recommended by my doctor ( primary care physician) for overall health! I have no skin conditions but the doc educated me on what I thought was soap (Dove body wash), and what actually is soap (this product, for instance). I urge anyone not educated about the subject of soap vs. the garbage labeled as soap to do some personal research ASAP. I don&#x27;t like to preach so I&#x27;ll leave it that.</li>
            <li> It clean everything had stainless on part of shorts it was there for at least a year it came OUT !  I also wash dishes wash my hands wash my face and even use it in the shower I haven&#x27;t felt this clean before  and it doesn&#x27;t dry out have like dish sot does  !!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Perfect cooling effect for those of us living in Central America.</li>
            <li> Best soap ever. CLEANLINESS IS GODLINESS</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, works beyond well, and surprising as well! Very Minty peppermint, I couldn&#x27;t ask for more. Being all natural, I am please, because I am allergic to everything and this is by far the best bath product I have used so far!</li>
            <li> Awesome soap but expensive, there are cheaper alternatives like black soap if you want to be environmentally friendly and know it&#x27;s safe to use on your skin unlike most soaps that have harsh detergents and other chemicals that may or may not be safe</li>
            <li> Very nice product, every household should have this for multipurpose use. I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> I miss you soap.  PS.  I love you</li>
            <li> Peppermint- Stage 1 Feingold approved</li>
            <li> In love and its my everyday soap. I use it in the shower and sometimes as a face wash. Love its versilitality</li>
            <li> Large bottle lasts a long time.  I refill a smaller pump bottle for use in the shower with a shower poof.  I love the peppermint -- it tingles and is refreshing.  Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  I haven&#x27;t tried it for household cleaning yet.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Very refreshing in the morning.  The tingle wakes you up!  Purchased the largest size available for best value.  Quick shipping, packed well.  Wish it had a pump to measure the amount dispensed.  It&#x27;s not a thick consistancy, so you just have to be careful.</li>
            <li> I love this soap , I got sensitive  skin and the peppermint shower makes half the house smells fresh,  the tingle as well in a hot shower wakes you up and invigorates, and it&#x27;s real soap</li>
            <li> Love this to clean my kitchen/floors</li>
            <li> There is a lot of literature out on this product, and most of them are quite good. With this product, a little goes a LONG way. In that way it&#x27;s more eco-friendly than most soaps you can get on the market these days, and easier on your wallet as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great uses:&lt;br /&gt;(1) Surface Cleaner - cuts on grease decently and leaves a great minty smell about the house.&lt;br /&gt;(2) Floor Cleaning Solution - Again, cleans dirt and stains well, and leaves a minty smell about the house.&lt;br /&gt;(3) Dish Washing Solution - See Above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so great uses:&lt;br /&gt;(1) Shampoo - I definitely needed conditioner afterwards, my hair felt so dry.&lt;br /&gt;(2) Dog wash - Same.</li>
            <li> Great deal on a ton of soap. Been using this stuff for a few years now...</li>
            <li> smells terrific, a bit of a tingle</li>
    </ol>
