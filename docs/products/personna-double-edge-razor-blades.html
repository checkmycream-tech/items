    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The best blade for me.</li>
            <li>Buy the best blades and learn how to use them.</li>
            <li>Plus, they come in a great dispenser with a place for used blades.  </li>
            <li>A good blade should go</li>
            <li>These are good razors.</li>
            <li>They are cheap and excellent, and I&#x27;ll keep buying them.  </li>
            <li>this is the kind of razor my father used when I was growing up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using a Merkur Futur razor and a nice badger brush</li>
            <li>why shave with this blade when you dont have to anymore, when theires better blades on the market.</li>
            <li>once in awhile and stick with the BETTER sensor,etc</li>
            <li>Blades are OK, but not the price of shipping.</li>
            <li>These blades are some of my favorite.</li>
            <li>These are certainly my most durable blade.</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t pay more than $.99+tax for a pack of 5.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how many shaves</li>
            <li>I suppose which blades work best for any individual varies, but for my Irish face I&#x27;m very happy with these!</li>
            <li>:)    </li>
            <li>Check out \\&quot;The Badger &amp; Blade\\&quot; website for more reviews on these blades.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite razor with this blade.  </li>
            <li>The blades themselves are OK</li>
            <li>and they went through my beard very smooth and easy.</li>
            <li>Extra 100 pack, which I have read is very good.</li>
            <li>They are sorta okay but not as smooth as the Persona.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed with how sharp these Personna blades are; I had 3 days growth</li>
            <li>Try &#x27;em, and if they work with your razor and technique, you&#x27;ll have an easy to find source of inexpensive blades.</li>
            <li>This is a smooth blade.</li>
            <li>I just completed 10 acceptably smooth, acceptably close shaves with one of these blades in my Parker</li>
            <li>Those who claim that these blades tear up their face must either be new to DE shaving or biased against \\&quot;common\\&quot; products they can buy locally, because every time I have bought Personna blades, I have had a succession of excellent shaves with these blades.</li>
            <li>Although I prefer the Persona I won&#x27;t pay the amazon price without looking around a bit more first.</li>
            <li>These work great with my Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor.</li>
            <li>I find these blades give an excellent, smooth shave, in spite of the negative reviews others have posted.  </li>
            <li>but nothing special.</li>
            <li>Stainless steel blades most durable.</li>
            <li>They are one of only 2 or 3 blades that will give more than 3 multi-pass shaves and I get as many as 5 acceptably smooth shaves from one personna red/black blade.    </li>
            <li>They did not cut or nick but they also seemed to leave more stubble and not last more than a couple shaves.</li>
            <li>So I am still holding my expectations high for a good shave when I receive new blades.</li>
            <li>In particular, I find them much superior to Derby&#x27;s (many nicks and a sore face, no more, thanks) and somewhat better than the so-called \\&quot;DE blade to judge others by\\&quot;, Merkur.  </li>
            <li>I get a very close comfortable shave with them in all my de razors.</li>
            <li>The second shave with these blades is more comfortable than the first.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Kept clean and dry these razors do a nice job.    </li>
            <li>No one was more surprised to find this result with these blades.</li>
            <li>they went right in the trash</li>
            <li>I now simply draw the blade lightly through a cork before first use, and it has made these Personna blades much more consistent.    </li>
            <li>These blades look exactly like blades that I have been happy with in the past.  </li>
            <li>Other brands work a lot better for me!</li>
            <li>Much better blades out there for the same price.</li>
            <li>Much better than astras, derbys, or the personnas 100ct in the blue box.</li>
            <li>They can be had, for a much lower price ($1.99 /w free shipping) direct from Personna&#x27;s store.</li>
            <li>Razor blades are not high-profit items, so they&#x27;re likely available in your neighborhood right now for a price comparable to what Amazon is selling them for.  </li>
            <li>I had read some positive reviews, but do not buy these.</li>
            <li>Super Heavyweight Double Edge Safety Razor &amp; 5 Shark Super Chrome Blades]].  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used all of the most highly reviewed razor blades, Feather, Gillette silver blue, Astra SP, etc, etc.  </li>
            <li>the description of the page, it said a certain thing</li>
            <li>With that said, these may work just fine for you, but don&#x27;t expect them to work like the \\&quot;red label\\&quot; Israeli Personna&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I think this is a very high quality product and the blades</li>
            <li>Another trait I liked is since they are not exceedingly sharp (not much to dull)</li>
            <li>I would stick with sensor, atra,tracer,trac 2 or fusion instead for a closer more comfortable shave with hardly any cuts.</li>
            <li>and I think I&#x27;ve really perfected my technique.  </li>
            <li>These 3 feel noticeably sharper but for reasons I don&#x27;t understand they don&#x27;t give the same number of acceptably smooth shaves as the Personna Red/Black do.    </li>
            <li>Cheap, drug-store blades - not the Israeli-made Red Personna blades</li>
            <li>Only slightly better than shaving with a week old blade.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re okay too if you don&#x27;t mind a little scrape and an occasional nick but for a fast clean shave...</li>
            <li>If you buy anything less than a case of blades here, that can&#x27;t happen, and the cost of custom shipping is why you&#x27;ll pay more here</li>
            <li>Each razor/blade combination is likely to yield different resutls, but at the price these are worth a try, and the minimal extra effort involved in corking them before first use seems to make these bargain blades good perfomers.  </li>
            <li>Not super sharp but ideal for multiple passes.</li>
            <li>These blades weigh almost nothing in the back of a shipping truck, so your local drugstore can basically get them shipped to their stores for free if they add some to their normal weekly shipments.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this blade with &amp; without lather and usually use them for 10-14 single-pass shaves and found it very comfortable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Absolutely don&#x27;t buy these for your first double edge razor experience.  </li>
            <li>As for the blades, these Personnas are exactly the same as the blades you can pick up in your corner drugstore.  </li>
            <li>Beware that shipping is likely to be UPS, only a year&#x27;s supply is worth buying for the freight!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how the previous reviewers are using these blades, but my experience is that these particular blades in the red/black package with the grey 10 blade cartridge are very good razor blades.  </li>
            <li>When shaving the more coarse hair on my face, it feels like it is half way ripping at it.</li>
            <li>3-5 shaves with proper maintenance between shaves (keep it clean and dry).  </li>
            <li>I like the double edged razor but it is really almost out of date now.</li>
            <li>Been using the dbl-edge for nearly forty years.  </li>
            <li>First results were merely ok, with some seemingly random nicks and cuts.  </li>
            <li>than you would at your local drugstore for exactly the same blades.</li>
            <li>Yeah for my first time ever shaving with a de razor, these blades make it more uncomfortable than the Gillete Mach 3 blades I transitioned from.</li>
            <li>I am new to DE shaving and have only tried Wilkinson Sword blades and now these Personna&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Picked these up at the local Wal-Mart in order to try out my new Parker 89r DE razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure about the actual manufacturer, but I&#x27;m sure that I have used blades that came off of the same model of manufacturing</li>
            <li>They are priced similar to good ones but are very poor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read many reviews, and they claim its just a poor blade.</li>
            <li>I strongly disagree with the people who are saying these blades are no good.</li>

            <li> I strongly disagree with the people who are saying these blades are no good.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little pricey and take some practice because they&#x27;re so sharp, but once you master them they&#x27;re worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It may be technique or the razor used, but I certainly don&#x27;t agree with the  review average of less than 4 stars    12-20-2014...</li>
            <li> Only last me about 3 shaves, and isn&#x27;t really sharp -</li>
            <li> to ten shaves, although I must admit, I am rather young and therefore have a relatively thin, soft beard.</li>
            <li> this razor I only use now once in awhile because it dulls with only a few shaves and their are nicks and cuts with this double edged blade too.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s just not worth it when there are dozens of blades of similar quality at equivalent or lower prices.</li>
            <li> But relatively over-the average.</li>
            <li> The only other blades I&#x27;ve tried are Sharp and</li>
            <li> the first stroke, these blades tug awfully hard at the stubble; as hard as other blades that have been used multiple times.  </li>
            <li> Tried these blades when I made the switch from spendy multiblade cartidge$ to safety razor wet shaving.  </li>
            <li> Some come out to be rough edged and cause bleeding.</li>
            <li> They seem to have a moderate-sharp edge, closer to a Feather than to a Derby, but not quite as sharp as a feather.</li>
            <li> The edge stays sharp for a loooonnnng time.</li>
            <li> I only get one shave out of them before the are too dull to use.  </li>
            <li> they last at least 3-4 shaves.  </li>
            <li> I started using DE blades four months ago, after using a double blade cartridge razor for at least 20 years.  </li>
            <li> yea, that probably helps a little.  </li>
            <li> -the shipping was just shy of $20, driving the cost per blade into the realm of \\&quot;not worth it\\&quot; AFAIC.    </li>
            <li> Double edge blades are nearly impossible to find in stores.</li>
            <li> And some of the blades have imperfections that cause random nicks.  </li>
            <li> These are very poor quality blades.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>

            <li> Only slightly better than shaving with a week old blade.  Other brands work a lot better for me!</li>
            <li> These are very poor quality blades. I had read some positive reviews, but do not buy these. Go Feather or Merkur.</li>
            <li> I like the double edged razor but it is really almost out of date now. this is the kind of razor my father used when I was growing up. this razor I only use now once in awhile because it dulls with only a few shaves and their are nicks and cuts with this double edged blade too. I would stick with sensor, atra,tracer,trac 2 or fusion instead for a closer more comfortable shave with hardly any cuts. why shave with this blade when you dont have to anymore, when theires better blades on the market. So my review is only try double edge razor blades  once in awhile and stick with the BETTER sensor,etc the ones I mentioned earlier!thank you!</li>
            <li> Tried these blades when I made the switch from spendy multiblade cartidge$ to safety razor wet shaving.  First results were merely ok, with some seemingly random nicks and cuts.  I read at Badger and Blade that \\&quot;corking\\&quot; safety razor blades can remove any imperfections left on the edge by the manufacturer.  I now simply draw the blade lightly through a cork before first use, and it has made these Personna blades much more consistent.    Each razor/blade combination is likely to yield different resutls, but at the price these are worth a try, and the minimal extra effort involved in corking them before first use seems to make these bargain blades good perfomers.  Try &#x27;em, and if they work with your razor and technique, you&#x27;ll have an easy to find source of inexpensive blades.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;red&#x27; persona blades are just what I would call middle of the road. Only last me about 3 shaves, and isn&#x27;t really sharp - but it&#x27;s forgiving and doesn&#x27;t knick.  They can be had, for a much lower price ($1.99 /w free shipping) direct from Personna&#x27;s store.</li>
            <li> These blades look exactly like blades that I have been happy with in the past.  I&#x27;m not sure about the actual manufacturer, but I&#x27;m sure that I have used blades that came off of the same model of manufacturing machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the first stroke, these blades tug awfully hard at the stubble; as hard as other blades that have been used multiple times.  And some of the blades have imperfections that cause random nicks.  I tried \\&quot;corking\\&quot; as another reviewer recommended... yea, that probably helps a little.  The second shave with these blades is more comfortable than the first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely don&#x27;t buy these for your first double edge razor experience.  If you shave DE regularly and just want to see if you can get away with using the cheapest blades you can find... go for it, and try corking.  I don&#x27;t regret having tried these.  I get a week of shaving out of each one, even if it isn&#x27;t the smoothest.  It is the cheapest.</li>
            <li> Blades are OK, but not the price of shipping. I bought 5 packs (dispensers) for 12+ dollars-the shipping was just shy of $20, driving the cost per blade into the realm of \\&quot;not worth it\\&quot; AFAIC.    Caveat emptor.</li>
            <li> Note that these are not the \\&quot;red label\\&quot; Israeli Personna blades.  With that said, these may work just fine for you, but don&#x27;t expect them to work like the \\&quot;red label\\&quot; Israeli Personna&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I strongly disagree with the people who are saying these blades are no good. I think this is a very high quality product and the blades last 3-4 shaves on average-an acceptable lifespan for a DE blade. They&#x27;re also USA made, for those who like to support American jobs. Those who claim that these blades tear up their face must either be new to DE shaving or biased against \\&quot;common\\&quot; products they can buy locally, because every time I have bought Personna blades, I have had a succession of excellent shaves with these blades. Shaving with a safety razor must be learned, and mistakes will produce nicks and razor burn no matter what blade one uses.  As for the blades, these Personnas are exactly the same as the blades you can pick up in your corner drugstore.  Walgreens, CVS, Rite Aid and the like all sell these blades as their generic DE blades. Razor blades are not high-profit items, so they&#x27;re likely available in your neighborhood right now for a price comparable to what Amazon is selling them for.  The only difference is the shipping costs, and frankly, you&#x27;ll come out ahead if you shop local for this item. These blades weigh almost nothing in the back of a shipping truck, so your local drugstore can basically get them shipped to their stores for free if they add some to their normal weekly shipments. If you buy anything less than a case of blades here, that can&#x27;t happen, and the cost of custom shipping is why you&#x27;ll pay more here than you would at your local drugstore for exactly the same blades.</li>
            <li> These are the blades they sell at local drugstores.  They are priced similar to good ones but are very poor. I only get one shave out of them before the are too dull to use.  A good blade should go 3-5 shaves with proper maintenance between shaves (keep it clean and dry).  I would not order these and pay shipping.  Much better blades out there for the same price.</li>
            <li> These blades are some of my favorite. They seem to have a moderate-sharp edge, closer to a Feather than to a Derby, but not quite as sharp as a feather. The edge stays sharp for a loooonnnng time. These are certainly my most durable blade. I can get mine to last up to ten shaves, although I must admit, I am rather young and therefore have a relatively thin, soft beard. I definitely recommend giving these blades a try.</li>
            <li> It was not the same product as in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;In the description of the page, it said a certain thing but when it actually came, It wasn&#x27;t the same</li>
            <li> This is a smooth blade. Not super sharp but ideal for multiple passes. Another trait I liked is since they are not exceedingly sharp (not much to dull) they last at least 3-4 shaves.  These can be found in discount stores at times but I wouldn&#x27;t pay more than $.99+tax for a pack of 5. If you like these blades, go for bulk. Otherwise, it&#x27;s just not worth it when there are dozens of blades of similar quality at equivalent or lower prices.</li>
            <li> Been using the dbl-edge for nearly forty years.  Kept clean and dry these razors do a nice job.    Beware that shipping is likely to be UPS, only a year&#x27;s supply is worth buying for the freight!</li>
            <li> The package said &amp;#34;DOUBLE EDGE PLATINUM CHROME&amp;#34; . . .  but on the blade dispenser it said only  &amp;#34;STAINLESS STEEL BLADES&amp;#34;.  SO WHICH IS CORRECT  ???    (the former blade dispenser I had used said  . . . PLATINUM CHROME on the dispenser AS WELL AS ON THE PACKAGE.  PLEASE EXPLAIN the difference.</li>
            <li> I am new to DE shaving and have only tried Wilkinson Sword blades and now these Personna&#x27;s. I was very impressed with how sharp these Personna blades are; I had 3 days growth and they went through my beard very smooth and easy. I paid $2.99 at my local grocery store and the package says Made In Israel. I don&#x27;t know how many shaves I&#x27;ll get out of one razor blade, but these are definitely sharper than Wilkinson Swords.</li>
            <li> These are good razors. I find this pack to be a smoother shave than the 100-pack. I&#x27;ve used this blade with &amp; without lather and usually use them for 10-14 single-pass shaves and found it very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I find these blades give an excellent, smooth shave, in spite of the negative reviews others have posted.  In particular, I find them much superior to Derby&#x27;s (many nicks and a sore face, no more, thanks) and somewhat better than the so-called \\&quot;DE blade to judge others by\\&quot;, Merkur.  I started using DE blades four months ago, after using a double blade cartridge razor for at least 20 years.  I&#x27;m using a Merkur Futur razor and a nice badger brush and I think I&#x27;ve really perfected my technique.  These Personna are not the Israeli Personna blades, though they may well be made in the Personna Israel plant, but I don&#x27;t care.  Plus, they come in a great dispenser with a place for used blades.  They are cheap and excellent, and I&#x27;ll keep buying them.  I suppose which blades work best for any individual varies, but for my Irish face I&#x27;m very happy with these!</li>
            <li> The best blade for me. Much better than astras, derbys, or the personnas 100ct in the blue box. I get a very close comfortable shave with them in all my de razors. They last longer than the others too!</li>
            <li> I am convinced these are not the same blades as the individually wrapped red Personnas. I waited to write till after I used several packages. I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was getting them at Walmart for $1.67USD for ten. The last time I was there they had switched to Shick instead. They are sorta okay but not as smooth as the Persona. The only other blades I&#x27;ve tried are Sharp and the Merkurs that came with the razor. They&#x27;re okay too if you don&#x27;t mind a little scrape and an occasional nick but for a fast clean shave... I WANT MY PERSONAS BACK!! :)    Although I prefer the Persona I won&#x27;t pay the amazon price without looking around a bit more first. CVS or Walgreen maybe?</li>
            <li> Not perfect, but better than German blades - Yes I&#x27;d rather shave with a piece of brick rather than use Merkur or Wilkinson Sword. It doesn&#x27;t come as &amp;#34;platinum coated&amp;#34; as the picture suggests, but only as a &amp;#34;stainless steel&amp;#34;. It may last 3 to 5 shaves (3 passes each shave), depending on each blade. Some come out to be rough edged and cause bleeding. But relatively over-the average.</li>
            <li> These work great with my Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor.</li>
            <li> I rated these blades 5 stars after 2 blades but as I progressed through the pack the quality seemed to lessen. They did not cut or nick but they also seemed to leave more stubble and not last more than a couple shaves. I wanted my review to reflect that.</li>
            <li> Picked these up at the local Wal-Mart in order to try out my new Parker 89r DE razor. Yeah for my first time ever shaving with a de razor, these blades make it more uncomfortable than the Gillete Mach 3 blades I transitioned from. When shaving the more coarse hair on my face, it feels like it is half way ripping at it. I&#x27;ve read many reviews, and they claim its just a poor blade. So I am still holding my expectations high for a good shave when I receive new blades. I order the Derby Extra 100 pack, which I have read is very good. Check out \\&quot;The Badger &amp; Blade\\&quot; website for more reviews on these blades. I do not recommend them.    Badger &amp; Blade - [..]</li>
            <li> I picked these up at the 99cent only store and buy I can tell you they will rip and cut your face up. they went right in the trash</li>
            <li> For men who still use &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; safety razor. Double edge blades are nearly impossible to find in stores. Stainless steel blades most durable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how the previous reviewers are using these blades, but my experience is that these particular blades in the red/black package with the grey 10 blade cartridge are very good razor blades.  They are one of only 2 or 3 blades that will give more than 3 multi-pass shaves and I get as many as 5 acceptably smooth shaves from one personna red/black blade.    No one was more surprised to find this result with these blades. I&#x27;ve used all of the most highly reviewed razor blades, Feather, Gillette silver blue, Astra SP, etc, etc.  These 3 feel noticeably sharper but for reasons I don&#x27;t understand they don&#x27;t give the same number of acceptably smooth shaves as the Personna Red/Black do.    It may be technique or the razor used, but I certainly don&#x27;t agree with the  review average of less than 4 stars    12-20-2014... Update.  My experience is cemented regarding this blade. I just completed 10 acceptably smooth, acceptably close shaves with one of these blades in my Parker [[ASIN:B002OZJZ9G Parker 65R Super Heavyweight Double Edge Safety Razor &amp; 5 Shark Super Chrome Blades]].  This is my favorite razor with this blade.  It just can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Cheap, drug-store blades - not the Israeli-made Red Personna blades I thought I was getting. I took several strokes before throwing them in the garbage. Felt like I was shaving with sandpaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried about 20 different blades, and I recommend just buying Feathers.. They&#x27;re a little pricey and take some practice because they&#x27;re so sharp, but once you master them they&#x27;re worth every penny. After all, this is your face, life is short, and we&#x27;re talking about maybe 10 cents per shave. Buy the best blades and learn how to use them.</li>
            <li> The packages I got say &amp;#34;Blades Made in Israel. The blades themselves are OK but nothing special.</li>
