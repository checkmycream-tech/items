            <li>I would recomend to others I love the case it is very good quality from the pushers to the case they came with</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite impressed and really glad I had the opportunity to try these in exchange for an honest opinion and review.&lt;br</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;These arrived nicely packaged and in a really nice case!  </li>
            <li>When I was able to get this kit for a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased opinion I was beyond happy..</li>
            <li>I LOVE THESE!</li>
            <li>An excellent purchase, this product is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>They are amazing...</li>
            <li>This is a nice, sturdy kit that arrived promptly.</li>
            <li>I get pedicures every two weeks and to be honest I am leary of their tools..</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s Very Professional!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a Happy Camper!!</li>
            <li>we both stood there and gave ourselves the beginning of a really nice manicure!&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
            <li>nice tools for having manicure or pedicure at home.  </li>
            <li>Nice kit, but</li>
            <li>I would appreciate knowing the main purpose for each tool and how best to use it.  </li>
            <li>Great item for that special someone too..</li>
            <li>Love these...</li>
            <li>These are quality tools and work well, I just wish I understood how many of them are used.  </li>
            <li>The company itself could not be better.</li>
            <li>I love it... 5 stars from me...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure i&#x27;ll figure it out though.</li>
            <li>Those tools are doing job  almost ok, but not as well as my daughter tool.</li>
            <li>The quality seemed clean and durable, nicely produced.</li>
            <li>Very nice tools very professional grade</li>
            <li>This is a nice product worth the money.</li>
            <li>fast service, good product</li>
            <li>This is a very nice set and all the instruments seem to be high quality and well worth the price!</li>
            <li>is a great set at a reasonable price - very high quality :)</li>
            <li>The case makes it so you drop them in your purse on the way to the salon and are ready for your own tools to get yourself pampered...</li>
            <li>but when I did pick one to use it worked great on pushing back my cuticles.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous set.</li>
            <li>If instructions are available, and I can get them, I&#x27;d give this product a full five starts.</li>
            <li>Extraordinary and cheap.</li>
            <li>and right away could feel a huge difference between these and the cheaply made metal ones I&#x27;ve used before.&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
            <li>This is a grade a professional set to use in a salon or in the comfort of your own home.</li>
            <li>They come with a nice little carrying case, nice to keep everything away.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for to clean up my nails</li>
            <li>but I will have fun</li>
            <li>Hopefully they will last, and most importantly, won&#x27;t rust.</li>
            <li>It is an important job since manicurists are refusing now to cut cuticles properly, particularly when they are applying UV gel.</li>
            <li>first tried the cuticle pusher end</li>
            <li>I really just needed something better than an orange stick to push back my cuticles.</li>
            <li>This kit is high quality and well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Very well made with a substantial feel to them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This kit contains five stainless steel manicure tools and a leather storage/carrying case.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>works very well</li>
            <li>Honestly, I wasn&#x27;t expecting these to be anything terribly special and not much different than the metal cuticle pushers I&#x27;ve used in the past but didn&#x27;t care for...</li>
            <li>When I opened the case to inspect these, I was pretty surprised at what high quality they are.  </li>
            <li>They looked decent.</li>
            <li>As others have said, I wish that the name Equinox International wasn&#x27;t so prominent and big on the front of the case.</li>
            <li>they are heavy duty and very accurate</li>
            <li>HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>yet it just thick enough to push even the toughest cuticles back without pain or damage.&lt;br /&gt;It would have been nice to have some instructions with this set as I&#x27;m not quite sure yet how to use each of these tools</li>
            <li>Love how sturdy and heavy they are.</li>
            <li>i would love this product but twice it was sent missing one of the 5 pushers.  </li>
            <li>otherwise very nice but not worth the trouble.</li>
            <li>Not really sure how to use them all and the bottom pushers are all the same size (I was hoping they would be different sizes) but they are really sturdy and really nice for doing home mani/pedi stuff which is why I bought them in the first place.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>The only thing I would say is I wish the case didn&#x27;t have its name so large</li>
            <li>I needed a pedicure set that wasn&#x27;t expensive and this little set was absolutely perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li>do an amazing job of pushing back the cuticle without scraping the nail which is what I never liked about the ones I&#x27;ve tried before;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really are professional grade tools and should last a lifetime...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t do pedicures professionally, but I, myself, need a set of pushers and cleaners to use between professional sessions.</li>
            <li>it would be nicer if it came with an explanation of what each end is most commonly used for.</li>
            <li>UV gel attaches stronger, when the attachment surface is larger, thus I need to take care of my cuticle the old fashion way.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to keep acrylic nails clean</li>
            <li>My husband happened to walk by as I was first trying these out and grabbed one and began using it on his nails - he normally cuts his really thick cuticles - and said, &amp;#34;WOW!&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Not Cheaply Constructed!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Any hope that my kit was missing instructions, but the rest of you received them?  </li>
            <li> i returned it once and then reordered it for my daughter and hers was also missing one pusher.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m frustrated that I&#x27;m not able to use this purchase at maximum efficiency and safety.  </li>
            <li> I would have given this product five stars, but I was disappointed that the kit did not come with any instructions.  </li>

            <li> This kit is high quality and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I get pedicures every two weeks and to be honest I am leary of their tools.. When I was able to get this kit for a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased opinion I was beyond happy.. It came earlier than expected.. They are amazing... they are heavy duty and very accurate so whether you are going to use them yourself or take them with you to your mani/pedi they are perfect.. The case makes it so you drop them in your purse on the way to the salon and are ready for your own tools to get yourself pampered... Great item for that special someone too.. They are quality made... The only thing I would say is I wish the case didn&#x27;t have its name so large but that is little and truth with time might wear off... Love these...</li>
            <li> Nice set! Not really sure how to use them all and the bottom pushers are all the same size (I was hoping they would be different sizes) but they are really sturdy and really nice for doing home mani/pedi stuff which is why I bought them in the first place.</li>

I wish it would come with an ebook or instructions on how to use each utensil but when I did pick one to use it worked great on pushing back my cuticles. This set makes a great gift for a manicurist or a nail lover.</li>
            <li> I Can&#x27;t Say Enough on this product! Quality, &amp; is EXCEPTIONAL!! Not Cheaply Constructed!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s Very Professional!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a Happy Camper!!</li>

            <li> Great value!  Excellent tool quality and nice storage case.  All the tools are well balanced, and I like their longer length.  I would have given this product five stars, but I was disappointed that the kit did not come with any instructions.  I would appreciate knowing the main purpose for each tool and how best to use it.  I have not used two of the tools, because I don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re designed to do.  I&#x27;m frustrated that I&#x27;m not able to use this purchase at maximum efficiency and safety.  Any hope that my kit was missing instructions, but the rest of you received them?  If instructions are available, and I can get them, I&#x27;d give this product a full five starts.</li>
            <li> fast service, good product</li>
            <li> great product for the price</li>
            <li> Honestly, I wasn&#x27;t expecting these to be anything terribly special and not much different than the metal cuticle pushers I&#x27;ve used in the past but didn&#x27;t care for...&lt;br /&gt;These arrived nicely packaged and in a really nice case!  When I opened the case to inspect these, I was pretty surprised at what high quality they are.  Very well made with a substantial feel to them.&lt;br /&gt;I first tried the cuticle pusher end and right away could feel a huge difference between these and the cheaply made metal ones I&#x27;ve used before.&lt;br /&gt;These do an amazing job of pushing back the cuticle without scraping the nail which is what I never liked about the ones I&#x27;ve tried before;&lt;br /&gt;They are tapered at the edge so it protects your nail bed yet it just thick enough to push even the toughest cuticles back without pain or damage.&lt;br /&gt;It would have been nice to have some instructions with this set as I&#x27;m not quite sure yet how to use each of these tools but I will have fun experimenting.&lt;br /&gt;Right away, I tossed out the orangewood stick I had been using and wished I&#x27;d found THESE sooner!  My husband happened to walk by as I was first trying these out and grabbed one and began using it on his nails - he normally cuts his really thick cuticles - and said, &amp;#34;WOW!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;So we both stood there and gave ourselves the beginning of a really nice manicure!&lt;br /&gt;These really are professional grade tools and should last a lifetime...I&#x27;m quite impressed and really glad I had the opportunity to try these in exchange for an honest opinion and review.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great set at a reasonable price - very high quality :)&lt;br /&gt;Hope this info was helpful!&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!!</li>
            <li> WOW! I LOVE THESE! HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ITEM! This is a grade A kit and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Extraordinary and cheap.</li>
            <li> nice tools for having manicure or pedicure at home.  I love it!!!</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my wife, family. They looked decent. The quality seemed clean and durable, nicely produced. Hopefully they will last, and most importantly, won&#x27;t rust. They come with a nice little carrying case, nice to keep everything away.</li>
            <li> Thank you, I am very happy with the cuticle set.</li>
            <li> I needed a pedicure set that wasn&#x27;t expensive and this little set was absolutely perfect for my needs. I&#x27;m trying to cut down on my manicure and pedicure costs and this has helped made my nails look like a professional has done them. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> ...with this set of nail-maintenance tools. An excellent purchase, this product is exactly as advertised. The pieces are made of surgical steel, so they feel substantial in your hand, and will stand up to just about anything you throw at them. The cuticle pushers come in a variety of sizes. The other end of each piece have a different tool for cleaning and maintaining the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there was an improvement to be made, it would be the inclusion of an explanation of best use for each tool included in the set, for those who may not know what they&#x27;re for or how to use them. It&#x27;s fairly simple to figure it out, though, so it doesn&#x27;t detract from the usefulness of the product.</li>
            <li> This kit contains five stainless steel manicure tools and a leather storage/carrying case. The set seems to be very good quality and, with the leather case, would make a very nice gift.</li>
            <li> Great item...great price..fast shipping</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous set. The seller is wonderful!</li>
            <li> Love how sturdy and heavy they are. Great quality</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for to clean up my nails and it works beautifully.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to keep acrylic nails clean this is perfect.</li>
            <li> Great value and quality.  Fast shipping. Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Seems to be excellent quality. As others have said, I wish that the name Equinox International wasn&#x27;t so prominent and big on the front of the case. I see absolutely no need for it. And, as others have mentioned, there is no info on the purpose of each tool or how to use them. That said, I am happy with the set.</li>
            <li> helps keep my cuticles on fleek! I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> works very well I would recomend to others I love the case it is very good quality from the pushers to the case they came with</li>
            <li> i would love this product but twice it was sent missing one of the 5 pushers.  i returned it once and then reordered it for my daughter and hers was also missing one pusher.  otherwise very nice but not worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> Nice kit, but it would be nicer if it came with an explanation of what each end is most commonly used for. The cuticle pushers are a no-brainer, but a couple of the other ends I&#x27;m not sure of. I&#x27;m sure i&#x27;ll figure it out though.</li>
            <li> Very nice tools very professional grade</li>
            <li> I bought this set since my daughter has one piece similar to those and it is doing the job of pushing cuticles well. It is an important job since manicurists are refusing now to cut cuticles properly, particularly when they are applying UV gel. UV gel attaches stronger, when the attachment surface is larger, thus I need to take care of my cuticle the old fashion way. Those tools are doing job  almost ok, but not as well as my daughter tool. They seems to be a bit thicker.  This might be a reason.</li>
