            <li>sure why it&#x27;s called what it is...</li>
            <li>I RECOMMEND OPI! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>This is my favorite OPI color ever.</li>
            <li>, they took care of it and just a couple of days later, the correct bottle was at my door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truly one of the best reds I&#x27;ve ever tried</li>
            <li>--I don&#x27;t polish my fingernails often, but love it on my toes.  </li>
            <li>Love this color.</li>
            <li>My favorite nail color.</li>
            <li>people claim this is a universal red suited for all skin tones but best for fair skin...</li>
            <li>OPI is a very good polish, but I was wanting a true red.  </li>
            <li>Super pleased.</li>
            <li>OPI isnt available in my area, there website is faulty</li>
            <li>I originally ordered &amp;#34;Waitress&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>If you love red you will love this color.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you Altima Beauty and for your quick service.  </li>
            <li>My ultimate favorite color!</li>
            <li>This is one of my two favorite colors, along with Affair in Red Square.</li>
            <li>as it&#x27;s my favorite red and received another one by accident.  </li>
            <li>It has been written up repeatedly in magazines as a very unique red--reminds me of the shiny candy apple red you seen on vintage cars.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In a bright light setting it looks exactly like the picture, but neutral lighting is a dark red.</li>
            <li>i started getting into reds last year and didnt realize how becoming certain reds look on me.</li>
            <li>only 2 quick drying coats for full coverage without any bald spots, streaks or brush strokes and VERY shiny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I have worn nail polish since the day I found out what it was.&lt;br /&gt;Any brand from low end to high end, and OPI is my favorite.</li>
            <li>i have very long nails and love polish...</li>
            <li>Great for year round red.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Not Really A Waitress&amp;#34; seems, by the picture, more of the color I got.  </li>
            <li>im very fussy with any color family.</li>
            <li>FOR REAL THIS STUFF IS KILLER.</li>
            <li>but this is a lovely deep red.</li>
            <li>The brush is a little full and delivers a bit too much polish to put on easily and without needing to go back and remove excess on the sides.</li>
            <li>in high school--wow...getting so old....</li>
            <li>it came out super dark on me</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is one of my two favorite colors, along with Affair in Red Square.</li>
            <li> OPI is a very good polish, but I was wanting a true red.  This color is a darker color than I wanted.  The brush is a little full and delivers a bit too much polish to put on easily and without needing to go back and remove excess on the sides.</li>
            <li> Awesome color....although I think this title was a pink color before....and was hoping to find that but this is a lovely deep red. If you love red you will love this color.</li>
            <li> While the brand is excellent and the seller delivered promptly and undamaged, it is definitely not the color represented.  Based on other reviewers I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the batch or warehouse in which it comes from.  Some reviewers stated it was definitely red.  While others say it was nothing like the picture.  I took a chance and hoped mine would be red.  Nope, it is the dark burgundy one.  Almost leaning on a little purple.  Update:  I noticed there are two of these &amp;#34;I&#x27;m not really a waitress&amp;#34;.  The one &amp;#34;OPI H08 I&#x27;m Not Really A Waitress&amp;#34; seems, by the picture, more of the color I got.  Mine is very dark leaning toward &amp;#34;wine&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> nice color on toe nails</li>
            <li> i started getting into reds last year and didnt realize how becoming certain reds look on me. i have very long nails and love polish...the bolder the better. im very fussy with any color family. sometimes i dont like the shade the 1st time i use it so i put it away and try it later. this was the case with this one...i thought it had a brick tone to it. but i was wearing a diff shade of red on all 10 nails. when i used this on all my nails i loved it. only 2 quick drying coats for full coverage without any bald spots, streaks or brush strokes and VERY shiny. it came out super dark on me and i could detect a hint of berry and even purple. people claim this is a universal red suited for all skin tones but best for fair skin...i agree with the lite skin part. doesnt have lots of shimmer but enuf to please me. im glad i asked owners on this to describe the color and ended ordering 2. OPI isnt available in my area, there website is faulty n they dont have a contact # so its hard to select shades.&lt;br /&gt;other reds i own and like....most are cooltoned, a few neutral n classic&lt;br /&gt;CHINA GLAZE;&lt;br /&gt;vertical rush&lt;br /&gt;thunderbird&lt;br /&gt;just be claus&lt;br /&gt;ruby pumps&lt;br /&gt;COLOR CLUB;&lt;br /&gt;berry and bright&lt;br /&gt;velvet rope</li>
            <li> My ultimate favorite color!</li>
            <li> Love, love, LOVE IT.  Quick service, good price.  HAPPY CAMPER!</li>
            <li> Perfect color for the holiday season!</li>
            <li> OPI is my go to brand and love this color. In a bright light setting it looks exactly like the picture, but neutral lighting is a dark red. Either way I&#x27;m happy with it perfect color for Christmas.</li>
            <li> lol, title????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure why it&#x27;s called what it is...or maybe I do I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I have worn nail polish since the day I found out what it was.&lt;br /&gt;Any brand from low end to high end, and OPI is my favorite. But out&lt;br /&gt;of all of their numerous shades/colors/wordtoyamothasillyphrasesandtitledcolors to&lt;br /&gt;choose from, this has hands down always been my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back in high school--wow...getting so old.... this was my &amp;#34;go to shade.&amp;#34; Every&lt;br /&gt;homecoming/ random dance/ prom- you name it: French Acrylics and PERFECTLY&lt;br /&gt;POLISHED I&#x27;M NOT REALLY A WAITRESS TOES. Cuz who doesn&#x27;t want to&lt;br /&gt;feel like a waitress FINALLY ON BREAK when they are out and about? ha ha. Maybe&lt;br /&gt;that was the idea behind the name? ... 0.0&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to those with nails.&lt;br /&gt;Preferably of the female variety, but I do not hate.&lt;br /&gt;Technically, boys 0.0 you are not really a waitress now, are you 0.o&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ahem... waiter ... HOST ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay next review to procrastinate doing homework and then CRUNCH TIME.&lt;br /&gt;BUT FOR REAL THIS STUFF IS KILLER. Likely the ONLY POLISH I have&lt;br /&gt;EVER USED in its ENTIRETY before it turned to jelly, oil, and some olive sparkly&lt;br /&gt;colored rock; or just plain wouldn&#x27;t stick on the nail...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another + : It LASTS! But of course, always use a TOP COAT! I RECOMMEND OPI! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Perfect color. Opinion quality cannot be beat. Polosh is perfect consistency and coverage in two coats. Great for year round red. Arrived on time in small package, not over sized box. Super pleased.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re Not Really a Waitress, then what do you do? This is my favorite OPI color ever. It&#x27;s very sexy. I think she&#x27;s a naughty librarian.</li>
            <li> GREAT customer service with Altima Beauty.  I originally ordered &amp;#34;Waitress&amp;#34; as it&#x27;s my favorite red and received another one by accident.  I inquired about it and no questions asked, they took care of it and just a couple of days later, the correct bottle was at my door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truly one of the best reds I&#x27;ve ever tried--I don&#x27;t polish my fingernails often, but love it on my toes.  It has been written up repeatedly in magazines as a very unique red--reminds me of the shiny candy apple red you seen on vintage cars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Altima Beauty and for your quick service.  Will definitely be a repeat buyer and recommend you.</li>
            <li> Love this color. Great quality nail polish.</li>
            <li> My favorite nail color.</li>
