            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>and I did my own,  </li>
            <li>I wanted to see how well the product worked on its own.  </li>
            <li>Nice product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to apply, just follow the instructions and wait 3 days to wash.</li>
            <li>Coudl be better.</li>
            <li>If you choose to use it, make sure you get none on your skin...</li>
            <li>~More</li>
            <li>I had color applied on top of to cover them....</li>
            <li>and I love the way my hair looks and feels.</li>
            <li>I would love to get a Brazilian Blowout at the salon, but I don&#x27;t have $300+ to drop on that at the moment.  </li>
            <li>won&#x27;t give it more than two stars because it had some cons....</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was okay, but i wouldnt buy it again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used the product and I am satisfied with my results.</li>
            <li>I love this pruductc</li>
            <li>my hair looks more shine</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more sleek, easier to comb, brighter...</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a good hour right there that I spend on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty good</li>
            <li>I will use this product as long as it&#x27;s available the best!</li>
            <li>The kit and instructions were easy to follow</li>
            <li>, if you aren&#x27;t great at doing your hair, then make sure you have help to section and get the back.  </li>
            <li>But now that I have a feel for it, It&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li>If you are thinking of purchasing this product, first make sure you read the directions from top TO BOTTOM before applying it.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair and had highlights done about 6 months ago which</li>
            <li>This was a great product for my 13 yr old that has super kinky curls -</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great product and I am going to start using it regularly.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t washed it yet, but it looks good so far.  </li>
            <li>Loved how soft and silky my hair felt.</li>
            <li>Worth it in the end!</li>
            <li>Brazilian women have been using formol on their blow dries for a good 10 years now and ANVISA (the Brazilian agency that regulates formol&#x27;s use on beauty products) actually allows some to be used.</li>
            <li>The latter takes me a good chunk of time.  </li>
            <li>It last me good 4 months.</li>
            <li>I love the pin straight effect after the three day wait time.</li>
            <li>dont think my pictures can do it full justice, looking in the mirror</li>
            <li>Someone said wear a facemask, not a bad idea when you are doing it around your face, the steam gets all up in your business.  </li>
            <li>But you&#x27;ll require sulfate free shampoo and conditioner once the kit bottles run out (try L&#x27;Oréal sulfate free shampoo and conditioner) rather than something your hair stylist tries selling for much more $$.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!</li>
            <li>When I ran across this product, I thought, &amp;#34;why not?&amp;#34;  This product was not hard to use and I&#x27;m sure it gets easier with experience.</li>
            <li>she just had more relaxed  soft curls</li>
            <li>I had to keep leaving the room to get some fresh air.  </li>
            <li>the results are worth it</li>
            <li>I followed all the instruction but straight hair, still, very soft, so, it&#x27;s ok.....</li>
            <li>Pros: really tames frizzy hair and has the straight, smooth effect of a Brazilian blowout.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>second of all; i didn&#x27;t really get an amazing result...</li>
            <li>Make sure to follow those instructions and definitely use a face mask.  </li>
            <li>I left a bit on still because I wanted to make sure my hair was thoroughly coated.  </li>
            <li>The first couple of times I used it</li>
            <li>I totally, totally, totally... LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>It was my first time</li>
            <li>I just washed my hair this morning for the first time after waiting the 3 days.  </li>
            <li>I bought a flat iron from walmart, john freida, it has titanium coated plates, I read a review on here that said be sure to use titanium.  </li>
            <li>If your hair is relatively straight, leave it alone, because this product actually caused more damage to my hair by trying to gently comb/pick/brush it with the product in.  </li>
            <li>I was able to blow dry and in 5 minutes and it&#x27;s shinier and healthier looking than it has ever been.</li>
            <li>the new year, I would like to hit the gym a bit more, but that would mean washing my hair more often</li>
            <li>easy to use,dried my hair with my fingers during the treatment, then used flat iron to seal in product,  took @</li>
            <li>Very toxic.&lt;br /&gt;Takes about three hours when you do it yourself.</li>
            <li>I have very wavy hair</li>
            <li>My granddaughter hair is wavy,calm her hair,so it looks so much healthier</li>
            <li>delivery was fast though...</li>
            <li>and I yearn for straight hair.</li>
            <li>I used a standing fan the whole time I was doing it.  </li>
            <li>I also watched a video on youtube about how to do the whole procedure as well.  </li>
            <li>I burned my fingers so much from the heat in my hair.</li>
            <li>Right now its baby soft and has a bit of sheen to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But most importantly - it dried almost completely straight!  </li>
            <li>This could be avoided all together if you&#x27;re really good at applying this to your hair while traveling down the street at high speed to maintain a constant flow of oxygen to avoid gasping.(I&#x27;m not exaggerating)</li>
            <li>However, formol leaves your hair shiny and pretty… for the first years, after a while it completely destroys your hair.</li>
            <li>OK Girls, if you are of mixed races and have difficulty getting all your hair to do the same thing, this is a life saver.  </li>
            <li>I can normally either wear my hair curly (which I prefer to not do) or I can straighten it and/or curl it.  </li>
            <li>I normally straighten my hair before allowing pictures.  </li>
            <li>Leaves you very soft.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>this works really well, but you need to have the fan and windows open when applying this</li>
            <li>Somehow manage to have a mask on that allows you to escape the fumes from drowning out your respiratory system through the entire process beginning with the very start of the application, which of course will not stop you from blood shot and severely burning (Not stinging....BURNING) eyes while it&#x27;s being applied in front of a high powered fan OUTSIDE.  </li>
            <li>After it&#x27;s applied, count very much on not being able to move a (comb, brush, pick) through your hair as it merely has the texture of waxy honey comb all over after the process is completed.</li>
            <li>He trimmed my hair and once I got all of my dead ends off,  all of my blowout is pretty much gone.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s 90% back to my normal hair.</li>
            <li>The directions are very clear and specific and say to use the product in a well ventilated area.  </li>
            <li>will this product be effective on coarse thick and dry hair??</li>
            <li>so I only had one that had a low and high heat setting.  </li>
            <li>I dont normally blow dry my hair</li>
            <li>My normal routine would be to let it air dry, then straighten with a flat iron.  </li>
            <li>it was hard doing my own because it&#x27;s hard to see what you are doing.  </li>

            <li> it was hard doing my own because it&#x27;s hard to see what you are doing.  </li>
            <li> have super long thick hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll come back after a month or two to change it to 5 stars or 3 stars depending on how long the results last.  </li>
            <li> If you have long, thick hair you may want to buy two, especially for the first application.</li>
            <li> After reading these other reviews I expected it to actually work, but it&#x27;s a whole lot of work for little</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve included pictures of me before and after, the before picture is a little old cause</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to leave Amazon reviews because I&#x27;m busy and usually don&#x27;t feel compelled enough to do it.  </li>
            <li> I received my kit earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> , it took a long time.  </li>
            <li> My hair is no where near the pictures, but I can blow dry it and straighten it a little faster than before.</li>
            <li> Because I have so much hair, it&#x27;s at least 20-30 minutes to blow dry it</li>
            <li> My hair is so frizzy that I could not even blow dry it.  </li>
            <li> Not pleased for the small bottles for the high price!!</li>
            <li> The keratin treatment didnt smell too bad, it was a lot easier to apply than I had imagined, I thought it would be more goupy.  </li>
            <li> Be careful on using it a lot as it will be bad for your hair after many uses.</li>
            <li> This product partially worked for me.  </li>
            <li> Burning and extreme irritation/numbness.</li>
            <li> I had an appointment to get a keratin treatment in the salon but had to cancel due to my kids activities.</li>
            <li> 1 1/2 hrs from beginning to end, then after 3 days washed hair , finger dried, then flat ironed in less than 5 minutes</li>
            <li> : The fumes that come out when you blow dry and straighten your hair during the treatment are harsh and will burn your eyes.</li>
            <li> The amount of product in my hair made it hard to get dry with a blow dryer and made straightening take longer than I believe</li>
            <li> My hair dried quicker than it ever has and with SO much less frizz.  </li>
            <li> No it didn&#x27;t work on my hair, it lasted just a few hours</li>
            <li> After this treatment it would have air dried wavy.</li>
            <li> The after picture is air dried, no product at all, just the included shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> So I cant really say if a small dose is actually bad for your health, but I imagine if it was it wouldn&#x27;t be allowed by ANVISA.</li>
            <li> and it was even difficult for me in the back..</li>
            <li> Past dilivery..</li>
            <li> Super disappointed!!!!</li>
            <li> I followed the directions, but didn&#x27;t realize when they instruct the user to remove excess product - they mean all excess!  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use, because the brand looks fake</li>
            <li> This one sucks :(.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;First of all; you have to leave it in for tree days, and it stinks!</li>
            <li> agreed that it was crap.</li>

            <li> It works but not the 6 months that ir says.</li>
            <li> Not pleased for the small bottles for the high price!! Will not order anymore!!</li>
            <li> Don´t ever try with other products, this is just the best of the best and I will definitely purchase this again in the future. I kit for a hole year, I applied the product every three or four months. It is just great!!!!</li>
            <li> This was a great product for my 13 yr old that has super kinky curls - she just had more relaxed  soft curls</li>
            <li> Coudl be better. I followed all the instruction but straight hair, still, very soft, so, it&#x27;s ok.....</li>
            <li> Works great for my daughters course hair. If you have long, thick hair you may want to buy two, especially for the first application.</li>
            <li> Awesome!  I loved. Very good product.</li>
            <li> Pros: really tames frizzy hair and has the straight, smooth effect of a Brazilian blowout.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The fumes that come out when you blow dry and straighten your hair during the treatment are harsh and will burn your eyes. Very toxic.&lt;br /&gt;Takes about three hours when you do it yourself.</li>
            <li> If you are thinking of purchasing this product, first make sure you read the directions from top TO BOTTOM before applying it. If your hair is relatively straight, leave it alone, because this product actually caused more damage to my hair by trying to gently comb/pick/brush it with the product in.  If you choose to use it, make sure you get none on your skin...anywhere! Two things will happen here. Burning and extreme irritation/numbness. Somehow manage to have a mask on that allows you to escape the fumes from drowning out your respiratory system through the entire process beginning with the very start of the application, which of course will not stop you from blood shot and severely burning (Not stinging....BURNING) eyes while it&#x27;s being applied in front of a high powered fan OUTSIDE.  This could be avoided all together if you&#x27;re really good at applying this to your hair while traveling down the street at high speed to maintain a constant flow of oxygen to avoid gasping.(I&#x27;m not exaggerating) After it&#x27;s applied, count very much on not being able to move a (comb, brush, pick) through your hair as it merely has the texture of waxy honey comb all over after the process is completed. By the time your hair is done being fried by the hair dyer and the straightener, it will look a bit calmer, however, when the wind blows, count on ALL of your hair strands to move as one unit!  ~More power to you.</li>
            <li> This product does not work for me.</li>
            <li> Its good i hace 3 week i did it and my hair look great ...and my hair is no breaking or falling</li>
            <li> This product partially worked for me.  My hair is so frizzy that I could not even blow dry it.  My normal routine would be to let it air dry, then straighten with a flat iron.  The directions are very clear and specific and say to use the product in a well ventilated area.  Make sure to follow those instructions and definitely use a face mask.  I will say that the actual straightening product burned my eyes.  I had to keep leaving the room to get some fresh air.  My hair is no where near the pictures, but I can blow dry it and straighten it a little faster than before.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use, because the brand looks fake</li>
            <li> Exelent. The best thing I&#x27;ve ever tried! Recommend!!!</li>
            <li> THIS MAKES MY HAIR FILL GOOD.</li>
            <li> No it didn&#x27;t work on my hair, it lasted just a few hours</li>
            <li> I NEVER write reviews, but I feel that this product warrants a great one! I have baby fine hair and had highlights done about 6 months ago which I had color applied on top of to cover them.... I didn&#x27;t like the highlights. I had an appointment to get a keratin treatment in the salon but had to cancel due to my kids activities. I was tentative to use this, but saw that it had received great reviews. I absolutely love it! It&#x27;s very easy to apply, just follow the instructions and wait 3 days to wash. I just washed it this morning and am amazed with the results. I have naturally curly hair. After this treatment it would have air dried wavy. I was able to blow dry and in 5 minutes and it&#x27;s shinier and healthier looking than it has ever been.</li>
            <li> I received my kit earlier than expected. The kit and instructions were easy to follow and I love the way my hair looks and feels. My Hair Stylist wanted to charge me 150$ for the Brazilian  Blowout Lol! She just lost a Client! I will use this product as long as it&#x27;s available the best!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t washed it yet, but it looks good so far.  I did my moms and I did my own,  it was hard doing my own because it&#x27;s hard to see what you are doing.  I don&#x27;t know if you didn&#x27;t have luck with this product maybe this video will help.  It could have simply been that you didn&#x27;t apply enough heat to your hair.  http://moroccankeratin.com/index.php/instructions-for-moroccan-keratin-treatments.html&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it doesn&#x27;t last after I was my hair then I will revise the review but it feels and looks similar to the keratin treatments I have gotten in the salon</li>
            <li> Super disappointed!!!! After reading these other reviews I expected it to actually work, but it&#x27;s a whole lot of work for little results.&lt;br /&gt;The first week my hair looked great and I was very happy with it,  but now on week 3 and it&#x27;s 90% back to my normal hair. So I went into my hair dresser, who is amazing and knows A LOT. Bette Middler&#x27;s was the client before me.... he&#x27;s that good.&lt;br /&gt;He agreed that it was crap. He trimmed my hair and once I got all of my dead ends off,  all of my blowout is pretty much gone.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to write this because these reviews make it sound so wonderful,  but you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you aren&#x27;t great at doing your hair, then make sure you have help to section and get the back.  I&#x27;m pretty good and it was even difficult for me in the back.. hope this helps.  I&#x27;m now looking for another one to try. This one sucks :(.</li>
            <li> Being Brazilian myself, and knowing quite a lot about blow dries, I can say this: if it smokes a lot and the smoke burns your eyes and gives you a sore throat, there is FORMOLDEHYDE on the composition. Brazilian women have been using formol on their blow dries for a good 10 years now and ANVISA (the Brazilian agency that regulates formol&#x27;s use on beauty products) actually allows some to be used. So I cant really say if a small dose is actually bad for your health, but I imagine if it was it wouldn&#x27;t be allowed by ANVISA. However, formol leaves your hair shiny and pretty… for the first years, after a while it completely destroys your hair. Be careful on using it a lot as it will be bad for your hair after many uses.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to leave Amazon reviews because I&#x27;m busy and usually don&#x27;t feel compelled enough to do it.  However, this product is amazing and I HAVE to leave a review.  I have very wavy hair and I have a lot of it.  I can normally either wear my hair curly (which I prefer to not do) or I can straighten it and/or curl it.  The latter takes me a good chunk of time.  Because I have so much hair, it&#x27;s at least 20-30 minutes to blow dry it and then about 20-30 minutes to straighten and/or curl it.  That&#x27;s a good hour right there that I spend on my hair.  I usually only wash my hair every 2-3 days for this reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the new year, I would like to hit the gym a bit more, but that would mean washing my hair more often and I just dread having to do my hair.  I would love to get a Brazilian Blowout at the salon, but I don&#x27;t have $300+ to drop on that at the moment.  When I ran across this product, I thought, &amp;#34;why not?&amp;#34;  This product was not hard to use and I&#x27;m sure it gets easier with experience. I followed the directions, but didn&#x27;t realize when they instruct the user to remove excess product - they mean all excess!  I left a bit on still because I wanted to make sure my hair was thoroughly coated.  The amount of product in my hair made it hard to get dry with a blow dryer and made straightening take longer than I believe it should have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For three days after doing the treatment, I did not wash my hair (according to the instructions).  On day 3, I finally washed my hair, got out of the shower, and did NOTHING to it.  I wanted to see how well the product worked on its own.  My hair dried quicker than it ever has and with SO much less frizz.  But most importantly - it dried almost completely straight!  Of course there are pieces here and there with a whisper of a wave, but I could literally leave the house with my hair like this and feel cute!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product and I am going to start using it regularly.  It&#x27;s one day of work every 3-4 months that will prevent me from having to spend countless hours on my hair in the meantime.  Now I have no excuses to not go to the gym!ry 3-4 months that will prevent me from having to spend countless hours on my hair in the meantime.  Now I have no excuses to not go to the gym!</li>
            <li> My granddaughter hair is wavy,calm her hair,so it looks so much healthier</li>
            <li> will this product be effective on coarse thick and dry hair??</li>
            <li> This product was allright.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t give it more than two stars because it had some cons....&lt;br /&gt;First of all; you have to leave it in for tree days, and it stinks! second of all; i didn&#x27;t really get an amazing result...&lt;br /&gt;It was okay, but i wouldnt buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was fast though...</li>
            <li> OK Girls, if you are of mixed races and have difficulty getting all your hair to do the same thing, this is a life saver.  All it does is coat your hair with Keratin, which is what hair is made of.  Uniforms the hair so you can do anything you want with your hair.  The first couple of times I used it, it took a long time.  But now that I have a feel for it, It&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy about the result. And I will keep buying this often.</li>
            <li> Loved how soft and silky my hair felt.</li>
            <li> I used the product and I am satisfied with my results. It last me good 4 months. I love it!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, leave hair shiny and without waves. The price is unbeatable. I have used it for two years now, obtaining the same result.  Watch out for this specific trademark.</li>
            <li> I love this pruductc my hair looks more shine</li>
            <li> I totally, totally, totally... LOVE this product. Like you don&#x27;t understand!! Cero frizz,  my hair it&#x27;s more sleek, easier to comb, brighter... It was my first time but I should have done it before!!</li>
            <li> Have used this product 2x no and on my third soon. I love the pin straight effect after the three day wait time. I have frizzy curly hair and I yearn for straight hair. I refuse to pay $500 by a salon expert, but rather have a friend do this 3 hour process for me. Worth it in the end! Do not come in contact with water during the three day wait time before rinsing. No hair clips either. This sample kit is only for one use from personal experience.  You&#x27;ll end up with left over clarifying shampoo. But you&#x27;ll require sulfate free shampoo and conditioner once the kit bottles run out (try L&#x27;Oréal sulfate free shampoo and conditioner) rather than something your hair stylist tries selling for much more $$.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!</li>
            <li> this works really well, but you need to have the fan and windows open when applying this, it made my eyes tear.but the results are worth it</li>
            <li> Past dilivery.. Nice product</li>
            <li> I started monday afternoon and today is friday.  I just washed my hair this morning for the first time after waiting the 3 days.  I am delightfully impressed.  I&#x27;ll come back after a month or two to change it to 5 stars or 3 stars depending on how long the results last.  I&#x27;ve included pictures of me before and after, the before picture is a little old cause I normally straighten my hair before allowing pictures.  The after picture is air dried, no product at all, just the included shampoo and conditioner.  Right now its baby soft and has a bit of sheen to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have super long thick hair so the process took from 1:30 pm to about 6 pm.  I dont normally blow dry my hair so I only had one that had a low and high heat setting.  I used low, since there was no medium, probably made it take longer. I bought a flat iron from walmart, john freida, it has titanium coated plates, I read a review on here that said be sure to use titanium.  The keratin treatment didnt smell too bad, it was a lot easier to apply than I had imagined, I thought it would be more goupy.  Someone said wear a facemask, not a bad idea when you are doing it around your face, the steam gets all up in your business.  I used a standing fan the whole time I was doing it.  I also watched a video on youtube about how to do the whole procedure as well.  After all was said and done my arms were so sore and my thumbs hurt from burns for about a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont think my pictures can do it full justice, looking in the mirror it dont look that wavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have one suggestion:  get a styling glove.  I burned my fingers so much from the heat in my hair.</li>
            <li> easy to use,dried my hair with my fingers during the treatment, then used flat iron to seal in product,  took @ 1 1/2 hrs from beginning to end, then after 3 days washed hair , finger dried, then flat ironed in less than 5 minutes, hair looks great!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. Leaves you very soft.</li>
