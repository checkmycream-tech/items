            <li>serum seems to be good at oil control like a toner.</li>
            <li>While it does a good job with improving tone, the sun will reverse those effects if you do not keep your skin protected.</li>
            <li>I loved that the scent wasn&#x27;t overpowering, and the bottle lasted me quite a while.</li>
            <li>Good job with portion control</li>

            <li>The vitamins in this are ideal for promoting skin cell turnover and diminishing free radical damage</li>
            <li>I like the look of the bottle - it&#x27;s very elegant -</li>
            <li>It feels good on the skin and smells nice.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this Adeline Hyaluronic Acid Serum for 10 days, and I love it!</li>
            <li>It turns out that hyaluronic acid is a great way to overcome mild acne!</li>
            <li>It smelled lightly of peppermint and was a great wake</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It has a light texture to it and goes on so great.  </li>
            <li>my own</li>
            <li>I was given this product for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>; I received a product sample to facilitate my review however the opinions expressed here are my own.</li>
            <li>So it was a treat to try something so popular.</li>
            <li>Two pumps and a nice thicker cream came out.</li>
            <li>product was provided at no cost for an honest product review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>…their customer service has been incredible…I own my own business and am quite picky about cost.</li>
            <li>I was intrigued and how effective this serum would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All opinions expressed are still 100% my own.</li>
            <li>This serum combines Hyaluronic acid, Vitamin C, D, and E, Witch Hazel, and Aloe for a nice combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used it and gave it my honest thoughts.</li>
            <li>Really nice skin care product.  </li>
            <li>I applied moisturizer over it and liked how it felt.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really loving this product.</li>
            <li>It is best to pat the face (or hands - or both) gently to enhance the [penetration into the skin.</li>
            <li>Felt nice after using and observed no side effects.</li>
            <li>That is also nice to hear so it must be working.</li>
            <li>nice texture ...</li>
            <li>It does not burn, but has a nice cooling sensation.  </li>
            <li>, kind of like it is going to break out in a rash.</li>
            <li>The opinions I have expressed are my own.</li>
            <li>MY OWN THOUGHT</li>
            <li>My opinions are 100% honest and my own.</li>
            <li>It works wonderful and quickly to remove the fine lines around my lips, I am a smoker.</li>
            <li>I was truly impressed by all 3 of these products, and would highly recommend that they be used in unison.</li>
            <li>Best product by far for sun damage skin!!  </li>
            <li>I am completely impressed with this serum and will begin by saying that you should most certainly invest in this product.</li>
            <li>This product is healthy, paraben free, and a great skin products.  </li>
            <li>From the airless pump bottle to the wonderful all natural product inside.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best I have ever purchased.  </li>
            <li>So far one of the best Hyaluronic Serums I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>But I use prescription 25% Retin A, and using Hyaluronic Acid and Vitamin C is a more effective routine.  </li>
            <li>though you&#x27;re using Adeline Hyaluronic Acid Serum, it&#x27;s important to keep up a good skin care regime.</li>
            <li>The product looks great in the packaging, &amp; my face feels fresh when I use it.</li>
            <li>this rate, I&#x27;ll actually be able to get the tattoo I&#x27;ve had my heart set on and be able to feel confident at my wedding!</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly into your skin and is pleasant to use.</li>
            <li>It applies best immediately after washing your face with warm water, while your pores are still open.</li>
            <li>I have tried many skin care products, and this by far is the best I have found.</li>
            <li>It has a cool, tingly feeling with it, but in a good way.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly.  </li>
            <li>So Great Price Positive reviews I tried this one.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a HUGE bonus!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff i got this from tomoson to review for free!</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic acid is something that is already in our body, it&#x27;s most found in the fluids of our eyes and joints.  </li>

            <li>Allow the serum to absorb before finishing with your favorite moisturizer and SPF in the daytime or night cream in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: I am still using Adeline&#x27;s Authentic Hyaluronic Acid Serum after almost every face wash while my skin is still moist, so it sops up all of that lovely hydration.</li>
            <li>I am most concerned about my wrinkles  close to my eyes......</li>
            <li>I do feel it is better suited to oily skin and combination skin -- like mine -- for spring and summer use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a while and am really pleased with my face.</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>

            <li>I love the appearance of my skin after using the product.</li>
            <li>After trying this out for a while, I&#x27;m able to see the difference in my skin when I use this.</li>

            <li>Since you can see it, you&#x27;ll be able to tell if you&#x27;re running out.</li>
            <li>RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FOR FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED OPINION</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>LOVE THE FEEL...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll make everything else work better, and your skin will thank you for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels luxurious, smells lovely, is safe around eyes, and takes the guesswork out of combining products.  </li>
            <li>It has been pretty much a pleasant experience each time I’ve used it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>From the first time I tried it, I loved how lightweight and refreshing it felt on my skin.</li>
            <li>From the first time I tried it, I loved how lightweight and refreshing it felt on my skin.</li>
            <li>It is very light feeling and absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li>This acid serum used for your face works pretty good.</li>
            <li>I am excited to purchase!</li>
            <li>Works great, and I love that it has some natural ingredients like Lavender Oil in it.</li>
            <li>This is a great product that leaves the skin noticeably soft and refined with a healthy glow after washing.  </li>
            <li>I feel good about the ingredients in both of these products that I am hopeful for positive results the longer I use them.</li>
            <li>make sure your skin and pores are clean to readily absorb the vitamins in the serum; it&#x27;s always best to exfoliate at least once a week for the best absorption of serums.</li>
            <li>Within a week I noticed fine lines diminishing and my forehead seemed smoother, my skin was just better looking all around.  </li>
            <li>For me, I am 29 and being able to have clean pores is always a plus so using the hyaluronic acid and seeing this as a result made me love this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect basic layer on clean skin.  </li>
            <li>I HOPE THIS WORKS, SO FAR AM HAPPY WITH PURCHASE.</li>
            <li>touch of lavender essential oil suspended in this beautiful, gel-like serum makes application a heady and lovely experience.  </li>
            <li>far I&#x27;m happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think that it makes both my moisturizer &amp; night cream go on more smoothly.</li>
            <li>Allow the serum to absorb before finishing with your favorite moisturizer and SPF in the daytime or night cream in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adeline Beauty provided me with free samples of products to review, and I was under no obligation to review it.</li>
            <li>I received this free to try and love it.</li>
            <li>I am someone who really didn&#x27;t need this product but my good friend does.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and sort of fuels my skin with good things!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used it in the evenings, after removing my make up, and it absorbed quite nicely.</li>
            <li>I love it and could tell after the first use!!  </li>
            <li>I sent a quick email to the company and they replied back stating that their products are never tested on animals (great!)</li>
            <li>but now I do not half to thank you for this great product.</li>
            <li>When mixed with Vitamin C it helps to penetrate your skin, I also have found that using one of those derma needle rollers is also a great way of getting the most out of my skincare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a newbie to skincare and this is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>I am more impressed everyday when my skin gets tighter with each application.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, vitamin C is the most important skin care ingredient to keep the skin looking smooth and youthful.  </li>
            <li>I like that it does not have a strong scent</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s best to use right after a shower when your pores are open.</li>
            <li>You see your skin becoming plumper, more hydrated and visibly more youthful with the first application.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not &amp;#34;that old&amp;#34; but have started to see some fine lines and wrinkles beginning to appear.  </li>
            <li>so whatever I can do to keep fine lines away...</li>
            <li>The serum stimulates collagen, firms and plums the skin, which as a result rids the skin of fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Hopefully it will help the fine lines and even the brown spots.  </li>
            <li>I did notice a difference in the fading of my fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>Appears to like it just fine.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping!</li>
            <li>quick search turned up some interesting information on hyaluronic acid.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t asked to leave a positive review, nor was I compensated in any way for offering my honest opinion of the product.</li>
            <li>Am getting ready to order 2 more bottles!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a lot of improvement in fine lines but it does seem to keep my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>At my age nothing but a face lift will make a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference.</li>

            <li>Feel free to use peels, day and night creams, and mosques, but this is your skincare workhorse.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good,  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that my skin is still fairly youthful – and that I am not knee deep in researching or trying everything under the sun to battle wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After about 10 days of use so far, it seems to be a good skin-firming product.</li>
            <li>The bottles are nice – good quality material with the pumps on each functioning as expected.</li>
            <li>Have been using this serum for almost two weeks and have noticed significant smoothness and reduction of appearance in fine lines/</li>
            <li>I got this right away and am absolutely in LOVE with it.</li>
            <li>Thanks Mark!!!</li>
            <li>My skin feels very clean &amp; fresh</li>
            <li>I struggle with dry skin, so I&#x27;m glad it said to use along with a moisturizer because it is very light, which is nice.</li>
            <li>This product has an amazing texture, its soft and smooth and so easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Delivery:&lt;br /&gt;Since this product was bought through Amazon the delivery was quick and easy.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this serum is packed full of powerful ingredients.</li>
            <li>First and most importantly for ME is that this serum doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling oily or sticky.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used countless &#x27;wrinkle products&#x27; and this one feels really good on my skin - you can tell it&#x27;s doing something as it really wakes up your skin - love it - and the customer service is FIVE STARS too!</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;I am enjoying this product very much.</li>
            <li>The airless pump bottle is a new trend in beauty/skincare because it&#x27;s more hygienic and more efficient.</li>
            <li>This serum is easy to use, feels good on, and hopefully keeps tiny wrinkles at bay.  </li>
            <li>Excited to use this.</li>
            <li>Excited to see the results after a couple of months using this, as I refuse to get anything injected in my face.</li>
            <li>I am familiar with, and like to use, a hyaluronic, Vitamin C serum.  </li>
            <li>The airless pump is also very easy to use and it dispenses just the right amount of serum - you don&#x27;t need very much.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know if an organic product (which is what I&#x27;d really love to use all of the time) would be as effective as they other top brands.  </li>
            <li>Discounted price offered for evaluation purposes, but all future purchases are my own.  :)</li>
            <li>things that I initially noticed and loved about this serum were its lightly herbal scent and how my face immediately felt tightened.  </li>
            <li>I love Adeline Beauty products and this is my favorite of their products thus far.</li>
            <li>I first received it as a trial and got a FULL bottle for free!  </li>
            <li>Shipped Quick Packing Secure.  </li>
            <li>I am really loving using this product and feel not only youthful and better about my appearance</li>
            <li>I am using it as a summer time moisturizer (very lightweight and absorbs quickly) and will be able to easily use it under a heavier moisturizer in the winter.  </li>
            <li>I am write a review on this product, to say the packaging is very professional, and liked the serum.</li>
            <li>I love that I am getting all the essential nutrients my skin needs to continue to look young and beautiful</li>
            <li>So far, I love this serum!  </li>
            <li>I am not one for high maintenance and this product is very easy to use and to get results with.</li>
            <li>The pump bottle make its easy to get just the right amount.</li>
            <li>Anyway, the company offered to refund the full price of the product--which I didn&#x27;t accept.  </li>
            <li>and it goes on cool.</li>
            <li>: I have received complimentary or free products for the purpose of this review.</li>
            <li>I noticed that this really helps my makeup blend into the skin easier and more</li>
            <li>and it went on light and fresh.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell and didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I just can not say enough good things about this product.  </li>
            <li>packaging was good, with each bottle arriving in a smaller box.</li>
            <li>After having dealt with so many serums in brown bottles with rubber droppers, this quality packaging is much appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very eye appealing and would make me, as a consumer, look at it twice on a shelf.  </li>
            <li>Im sure if i were much younger,&lt;br /&gt;there</li>
            <li>The skin on my face is smooth and fresh looking in the morning, and my eyes look younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s not a bad product per se, but I have been using it for about a month, and don&#x27;t see any changes or improvements at all.</li>
            <li>The packaging is attractive and very professional and classy looking.</li>
            <li>It totally holds like 100% times its own weight in moisture which in turn plumps up them fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I dream of my twenties when I took for granted the healthy glow, the nice and supple skin that I abused on a consistent basis and that I definitely didn&#x27;t appreciate.  </li>
            <li>I am pretty pleased with this product, and the bottle looks nice and sleek above my sink.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that I need to use just a very small amount in the morning and my skin feels great!</li>
            <li>and I am starting to think that this product is better for people with more acne prone skin as a moisturizer rather than an anti-wrinkle solution.</li>
            <li>The gel went on nice and smooth and within several minutes I could feel a tightening sensation.</li>
            <li>This serum has no scent and spreads quickly and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, it absorbs quick, and doesn&#x27;t stain pillowcases like some vitamin C products.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Everything I buy on Amazon I check customer reviews and they make a tremendous impact on whether I purchase said product…</li>
            <li>I believe my routine should be quick.</li>
            <li>I ordered all three Adeline products and received the product super quickly through Prime shipping, in just 2 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even if I never produce a wrinkle, I would still use Adeline because my skin is super clear!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am lucky that I use rx</li>
            <li>The serum was delivered quickly and packaging was intact.</li>
            <li>I rec&#x27;d my Serum quickly, with ease of ordering.  </li>
            <li>The first ingredient listed s deionized water, which gives it that smooth, cool feel.  </li>
            <li>Very fast shipping, too!</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping, too!  </li>
            <li>so I am very aware that I need protection.</li>
            <li>I am 75 years old, fair skinned, and I don&#x27;t want to look younger, I just want to have a healthy skin.</li>
            <li>The cap is easy to remove and put back on; it glides on and off very smoothly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Men will want to use this, too, as it is strong but not irritating.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to finishing my first bottle and will post the results I see!</li>
            <li>Instead this makes your moisturizer more effective and allows your skin to retain moisture; one reason why you should apply it on slightly damp skin.</li>
            <li>The serum has a slight refreshing aloe scent, which is nice, because it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>It is very smooth and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>I felt comfortable that there were no animal products used in the making of the Adeline skin care, but I wanted to be certain.</li>
            <li>I used to think it was just one huge gimick, not so much</li>
            <li>Adeline Hyaluronic Acid Serum with Vitamin C really love this product has made my skin soft and  </li>
            <li>While it hasn&#x27;t been able to clear up the old marks, I am confident that if I continue using it, it will in time lessen the scarring.</li>

            <li>I will definitely continue using this product and I look forward to the positive effects on my skin that I have experienced so far!!</li>
            <li>I first ordered the products, I had done a quick google search on the ingredients.</li>
            <li>always love when I can find a product on Amazon because I think that it just immediately makes the purchase experience better than other retailers right from the start.</li>
            <li>This is so much easier to plug into my phone than the original one was.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Adeline Beauty has removed confusion with the Hyaluronic Serum with Vitamins C and E and Retinol--and with lots of other really, really good stuff.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, it&#x27;s the buzz word right now in any beauty magazine.</li>
            <li>I could see a difference right away.</li>
            <li>The price is right for the amount of product that you get.</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic Acid Serum is the hottest ingredient in skin care right now.</li>
            <li>I also use it at night right before I go to bed.</li>
            <li>But the immediate benefits of this Hyaluronic acid can be felt right away.</li>
            <li>I also love the soft scent it has when i first apply it to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seems to soften my facial wrinkles when I used it with OZ Naturals - The BEST Eye Gel, Cream For Dark Circles Puffiness for over two weeks.  </li>
            <li>All those ingredients combined helps your skin feel more hydrated, toned, smooth and it also helps even out your skin tone, diminish fine lines &amp; wrinkles and even gives you a little glow!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>ADELINE not only created a hyaluronic acid serum enhanced with Vitamins A, C, D, E, Retinol and Aloe and witch hazel, but the company makes this serum very easy to use.</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s colder and dry, I layer a light moisturizer on top.  </li>
            <li>This is a small family run business with great products.</li>
            <li>so you really want to take full advantage of that by prepping your skin.</li>
            <li>I love how it smells, and it has already improved where I had really deep smile lines.</li>
            <li>I applied it to my sensitive skin I waited for any side effects or strong fragrance and found none.</li>
            <li>it absorbs and dries quickly, leaving my skin ready for a moisturizer or makeup.  </li>
            <li>I can really see a difference… Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>I thought it irritated my skin at first but decided it was something else that I should&#x27;t use on my skin.  </li>
            <li>so I wasn’t quiet sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>My face is starting to feel firmer and is feeling so much better.</li>
            <li>As for the pump, periodically I may get a touch of a splutter, yet otherwise consistent, measured</li>
            <li>I have always suffered from acne that only gets slightly better in the summer months amidst the pool and summer sun.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I wake up in the morning my skin look and feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>My first impression?</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, making my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>I would most definitely try this product again.</li>
            <li>I can tell I don&#x27;t need to use as much cover-up as before as well!</li>
            <li>Will be getting again real soon and recommending it to others as well!</li>
            <li>could tell a difference the first time I used this product along with the moisturizer.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;I am still on my first bottle of this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this serum for more than 3 months, just got my second order.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different products and</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product Packaging and First Impression:</li>
            <li>It is refreshing to buy a product that actually does what they say it will do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first thing I do every morning after washing my face, put on a vitamin C serum</li>
            <li>There are many on the market, and even though they all contain the hyaluronic acid ingredient and the vitamin C ingredient, they are not created equally.....</li>
            <li>SOFT, SMOOTH AND VELVETY SKIN.</li>
            <li>Too much sun as a child!</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product as I was pleased with its usage and results.</li>
            <li>I was willing to give it a try like everything else.</li>
            <li>This will be a staple of mine in my skincare repertoire;)</li>
            <li>This was my first Hyaluronic Serum</li>
            <li>I had no burning, no tingling or obnoxious alcohol scents as with most facial cleansers and some serums.</li>
            <li>I really think that this product will always be within reach when I wash my face wherever I am!</li>
            <li>I prefer serums personally and no one knows or even comes close to guessing my age - never having had or will entertain the idea of surgeries when I count on Authentic Skin Care products.</li>
            <li>If you use it consistently, your skin will look great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product received for review.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin with a few blemishes here and there, My redness in my face is something I have to control because it is just there.</li>
            <li>It feels very creamy and my skin feels fresh and, “just plain good”.</li>
            <li>It feels very creamy and her skin feels fresh and, “just plain good”.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t seen the amazing results other people have been talking about.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to apply, a small amount spread easily and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It has great packaging and it is 2 oz where most other similar products are only 1oz.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having said that – I was eager to try a new skin care line as the years are passing quickly and it never hurts to be prepared or to be proactive.</li>
            <li>She feels so much youthful and a lot better about how she feels on the outside.  </li>
            <li>I am a facial cleanser addiction, I love trying them all, and getting as much as I can get.</li>
            <li>This really smooths all that out and gives me a healthy, younger look.</li>
            <li>It has left my skin feeling much softer and more moisturized.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gel-like and spreads easily, absorbs quickly and feels a little cool on application.</li>
            <li>and that they were pretty certain that the ingredients were not animal based.</li>
            <li>/no or let me find out – versus a “pretty certain”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I finally found something for my sensitive skin!!!</li>
            <li>I was provided a sample for reviewing purposes but a positive review was not asked for or promised or implied.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not one to post positive comments just to please.  </li>
            <li>Nor was I under any obligation to write a positive review.</li>
            <li>And most importantly for my daily handling of technical objects with shiny, glossy surfaces, this absorbs fully into the skin.  </li>
            <li>my face looked better and wasn&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li>So surprised to see how quickly this is working.</li>
            <li>My skin felt so much softer and smoother after just a few uses, and (very important!)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll certainly order this again.  </li>
            <li>It has done nothing for me, but certain things work for certain people.        </li>
            <li>my case I was more interested in this product for its other effect; clearing acne.</li>
            <li>The bottle is decent size for the price and very easy to use with its simple pump action.</li>
            <li>She has been asking around for a good product that can help her skin not look so dull.</li>
            <li>It works very well on my skin, keeps it clear and looking fresh.</li>
            <li>When you get to about the age of thirty, you really start to notice some changes in your skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After really reading and discovering what my skin was losing, I really started to appreciate what anti-aging products.  </li>
            <li>though it says that hyaluronic acid serums can help with wrinkles that so much of the product would have to be used that results might not be visible for months.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>I was a bit apprehensive as I&#x27;m very picky about my face care products and opt for products like Dermologica, Skinceuticals, Arbonne Anti Aging and Prevage, among others.  </li>
            <li>I really like the smell</li>
            <li>I didn’t have to use much and it didn’t hurt my skin</li>
            <li>Just one pea size amount for your whole face.</li>
            <li>The real test is if (or when)</li>
            <li>I apply once a day and my face is very moisturized and refreshed.</li>
            <li>It dries really fast</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t do much in terms of tighten or removing wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>There is no guarantee with our reviews and we will not we be held responsible if you decide to purchase an item and</li>
            <li>In every step of skin care always use circular, upward motions with a gentle touch on your face.</li>
            <li>Everything came fast and as described.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I found that this product really adds to the benefits of the Adeline Anti Aging Moisturizer Cream.</li>
            <li>I feel that really allows the product to soak in.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe there is anything that works that fast.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of skin care products and this one works really well.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling soft and fresh.</li>

            <li>I really like this product alot.  </li>

            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see any difference in my skin.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s reasonably priced for its effectiveness.</li>
            <li>It is also very affordable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Witch hazel is an important ingredient for me:  I look for it in all my facial products.  </li>
            <li>really is a miricle.</li>
            <li>One pump from the bottle is all that is needed for my whole face and neck.</li>
            <li>This makes my face feel make up ready</li>
            <li>THAT IT ABSORBS FAST LIGHTWEIGHT.ITS NOT GREASY.  </li>
            <li>I found it worked really well with my combination skin.</li>
            <li>The labeling and overall appearance gives the product a classy look, and I enjoyed using them daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong active ingredient so it won&#x27;t peel your skin, but will work great as any other facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>It has a very slight citrus odor and absorbs nicely in my skin.</li>
            <li>I have found this product to add a glow to my face that I did not see prior to using it, and I am excited I came across it per a close friends recommendation.</li>
            <li>, I actually think this product is worth the price and will last you a good long time!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for about ten days now, smoothing it on my clean face morning and night.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice not to have dry, itchy skin now, and of course, I like having younger looking skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cost:&lt;br /&gt;Considering this product is normally in the 60 dollar range for many other beauty retailers this one is a steal at $35.25US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to do with Hyaluronic serum:&lt;br</li>
            <li>twice daily for maximum effect - you will be surprised how quickly the benefits are noticeable!</li>
            <li>live in hot, humid coastal Texas, and many serums are too heavy for me to use during the summertime.  </li>

            <li>Traded in the expensive serums a while ago for Nicci Marie Hyaluronic Acid Serum, this is a great serum.</li>

            <li>i really do wake up pretty and younger.</li>
            <li>My back is super soft and dare I say, supple.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hyaluronic serum is a big deal right now in the beauty world</li>
            <li>(It absorbs quickly, isn&#x27;t greasy &amp; doesn&#x27;t take long to dry)&lt;br /&gt;Follow</li>
            <li>The packaging is beautiful, and I really feel like I&#x27;ve found a boutique facial care line of products that meets my stringent face care needs, and my desire to choose green, organic products over conventionally manufactured products.</li>
            <li>DEFINITELY REDUCES FINE LINES WITH REGULAR USE</li>
            <li>I would certainly recomend this for anyone, old or young.</li>
            <li>new.</li>
            <li>Wanna wake up feeling like a new you?</li>
            <li>vitamin A speeds cell turnover, giving you a fresher set of skin cells to sport around like a new face</li>
            <li>Usually my face and eyes react negatively to moisturizers and make-up, but I had only positive reactions to this product; it applies smoothly, smells pleasant, and leaves my skin softer than before.</li>
            <li>It is very liquid gel and doesn&#x27;t take much to cover your entire face.</li>
            <li>It also (for some reason) rids the face and back of hands of brown age spots - a definite plus - and all of this is accompanied by a soothing comfortable sense when applying.  </li>
            <li>I love the way they hydrate, soothe, reverse aging and sun damage and renew my middle aged skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We state our opinions very clearly and our product reviews are just that.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very soft and wrinkles do seem lessened.  </li>
            <li>It has tightened and looks so much better then it has in the past 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I have normal/combination skin, and need only this serum in the hot, humid Iowa summer weather.  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something natural to erase those stubborn wrinkles, try this!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>This product was definitely sensitive to my skin!</li>
            <li>but I’d dearly love to avoid them if at all possible for as long as possible.</li>
            <li>I did a comparison of my moisturizer using this on one half of my face and none on the other, and the serum side definitely looked fresher and the skin looked firmer with fine lines temporarily filled in.</li>
            <li>is solid, fits the hand well, and one press of the top delivers the little pearl that is all you need to treat the cleansed face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have gotten compliments on my skin and the fact that they cannot believe I am that old from a dental assistant who was very up close and personal.</li>
            <li>so you can see the serum, which is also clear.</li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:46dd97fbe569e101d036fde178855f65]]Love it as a hand lotion - leaves my hands feeling firm, smooth, and refreshed feeling.  </li>
            <li>I am not a beauty professional.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one, however, much to my surprise and delight, has begun to change my complexion with fewer lines and smaller pours.</li>
            <li>I am very picky about my products and recent sent back a whole skincare line by a well-known supermodel.....</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in skin but will update my comments after a month.</li>
            <li>I am a 35 year old mom of two...</li>
            <li>After 4 weeks I started to notice my skin had a natural brightening.</li>
            <li>Im 68 years old and don&#x27;t expect miracles.</li>
            <li>It does what is says, it leaves my skin soft and refreshed, I  use it in the morning underneath my moisturizer and before going to bed.</li>
            <li>I had no trouble with any reaction or redness.</li>
            <li>and I do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and she does have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I like this product so far.  </li>
            <li>I would have been a much happier person back then.  </li>
            <li>It really made a change in my facial skin.  </li>
            <li>Hyaluronic acid is a vital, natural component of the skin.</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive, and this product has not irritated my skin in any way or caused any breakouts.</li>
            <li>and although I am a skeptic as far as claims by beauty products, I tried this.</li>
            <li>FOR YOUR WHOLE FACE, SO THE BOTTLE WILL LAST AWHILE.</li>
            <li>Enough hydration to keep the dryness away but not too much that it leaves my skin oily and greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>This product left my skin feeling more youthful then usual with the skin firmer and with a natural glow.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin with a few blemishes here and there, I have went through a few different products and have not seen considerable results until I found this!</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product will definitely buy again</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product, especially for the price - can&#x27;t beat it in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I use it alone just put a makeup primer on and go,  and let it dry for several minutes to get absorbed into skin.  </li>
            <li>It has been around for a long time and really works.</li>
            <li>A&lt;br /&gt;I am very blessed to come from a long line of women in my family who are all quite youthful in their appearance.</li>
            <li>If you’re in the market for a new set to add or replace like I did to your facial routine, Adeline is it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Check it Out and BUY IT TODAY to begin a NEW YOU!e this in my daily routine now</li>
            <li>This serum absorbs into skin very fast and works comparable to other serums I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I finally found something that really works I have been using  this product for several weeks now</li>
            <li>My face feels very weird, kind of hot</li>
            <li>This is non greasy and easy to apply and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and requires very little effort on my part!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, I am using it before makeup with no other moisturizer or serum or primer.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first as I have tried many different serums.  </li>
            <li>; is a major plus for me.  </li>
            <li>It is just the right, slight, amount of fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way.</li>
            <li>these age defying products are in general just hype.  </li>
            <li>and I’ve clearly seen a big improvement on my face and neck</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s clear in the middle</li>
            <li>far as effects go, my skin is smoother than before, especially around my eyes where I have skin spots from sun.  </li>
            <li>I am a 33 year old female who is starting to not look  as young as I would like.</li>
            <li>I have found this product to add a glow to my face that I did not see prior to using it,the product diminishes wrinkles and moisturizes also with no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>I am a professional in the Hair Industry with an extensive resume in the celebrity field.</li>
            <li>The nice thing is it doesn&#x27;t gum up with my foundation and make that weird pilling on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will certainly try other products from this company    </li>
            <li>It gets a 2 only because my skin feels soft and not dry.</li>
            <li>I received this a few days ago and I started using right away.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 42, caucasian , normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li>no stinging, tingling, or any other sensations, besides wet and cool.</li>
            <li>Much to my children’s chagrin, most people are shocked to know that I have a 19, 16 and 14 year old – or that I am bordering 38 years old.</li>
            <li>Ive noticed no difference as of yet other than face very shiny for awhile.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s normally oily and at the same time, dry and itchy beneath.&lt;br /&gt;image</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, I only use a few drops a day along my smile lines ( I smile a lot)  and also crows feet.  </li>
            <li>There were days I apple make-up after use and days I left my skin bare.  </li>
            <li>The serum is slightly thick, more like oil than other watery serums I have used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to collect a drawer full of little bottles, but difficult to remember what product goes with which, and  which one to use first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s too soon to see the permanent changes it will make (it takes roughly 28 days for new skin to emerge)</li>
            <li>The uneven complexions have lessened and even my small scar appears to be more transparent.</li>
            <li>I am 29 years old, but have spent all of my life in the California sun, not being stringent with sunscreen or skincare in general until last year.</li>
            <li>, it isn’t oily, it does not dry out your skin either and one pump of the bottle seems to be enough to cover my entire face.</li>
            <li>I apply in morning rinsing my face well, apply serum let dry for no less than 10 minutes before primer.  </li>
            <li>like how easily the product is to apply....a little goes a long way...........made my tiny lines look less noticeable</li>

            <li> I strongly recommend this product, and the price point is perfect, too.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking easy ways to remove wrinkles, I think the best treatment is to avoid UVA/UVB rays and wear sunscreen.</li>

            <li> Good price</li>
            <li> I follow up with a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s a good product, I&#x27;ll shout from the roof-top.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to use it also around your eyes, it won&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> I was encouraged to try this serum by my sister in law, who had been using it with good results.  </li>
            <li> serum seems to be good at oil control like a toner.</li>
            <li> While it does a good job with improving tone, the sun will reverse those effects if you do not keep your skin protected.</li>
            <li> I loved that the scent wasn&#x27;t overpowering, and the bottle lasted me quite a while.</li>
            <li> Good job with portion control</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super packed with awesome ingredients.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful combination of those two ingredients, plus there is more to this serum that takes it over the top for</li>
            <li> This was a very interesting product.</li>

            <li> The serum is lightweight and is easily absorbed and it leaves my skin perfectly hydrated</li>
            <li> The vitamins in this are ideal for promoting skin cell turnover and diminishing free radical damage</li>
            <li> I like the look of the bottle - it&#x27;s very elegant -</li>
            <li> It feels good on the skin and smells nice.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product and much better than a another brand that is no longer available.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Adeline Hyaluronic Acid Serum for 10 days, and I love it!</li>
            <li> It turns out that hyaluronic acid is a great way to overcome mild acne!</li>
            <li> It smelled lightly of peppermint and was a great wake</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li> It has a light texture to it and goes on so great.  </li>
            <li> my own</li>
            <li> I was given this product for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> ; I received a product sample to facilitate my review however the opinions expressed here are my own.</li>
            <li> So it was a treat to try something so popular.</li>
            <li> Two pumps and a nice thicker cream came out.</li>
            <li> product was provided at no cost for an honest product review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> …their customer service has been incredible…I own my own business and am quite picky about cost.</li>
            <li> I was intrigued and how effective this serum would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All opinions expressed are still 100% my own.</li>
            <li> This serum combines Hyaluronic acid, Vitamin C, D, and E, Witch Hazel, and Aloe for a nice combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it and gave it my honest thoughts.</li>
            <li> Really nice skin care product.  </li>
            <li> I applied moisturizer over it and liked how it felt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really loving this product.</li>
            <li> It is best to pat the face (or hands - or both) gently to enhance the [penetration into the skin.</li>
            <li> Felt nice after using and observed no side effects.</li>
            <li> That is also nice to hear so it must be working.</li>
            <li> nice texture ...</li>
            <li> It does not burn, but has a nice cooling sensation.  </li>
            <li> , kind of like it is going to break out in a rash.</li>
            <li> The opinions I have expressed are my own.</li>
            <li> MY OWN THOUGHT</li>
            <li> My opinions are 100% honest and my own.</li>
            <li> It works wonderful and quickly to remove the fine lines around my lips, I am a smoker.</li>
            <li> I was truly impressed by all 3 of these products, and would highly recommend that they be used in unison.</li>
            <li> Best product by far for sun damage skin!!  </li>
            <li> I am completely impressed with this serum and will begin by saying that you should most certainly invest in this product.</li>
            <li> This product is healthy, paraben free, and a great skin products.  </li>
            <li> From the airless pump bottle to the wonderful all natural product inside.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best I have ever purchased.  </li>
            <li> So far one of the best Hyaluronic Serums I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> But I use prescription 25% Retin A, and using Hyaluronic Acid and Vitamin C is a more effective routine.  </li>
            <li> though you&#x27;re using Adeline Hyaluronic Acid Serum, it&#x27;s important to keep up a good skin care regime.</li>
            <li> The product looks great in the packaging, &amp; my face feels fresh when I use it.</li>
            <li> this rate, I&#x27;ll actually be able to get the tattoo I&#x27;ve had my heart set on and be able to feel confident at my wedding!</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly into your skin and is pleasant to use.</li>
            <li> It applies best immediately after washing your face with warm water, while your pores are still open.</li>
            <li> I have tried many skin care products, and this by far is the best I have found.</li>
            <li> It has a cool, tingly feeling with it, but in a good way.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smoothly.  </li>
            <li> So Great Price Positive reviews I tried this one.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a HUGE bonus!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff i got this from tomoson to review for free!</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid is something that is already in our body, it&#x27;s most found in the fluids of our eyes and joints.  </li>

            <li> I do feel it is better suited to oily skin and combination skin -- like mine -- for spring and summer use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while and am really pleased with my face.</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> I GOT THIS PRODUCT FOR FREE TO DO AN HONEST REVEIW</li>
            <li> I received the product promotionally for review, and I really enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> I love the appearance of my skin after using the product.</li>
            <li> After trying this out for a while, I&#x27;m able to see the difference in my skin when I use this.</li>
            <li> My skin feels firmer and softer and it looks more &#x27;glow-y&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Since you can see it, you&#x27;ll be able to tell if you&#x27;re running out.</li>
            <li> RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FOR FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED OPINION</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE FEEL...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll make everything else work better, and your skin will thank you for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels luxurious, smells lovely, is safe around eyes, and takes the guesswork out of combining products.  </li>
            <li> It has been pretty much a pleasant experience each time I’ve used it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> From the first time I tried it, I loved how lightweight and refreshing it felt on my skin.</li>
            <li> From the first time I tried it, I loved how lightweight and refreshing it felt on my skin.</li>
            <li> It is very light feeling and absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li> This acid serum used for your face works pretty good.</li>
            <li> I am excited to purchase!</li>
            <li> Works great, and I love that it has some natural ingredients like Lavender Oil in it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that leaves the skin noticeably soft and refined with a healthy glow after washing.  </li>
            <li> I feel good about the ingredients in both of these products that I am hopeful for positive results the longer I use them.</li>
            <li> make sure your skin and pores are clean to readily absorb the vitamins in the serum; it&#x27;s always best to exfoliate at least once a week for the best absorption of serums.</li>
            <li> Within a week I noticed fine lines diminishing and my forehead seemed smoother, my skin was just better looking all around.  </li>
            <li> For me, I am 29 and being able to have clean pores is always a plus so using the hyaluronic acid and seeing this as a result made me love this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect basic layer on clean skin.  </li>
            <li> I HOPE THIS WORKS, SO FAR AM HAPPY WITH PURCHASE.</li>
            <li> touch of lavender essential oil suspended in this beautiful, gel-like serum makes application a heady and lovely experience.  </li>
            <li> far I&#x27;m happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think that it makes both my moisturizer &amp; night cream go on more smoothly.</li>
            <li> Allow the serum to absorb before finishing with your favorite moisturizer and SPF in the daytime or night cream in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adeline Beauty provided me with free samples of products to review, and I was under no obligation to review it.</li>
            <li> I received this free to try and love it.</li>
            <li> I am someone who really didn&#x27;t need this product but my good friend does.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and sort of fuels my skin with good things!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it in the evenings, after removing my make up, and it absorbed quite nicely.</li>
            <li> I love it and could tell after the first use!!  </li>
            <li> I sent a quick email to the company and they replied back stating that their products are never tested on animals (great!)</li>
            <li> but now I do not half to thank you for this great product.</li>
            <li> When mixed with Vitamin C it helps to penetrate your skin, I also have found that using one of those derma needle rollers is also a great way of getting the most out of my skincare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a newbie to skincare and this is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> I am more impressed everyday when my skin gets tighter with each application.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, vitamin C is the most important skin care ingredient to keep the skin looking smooth and youthful.  </li>
            <li> I like that it does not have a strong scent</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s best to use right after a shower when your pores are open.</li>
            <li> You see your skin becoming plumper, more hydrated and visibly more youthful with the first application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not &amp;#34;that old&amp;#34; but have started to see some fine lines and wrinkles beginning to appear.  </li>
            <li> so whatever I can do to keep fine lines away...</li>
            <li> The serum stimulates collagen, firms and plums the skin, which as a result rids the skin of fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it will help the fine lines and even the brown spots.  </li>
            <li> I did notice a difference in the fading of my fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Appears to like it just fine.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping!</li>
            <li> quick search turned up some interesting information on hyaluronic acid.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t asked to leave a positive review, nor was I compensated in any way for offering my honest opinion of the product.</li>
            <li> Am getting ready to order 2 more bottles!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a lot of improvement in fine lines but it does seem to keep my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> At my age nothing but a face lift will make a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> did receive this product for free for testing purposes.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;**I received a free copy of product for a review.</li>
            <li> Because it has lavender oil, the serum has a light lavender scent that is not overpowering or aggravating to your skin.   </li>
            <li> Feel free to use peels, day and night creams, and mosques, but this is your skincare workhorse.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good,  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that my skin is still fairly youthful – and that I am not knee deep in researching or trying everything under the sun to battle wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After about 10 days of use so far, it seems to be a good skin-firming product.</li>
            <li> The bottles are nice – good quality material with the pumps on each functioning as expected.</li>
            <li> Have been using this serum for almost two weeks and have noticed significant smoothness and reduction of appearance in fine lines/</li>
            <li> I got this right away and am absolutely in LOVE with it.</li>
            <li> Thanks Mark!!!</li>
            <li> My skin feels very clean &amp; fresh</li>
            <li> I struggle with dry skin, so I&#x27;m glad it said to use along with a moisturizer because it is very light, which is nice.</li>
            <li> This product has an amazing texture, its soft and smooth and so easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Delivery:&lt;br /&gt;Since this product was bought through Amazon the delivery was quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this serum is packed full of powerful ingredients.</li>
            <li> First and most importantly for ME is that this serum doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling oily or sticky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used countless &#x27;wrinkle products&#x27; and this one feels really good on my skin - you can tell it&#x27;s doing something as it really wakes up your skin - love it - and the customer service is FIVE STARS too!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I am enjoying this product very much.</li>
            <li> The airless pump bottle is a new trend in beauty/skincare because it&#x27;s more hygienic and more efficient.</li>
            <li> This serum is easy to use, feels good on, and hopefully keeps tiny wrinkles at bay.  </li>
            <li> Excited to use this.</li>
            <li> Excited to see the results after a couple of months using this, as I refuse to get anything injected in my face.</li>
            <li> I am familiar with, and like to use, a hyaluronic, Vitamin C serum.  </li>
            <li> The airless pump is also very easy to use and it dispenses just the right amount of serum - you don&#x27;t need very much.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know if an organic product (which is what I&#x27;d really love to use all of the time) would be as effective as they other top brands.  </li>
            <li> Discounted price offered for evaluation purposes, but all future purchases are my own.  :)</li>
            <li> things that I initially noticed and loved about this serum were its lightly herbal scent and how my face immediately felt tightened.  </li>
            <li> I love Adeline Beauty products and this is my favorite of their products thus far.</li>
            <li> I first received it as a trial and got a FULL bottle for free!  </li>
            <li> Shipped Quick Packing Secure.  </li>
            <li> I am really loving using this product and feel not only youthful and better about my appearance</li>
            <li> I am using it as a summer time moisturizer (very lightweight and absorbs quickly) and will be able to easily use it under a heavier moisturizer in the winter.  </li>
            <li> I am write a review on this product, to say the packaging is very professional, and liked the serum.</li>
            <li> I love that I am getting all the essential nutrients my skin needs to continue to look young and beautiful</li>
            <li> So far, I love this serum!  </li>
            <li> I am not one for high maintenance and this product is very easy to use and to get results with.</li>
            <li> The pump bottle make its easy to get just the right amount.</li>
            <li> Anyway, the company offered to refund the full price of the product--which I didn&#x27;t accept.  </li>
            <li> and it goes on cool.</li>
            <li> : I have received complimentary or free products for the purpose of this review.</li>
            <li> I noticed that this really helps my makeup blend into the skin easier and more</li>
            <li> and it went on light and fresh.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell and didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I just can not say enough good things about this product.  </li>
            <li> packaging was good, with each bottle arriving in a smaller box.</li>
            <li> After having dealt with so many serums in brown bottles with rubber droppers, this quality packaging is much appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very eye appealing and would make me, as a consumer, look at it twice on a shelf.  </li>
            <li> Im sure if i were much younger,&lt;br /&gt;there</li>
            <li> The skin on my face is smooth and fresh looking in the morning, and my eyes look younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s not a bad product per se, but I have been using it for about a month, and don&#x27;t see any changes or improvements at all.</li>
            <li> The packaging is attractive and very professional and classy looking.</li>
            <li> It totally holds like 100% times its own weight in moisture which in turn plumps up them fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I dream of my twenties when I took for granted the healthy glow, the nice and supple skin that I abused on a consistent basis and that I definitely didn&#x27;t appreciate.  </li>
            <li> I am pretty pleased with this product, and the bottle looks nice and sleek above my sink.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that I need to use just a very small amount in the morning and my skin feels great!</li>
            <li> and I am starting to think that this product is better for people with more acne prone skin as a moisturizer rather than an anti-wrinkle solution.</li>
            <li> The gel went on nice and smooth and within several minutes I could feel a tightening sensation.</li>
            <li> This serum has no scent and spreads quickly and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, it absorbs quick, and doesn&#x27;t stain pillowcases like some vitamin C products.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Everything I buy on Amazon I check customer reviews and they make a tremendous impact on whether I purchase said product…</li>
            <li> I believe my routine should be quick.</li>
            <li> I ordered all three Adeline products and received the product super quickly through Prime shipping, in just 2 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even if I never produce a wrinkle, I would still use Adeline because my skin is super clear!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am lucky that I use rx</li>
            <li> The serum was delivered quickly and packaging was intact.</li>
            <li> I rec&#x27;d my Serum quickly, with ease of ordering.  </li>
            <li> The first ingredient listed s deionized water, which gives it that smooth, cool feel.  </li>
            <li> Very fast shipping, too!</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping, too!  </li>
            <li> so I am very aware that I need protection.</li>
            <li> I am 75 years old, fair skinned, and I don&#x27;t want to look younger, I just want to have a healthy skin.</li>
            <li> The cap is easy to remove and put back on; it glides on and off very smoothly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Men will want to use this, too, as it is strong but not irritating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to finishing my first bottle and will post the results I see!</li>
            <li> Instead this makes your moisturizer more effective and allows your skin to retain moisture; one reason why you should apply it on slightly damp skin.</li>
            <li> The serum has a slight refreshing aloe scent, which is nice, because it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> It is very smooth and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> I felt comfortable that there were no animal products used in the making of the Adeline skin care, but I wanted to be certain.</li>
            <li> I used to think it was just one huge gimick, not so much</li>
            <li> Adeline Hyaluronic Acid Serum with Vitamin C really love this product has made my skin soft and  </li>
            <li> While it hasn&#x27;t been able to clear up the old marks, I am confident that if I continue using it, it will in time lessen the scarring.</li>

            <li> hydration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary sample of Adeline serum for testing and review purposes.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely continue using this product and I look forward to the positive effects on my skin that I have experienced so far!!</li>
            <li> I first ordered the products, I had done a quick google search on the ingredients.</li>
            <li> always love when I can find a product on Amazon because I think that it just immediately makes the purchase experience better than other retailers right from the start.</li>
            <li> This is so much easier to plug into my phone than the original one was.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Adeline Beauty has removed confusion with the Hyaluronic Serum with Vitamins C and E and Retinol--and with lots of other really, really good stuff.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, it&#x27;s the buzz word right now in any beauty magazine.</li>
            <li> I could see a difference right away.</li>
            <li> The price is right for the amount of product that you get.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic Acid Serum is the hottest ingredient in skin care right now.</li>
            <li> I also use it at night right before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> But the immediate benefits of this Hyaluronic acid can be felt right away.</li>
            <li> I also love the soft scent it has when i first apply it to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seems to soften my facial wrinkles when I used it with OZ Naturals - The BEST Eye Gel, Cream For Dark Circles Puffiness for over two weeks.  </li>
            <li> All those ingredients combined helps your skin feel more hydrated, toned, smooth and it also helps even out your skin tone, diminish fine lines &amp; wrinkles and even gives you a little glow!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> ADELINE not only created a hyaluronic acid serum enhanced with Vitamins A, C, D, E, Retinol and Aloe and witch hazel, but the company makes this serum very easy to use.</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s colder and dry, I layer a light moisturizer on top.  </li>
            <li> This is a small family run business with great products.</li>
            <li> so you really want to take full advantage of that by prepping your skin.</li>
            <li> I love how it smells, and it has already improved where I had really deep smile lines.</li>
            <li> I applied it to my sensitive skin I waited for any side effects or strong fragrance and found none.</li>
            <li> it absorbs and dries quickly, leaving my skin ready for a moisturizer or makeup.  </li>
            <li> I can really see a difference… Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I thought it irritated my skin at first but decided it was something else that I should&#x27;t use on my skin.  </li>
            <li> so I wasn’t quiet sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> My face is starting to feel firmer and is feeling so much better.</li>
            <li> As for the pump, periodically I may get a touch of a splutter, yet otherwise consistent, measured</li>
            <li> I have always suffered from acne that only gets slightly better in the summer months amidst the pool and summer sun.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I wake up in the morning my skin look and feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> My first impression?</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, making my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> I would most definitely try this product again.</li>
            <li> I can tell I don&#x27;t need to use as much cover-up as before as well!</li>
            <li> Will be getting again real soon and recommending it to others as well!</li>
            <li> could tell a difference the first time I used this product along with the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I am still on my first bottle of this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for more than 3 months, just got my second order.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different products and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product Packaging and First Impression:</li>
            <li> It is refreshing to buy a product that actually does what they say it will do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first thing I do every morning after washing my face, put on a vitamin C serum</li>
            <li> There are many on the market, and even though they all contain the hyaluronic acid ingredient and the vitamin C ingredient, they are not created equally.....</li>
            <li> SOFT, SMOOTH AND VELVETY SKIN.</li>
            <li> Too much sun as a child!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product as I was pleased with its usage and results.</li>
            <li> I was willing to give it a try like everything else.</li>
            <li> This will be a staple of mine in my skincare repertoire;)</li>
            <li> This was my first Hyaluronic Serum</li>
            <li> I had no burning, no tingling or obnoxious alcohol scents as with most facial cleansers and some serums.</li>
            <li> I really think that this product will always be within reach when I wash my face wherever I am!</li>
            <li> I prefer serums personally and no one knows or even comes close to guessing my age - never having had or will entertain the idea of surgeries when I count on Authentic Skin Care products.</li>
            <li> If you use it consistently, your skin will look great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product received for review.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin with a few blemishes here and there, My redness in my face is something I have to control because it is just there.</li>
            <li> It feels very creamy and my skin feels fresh and, “just plain good”.</li>
            <li> It feels very creamy and her skin feels fresh and, “just plain good”.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t seen the amazing results other people have been talking about.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s easy to apply, a small amount spread easily and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> It has great packaging and it is 2 oz where most other similar products are only 1oz.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having said that – I was eager to try a new skin care line as the years are passing quickly and it never hurts to be prepared or to be proactive.</li>
            <li> She feels so much youthful and a lot better about how she feels on the outside.  </li>
            <li> I am a facial cleanser addiction, I love trying them all, and getting as much as I can get.</li>
            <li> This really smooths all that out and gives me a healthy, younger look.</li>
            <li> It has left my skin feeling much softer and more moisturized.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gel-like and spreads easily, absorbs quickly and feels a little cool on application.</li>
            <li> and that they were pretty certain that the ingredients were not animal based.</li>
            <li> /no or let me find out – versus a “pretty certain”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I finally found something for my sensitive skin!!!</li>
            <li> I was provided a sample for reviewing purposes but a positive review was not asked for or promised or implied.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not one to post positive comments just to please.  </li>
            <li> Nor was I under any obligation to write a positive review.</li>
            <li> And most importantly for my daily handling of technical objects with shiny, glossy surfaces, this absorbs fully into the skin.  </li>
            <li> my face looked better and wasn&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li> So surprised to see how quickly this is working.</li>
            <li> My skin felt so much softer and smoother after just a few uses, and (very important!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll certainly order this again.  </li>
            <li> It has done nothing for me, but certain things work for certain people.        </li>
            <li> my case I was more interested in this product for its other effect; clearing acne.</li>
            <li> The bottle is decent size for the price and very easy to use with its simple pump action.</li>
            <li> She has been asking around for a good product that can help her skin not look so dull.</li>
            <li> It works very well on my skin, keeps it clear and looking fresh.</li>
            <li> When you get to about the age of thirty, you really start to notice some changes in your skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After really reading and discovering what my skin was losing, I really started to appreciate what anti-aging products.  </li>
            <li> though it says that hyaluronic acid serums can help with wrinkles that so much of the product would have to be used that results might not be visible for months.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> I was a bit apprehensive as I&#x27;m very picky about my face care products and opt for products like Dermologica, Skinceuticals, Arbonne Anti Aging and Prevage, among others.  </li>
            <li> I really like the smell</li>
            <li> I didn’t have to use much and it didn’t hurt my skin</li>
            <li> Just one pea size amount for your whole face.</li>
            <li> The real test is if (or when)</li>
            <li> I apply once a day and my face is very moisturized and refreshed.</li>
            <li> It dries really fast</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t do much in terms of tighten or removing wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> There is no guarantee with our reviews and we will not we be held responsible if you decide to purchase an item and</li>
            <li> In every step of skin care always use circular, upward motions with a gentle touch on your face.</li>
            <li> Everything came fast and as described.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I found that this product really adds to the benefits of the Adeline Anti Aging Moisturizer Cream.</li>
            <li> I feel that really allows the product to soak in.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe there is anything that works that fast.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of skin care products and this one works really well.</li>

            <li> It is also very affordable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Witch hazel is an important ingredient for me:  I look for it in all my facial products.  </li>
            <li> really is a miricle.</li>
            <li> One pump from the bottle is all that is needed for my whole face and neck.</li>
            <li> This makes my face feel make up ready</li>

            <li> It has a very slight citrus odor and absorbs nicely in my skin.</li>
            <li> I have found this product to add a glow to my face that I did not see prior to using it, and I am excited I came across it per a close friends recommendation.</li>
            <li> , I actually think this product is worth the price and will last you a good long time!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for about ten days now, smoothing it on my clean face morning and night.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice not to have dry, itchy skin now, and of course, I like having younger looking skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cost:&lt;br /&gt;Considering this product is normally in the 60 dollar range for many other beauty retailers this one is a steal at $35.25US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to do with Hyaluronic serum:&lt;br</li>
            <li> twice daily for maximum effect - you will be surprised how quickly the benefits are noticeable!</li>
            <li> live in hot, humid coastal Texas, and many serums are too heavy for me to use during the summertime.  </li>

            <li> Adeline Hyaluronic Acid Serum with Vitamins A and E and Retinol is a high end product.  </li>
            <li> this one seems to tighten skin a little more.  </li>
            <li> The fine lines around my eyes look so much softer and a lot less</li>
            <li> Traded in the expensive serums a while ago for Nicci Marie Hyaluronic Acid Serum, this is a great serum.</li>
            <li> Taken any of dryness, and dullness of winter away and left fresh look and</li>

            <li> i really do wake up pretty and younger.</li>
            <li> My back is super soft and dare I say, supple.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hyaluronic serum is a big deal right now in the beauty world</li>
            <li> (It absorbs quickly, isn&#x27;t greasy &amp; doesn&#x27;t take long to dry)&lt;br /&gt;Follow</li>
            <li> The packaging is beautiful, and I really feel like I&#x27;ve found a boutique facial care line of products that meets my stringent face care needs, and my desire to choose green, organic products over conventionally manufactured products.</li>
            <li> DEFINITELY REDUCES FINE LINES WITH REGULAR USE</li>
            <li> I would certainly recomend this for anyone, old or young.</li>
            <li> new.</li>
            <li> Wanna wake up feeling like a new you?</li>
            <li> vitamin A speeds cell turnover, giving you a fresher set of skin cells to sport around like a new face</li>
            <li> Usually my face and eyes react negatively to moisturizers and make-up, but I had only positive reactions to this product; it applies smoothly, smells pleasant, and leaves my skin softer than before.</li>
            <li> It is very liquid gel and doesn&#x27;t take much to cover your entire face.</li>
            <li> It also (for some reason) rids the face and back of hands of brown age spots - a definite plus - and all of this is accompanied by a soothing comfortable sense when applying.  </li>
            <li> I love the way they hydrate, soothe, reverse aging and sun damage and renew my middle aged skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We state our opinions very clearly and our product reviews are just that.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very soft and wrinkles do seem lessened.  </li>
            <li> It has tightened and looks so much better then it has in the past 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have normal/combination skin, and need only this serum in the hot, humid Iowa summer weather.  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something natural to erase those stubborn wrinkles, try this!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> This product was definitely sensitive to my skin!</li>
            <li> but I’d dearly love to avoid them if at all possible for as long as possible.</li>
            <li> I did a comparison of my moisturizer using this on one half of my face and none on the other, and the serum side definitely looked fresher and the skin looked firmer with fine lines temporarily filled in.</li>
            <li> is solid, fits the hand well, and one press of the top delivers the little pearl that is all you need to treat the cleansed face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have gotten compliments on my skin and the fact that they cannot believe I am that old from a dental assistant who was very up close and personal.</li>
            <li> so you can see the serum, which is also clear.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:46dd97fbe569e101d036fde178855f65]]Love it as a hand lotion - leaves my hands feeling firm, smooth, and refreshed feeling.  </li>
            <li> I am not a beauty professional.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one, however, much to my surprise and delight, has begun to change my complexion with fewer lines and smaller pours.</li>
            <li> I am very picky about my products and recent sent back a whole skincare line by a well-known supermodel.....</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in skin but will update my comments after a month.</li>
            <li> I am a 35 year old mom of two...</li>
            <li> After 4 weeks I started to notice my skin had a natural brightening.</li>
            <li> Im 68 years old and don&#x27;t expect miracles.</li>
            <li> It does what is says, it leaves my skin soft and refreshed, I  use it in the morning underneath my moisturizer and before going to bed.</li>
            <li> I had no trouble with any reaction or redness.</li>
            <li> and I do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and she does have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I like this product so far.  </li>
            <li> I would have been a much happier person back then.  </li>
            <li> It really made a change in my facial skin.  </li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid is a vital, natural component of the skin.</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive, and this product has not irritated my skin in any way or caused any breakouts.</li>
            <li> and although I am a skeptic as far as claims by beauty products, I tried this.</li>
            <li> FOR YOUR WHOLE FACE, SO THE BOTTLE WILL LAST AWHILE.</li>
            <li> Enough hydration to keep the dryness away but not too much that it leaves my skin oily and greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> This product left my skin feeling more youthful then usual with the skin firmer and with a natural glow.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin with a few blemishes here and there, I have went through a few different products and have not seen considerable results until I found this!</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product, especially for the price - can&#x27;t beat it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I use it alone just put a makeup primer on and go,  and let it dry for several minutes to get absorbed into skin.  </li>
            <li> It has been around for a long time and really works.</li>
            <li> A&lt;br /&gt;I am very blessed to come from a long line of women in my family who are all quite youthful in their appearance.</li>
            <li> If you’re in the market for a new set to add or replace like I did to your facial routine, Adeline is it.</li>

            <li> This serum absorbs into skin very fast and works comparable to other serums I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I finally found something that really works I have been using  this product for several weeks now</li>
            <li> My face feels very weird, kind of hot</li>
            <li> This is non greasy and easy to apply and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and requires very little effort on my part!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, I am using it before makeup with no other moisturizer or serum or primer.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first as I have tried many different serums.  </li>
            <li> ; is a major plus for me.  </li>
            <li> It is just the right, slight, amount of fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way.</li>
            <li> these age defying products are in general just hype.  </li>
            <li> and I’ve clearly seen a big improvement on my face and neck</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s clear in the middle</li>
            <li> far as effects go, my skin is smoother than before, especially around my eyes where I have skin spots from sun.  </li>
            <li> I am a 33 year old female who is starting to not look  as young as I would like.</li>
            <li> I have found this product to add a glow to my face that I did not see prior to using it,the product diminishes wrinkles and moisturizes also with no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I am a professional in the Hair Industry with an extensive resume in the celebrity field.</li>
            <li> The nice thing is it doesn&#x27;t gum up with my foundation and make that weird pilling on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will certainly try other products from this company    </li>
            <li> It gets a 2 only because my skin feels soft and not dry.</li>
            <li> I received this a few days ago and I started using right away.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 42, caucasian , normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li> no stinging, tingling, or any other sensations, besides wet and cool.</li>
            <li> Much to my children’s chagrin, most people are shocked to know that I have a 19, 16 and 14 year old – or that I am bordering 38 years old.</li>
            <li> Ive noticed no difference as of yet other than face very shiny for awhile.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s normally oily and at the same time, dry and itchy beneath.&lt;br /&gt;image</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, I only use a few drops a day along my smile lines ( I smile a lot)  and also crows feet.  </li>
            <li> There were days I apple make-up after use and days I left my skin bare.  </li>
            <li> The serum is slightly thick, more like oil than other watery serums I have used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to collect a drawer full of little bottles, but difficult to remember what product goes with which, and  which one to use first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s too soon to see the permanent changes it will make (it takes roughly 28 days for new skin to emerge)</li>
            <li> The uneven complexions have lessened and even my small scar appears to be more transparent.</li>
            <li> I am 29 years old, but have spent all of my life in the California sun, not being stringent with sunscreen or skincare in general until last year.</li>
            <li> , it isn’t oily, it does not dry out your skin either and one pump of the bottle seems to be enough to cover my entire face.</li>
            <li> I apply in morning rinsing my face well, apply serum let dry for no less than 10 minutes before primer.  </li>
            <li> like how easily the product is to apply....a little goes a long way...........made my tiny lines look less noticeable</li>
            <li> It soaks in quickly and seems to make things look a little smoother and less puffy.</li>
            <li> i may have bought something other than what im looking for but this has done nothing noticeable so far</li>
            <li> I noticed the new acne that had previously formed between my brows</li>
            <li> I applied it twice daily for a little over a week and noticed I started to feel like my skin was not only firm but felt fresh if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> My skin feels a little tight right after use and the crows feet disappear.</li>
            <li> This bottle will last a long time!</li>
            <li> Made my skin feel young and tight.</li>
            <li> Have tried a few other products that did not seem to make any real difference.</li>
            <li> Well, I was a little nervous testing this out, based on the name, however, I was pleasantly surprised that it just felt like jelly on my face-</li>
            <li> Prior to this product, I used a lot of moisturizer on my skin, and it still remained dry, or would get dry during the day.  </li>
            <li> It has been about 4 weeks and the area around my eyes is much firmer, smoother, and youthful looking to say the least.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it for long</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve aged, the skin on the back of my hands has gotten wrinkly.</li>
            <li> You have nothing to lose with their money back , empty bottle promise.</li>
            <li> When I use this product, it keeps my face from getting scaly all day long.  </li>
            <li> Takes perhaps 30 or 40 seconds, then absolutely no oily residue - any residue at all would be a deal killer, but also doesn&#x27;t leave the skin feeling raspy (and why I stopped using the last one that claimed no oily residue, yet made my palms dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this serum for a little over a week now, but I can feel such a difference!  </li>
            <li> and as I was reviewing it I was trying to distinguish it from other serums that are similar that I have also</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> It did hydrate my dry skin</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use a moisturizer, I can get dry spots.</li>
            <li> Then once dry, apply a moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> &amp; pat dry</li>
            <li> (I use it on my hands &amp; decolletage too)&lt;br /&gt;Allow to dry.</li>
            <li> I dispense the serum on my finger tips and then spread it all around my face, to diminish my surface lines and wrinkles, and to plump and hydrate my dry, sagging skin.</li>
            <li> It seems like I have less surface lines and wrinkles and my face is not dry anymore.</li>
            <li> I also want to share that,even at 37 – I still fall victim to acne breakouts.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve changed it for this one, does the same and cost a lot less.</li>
            <li> There were times before I added the Anti-Aging Moisturizer with Matrixyl into the mix that my skin felt a touch dry, but that would be expected with this type of treatment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 58 and looked 68, if not older.</li>
            <li> A small amount of serum goes a long way so this bottle will last a long while.&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very subtle at first, but gradually you&#x27;ll notice some age spots, discoloration, and a loss of elasticity.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think my fine line and wrinkles were that bad to begin with, but I feel this product is definitely keeping things that way, keeping that &amp;#34;crepey&amp;#34; look around my eyes and forehead in check.</li>
            <li> I have EXTREME dry skin.  </li>
            <li> So I will use this serum in late spring through early fall when my oil glands like to work</li>
            <li> This serum does not really have a smell.</li>
            <li> bottle, send back the empty bottle if you&#x27;re not completely thrilled, and they&#x27;ll refund your entire purchase price!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a few days and already see a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> I use this serum in the evenings after I cleanse my face, then facial moisturizer after the serum has dried.</li>
            <li> I may put on additional moisturizer at night but it depends on how rough my day has been on my skin.</li>
            <li> Instantly made my face feel tighter and firmer without the burn of harsh chemicals like other products.</li>
            <li> A little amount goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My wife is using this and says that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it makes my naturally dry skin feel even drier.</li>
            <li> Other products make my face feel tight but dry</li>
            <li> i SUGGEST that eveyone tries this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum daily and gaining unbelievable results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I on the other hand do not have wrinkles yet</li>
            <li> It came with some other items and was packaged well.</li>
            <li> That may seem like a lot of moolah, but believe me, a little of this stuff goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> It works well with vitamin A serums and other beauty creams and regimens.</li>
            <li> The other day I mentioned my age while filling out an insurance form, and the person looked at me and said, &amp;#34;Wow</li>
            <li> you have to be consistent as with any other skin product , I was using the expensive Lancome serum</li>
            <li> I usually use two pumps to cover my face and neck so this bottle will last</li>
            <li> Must use for several months to see if it works as well, if not better than product being used</li>
            <li> The serum is lightweight and compliments my other skincare products.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what other serums contain that make them sticky, but this one does not have it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but i do not feel like I have to as I did with other products.</li>
            <li> EVERY MORNING.I HAVE USED IT WITH OTHER FACE PRODUCT</li>
            <li> YOU ONLY NEED A SMALL AMOUNT OF IT</li>
            <li> In just a few days, I noticed my skin appeared brighter and didn&#x27;t feel so dry.  </li>
            <li> I am 61 years old and have tired a lot of creams and lotions, because I have sensitive skin and really thin skin under my eyes that tends to get dry and show the wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> The amount of serum you receive relative to the price is hard to beat and the performance is something I&#x27;ve not gotten out of any store bought</li>
            <li> However, due to the frigid temperature in my area, my skin is more on the dry side</li>
            <li> , I had a problem with dark circles under my eye and it has lightened it up</li>
            <li> It also cleared up my acne outside of a few small things.</li>
            <li> It is a small, family run business focused on producing great skin care products without a lot of nasty</li>
            <li> Lately, I can&#x27;t get enough of this one that Adeline sent me to review for them!&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic</li>
            <li> The silver base and cap look elegant.</li>
            <li> I am used to most serums being of an oil base and not always works for those with oily to combo skin types.</li>
            <li> These ingredients work together to help slow down my skin&#x27;s aging process, while improving my skin&#x27;s appearance at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don’t help gravity by tugging down on your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Replenishing the skin with hyaluronic acid slows down the aging process.  </li>
            <li> using it, it can dry a little stiff</li>
            <li> /&gt;To use this serum, after washing and patting dry your face/neck, all you have to do is apply a small amount all over your face/neck area and let it dry (usually within 1-2 minutes).  </li>
            <li> I believe I used a pump and a half.  </li>
            <li> texture, less wrinkles (</li>
            <li> You can feel a slight tingle as soon as you apply the Organic Eye Serum</li>
            <li> and I had decided to try this on one half of my face</li>
            <li> It is hard to tell what the long term benefits are without using over a longer period of time, but I have already noticed results and will be continuing with the use of this product.</li>
            <li> However that does not mean this product is not great!</li>
            <li> I like that it was packaged in the airless pump container because there is less chance of contamination and its easier to use than the little</li>
            <li> I had two brown sun spots that are seriously fading after only a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Ya know every little bit of upward motion helps fight gravity!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a little drying but the directions say to put moisturizer on after you put it on</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product a little over a month now</li>
            <li> The pump delivers a very small single dose of serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a few days of use I could notice a difference however I never saw skin firming as an issue for me.</li>
            <li> had dried up and flaked away.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s working already, can&#x27;t wait to see my skin in a few weeks!&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for months now, and there&#x27;s a few things to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have you been using Hyaluronic Acid Serum as part of your everyday skincare routine yet?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the serum for a few days and like it.</li>
            <li> Is it supposed to be a miracle worker like they say and work in just a few days?  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like it is too heavy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> I will update my review in a few weeks after I have had a chance to use it a while longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Adeline Hyaluronic Acid Serum for a few weeks now and have seen an improvement in my skin&#x27;s appearance.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this serum a few months ago</li>
            <li> mean really nothing is going to make your wrinkles disappear that comes in a bottle sorry folks.  </li>
            <li> I also think my skin looked less dull.  </li>
            <li> Then you go about business as usual with your moisturizers, makeup, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The sides of my nose, those weird folds, don&#x27;t look as deep.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Hyaluronic acid has been shown to reduce small wrinkles in skin.</li>
            <li> so I was anxious to see how it would work.</li>
            <li> I would no more skip a day of using a product with vitamin C than I would skip getting dressed for the day.  </li>
            <li> Usually, gel like products burn my skin as they soak into it--</li>
            <li> my wrinkles a little less angry looking.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to pin point any specifics since it&#x27;s already in my skincare routine.  </li>
            <li> It tightened my pores and smoothed my skin, and I hardly ever see bumps or blemishes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not noticed any negative side effects.  </li>
            <li> I will be seventy this year and work outside in the heat and cold, sun and rain or snow.</li>
            <li> Skin care can be really confusing.  </li>
            <li> This serum is thick, creamy, absorbs rapidly, and leaves the skin feeling divine in its wake.</li>
            <li> Started using this product a week ago &amp; within a few days my face looked brighter &amp; my age spots were clearing up!!  </li>
            <li> This Hyaluronic Acid Serum is some serious stuff.  </li>
            <li> Serum has a consistency slightly thinner than Aloe, it has a faint lavender scent.</li>
            <li> Oh, and the subtle lavender scent is divine.</li>
            <li> I didn’t have any bad reactions (I’m very sensitive skinned usually), it wasn’t unpleasant and did not sting or burn at all.</li>
            <li> When she did look closely at my back she said, &amp;#34;Oh, you have chicken skin!</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I&#x27;m not sure if using beauty products like this work.  </li>
            <li> No remarkable changes</li>
            <li> and then my moisturizer and finally my makeup base.  </li>
            <li> The combination of these ingredients truly help combat the sagging, wrinkling and poor texture of aging skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you can seriously feel your skin feel tighter!</li>
            <li> I am crazy lately over all products that contain Vitamin C as well as Hyaluronic Acid.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive for a lotion that doesn&#x27;t deliver as promised.</li>
            <li> The cliff notes - no &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s just annoying, and it&#x27;s caused by excessive skin cell build up at the hair follicles.</li>
            <li> I always hate throwing away unused product because you can&#x27;t get to it.  </li>
            <li> My face is smoother and  my well earned but hated wrinkles have improved.</li>
            <li> aging does awful things to skin...</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this stuff i got this from tomoson to review for free! i SUGGEST that eveyone tries this! its amazing!</li>
            <li> Love this serum!  Helps hold in moisture ?</li>
            <li> When you get to about the age of thirty, you really start to notice some changes in your skin.  It&#x27;s very subtle at first, but gradually you&#x27;ll notice some age spots, discoloration, and a loss of elasticity.  I dream of my twenties when I took for granted the healthy glow, the nice and supple skin that I abused on a consistent basis and that I definitely didn&#x27;t appreciate.  I now take care of my skin and understand why skincare is a probably billion dollar industry.  I used to think it was just one huge gimick, not so much anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After really reading and discovering what my skin was losing, I really started to appreciate what anti-aging products.  Hyaluronic acid is something that is already in our body, it&#x27;s most found in the fluids of our eyes and joints.  It&#x27;s used in a lot of skincare products to help to decrease the signs of aging.  Hylauronic acid is always one of those ingredients that you want to see in your serums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can help to cushion and to lubricate your skin.  When mixed with Vitamin C it helps to penetrate your skin, I also have found that using one of those derma needle rollers is also a great way of getting the most out of my skincare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular serum seems to work quite well.  I&#x27;ve not noticed any negative side effects.  I&#x27;ve been using Hylaronic acid on a regular basis, only sometimes switching the brands.  It&#x27;s hard to pin point any specifics since it&#x27;s already in my skincare routine.  However, like I said I haven&#x27;t experienced any adverse effects since using this one now for about three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  Sample Provided for Testing &amp; Review</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product!!  I thought it irritated my skin at first but decided it was something else that I should&#x27;t use on my skin.  Anyway, the company offered to refund the full price of the product--which I didn&#x27;t accept.  I&#x27;ll certainly order this again.  Everyone should use this on their face.  Also, this company is great to do business with.  Enough said.</li>
            <li> My second bottle! This stuff is great for the face !</li>
            <li> No joke, I love them beauty serums...reason being is that they work!  This Hyaluronic Acid Serum is some serious stuff.  It totally holds like 100% times its own weight in moisture which in turn plumps up them fine lines and wrinkles.  I&#x27;ve been using this serum daily and gaining unbelievable results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this serum to my family and friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product for free for testing purposes.  My opinion is 100% my own and I would not recommend something that I wouldn&#x27;t use myself.</li>
            <li> Delivery:&lt;br /&gt;Since this product was bought through Amazon the delivery was quick and easy. I got the product in two days as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging:&lt;br /&gt;Adeline has put a lot of thought into their packaging design and it shows. The bottle is wonderful and sleek and anyone who is into packaging design will be impressed with this display.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost:&lt;br /&gt;Considering this product is normally in the 60 dollar range for many other beauty retailers this one is a steal at $35.25US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to do with Hyaluronic serum:&lt;br /&gt;So this product is said to help with anti-aging however I do not see that as a possibility fully. I was reading articles on websites like beautyeditor.ca and though it says that hyaluronic acid serums can help with wrinkles that so much of the product would have to be used that results might not be visible for months.&lt;br /&gt;In my case I was more interested in this product for its other effect; clearing acne. It turns out that hyaluronic acid is a great way to overcome mild acne! For me, I am 29 and being able to have clean pores is always a plus so using the hyaluronic acid and seeing this as a result made me love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Verdict:&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic serum is a big deal right now in the beauty world and I am starting to think that this product is better for people with more acne prone skin as a moisturizer rather than an anti-wrinkle solution. However that does not mean this product is not great! I did see improvement in my skin; just not dealing with wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other:&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product for free as a sample and my review/opinion is my own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month, and it is my go-to for my face regimen, which includes applying this product twice daily--once in the morning and once in the evening.  I use it in combination with their eye serum, both of which I received free-of-charge, to review.  I was a bit apprehensive as I&#x27;m very picky about my face care products and opt for products like Dermologica, Skinceuticals, Arbonne Anti Aging and Prevage, among others.  I didn&#x27;t know if an organic product (which is what I&#x27;d really love to use all of the time) would be as effective as they other top brands.  The product has a wonderful feel, goes on smoothly and evenly, and you can feel the heat from the hyaluronic serum going to work.  Just enough to know it&#x27;s working.  I&#x27;ve been so delighted with the Adeline Serum and so happy to finally find an organic product that I can use without sacrificing quality. I strongly recommend this product, and the price point is perfect, too. The packaging is beautiful, and I really feel like I&#x27;ve found a boutique facial care line of products that meets my stringent face care needs, and my desire to choose green, organic products over conventionally manufactured products.</li>
            <li> Very nice serum.  Goes on nicely - then after using the Adeline Moisturizer, my skin feels great.</li>
            <li> I love this product and all it has done for my skin. I combine this with the Adeline Moisturizer and it makes my skin feel and look beautifully healthy. I love that I am getting all the essential nutrients my skin needs to continue to look young and beautiful as I age. I also love the soft scent it has when i first apply it to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FOR FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED OPINION</li>
            <li> If you’re in the market for a new set to add or replace like I did to your facial routine, Adeline is it. I’ve only been using it for 2 weeks and I’ve clearly seen a big improvement on my face and neck, I had a problem with dark circles under my eye and it has lightened it up and my face is has gotten rid of the blemishes and my skin tone is one complexion now.i received this product in return for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> This was a very interesting product. I had never used a Hyaluronic Acid Serum so I wasn’t quiet sure what to expect. The gel went on nice and smooth and within several minutes I could feel a tightening sensation. After a few days of use I could notice a difference however I never saw skin firming as an issue for me. I really like the smell, it’s like an aloe fragrance and it goes on cool. I didn’t have to use much and it didn’t hurt my skin so I think I will continue to use it, can’t hurt. I received this product for free for testing purposes however all thoughts and opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> This is awesome! I am a newbie to skincare and this is so easy to use. Just one pea size amount for your whole face. My face is starting to feel firmer and is feeling so much better. I was given this product for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I am someone who really didn&#x27;t need this product but my good friend does. She has been asking around for a good product that can help her skin not look so dull. I on the other hand do not have wrinkles yet ** Thank God ** I have fair skin with a few blemishes here and there, My redness in my face is something I have to control because it is just there. My friend did review this product and has seen a change in her skin. It has tightened and looks so much better then it has in the past 2 weeks. She feels so much youthful and a lot better about how she feels on the outside.  I did review this product for free. These are my own words 100 %!</li>
            <li> Adeline Hyaluronic Acid Serum with Vitamin C really love this product has made my skin soft and  new. Taken any of dryness, and dullness of winter away and left fresh look and feel.&amp;#34;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY UNBIAS REVIEW</li>
            <li> I have used this two night now and I must say I see and feel a difference the next morning. I think it&#x27;s best to use right after a shower when your pores are open. Only time will tell if its a gimmick/quick trick or if it truly has lasting effects. So far so good.It came with some other items and was packaged well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get over how silky smooth my face feels after putting this serum on!  I want to keep touching it!  I plan on ordering the anti-aging moisturizer from Adeline to put on afterwards.  I feel good about the ingredients in both of these products that I am hopeful for positive results the longer I use them. I&#x27;ve only been using this serum for a little over a week now, but I can feel such a difference!  The real test is if (or when) I get compliments about how much younger my skin looks!  I&#x27;m 61, so I&#x27;m not expecting miracles, but I think using Adeline products will postpone the nip and tuck!</li>
            <li> I am 75 years old, fair skinned, and I don&#x27;t want to look younger, I just want to have a healthy skin. This works for me. It is easy to use,  Apply on clean skin, don&#x27;t forget sunscreen. It is simple. The way I like it.</li>
            <li> In just a few days, I noticed my skin appeared brighter and didn&#x27;t feel so dry.  I&#x27;m not &amp;#34;that old&amp;#34; but have started to see some fine lines and wrinkles beginning to appear.  This product by Adeline has given me a more youthful appearance and is a wonderful refreshment for my face.  This product is healthy, paraben free, and a great skin products.  I will definitely be reordering and adding this to my permanent skin regimen.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:46dd97fbe569e101d036fde178855f65]]Love it as a hand lotion - leaves my hands feeling firm, smooth, and refreshed feeling.  And most importantly for my daily handling of technical objects with shiny, glossy surfaces, this absorbs fully into the skin.  Takes perhaps 30 or 40 seconds, then absolutely no oily residue - any residue at all would be a deal killer, but also doesn&#x27;t leave the skin feeling raspy (and why I stopped using the last one that claimed no oily residue, yet made my palms dry and tacky).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is pleasing as well.  As for the pump, periodically I may get a touch of a splutter, yet otherwise consistent, measured amounts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Discounted price offered for evaluation purposes, but all future purchases are my own.  :)</li>
            <li> Well, I was a little nervous testing this out, based on the name, however, I was pleasantly surprised that it just felt like jelly on my face- no stinging, tingling, or any other sensations, besides wet and cool. The corners of my eyes have noticeably tightened up after 10 days of use, and I think that my cheeks are smoother, too. I am pretty pleased with this product, and the bottle looks nice and sleek above my sink.</li>
            <li> After about 4-6 days of applying once a day (directions say you can use twice daily) I noticed the new acne that had previously formed between my brows had dried up and flaked away. As this wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting (the product didn&#x27;t list &amp;#34;will miraculously desolve zits from your face&amp;#34; in the benefits) I decided to put it to another test. My back. I have always suffered from acne that only gets slightly better in the summer months amidst the pool and summer sun.&lt;br /&gt;A year ago my boyfriend treated me to a massage in a salon. I apologized to the lady in advance and she shrugged and told me not to worry. When she did look closely at my back she said, &amp;#34;Oh, you have chicken skin! That&#x27;s all!&amp;#34; I didn&#x27;t know what she meant, so she printed me out info on kerotosis pilaris. The cliff notes - no &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s just annoying, and it&#x27;s caused by excessive skin cell build up at the hair follicles. A year later, I received a trial of this Hyaluronic Acid Serum by Adeline and thought &amp;#34;really what could it hurt?&amp;#34; Well, let me tell you. I had Sam rub it in my back every day. Since they recommend following with a moisturizer, I chose coconut oil because I use it regularly anyway. The acid helped enhance the effects of the oil. My skin seemed to absorb it better. My back is super soft and dare I say, supple. It also cleared up my acne outside of a few small things. While it hasn&#x27;t been able to clear up the old marks, I am confident that if I continue using it, it will in time lessen the scarring. In 15 years, this is the clearest my back has been. It&#x27;s normally oily and at the same time, dry and itchy beneath.&lt;br /&gt;image After&lt;br /&gt;At this rate, I&#x27;ll actually be able to get the tattoo I&#x27;ve had my heart set on and be able to feel confident at my wedding! I received this product in exchange for my unbiased opinion, and I&#x27;m very happy I did!</li>
            <li> Love this serum! It&#x27;s super packed with awesome ingredients. I did some research on Hyaluronic Acid and it&#x27;s a plumper. People have this injected into their skin to plump up creases in wrinkles. It helps with collagen production and a dewy appearance. Yes please! It has Vitamin C which improves collagen production and reduces spots and improves skin texture and appearance. I have been using this in combination with their eye serum and anti-aging moisturizer and I love them all! This is lightly scented with lavender and has a nice consistency. It&#x27;s gel-like and spreads easily, absorbs quickly and feels a little cool on application. I would definitely recommend this and keep this in my beauty routine. I already seen an improvement in the lines in my fore head and apply it daily. If it&#x27;s working already, can&#x27;t wait to see my skin in a few weeks!&lt;br /&gt;  Ingredients include:  Deionized Water, Sodium Hyaluronate (hyaluronic acid), Aloe Barbadensis Juice, Phenoxyethanol (preservative), Witch Hazel Extract, Acrylates/C 10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, MSM, Potassium Sorbate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Hydroxide, Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate, Lavender Oil, L-Arginine, Retinyl Palmitate, Cholecalciferol.&lt;br /&gt;  Disclosure; I received a product sample to facilitate my review however the opinions expressed here are my own.</li>
            <li> I have recently fallen in love...with a skin care line!  It&#x27;s called Adeline Skin Care.  It is a small, family run business focused on producing great skin care products without a lot of nasty chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adeline Skin Care sent me this product to try at no cost&lt;br /&gt;About the Serum&lt;br /&gt;Adeline Skin Care&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum contains Retinol, Aloe Juice, Vitamins A,C,D,&amp;E, and Witch Hazel.&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a 1.7 oz pump bottle and retails for $59.99.  That may seem like a lot of moolah, but believe me, a little of this stuff goes a long way!  For me, it takes two tiny pumps (about a pea sized drop) to cover my entire face-neck area.&lt;br /&gt;How to Use It&lt;br /&gt;To use this serum, after washing and patting dry your face/neck, all you have to do is apply a small amount all over your face/neck area and let it dry (usually within 1-2 minutes).  Then you go about business as usual with your moisturizers, makeup, etc.&lt;br /&gt;What I Thought About It&lt;br /&gt;Several things that I initially noticed and loved about this serum were its lightly herbal scent and how my face immediately felt tightened.  I have noticed also after using it for a few weeks now that my moisturizer seems to work better.  My face seems hydrated for longer stretches.  I have even been able to start going makeup free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can safely say that I LOVE this serum. Before trying this product out, I didn&#x27;t have a serum in my beauty regimen; but now I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it!</li>
            <li> At 56 I&#x27;m trying to fight signs of aging as much as possible. I love everything about this serum!! From the airless pump bottle to the wonderful all natural product inside.  I love the fact that this serum is packed full of powerful ingredients. Vitamin C &amp; Retinol And Vitamin E and all three work amazingly well together and add Hyaluronic acid to really moisturize my skin. First and most importantly for ME is that this serum doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling oily or sticky. I am able to use it both morning and night on my face and decolletage area. This serum has no scent and spreads quickly and absorbs quickly. Be sure to spread your serum in an upward motion. &#x27;Ya know every little bit of upward motion helps fight gravity!&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels amazing!! The fine lines around my eyes look so much softer and a lot less puffy.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely amazing product!  The serum has no scent. I love the consistency, it&#x27;s easy to apply, a small amount spread easily and absorbs quickly. A small amount of serum goes a long way so this bottle will last a long while.&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I have received complimentary or free products for the purpose of this review. The opinions are 100% mine. I have not been influenced in any way. This review is solely my opinion and the information provided is what I personally experienced using Adeline!</li>
            <li> This product has an amazing texture, its soft and smooth and so easy to apply.The pump bottle make its easy to get just the right amount.I apply once a day and my face is very moisturized and refreshed.It dries really fast so i can apply makeup and not have to worry about smearing it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product awhile now and as I was reviewing it I was trying to distinguish it from other serums that are similar that I have also reviewed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, it&#x27;s the buzz word right now in any beauty magazine. So it was a treat to try something so popular. I&#x27;ve been using them for months now, and there&#x27;s a few things to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, if you do an at-home chemical peel, this is a must for after.  It simply IS necessary.  But also, after sunburn or any irritation, it also is soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, I am using it before makeup with no other moisturizer or serum or primer. I feel like I don&#x27;t need it. I do use a sheer tiny bit of SPF 30 but just a bit.  The nice thing is it doesn&#x27;t gum up with my foundation and make that weird pilling on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, it absorbs quick, and doesn&#x27;t stain pillowcases like some vitamin C products.  I think the term &amp;#34;acid&amp;#34; is a bit deceiving...this is not acid like you imagine battery acid. It&#x27;s a soothing moisturizing lotion that just feels good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as effects go, my skin is smoother than before, especially around my eyes where I have skin spots from sun.  Along my jawline there is a softness too.  The sides of my nose, those weird folds, don&#x27;t look as deep.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just a temporary filler, since I use this twice a day, I will let you know if I stop using it and that changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, I like, and this is a big bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rec&#x27;d this as a sample to inspect and review.</li>
            <li> I love Adeline Beauty products and this is my favorite of their products thus far. This serum is thick, creamy, absorbs rapidly, and leaves the skin feeling divine in its wake. It works well with vitamin A serums and other beauty creams and regimens. Remember to follow with a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Disclosure: I was provided a sample for reviewing purposes but a positive review was not asked for or promised or implied.  Every year that I get older, I end up using these beauty products to try to prolong my youthful appearance.  Needless to say, I&#x27;m not sure if using beauty products like this work.  I&#x27;m always reluctant to believe claims of beauty products diminishing surface lines and wrinkles especially when they don&#x27;t contain retinol.  I tried Adeline&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum to see the difference.  It did hydrate my dry skin but it didn&#x27;t do much in terms of tighten or removing wrinkles.  I like that the serum is alcohol and paraben free so it won&#x27;t dry or irritate your skin.  The serum is more like a gel like substance and it takes awhile to settle into your skin.  Overall, it&#x27;s great product to moisturize your skin.  If you&#x27;re looking easy ways to remove wrinkles, I think the best treatment is to avoid UVA/UVB rays and wear sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Have you been using Hyaluronic Acid Serum as part of your everyday skincare routine yet?  Well, you should be!  I only discovered Hyaluronic Acid Serum awhile ago when I was sent some to review for my blog and I have been hooked ever since.  Lately, I can&#x27;t get enough of this one that Adeline sent me to review for them!&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic Acid Serum by Adeline does so many great things for your skin.  Not only does it contain Hyaluronic Acid but it also has Vitamins A, C, D, E and Retinol.  All those ingredients combined helps your skin feel more hydrated, toned, smooth and it also helps even out your skin tone, diminish fine lines &amp; wrinkles and even gives you a little glow!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the serum in my evening skincare routine and applying it to my face, neck, decollete and my shoulders.  The serum is lightweight and is easily absorbed and it leaves my skin perfectly hydrated so there is no need to use any additional moisturizers.  When I wake up in the morning my skin look and feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is a small family run business with great products. I love this product and the way it makes my face feel. I use the eye serum, the hyaluronic acid and the moisturizer. It makes my skin look great. I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FOR FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED OPINION.</li>
            <li> My first impression? The 1.7 oz. bottle of Hyaluronic Acid Serum is just that. It is very liquid gel and doesn&#x27;t take much to cover your entire face. I believe I used a pump and a half.  NOW my favorite this morning was the Anti-Aging Moisturizer with Matrixyl. Two pumps and a nice thicker cream came out. It smelled lightly of peppermint and was a great wake me up!&lt;br /&gt;Since I have applied both products I do have to say that my skin feels lovely!&lt;br /&gt;You can find both of these wonderful products at&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/anti-aging-moisturizer-cream-antioxidants/dp/b00kveevnw/ie&#x3D;utf8?m&#x3D;a2ne1xkbwkz2te&amp;keywords&#x3D;adeline+anti-aging+moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/hyaluronic-acid-serum-moisturizer-alternative/dp/b00gmxize2?ie&#x3D;utf8&amp;keywords&#x3D;adeline+hyaluronic+acid+serum&lt;br /&gt;The Hyaluronic Acid Serum advises to use twice a day and so I will be following that directive.&lt;br /&gt;Please note!

            <li> This is so much easier to plug into my phone than the original one was.</li>
            <li> 62 years old…..Noticeably tighter and smoother texture to skin….have tried lots of products….much much more expensive then Hyaluronic Acid Serum without the same result….Plus…their customer service has been incredible…I own my own business and am quite picky about cost. svce&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything I buy on Amazon I check customer reviews and they make a tremendous impact on whether I purchase said product…So Ladies….try this one…Moisturize after serum dries will give you skin you can&#x27;t believe…</li>
            <li> I’ve been experimenting with different face creams and serums. Adeline’s Hyaluronic Acid Serum contains Retinol, a blend of Vitamin A for elasticity, collagen formation, and sun damage repair; Vitamin C for improved moisture, elasticity, and tone; Vitamin D to moisturize skin and promote healing; Vitamin E for anti-oxidant protection and non-greasy moisture! I was intrigued and how effective this serum would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions&lt;br /&gt;Use twice daily, once in the morning and once at night.  The hyaluronic acid serum will draw in the moisture from the environment as well as from the moisturizer deep into your skin for a great hydrating affect. Moisturize your face and neck every morning and/or night after you cleanse and tone. Always moisturize your face and neck in upward motions. Moisturizing is important for all skin types. In every step of skin care always use circular, upward motions with a gentle touch on your face. Don’t help gravity by tugging down on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Serum has a consistency slightly thinner than Aloe, it has a faint lavender scent. It absorbs quickly into your skin and is pleasant to use. I like that it was packaged in the airless pump container because there is less chance of contamination and its easier to use than the little eyedroppers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this Product Complimentary for Evaluation purposes.

            <li> No problems with this vendor. Everything came fast and as described.</li>
            <li> Adeline&#x27;s serum works well. The serum is slightly thick, more like oil than other watery serums I have used. It has a very slight citrus odor and absorbs nicely in my skin. My skin feels soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic acid has been shown to reduce small wrinkles in skin. It has been around for a long time and really works. This serum combines Hyaluronic acid, Vitamin C, D, and E, Witch Hazel, and Aloe for a nice combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum comes in a tall pump bottle. The silver base and cap look elegant. The pump delivers a very small single dose of serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels great on my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A free sample was provided for review.</li>
            <li> I love love love this serum. Instantly made my face feel tighter and firmer without the burn of harsh chemicals like other products. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Great effect from using this serum.</li>
            <li> I am crazy lately over all products that contain Vitamin C as well as Hyaluronic Acid.  This one is light...goes on easily and feels wonderful!  It seems to even out my skin tone...aging does awful things to skin...so whatever I can do to keep fine lines away...I will do.  This serum is easy to use, feels good on, and hopefully keeps tiny wrinkles at bay.  It&#x27;s gentle and sort of fuels my skin with good things!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My thank you to the manufacturer for sending me this product.  I used it and gave it my honest thoughts.</li>
            <li> Two days and I can see and feel improvement already!!! I will be as repeat customer!!! Awesome product for a very reasonable price!!!!</li>
            <li> Loved it. Will buy again</li>
            <li> I am a 33 year old female who is starting to not look  as young as I would like. I have found this product to add a glow to my face that I did not see prior to using it, and I am excited I came across it per a close friends recommendation.</li>
            <li> Love it, I will get it again</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s not a bad product per se, but I have been using it for about a month, and don&#x27;t see any changes or improvements at all.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first as I have tried many different serums.  This one, however, much to my surprise and delight, has begun to change my complexion with fewer lines and smaller pours. Definitely a product to check into.</li>
            <li> I have been using this at night for about a month and am already a big fan of this product! From the first time I tried it, I loved how lightweight and refreshing it felt on my skin. I have noticed a new glow to my skin already! Very fast shipping, too!</li>
            <li> I love this serum! My face feels softer and smoother. And my pores appears smaller. I hope it improves even more with continued use.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I finally found something for my sensitive skin!!! What a fantastic product. You will love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SERUM!  I use it after cleansing in the morning, and follow up with moisturizer/sunscreen.  It tightens up pores and makes skin so smooth for foundation.  I&#x27;m so glad I found it!</li>
            <li> Really nice skin care product.  I love the way it feels on my face.  Great bargain too.  I would order it again.</li>
            <li> Gives my skin a plumper and smoother appearance.  Use on my face and the tops of my hands to improve surface appearance.</li>
            <li> After seeing the reviews, I decided to give this product a try. I love the way it makes my skin feel. I&#x27;ve only used it a short time but can&#x27;t wait for more improvements. The customer service with this company is awesome!</li>
            <li> Excited to use this. I have heard great things. Just got in the mail two days ago. Already started to use it. Goes on smooth, making my skin feel soft. Feels hydrating. Love it so far</li>
            <li> I love it and could tell after the first use!!  I have already told many of my friends about this product!!</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed this serum. I found that this product really adds to the benefits of the Adeline Anti Aging Moisturizer Cream. I have noticed that my skin is more supple and plump when I wake up in the mornings. I noticed that this really helps my makeup blend into the skin easier and more evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that this serum is not oily at all and is a gel consistency. I am used to most serums being of an oil base and not always works for those with oily to combo skin types. I believe this serum is best suited for those with oily to combo skin. An important note is that this serum has NOT made me break out!!!! That&#x27;s a HUGE bonus! This serum does not really have a smell. It applies best immediately after washing your face with warm water, while your pores are still open. I feel that really allows the product to soak in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FOR FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED OPINION.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using this product, there was no heaviness and it went on light and fresh. I have never tried any of these products before so I was anxious to see how it would work. I did notice some firmness after a couple of weeks of using. I would most definitely try this product again.</li>
            <li> Had,never tried this brand before.  A bit drying but I like it.  At my age nothing but a face lift will make a huge difference.  Good price</li>
            <li> Just got this 1-2 weeks ago,  definitely see improvement in skin tone,  texture, less wrinkles (yeah) and minimized pores.  So far so good,  love how my skin feels dewy fresh. Tnankyou thankyou</li>
            <li> I was sceptical of this product before I bought it but I love it! I haven&#x27;t been using it for long but I can already tell a difference!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! Combined with the Adeline moisturizer I am so very happy with my purchase and will be sticking with line! No heavy fragrance, feels light and smooth going on and is quickly absorbed. I am very picky about my products and recent sent back a whole skincare line by a well-known supermodel..... I purchased based on the reviews I read here on Amazon and I can tell you they were on point! I have found my longterm skincare line!</li>
            <li> I just started using the Hyaluronic Acid Serum just under two weeks ago but this product goes on so smoothly and it feels firming as well immediately when applied to my face.  The packaging is attractive and very professional and classy looking. I will definitely continue using this product and I look forward to the positive effects on my skin that I have experienced so far!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the serum for a few days and like it. So far I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in skin but will update my comments after a month. I follow up with a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping! I got this right away and am absolutely in LOVE with it. My acne seems to be doing better since using this product.</li>
            <li> This hyaluronic  acid serum was a pleasant surprise. Usually my face and eyes react negatively to moisturizers and make-up, but I had only positive reactions to this product; it applies smoothly, smells pleasant, and leaves my skin softer than before. What a wonderful find!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. This is the best feeling product ever. I could see a difference right away. Love it!</li>
            <li> I like the product. It is a little drying but the directions say to put moisturizer on after you put it on, that helps the drying,  I had a clogged pore and I believe this helped it unclog.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best I have ever purchased.  Magic in a bottle, i use this with the derma roller. I&#x27;m looking younger every day  Thank for such a great product highly recommend this product will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> these age defying products are in general just hype.  This one is no exception.  wont buy again to be sure</li>
            <li> Using this in conjunction with another product and both together seem to be working as predicted. This is non greasy and easy to apply and a little goes a long way. Definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am write a review on this product, to say the packaging is very professional, and liked the serum. When I applied the product, it felt like a mask. I applied moisturizer over it and liked how it felt. I would recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;An I will be reordering.</li>
            <li> Ive noticed no difference as of yet other than face very shiny for awhile. i may have bought something other than what im looking for but this has done nothing noticeable so far</li>
            <li> This acid serum used for your face works pretty good. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong active ingredient so it won&#x27;t peel your skin, but will work great as any other facial cleanser. Has some vitamins in it, which keep your face looking healthy and fresh. I am a facial cleanser addiction, I love trying them all, and getting as much as I can get.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I first received it as a trial and got a FULL bottle for free!  I just reordered my 2nd bottle and will continue to use it forever!  Within a week I noticed fine lines diminishing and my forehead seemed smoother, my skin was just better looking all around.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week but after day 1 I was already hooked. It has a nice smell and didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. It has a cool, tingly feeling with it, but in a good way. It immediately made my skin feel tighter and firmer. I feel like with continued use my skin will appear more toned and tightened.&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product for free in exchage for my unbiased opinion</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for about 3 weeks.  Is it supposed to be a miracle worker like they say and work in just a few days?  I don&#x27;t believe there is anything that works that fast.  No noticeable change noticed yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of skin care products and this one works really well. My skin feels a little tight right after use and the crows feet disappear. I&#x27;m happy with the results.</li>
            <li> like how easily the product is to apply....a little goes a long way...........made my tiny lines look less noticeable</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really loving this product. Leaves my skin feeling soft and fresh. Scent is light and summery. I am a 35 year old mom of two...I figured it was time I start stepping up my skin care. This serum is helping me look and feel great!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about three months. So far, I am pleased with the results. I have noticed that my skin looks and feels smoother, and also seems to be more firm.</li>
            <li> I love how it smells, and it has already improved where I had really deep smile lines. I can tell I don&#x27;t need to use as much cover-up as before as well! I struggle with dry skin, so I&#x27;m glad it said to use along with a moisturizer because it is very light, which is nice. I don&#x27;t feel like it is too heavy.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff! My face is so smooth after! Will be getting again real soon and recommending it to others as well! Thank you for the free sample!!&lt;br /&gt;-Savannah</li>
            <li> You will not find anything better over-the-counter.  The amount of serum you receive relative to the price is hard to beat and the performance is something I&#x27;ve not gotten out of any store bought anti-aging product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not one to post positive comments just to please.  If it&#x27;s a good product, I&#x27;ll shout from the roof-top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on the roof......&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m shouting..........&amp;#34;AWESOME PRODUCT.  YOU WILL GET RESULTS!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my face, neck, and post pregnancy tummy.  I definitely see a difference!  My only complaint is that it makes my naturally dry skin feel even drier.</li>
            <li> Started using this product a week ago &amp; within a few days my face looked brighter &amp; my age spots were clearing up!!  Best product by far for sun damage skin!!  I will be back!!  Very happy:-)</li>
            <li> Love this product...after 2 days my skin looks fabulous!  My otherwise larger pores are minimized and my skin looks smooth.  Still working on the lip lines though.</li>
            <li> Works great, and I love that it has some natural ingredients like Lavender Oil in it. I have found my product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a couple of weeks but I think I do see a difference.  My skin tone has definitely evened out some.  Red spots and sun spots have atually lightened up.  My skin is very soft and wrinkles do seem lessened.  I think since it is non-toxic, it&#x27;s a very good deal!</li>
            <li> I really like this product alot.  Not greasy or oily on face.  I like the way that it feels, &amp; the fact I can wear under my makeup.  A little amount goes a long way.  I&#x27;ve only used for a short time, but believe I am definitely seeing some improvements in my skin.  I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I waited about 3 months before I decided to do this review. I am very picky when it comes to skincare. I believe my routine should be quick. I would use this serum after I used a cleanser in the morning. It kept my face feeling tightened and smooth. After 4 weeks I started to notice my skin had a natural brightening. I would certainly recomend this for anyone, old or young. I am excited to purchase! I received this for free but all opinions are mine.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think my fine line and wrinkles were that bad to begin with, but I feel this product is definitely keeping things that way, keeping that &amp;#34;crepey&amp;#34; look around my eyes and forehead in check. The other day I mentioned my age while filling out an insurance form, and the person looked at me and said, &amp;#34;Wow, I would have guessed ten years younger!&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  I have recommended it to friends and family !!!</li>
            <li> I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FOR FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED OPINION.&lt;br /&gt;I could tell a difference the first time I used this product along with the moisturizer. my face looked better and wasn&#x27;t dry. I will be buying more once It runs out!</li>
            <li> I am more impressed everyday when my skin gets tighter with each application.</li>
            <li> So far I love this product. People have been remarking that I look more rested since I started using this product and it is the only change I&#x27;ve made to my appearance.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I had two brown sun spots that are seriously fading after only a few weeks.  Make up goes on so smoothly after applying the product.  I highly recommend the serum!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!!!!!! I finally found something that really works I have been using  this product for several weeks now and I am getting so many compliments on my skin even my lines around my mouth are finally disappearing  and believe me they were deep now I was going to get some shots done but now I do not half to thank you for this great product. IT REALLY WORKS!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> So far, I love this serum!  It&#x27;s easy to use and requires very little effort on my part!  I am using it in conjunction with a vitamin c serum and have noticed my skin feels a bit firmer and my wrinkles a little less angry looking.  I am 38 and wrinkles are starting to appear.  However, I am still a minimalist when it comes to aging skin care and this has been perfect for me.  I am using it as a summer time moisturizer (very lightweight and absorbs quickly) and will be able to easily use it under a heavier moisturizer in the winter.  I also love the pump on this bottle...it pushes up from the bottom, so you won&#x27;t have unreachable, leftover serum at the bottom of the bottle.  I always hate throwing away unused product because you can&#x27;t get to it.  So this will be nice!  I will definitely order this again and will order from the same company.</li>
            <li> Very effective and not greasy</li>
            <li> Excellent product and much better than a another brand that is no longer available. Better moisturizing and skin brightening results.</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with how this makes my skin look.  I put it on in the morning after I shower and it immediately makes my wrinkles around my eyes look better and my face look younger.  I am 61 years old and have tired a lot of creams and lotions, because I have sensitive skin and really thin skin under my eyes that tends to get dry and show the wrinkles.  This really smooths all that out and gives me a healthy, younger look.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Seems to soften my facial wrinkles when I used it with OZ Naturals - The BEST Eye Gel, Cream For Dark Circles Puffiness for over two weeks.  I put moisturizer cream after applying it.  Love it.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I am still on my first bottle of this and I do like it. I am 54 so my wrinkles are very obvious but I do think it helps to diminish the looks of them. I&#x27;m glad I ordered it and will continue to use for a longer period to see more results. I&#x27;m a skeptic so I have to see results but I think it is really helping.  I did receive an offer for 50% off the 2nd bottle, so that was great incentive too!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> yes I do love this after you put on vitamin C serum and then moisturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;c</li>
            <li> Love this product, it&#x27;s cleared my skin up even though that&#x27;s not what I think it was meant for and it feels wonderful going on, very lightweight!  Would recommend this product to anyone looking to smooth their skin&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have been using the serum for four weeks now and my skin already looks and feels better. I was also really impressed with how fast I received it! I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have only used this five times since I purchased it but I can already see the difference it makes! My skin looks and feels younger.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  Im 68 years old and don&#x27;t expect miracles. But I love the way this serum makes my face feel. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see any difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Yes it is &#x27;The Best&#x27;. On my second order.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 42, caucasian , normal to dry skin. I&#x27;ve been using this serum for more than 3 months, just got my second order. It does what is says, it leaves my skin soft and refreshed, I  use it in the morning underneath my moisturizer and before going to bed. It&#x27;s good to use it also around your eyes, it won&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. It&#x27;s not a miracle! you have to be consistent as with any other skin product , I was using the expensive Lancome serum but I&#x27;ve changed it for this one, does the same and cost a lot less. So far so good. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It has done nothing for me, but certain things work for certain people.        11/19/14 Update: Although this product did not work for me, the founder of the company is just great!! He has addressed my issue and has taken care of everything, plus some. I&#x27;m not going to say what he did, as I don&#x27;t want anyone taking advantage.    He has great customer service and attitude towards his product not working for ME. Like i said some products work for some and not for others.  I will certainly try other products from this company    Thanks Mark!!! 5 Stars for your company&#x27;s customer service!</li>
            <li> I love the hyaluronic acid serum.  It works very well on my skin, keeps it clear and looking fresh.</li>
            <li> Have been using this serum for almost two weeks and have noticed significant smoothness and reduction of appearance in fine lines/crows feet around my eyes. So surprised to see how quickly this is working. I am 29 years old, but have spent all of my life in the California sun, not being stringent with sunscreen or skincare in general until last year. Have tried a few other products that did not seem to make any real difference. Excited to see the results after a couple of months using this, as I refuse to get anything injected in my face. Would highly recommend this product, especially for the price - can&#x27;t beat it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> After reading so many goid reviews i thought i will try it, did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now but I haven&#x27;t seen the amazing results other people have been talking about. So either their skin is all jacked up and they see these results or they are paid to say it. BUT, it does seem to help my moisturizer sink into my skin a lot better since pairing the the two together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean really nothing is going to make your wrinkles disappear that comes in a bottle sorry folks.  But I do like that it helps my skin get better hydration.</li>
            <li> my wife said its best product she use and told her sisters and friends about it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a skeptic. Really. But I have to say whether I wanted to just believe or I actually have seen a difference, I believe this does make my skin look better and feel better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using it, it can dry a little stiff but then I put some moisturizer on and that goes away. If I don&#x27;t use a moisturizer, I can get dry spots. I had no trouble with any reaction or redness. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a scent or any side-effects that I have experienced. It soaks in quickly and seems to make things look a little smoother and less puffy. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now (most days, not all) and most of the time, after use, I see a difference. I usually use two pumps to cover my face and neck so this bottle will last quite awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for testing.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way. It feels very creamy and my skin feels fresh and, “just plain good”. I have only used it for about a week now so I haven&#x27;t really seen any changes in the texture of my skin but I do like the overall look and feel so I do intend to continue using it. I have had no redness, itching or peeling from using it and I do have sensitive skin so I am happy with this. I will update my review in a few weeks after I have had a chance to use it a while longer.</li>
            <li> My wife is using this and says that a little goes a long way. It feels very creamy and her skin feels fresh and, “just plain good”. She has only used it for about a week now so she hasn’t really seen any changes in the texture of her skin but she does like the overall look and feel so she intends to continue using it. She has had no redness, itching or peeling from using it and she does have sensitive skin so she is happy with this. I may have to try it for myself since she is pleased with it and will update my review in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> So many positives for this product. It feels great on your skin and I can actually see the difference after one week. I keep it with me and apply throughout the day under my eyes to feel refreshed and add extra energy to my day ( give it a try). It has great packaging and it is 2 oz where most other similar products are only 1oz.</li>
            <li> ADELINE not only created a hyaluronic acid serum enhanced with Vitamins A, C, D, E, Retinol and Aloe and witch hazel, but the company makes this serum very easy to use. The pump the serum arrive in is solid, fits the hand well, and one press of the top delivers the little pearl that is all you need to treat the cleansed face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Men will want to use this, too, as it is strong but not irritating. The serum stimulates collagen, firms and plums the skin, which as a result rids the skin of fine lines and wrinkles. It also (for some reason) rids the face and back of hands of brown age spots - a definite plus - and all of this is accompanied by a soothing comfortable sense when applying.  It is best to pat the face (or hands - or both) gently to enhance the [penetration into the skin. Then once dry, apply a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use it twice daily for maximum effect - you will be surprised how quickly the benefits are noticeable! Grady Harp, January 15</li>
            <li> This product is great !  You need to try it.</li>
            <li> Made my skin feel young and tight.</li>
            <li> I can really see a difference… Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I use this under my moisturizer and have been for over a month. I haven&#x27;t noticed a lot of improvement in fine lines but it does seem to keep my skin smooth. I use it on the backs of my hands also. It keeps my skin moisturized better than creams and lotions alone.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Not only has it help to smoothe my skin , but it has totally eliminated the hormonal break out Tht I was battling.  I would highly recommend this product.  I have tried so many different products and not one of them could compare to this stuff.  I just can not say enough good things about this product.  I highly highly recommend this product .</li>
            <li> I HOPE THIS WORKS, SO FAR AM HAPPY WITH PURCHASE.</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with how this makes my skin look. I put it on in the morning after I shower and it immediately makes my wrinkles around my eyes look better and my face look. I have found this product to add a glow to my face that I did not see prior to using it,the product diminishes wrinkles and moisturizes also with no harsh chemicals. It&#x27;s made in the USA I love that. I received this product for free in exchange for a unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Very effective product.  I love  how it makes my skin so smooth.  It has a light texture to it and goes on so great.  A little goes a long way, I only use a few drops a day along my smile lines ( I smile a lot)  and also crows feet.  I highly recommend this product!  You will love it too!</li>
            <li> This product is Grwat. Very happy and will order again.</li>
            <li> So far one of the best Hyaluronic Serums I&#x27;ve tried. Recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I used to make DIY Vitamin C serums. This comes in a beautiful  package and is nice. Felt nice after using and observed no side effects. Sample was provided for a review.</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to review 3 Adeline skin care products, including: Hyaluronic Acid Serum, Anti-Aging Moisturizer with Matrixyl and the Organic Eye Serum, with the sole purpose of sharing my unbiased opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall Purchasing Experience: A+&lt;br /&gt;I always love when I can find a product on Amazon because I think that it just immediately makes the purchase experience better than other retailers right from the start. The same applies here. I ordered all three Adeline products and received the product super quickly through Prime shipping, in just 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Packaging and First Impression: A+&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was good, with each bottle arriving in a smaller box. The bottles are nice – good quality material with the pumps on each functioning as expected. The labeling and overall appearance gives the product a classy look, and I enjoyed using them daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Review: A&lt;br /&gt;I am very blessed to come from a long line of women in my family who are all quite youthful in their appearance. Much to my children’s chagrin, most people are shocked to know that I have a 19, 16 and 14 year old – or that I am bordering 38 years old. I love the fact that my skin is still fairly youthful – and that I am not knee deep in researching or trying everything under the sun to battle wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that – I was eager to try a new skin care line as the years are passing quickly and it never hurts to be prepared or to be proactive. I was truly impressed by all 3 of these products, and would highly recommend that they be used in unison. The Hyaluronic Acid Serum goes on smoothly and leaves your skin feeling tighter, clearer and refreshed. There were times before I added the Anti-Aging Moisturizer with Matrixyl into the mix that my skin felt a touch dry, but that would be expected with this type of treatment. Once I added in the moisturizer – it was the perfect balance that my skin was craving. I also want to share that,even at 37 – I still fall victim to acne breakouts. My skin has never been clearer since using all 3 of these products! Even if I never produce a wrinkle, I would still use Adeline because my skin is super clear!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite product of the 3 is the Organic Eye Serum. I am so not a morning person and often wake up groggy with bags under my eyes and my hair standing on end. No – this doesn’t fix bed head, but it does fix bags…and awesome-ly at that. You can feel a slight tingle as soon as you apply the Organic Eye Serum and immediately you are assured that it is indeed working. But besides the tingle you can feel a tightness and see the bags begin to disappear. Like magic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer Service: B-&lt;br /&gt;When I first ordered the products, I had done a quick google search on the ingredients. I felt comfortable that there were no animal products used in the making of the Adeline skin care, but I wanted to be certain. I sent a quick email to the company and they replied back stating that their products are never tested on animals (great!) and that they were pretty certain that the ingredients were not animal based. I would have appreciated a firm yes/no or let me find out – versus a “pretty certain”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend? Yes&lt;br /&gt;I had a great experience with the 3 products being used together and would recommend doing the same.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I will be ordering more when I run out.  I have noticed that the sun spots have disappeared. REALLY!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also gotten compliments!  That is also nice to hear so it must be working.</li>
            <li> Very nice serum, just had my 55 birthday so thought I would step up my skin care routine.  Traded in the expensive serums a while ago for Nicci Marie Hyaluronic Acid Serum, this is a great serum. But I use prescription 25% Retin A, and using Hyaluronic Acid and Vitamin C is a more effective routine.  So Great Price Positive reviews I tried this one.  Very Similar this one seems to tighten skin a little more.  I use it alone just put a makeup primer on and go,  and let it dry for several minutes to get absorbed into skin.  Just adding an update after using regular for about 6 8 weeks, this product has tightened pores, has visibly reduced the deep wrinkles on my lower jaw line.  So impressed with this serum.  I apply in morning rinsing my face well, apply serum let dry for no less than 10 minutes before primer.  I am lucky that I use rx Retin A 25% daily at night.  Love this stuff.  Shipped Quick Packing Secure.  If you have sensitive skin be careful as this might sting.  Very Happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> Product did not do what it claimed to do.  Seller very promptly refunded my money.  I appreciate that.</li>
            <li> You can definitely tell there is a difference in my forehead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product a little over a month now and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference. My face is smoother and  my well earned but hated wrinkles have improved. The price is right for the amount of product that you get.</li>
            <li> I received this Adeline Hyaluronic Acid Serum and used it for about two weeks. I did not notice any adverse reactions like blocked pores and breakouts. It rehydrates the skin and it&#x27;s lightweight and easy to use. It&#x27;s reasonably priced for its effectiveness. Hyaluronic Acid Serum is the hottest ingredient in skin care right now. It is also RISK-FREE &amp;#34;Bottom of the Bottle&amp;#34; Guarantee -the company  stands behind the products 100%. Even if you use the entire 2 oz. bottle, send back the empty bottle if you&#x27;re not completely thrilled, and they&#x27;ll refund your entire purchase price!</li>
            <li> I have only used it maybe a month.  Time will tell.</li>
            <li> I like this product so far.  Must use for several months to see if it works as well, if not better than product being used now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will check back in, in about 3-4 months.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this serum to me and I have never been happier! The serum was delivered quickly and packaging was intact. The serum is lightweight and compliments my other skincare products. I&#x27;m looking forward to finishing my first bottle and will post the results I see!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a few days and already see a noticeable difference. It is refreshing to buy a product that actually does what they say it will do. It is also very affordable.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Love this product, in just a few days, I have noticed a difference, will continue to re-order it. I have tried many skin care products, and this by far is the best I have found. My order arrived sooner than I expceted.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, vitamin C is the most important skin care ingredient to keep the skin looking smooth and youthful.  I would no more skip a day of using a product with vitamin C than I would skip getting dressed for the day.  It&#x27;s the first thing I do every morning after washing my face, put on a vitamin C serum then moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adeline is one of the serums I&#x27;ve used.  It feels good on the skin and smells nice.  It works as well as serums that are twice the price.  I was given my bottle as a review product and I can recommend it to others.  The company is great and the product is essential.  Why not buy some and try it yourself?</li>
            <li> The best that I can say is that it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I am familiar with, and like to use, a hyaluronic, Vitamin C serum.  There are many on the market, and even though they all contain the hyaluronic acid ingredient and the vitamin C ingredient, they are not created equally.....This is a wonderful combination of those two ingredients, plus there is more to this serum that takes it over the top for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in hot, humid coastal Texas, and many serums are too heavy for me to use during the summertime.  This one is superb:  It is light weight, and not sticky.  &amp;#34;Not sticky&amp;#34; is a major plus for me.  I don&#x27;t know what other serums contain that make them sticky, but this one does not have it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Witch hazel is an important ingredient for me:  I look for it in all my facial products.  This Adeline serum has it.  I wish my mother had clued me in to the benefits of witch hazel back when I was a teen.  I would have been a much happier person back then.  Oh well...As it is, I discovered witch hazel later in life and have faithfully used it since.  It really made a change in my facial skin.  It tightened my pores and smoothed my skin, and I hardly ever see bumps or blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The touch of lavender essential oil suspended in this beautiful, gel-like serum makes application a heady and lovely experience.  It is just the right, slight, amount of fragrance.  It lifts me for the moments I am applying it, then disappears and does not interfere with my perfume fragrance.  (It also does not attract insects...which is a problem I&#x27;ve had with some serums.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last, but definitely not least, this serum comes in a nice-looking, convenient bottle with a quality pump head.  After having dealt with so many serums in brown bottles with rubber droppers, this quality packaging is much appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a sample product from Adeline Beauty.</li>
            <li> I received this a few days ago and I started using right away.  Hopefully it will help the fine lines and even the brown spots.  I used  my essential oil moisturizer after but I rec the companion moisturizer so I am going to &#x27;give it a whirl&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Adeline Hyaluronic Acid Serum for a few weeks now and have seen an improvement in my skin&#x27;s appearance.  I use this on my face, neck,  decolletage &amp; just started using it on the back of my hands.  As I&#x27;ve aged, the skin on the back of my hands has gotten wrinkly. Adeline&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum improved the appearance of my hands too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to use:&lt;br /&gt;Wash &amp; pat dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;If you use toner, apply toner first.&lt;br /&gt;Apply a pea sized amount of serum to face &amp; neck (I use it on my hands &amp; decolletage too)&lt;br /&gt;Allow to dry. (It absorbs quickly, isn&#x27;t greasy &amp; doesn&#x27;t take long to dry)&lt;br /&gt;Follow with moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;For best results, use twice a day, morning &amp; evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A quick search turned up some interesting information on hyaluronic acid.&lt;br /&gt;~ It increases hydration&lt;br /&gt;~ Improves elasticity&lt;br /&gt;~ Reverses free radical damage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Hyaluronic acid is a vital, natural component of the skin. It is produced by the fibroblast skin cells which produce collagen; collagen is what gives the skin the firmness and health. Replenishing the skin with hyaluronic acid slows down the aging process.  This serum also contains Vitamin E, Vitamin D, Vitamin A and Vitamin C, MSM along with Lavender oil, and Aloe Vera.  These ingredients work together to help slow down my skin&#x27;s aging process, while improving my skin&#x27;s appearance at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though you&#x27;re using Adeline Hyaluronic Acid Serum, it&#x27;s important to keep up a good skin care regime. I use this serum in the evenings after I cleanse my face, then facial moisturizer after the serum has dried. In the mornings I use moisturizer. Once a month or so I exfoliate my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;m happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;review sample provided</li>
            <li> No remarkable changes</li>
            <li> i just ordered another. this stuff is awesome i really do wake up pretty and younger. and it keeps pimples away. really is a miricle. i will keep buying this!</li>
            <li> I was encouraged to try this serum by my sister in law, who had been using it with good results.  I immediately loved it!  My skin felt so much softer and smoother after just a few uses, and (very important!) it didn&#x27;t cause me to break out.  I have normal/combination skin, and need only this serum in the hot, humid Iowa summer weather.  When it&#x27;s colder and dry, I layer a light moisturizer on top.  Love it and will continue to use!</li>
            <li> WOW THIS IS GREAT STUFF!  SOFT, SMOOTH AND VELVETY SKIN. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used countless &#x27;wrinkle products&#x27; and this one feels really good on my skin - you can tell it&#x27;s doing something as it really wakes up your skin - love it - and the customer service is FIVE STARS too! LOVE this seller...</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I am enjoying this product very much. I think that it makes both my moisturizer &amp; night cream go on more smoothly. My skin feels very clean &amp; fresh</li>
            <li> WOW! I don&#x27;t know what else to say. I&#x27;ve added this product to my regimen twice daily and it has done wonders to my face! I&#x27;m 58 and looked 68, if not older. Too much sun as a child! After 21/2 weeks of using this, my husband asked if I had Botox. Now he uses it also!! I can&#x27;t express enough how GREAT this HA works. Am getting ready to order 2 more bottles! If you are looking for something natural to erase those stubborn wrinkles, try this! They are a wonderful co. that stands by their product and customers. You have nothing to lose with their money back , empty bottle promise. But, trust me, you&#x27;ll love the results!!</li>
            <li> I have noticed that I need to use just a very small amount in the morning and my skin feels great! I use the Hyaluronic Acid Serum and then my moisturizer and finally my makeup base.  I also use it at night right before I go to bed. I love the product and am glad that I got it.</li>
            <li> nice texture ... Watery and not greasy at all.  My face definitely feels hydrated after use.  I use it morning and night.</li>
            <li> I rec&#x27;d my Serum quickly, with ease of ordering.  The product looks great in the packaging, &amp; my face feels fresh when I use it.</li>
            <li> I received the Adeline Hyaluronic Acid Serum Free and for review.  I was very impressed with the exquisite packaging.  The serum comes in a pump with silver accents.  It is very eye appealing and would make me, as a consumer, look at it twice on a shelf.  The pump itself is extremely easy to use and distributes the perfect amount.  The serum is clear and not at all cloudy, which is also eye appealing.  It goes on very smoothly.  It does not burn, but has a nice cooling sensation.  The first ingredient listed s deionized water, which gives it that smooth, cool feel.  I used it twice, once at night and once in the morning.  There were days I apple make-up after use and days I left my skin bare.  Either way, the serum did not make me feel as if I had anything sticky or greasy on.  At night, I used it under my moisturizer.  There is no alcohol so it is not drying and it contains vitamins.  I did notice a difference in the fading of my fine lines and wrinkles.  I also think my skin looked less dull.  It did not look shiny or greasy, but rather brighter.  I would definitely recommend this product as I was pleased with its usage and results.</li>
            <li> It is Ok so far.  Not much change so far</li>
            <li> The third ingredient, after water and glycerin is propylene glycol, anti-freeze!  I just used it for the 2nd time, once last night and again this a.m. My face feels very weird, kind of hot, kind of like it is going to break out in a rash. My advice is stay away from this product.  I am going to wash my face, even though I will have to reapply make-up.  Read up on propylene glycol - there is a big picture of --you guessed it--anti-freeze!</li>
            <li> I am a professional in the Hair Industry with an extensive resume in the celebrity field. I have fair skin with a few blemishes here and there, I have went through a few different products and have not seen considerable results until I found this! I was willing to give it a try like everything else. It has been about 4 weeks and the area around my eyes is much firmer, smoother, and youthful looking to say the least. This will be a staple of mine in my skincare repertoire;) For any non believer trust me I know how it is but listen, its a completey &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; product and hypo-allergenic, its inexpensive, and the result is a more beautiful you! What else can be said! Wow! I sound like an infomercial but hey, truth is truth;))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You ASC for a great product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Hayden</li>
            <li> I love it!  Can actually feel tightening of my skin after a week</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using the serum daily since it arrived. Since it&#x27;s too soon to see the permanent changes it will make (it takes roughly 28 days for new skin to emerge) I will update my results next month. But the immediate benefits of this Hyaluronic acid can be felt right away. My skin feels softer and is retaining more moisture than ever before. It&#x27;s not greasy or oily, but smooth and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is Alcohol and Paraben Free. It arrives in a 50ml /2oz clear and silver pump bottle with a plastic safety seal around the top. You will have to prime the bottle and pump it several times to begin the flow of serum. You will only need 1-2 pumps max to cover your entire face and neck/decollete. Allow the serum to absorb before finishing with your favorite moisturizer and SPF in the daytime or night cream in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 12/17/14: I am still using Adeline&#x27;s Authentic Hyaluronic Acid Serum after almost every face wash while my skin is still moist, so it sops up all of that lovely hydration. My skin feels great. It is very smooth and soft to the touch. This was my first Hyaluronic Serum and it&#x27;s still the one I am using to this day. The bottle lasts a very long time. 5 months later and I am on my 2nd pump. With your moisturizer in the morning, it is a great makeup primer that leaves your skin looking even and toned. My skin has improved quite a bit since receiving this Hyaluronic Acid Serum.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference at all yet and I&#x27;ve been using the product faithfully for 2 weeks. My under eye puffiness is the same. None of my brown spots have lightened and wrinkles are not diminished. It gets a 2 only because my skin feels soft and not dry. Appears to like it just fine.</li>
            <li> This hasn&#x27;t helped my wrinkles &amp; I am 44 approaching 45. I am most concerned about my wrinkles  close to my eyes......I am told I ihave eyes that speak</li>
            <li> I received this serum at no cost to me from Adeline Beauty to review on my blog. I like this serum and would have actually given it a 4.5 out of 5 stars if that option were given to me. This serum absorbs into skin very fast and works comparable to other serums I&#x27;ve tried. I do feel it is better suited to oily skin and combination skin -- like mine -- for spring and summer use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum seems to be good at oil control like a toner. However, due to the frigid temperature in my area, my skin is more on the dry side and I need to keep those oils. So I will use this serum in late spring through early fall when my oil glands like to work overtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to warn to wear sunscreen with this. While it does a good job with improving tone, the sun will reverse those effects if you do not keep your skin protected.</li>
            <li> **I received this free product to review. I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the FTC Regulations.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going to bed feeling drab? Wanna wake up feeling like a new you? Try ADELINE Hyaluronic Acid Serum. I am completely impressed with this serum and will begin by saying that you should most certainly invest in this product. I am not one for high maintenance and this product is very easy to use and to get results with. I simply use it in the morning after getting dressed and then put it on before bedtime. Literally, these miniscule moments take away years from your skin if you continue to do it twice a day. You WILL see results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not wear make up but with applying this serum, who even needs concealer. This product left my skin feeling more youthful then usual with the skin firmer and with a natural glow. The uneven complexions have lessened and even my small scar appears to be more transparent. The Vitamin A in the serum provides a collagen formation and repair from the sun damage from years of accumulation. Whereas, the Vitamin C provides improved tone and moisture. Vitamin D heals the skin while the Vitamin E restores the skin and leaves no sign of greasy appearance or white blotching as can be found in serums and lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I applied it to my sensitive skin I waited for any side effects or strong fragrance and found none. I had no burning, no tingling or obnoxious alcohol scents as with most facial cleansers and some serums. This product was definitely sensitive to my skin! The bottle is decent size for the price and very easy to use with its simple pump action. The pump bottle should last quite awhile if you use only twice daily. I am really loving using this product and feel not only youthful and better about my appearance but it also smells wonderful like Spring on its way. I will continue to use this in my daily routine now and when I run out get more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check it Out and BUY IT TODAY to begin a NEW YOU!e this in my daily routine now and when I run out get more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check it Out and BUY IT TODAY to begin a NEW YOU!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:701f942932757ada221316c16c0869f5]]Did Adeline Hyaluronic Acid Serum work for me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely. You see your skin becoming plumper, more hydrated and visibly more youthful with the first application. You don&#x27;t want to use this in lieu of a moisturizer (serums are meant to be applied underneath serum). Instead this makes your moisturizer more effective and allows your skin to retain moisture; one reason why you should apply it on slightly damp skin. make sure your skin and pores are clean to readily absorb the vitamins in the serum; it&#x27;s always best to exfoliate at least once a week for the best absorption of serums. The vitamins in this are ideal for promoting skin cell turnover and diminishing free radical damage so you really want to take full advantage of that by prepping your skin. I did a comparison of my moisturizer using this on one half of my face and none on the other, and the serum side definitely looked fresher and the skin looked firmer with fine lines temporarily filled in. Oh, and the subtle lavender scent is divine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using the serum daily since it arrived. I apply it to my skin either at night, or just before putting on makeup in the morning.  I have EXTREME dry skin.  Prior to this product, I used a lot of moisturizer on my skin, and it still remained dry, or would get dry during the day.  When I use this product, it keeps my face from getting scaly all day long.  Usually, gel like products burn my skin as they soak into it-- this does NOT!  My face is NOT greasy at all.  It makes a great base coat for makeup in my opinion. It also dries fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is Alcohol and Paraben Free. It arrives in a 50ml /2oz clear and silver pump bottle with a plastic safety seal around the top. You will have to prime the bottle and pump it several times to begin the flow of serum. You will only need 1-2 pumps max to cover your entire face and neck/decollete. Allow the serum to absorb before finishing with your favorite moisturizer and SPF in the daytime or night cream in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adeline Beauty provided me with free samples of products to review, and I was under no obligation to review it. Nor was I under any obligation to write a positive review.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two weeks. One pump from the bottle is all that is needed for my whole face and neck. What a great value! This bottle will last a long time! My skin is sensitive, and this product has not irritated my skin in any way or caused any breakouts. I feel like I am doing something good for my skin!</li>
            <li> After about 10 days of use so far, it seems to be a good skin-firming product. I use it at night before bed and am happy with the result in the morning.</li>
            <li> Product made no difference to my skin.  I feel imy age  (84) has been the reason.  Im sure if i were much younger,&lt;br /&gt;there wouldhavbeen adifference</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product! It works great and smells wonderful as well. It is very light feeling and absorbs very quickly. It works wonderful and quickly to remove the fine lines around my lips, I am a smoker. Also I have noticed the lines around my eyes improving as well. It has left my skin feeling much softer and more moisturized. It is hard to tell what the long term benefits are without using over a longer period of time, but I have already noticed results and will be continuing with the use of this product. I would definitely recommend and would also give this item as a gift to another that I was purchasing skin care related items for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product for my review purposes, all thoughts are my 100%% unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> The vitamins, well we all know how important those are. Vitamin E heals and reduces inflammation, vitamin C heals, protects and reduces discoloration, vitamin A speeds cell turnover, giving you a fresher set of skin cells to sport around like a new face -- retinol is a synthetic vitamin A and does the same thing. I&#x27;ve been using this for a while and am really pleased with my face. I have been using this at night for about a month and am already a big fan of this product! From the first time I tried it, I loved how lightweight and refreshing it felt on my skin. I have noticed a new glow to my skin already! Very fast shipping, too!  I received this free to try and love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since June and although I am a skeptic as far as claims by beauty products, I tried this. I had been using another product and I had decided to try this on one half of my face so i could compare them. After several weeks I switched to using just this serum. I can put this on and my face feels great. Other products make my face feel tight but dry I had to use additional moisturizer or a sunscreen afterwards. This makes my face feel make up ready or I apply a light moisturizer or makeup after I use it but i do not feel like I have to as I did with other products. I may put on additional moisturizer at night but it depends on how rough my day has been on my skin. I will be seventy this year and work outside in the heat and cold, sun and rain or snow. I am Irish, everyone in the family has some form of skin cancer so I am very aware that I need protection. I have gotten compliments on my skin and the fact that they cannot believe I am that old from a dental assistant who was very up close and personal. I really think that this product will always be within reach when I wash my face wherever I am!</li>
            <li> I USE THIS PRDUCT DAILY. I USE IT EVERY MORNING.I HAVE USED IT WITH OTHER FACE PRODUCT AND IT WORKS GREAT WITH THEM. IT DOES HAVE A BIT OF A SMELL KINDA LIKE LAVENDER.I LOVE THAT IT ABSORBS FAST LIGHTWEIGHT.ITS NOT GREASY.  I LIKE THAT YOU ONLY NEED A SMALL AMOUNT OF IT FOR YOUR WHOLE FACE, SO THE BOTTLE WILL LAST AWHILE. THIS PRODUCT IS USED FOR: MOISTERIZING DEEP INTO YOU SHIN FOR A GREAT HYDRATING AFFECT.  I DONT LIKE THAT THEIR ISNT S.P.F IN IT. I GOT THIS PRODUCT FOR FREE TO DO AN HONEST REVEIW ON IT SO THIS IS WHAT I THINK ABOUT THIS PRODUCT 100% MY OWN THOUGHT</li>
            <li> I ordered this serum a few months ago and I just finished it. I found it worked really well with my combination skin. I used it in the evenings, after removing my make up, and it absorbed quite nicely. I loved that the scent wasn&#x27;t overpowering, and the bottle lasted me quite a while. I received the product promotionally for review, and I really enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> I love the appearance of my skin after using the product. I plan on ordering this for years to come. There are all the ingredients anyone needs in an anti-aging serum. I prefer serums personally and no one knows or even comes close to guessing my age - never having had or will entertain the idea of surgeries when I count on Authentic Skin Care products.</li>
            <li> I applied it twice daily for a little over a week and noticed I started to feel like my skin was not only firm but felt fresh if that makes sense. I do not believe I currently have wrinkles but I’d dearly love to avoid them if at all possible for as long as possible. I like that it does not have a strong scent, it isn’t oily, it does not dry out your skin either and one pump of the bottle seems to be enough to cover my entire face. Good job with portion control, I actually think this product is worth the price and will last you a good long time! I’m hoping to avoid those laugh lines, with the Acid Serum you can seriously feel your skin feel tighter! I didn’t have any bad reactions (I’m very sensitive skinned usually), it wasn’t unpleasant and did not sting or burn at all. It has been pretty much a pleasant experience each time I’ve used it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a free copy of product for a review. My opinions are 100% honest and my own.**</li>
            <li> For reviewing purposes, I had a chance to try out Adeline&#x27;s organic hyaluronic acid serum and it&#x27;s a holy grail for me. Because it has lavender oil, the serum has a light lavender scent that is not overpowering or aggravating to your skin.   The airless pump bottle is a new trend in beauty/skincare because it&#x27;s more hygienic and more efficient. A half-pump is enough serum to cover my entire face. I start my morning by mixing this and Adeline&#x27;s anti-aging moisturizer. My face stays moisturized throughout the day.  After trying this out for a while, I&#x27;m able to see the difference in my skin when I use this. My skin feels firmer and softer and it looks more &#x27;glow-y&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Adeline Hyaluronic Acid Serum for 10 days, and I love it! I like the look of the bottle - it&#x27;s very elegant - and I like that it&#x27;s clear in the middle so you can see the serum, which is also clear. Since you can see it, you&#x27;ll be able to tell if you&#x27;re running out. The cap is easy to remove and put back on; it glides on and off very smoothly. The airless pump is also very easy to use and it dispenses just the right amount of serum - you don&#x27;t need very much. I dispense the serum on my finger tips and then spread it all around my face, to diminish my surface lines and wrinkles, and to plump and hydrate my dry, sagging skin. I use it every night, after I&#x27;ve removed my makeup, and before I apply my moisturizer. The serum has a slight refreshing aloe scent, which is nice, because it doesn&#x27;t bother me. I actually look forward to my bedtime routine every night because my skin feels so refreshed after applying the serum. In fact, I think this serum is already working! It seems like I have less surface lines and wrinkles and my face is not dry anymore. It&#x27;s nice not to have dry, itchy skin now, and of course, I like having younger looking skin. I will definitely continue using this serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FOR FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED OPINION</li>
            <li> Does not leave a greasy feel after applying. I really love this product. Enough hydration to keep the dryness away but not too much that it leaves my skin oily and greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Product is as promised</li>
            <li> LOVE THE FEEL...DEFINITELY REDUCES FINE LINES WITH REGULAR USE</li>
            <li> This is a great product that leaves the skin noticeably soft and refined with a healthy glow after washing.  I am very pleased!</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion, but it did not work for my age spots. It&#x27;s expensive for a lotion that doesn&#x27;t deliver as promised.</li>
            <li> Skin care can be really confusing.  It&#x27;s easy to collect a drawer full of little bottles, but difficult to remember what product goes with which, and  which one to use first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adeline Beauty has removed confusion with the Hyaluronic Serum with Vitamins C and E and Retinol--and with lots of other really, really good stuff.  It&#x27;s the perfect basic layer on clean skin.  Done.  Feel free to use peels, day and night creams, and mosques, but this is your skincare workhorse.  It&#x27;ll make everything else work better, and your skin will thank you for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Adeline Hyaluronic Acid Serum with Vitamins A and E and Retinol is a high end product.  It feels luxurious, smells lovely, is safe around eyes, and takes the guesswork out of combining products.  If you use it consistently, your skin will look great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product received for review.</li>
            <li> Over the last year or so I discovered hyaluronic acid and vitamin C serums.  I love the way they hydrate, soothe, reverse aging and sun damage and renew my middle aged skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beneficial ingredients in Adeline&#x27;s serum are hyaluronic acid, aloe, witch hazel, retinal palmitate (vitamin A), lavender oil, L-arganine (stimulates anti-aging hormones), Tocopheryl acetate (vitamin E), ascorbate (vitamin C) and cholecalciferol (vitamin D).  The combination of these ingredients truly help combat the sagging, wrinkling and poor texture of aging skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple of ingredients I don&#x27;t like seeing in beauty products I use: Phenoxyethanol (preservative made with benzene), and sodium hydroxide (lye, used as a pH adjuster).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for about ten days now, smoothing it on my clean face morning and night.  I like that it absorbs and dries quickly, leaving my skin ready for a moisturizer or makeup.  I can feel the tightening effect of it especially under my eyes, where I have the beginnings of eye bags.  The skin on my face is smooth and fresh looking in the morning, and my eyes look younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a mid-priced serum, I think this is a very nice product that helps improve skin&#x27;s appearance and hydration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary sample of Adeline serum for testing and review purposes.  I wasn&#x27;t asked to leave a positive review, nor was I compensated in any way for offering my honest opinion of the product.</li>
