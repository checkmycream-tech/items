            <li>I have been very happy with the results of this product (and the cleansing conditioner) and the price is a lot easier to swallow than the WEN products!</li>

            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>YES, it has GREAT slip.</li>
            <li>Great product my hair loves it</li>
            <li>It truly does help with fly aways and frizz, but not on humid days</li>
            <li>This smells great, and gives my hair a sleek shiny look.</li>
            <li>This is the best and most lightweight leave in conditioner I have used.</li>
            <li>The most amazing spray from L&#x27;Oreal !!</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a good value for it&#x27;s price</li>
            <li>It smells really good, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>, I had to press with a good amount of pressure.</li>
            <li>This replaced my Nexxus spray which I loved too.</li>
            <li>It makes my afro shape up nicely and is great for my morning hair refresher.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Actually, the L&#x27;Oreal shampoo conditioner is really good also as you wash once and then do not need to put in any added conditioner.</li>
            <li>But for us this works great and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I plan on buying the shampoo and conditioner after work today and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll find more great results!</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li>My favorite product!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE the smell!</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve tried many!  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair, and this is a great detangler.  </li>
            <li>Amazing to use.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>its ok.. not the best…i bought this because i loved the cleansing conditioner… but this leave-in is just so - so….</li>
            <li>Honestly i didnt not notice a difference in my hair or my kids hair.  </li>
            <li>Loving the way it makes my color treated aging hair feel.</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent</li>
            <li>This remedied itself and now comes out in a very nice, fine mist.</li>
            <li>The original product was great- scent as well as effect on my unruly hair.</li>
            <li>I have the kind of kinky curly hair that is suitable for afros.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did, it smells amazing and my hair feels amazing.</li>
            <li>It is easily applied and smells good.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply to my hair.</li>
            <li>And I wasnt a fan of the smell, its very strong.</li>
            <li>Also smells so good, a warm yet clean scent.</li>
            <li>but the Spray leaves your hair smooth and soft,and it smells good too</li>
            <li>This detangler and leave-in conditioner has a pleasant, mild fragrance.</li>
            <li>Very lite weight product yet surprisingly moisturizing and good at getting rid of frizz.</li>
            <li>the downside, the scent is really strong and kind of cloying.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling fuller with more defined wave/curl.  </li>
            <li>This product uses Amodimethicone, which ,most of us know by now, coats hair with a film and does not allow moisture in to the hair, eventually drying out the strands.</li>
            <li>Love the evercreme line of products.</li>
            <li>LOVE using this after each shower.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It works ok</li>
            <li>Ok so I am 61</li>
            <li>Love this, never see it in the store anymore.</li>
            <li>love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I both love this.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>The EverSleek products are fabulous though!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it every time I shampoo, but more like once a week.</li>
            <li>It does not flatten it out at all , it makes it more hydrated looking.</li>
            <li>Having used many leave-ins for my curly color-treated hair, I have to say I am more than pleased.</li>
            <li>It works better for him than shampoos.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s perfect for coarse keratin treated hair....</li>
            <li>smells great and takes tangles out very well.  </li>
            <li>Will be purchasing 2 more bottles</li>
            <li>I sprayed this product on my hair and the fragrance is cloying and overwhelming.</li>
            <li>My hair is healthy and untreated in any way.</li>
            <li>I just wish it had a bit more of a moisturizing effect on MY hair.</li>
            <li>but it is not cruelty-free which I know is not the concern of everyone but is for many others.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s not what you want! :)</li>
            <li>I am totally in love with this Product and</li>
            <li>i love the scent and texture.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more of a cream than a liquid</li>
            <li>It retains the moisture pretty good</li>
            <li>Very, very strong, sickly sweet smell.  </li>
            <li>I just got this last week at Target mostly b/c of the great smell, but after using it, my hair shines, it&#x27;s not as frizzy, my fly-aways are under control, and my hair looks healthy.</li>
            <li>I love this spray to moisture my hair, its comfortable to use and the effect is immediate</li>
            <li>Love all of loreal&#x27;s sulfate free hair care.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice a difference in softness for my hair (which is why I give it 4 stars), but it does smell good.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s fairly easy to find, and it works well for styling.</li>
            <li>I love this leave-in conditioner by L&#x27;Oreal to leave my hair feeling soft and smelling good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Very very good for dry indian hair</li>
            <li>My baby fine fine loves this product.</li>
            <li>I have fine spiral curls.  </li>
            <li>Not heavy, smells good, easy to control application/spray.</li>
            <li>This spray smells wonderful and I am usually not a lover of smelly hair stuff and it leaves my hair feeling soft and frizz free.</li>
            <li>Really i have used like all kind of hair spray&#x27;s before to get my hair smooth but not greasy and THIS IS THE ONE ..</li>
            <li>it keep it smooth and hydrated for all day along ..</li>
            <li>Have bought my second,  is great for curly hair</li>
            <li>It is light and seems to work well.</li>
            <li>With that said, I only gave it three stars because while it is certainly great for detangling, I don&#x27;t feel that it ADDS any moisture to my hair.</li>
            <li>Works great on my coarse, curly, color-treated hair.</li>
            <li>Spray it on, scrunch it in, and enjoy the curls.</li>
            <li>yet it still sprays out of the nozzle evenly and like a light mist.</li>
            <li>It smells so good and leaves my hair so soft</li>
            <li>This product leave my hair so soft and smelling so good.</li>
            <li>My hair tangles very easily, and this product gets the knots out very well.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite product - EverCreme does it again!</li>
            <li>Great for detangling, smells good, like vanilla creme, some people might think it&#x27;s too strong, but the smell doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try it</li>
            <li>I was so excited to discover this product.</li>
            <li>My hair warmed up to this new leave-in  quite nicely.  </li>
            <li>Have to use a lot to get your hair clean</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten a few compliments on how good it smells, but I can&#x27;t justify buying these products just because it makes my hair smell nice.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very soft and gives it a nice shine.</li>
            <li>I was really happy to find this on Amazon, as i could not find it in local stores after the first purchase.</li>
            <li>The consistecy is wonderful, not watery, and not too thick.</li>
            <li>My hair has never been softer, and full of bounce.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft, smooth &amp; very light.</li>
            <li>- Smells very good, like a sweet vanilla/sugary scent with a small hint of something herbal.</li>
            <li>I have seen tremendous results with my hair.</li>
            <li>My favorite leave in conditioner, mainly because of the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Now my hair doesn&#x27;t need the normal routine of Organix products going through it as my hair looks so much better with this product.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t gotten good results using this on dry hair and it doesn&#x27;t help with frizziness in humid weather.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find the consistency more cream-like than a liquid.  </li>
            <li>Overall I am happy with this so far.</li>
            <li>I bought this product about two weeks ago and started using it right away...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at ALL (which when you have VERY fine hair like me, is really easy to do).  </li>
            <li>use all of the other products in this line, excluding the co-wash, and they are excellent for extremely dry hair.</li>
            <li>An exception could be made if regulatory authorities required it for safety or regulatory purposes.&amp;#34;  There are many, many other vegan and cruelty-free hair products that are excellent and do not wimp out on the last part, because the last part simply means &amp;#34;If</li>
            <li>, I would totally give it a try, its cheap too :) you can Spray it in your hands and apply it to the areas that are more dry ....</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal Nourishing leave in spray and most people were liking it,and writing their hair was not weighed down, if you have  fine hair like me</li>
            <li>Not terrible, but, at the end of the day, when I brush it through, there&#x27;s definitely product residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;ll elaborate further.....</li>
            <li>- Moisturizes/smoothes my hair pretty well.</li>
            <li>Just spray it on and run your finger through the hair first.</li>
            <li>First of all, let me tell you my hair type so that you can make an informed decision.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday for good results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even started using this after regular showers at home because I love how it makes my hair feel, and it smells absolutely wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I either blow dry or air dry and have great results either way.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased this from Amazon and have only recently gotten it again, although I love it.  </li>
            <li>Certainly [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>A little too strong and sweet for my taste, but my husband likes it and says my hair smells like candy haha!</li>
            <li>I have fine, Blonde highlighted , shoulder blade length hair</li>
            <li>My whole family uses this as a detangler/conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>This stuff is very conditioning without being greasy.</li>
            <li>not we spray her before the pool and after her shower to keep he hair smooth all day and into the next day.</li>
            <li>It acted too much like glue.  </li>
            <li>I bought the intense nourishing shampoo, conditioner, leave in spray and hair mask</li>
            <li>Much to my surprise this Leave-in spray didn&#x27;t seem to do that; my hair was really fly-away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this line.</li>
            <li>Thanks L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li>It is VERY close to matching theirs</li>
            <li>All Loreal evercreme products are really excelent.</li>
            <li>This really makes your hair smooth!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff</li>
            <li>Conditions very well.</li>
            <li>It works good in my thick semi curly frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>I use this right before blow drying and it makes my hair incredibly soft and it feels very moisturized.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, so i was worried about it weighing it down...</li>
            <li>I have EVER used better than any other</li>
            <li>I like the smell better than any other leave-in conditioner I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>(I have long, fine hair that reaches to mid-back).</li>
            <li>This new spray is simple fabulous.  </li>
            <li>It also works wonders on our son&#x27;s hair which is curly but kind of on the dry side (he is mixed).</li>
            <li>It keeps the cuticle of my hair lying flat, which means less frizz and more smooth, shiny hair.  </li>
            <li>I have baby fine blond hair that is highlighted &amp; dry.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I really like this product and will most likely be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li>NOW I know what is it that a woman who sits near me at work is using that makes me want to gag ;).  </li>
            <li>My mid-back length, fine hair feels completely natural after application, even the next day.</li>
            <li>It is pretty strong so you will not need a lot so a bottle will last several months.</li>
            <li>Do your research, read the labels and educate yourself on the good and bad ingredients so you will be better informed.</li>
            <li>Be sure to just spray the bottom half of your hair, not to close to the scalp or hair will be greasy.</li>
            <li>the less, I get a better deal on Amazon for it anyway</li>
            <li>My kids are bi-racial with their hair being more towards the black side.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many brands from drugstores and salons, and this isn&#x27;t the worst, but it isn&#x27;t the best either.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the best for detangling hair and if it needs hydration at the same time without being a heavy formula that weighs your hair down.</li>
            <li>I am really picky about hair/skin products since I have Rosacea, and extremely sensitive skin...which includes my scalp.</li>
            <li>I love this product and have been using it on and off for a few years.</li>
            <li>Though it claims to be free of heavy waxes, that is is exactly what it feels like on my hair.</li>
            <li>Find an argon oil (one that is pure, not silicone based) or some other organic oil to moisturize your hair, you will notice more lasting results.</li>
            <li>Love this for conditioning my dry hair daily.</li>
            <li>and it has caused my hair to become more stressed out, kinda crunchy in places and Dry especially the ends.</li>
            <li>This actually makes my hair kind of shiny, which is pretty hard to do.</li>
            <li>Probably because this stuff is really thick, and most detangling strays are much watery-er.</li>
            <li>if your hair is super dry I would advise that you give this product a try.</li>
            <li>This product works well without weighing my fine hair down.</li>
            <li>Especially in dry cold weather, my hair can get almost brittle unless I add moisture and this stuff is perfect AND not outrageously expensive.</li>
            <li>dry\\&quot; but considering that the product line is not necessarily geared towards my hair type (at least not from the advertisements) an \\&quot;extra dry hair\\&quot; formula might work best for me.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair soft and wavy!</li>
            <li>It does exactly as promised as well as leaving my hair especially shiny.</li>
            <li>I have only used one other product that works better.</li>
            <li>I spray it on my hand or directly onto my hair, starting with the ends first and working it throughout the rest.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pretty strong to my nose - enough to mess with my usual scent and too strong for hubby.</li>
            <li>i use it daily on wet hair before a quick dry and i feel that it does serve as a light heat protection as well.</li>
            <li>All the sulfate free products i had been using had turned my hair into a tangly,gluey mess.</li>
            <li>I love this product and it&#x27;s hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping with minimal packaging too!</li>
            <li>Makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft thati keep playing with it.</li>
            <li>or I can spray directly on my hair, which is my preferred method.  </li>
            <li>Have natural curly frizzy hair but this helps</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought this twice now and it keeps my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I still have really soft, shiny hair</li>
            <li>This stuff leaves it feeling manageable and soft.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping for something I could use in the morning to revitalize my 3B curls without having to completely rewet my hair.</li>
            <li>I have a ton of very think, somewhat coarse, wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t spray directly on hair though.</li>
            <li>ever used it leaves the hair soft and fully moisturized.</li>
            <li>it really necessary to have THAT MUCH scent in anything?</li>
            <li>Soft, supple.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair so silky soft.</li>
            <li>Smells like old women.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve realized that its difficult to find products that are not drying on my hair and smell good.</li>
            <li>I have badly wild ends due to breakage and using this is the only way I can look like I didn&#x27;t put my finger in a light socket.</li>
            <li>My hair is a little thin, very fine and light natural blond.  </li>
            <li>I bought this from my local drug store and was a little hesitant because of the price (higher than listed here on Amazon), but I convinced myself it would be worth it.</li>
            <li>The Good:&lt;br /&gt;- Smells FABULOUS.&lt;br /&gt;- Goes on easy wet or dry.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair ready for flat ironing and it does indeed help stop breakage.</li>
            <li>but it really makes my hair soft and as long as my girlfriend likes the feel of my hair</li>
            <li>First because it seemed like it was actually drying out my hair, and second because it doesn&#x27;t protect it from snarls.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use and highly recommend the entire Evercreme line.  </li>
            <li>I am African American with natural hair that I wear straight.</li>
            <li>Even after long term use, I did not see much of an improvement.</li>
            <li>bought this form my daughter who is a swimming pool dolphin after she spend to full days back to back and at the end of the second day looked like a white Rastafarian took almost an hour to detangle.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly hair which tends to get dry</li>
            <li>My hair is extremely dry from bleaching, so using this on non-wash days really helps the look and texture of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I forgot how long my first bottle lasted me, so I guess I&#x27;ll have to wait and see when I finish my current one to see how often I&#x27;ll be buying it.  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised when I sprayed this on my hair because I was used to the regular watery leave-ins...</li>
            <li>Maybe L&#x27;Oreal could make a leave in for \\&quot;extra dry hair\\&quot; which would contain a few more humectants.</li>
            <li>I have thick hair with fine, wavy strands.</li>
            <li>I use this after using Garnier Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine Intensely Smooth Leave in Conditioner, and lately in conjunction with the EverCreme Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
            <li>But I tried it anyway because it has omega acids in it which clearly was not enough</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to find a drugstore spray leave in conditioner that is somewhat similar to Enjoy&#x27;s and after trying a few others hit on a winner in this one!  </li>
            <li>It gives my hair the extra wave, while giving it the soft, touchable look.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not heavy at all but definitely leaves a silky layer that i can feel is conditioning the ends.</li>
            <li>To keep it short this product made my already dry hair feel very rough and more dry.</li>
            <li>leaves hair soft and hydrated , Tencho wicks and my hair is difficult to disentangle is weak and thin, with this product, my hair is perfect styling and a smooth , glossy finish .</li>
            <li>It seems kind of expensive for only 8.5 oz.</li>
            <li>It really did nothing but weighed down my hair.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly, dry, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>After trying the the similar WEN products--this one is just as good and much, much less expensive.</li>
            <li>My hair had good days &amp; bad.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> and it smells great too!</li>
            <li> I have been very happy with the results of this product (and the cleansing conditioner) and the price is a lot easier to swallow than the WEN products!</li>
            <li> You can spray some in your hand and rub it through your hair, and it works perfect.</li>
            <li> This detangler is amazing!!</li>
            <li> Smells great and works perfect.</li>
            <li> Loved this product!</li>
            <li> Great for detangling kids&#x27;</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> YES, it has GREAT slip.</li>
            <li> Great product my hair loves it</li>
            <li> It truly does help with fly aways and frizz, but not on humid days</li>
            <li> This smells great, and gives my hair a sleek shiny look.</li>
            <li> This is the best and most lightweight leave in conditioner I have used.</li>
            <li> The most amazing spray from L&#x27;Oreal !!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a good value for it&#x27;s price</li>
            <li> It smells really good, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> , I had to press with a good amount of pressure.</li>
            <li> This replaced my Nexxus spray which I loved too.</li>
            <li> It makes my afro shape up nicely and is great for my morning hair refresher.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Actually, the L&#x27;Oreal shampoo conditioner is really good also as you wash once and then do not need to put in any added conditioner.</li>
            <li> But for us this works great and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I plan on buying the shampoo and conditioner after work today and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll find more great results!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li> My favorite product!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE the smell!</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve tried many!  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair, and this is a great detangler.  </li>
            <li> Amazing to use.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> its ok.. not the best…i bought this because i loved the cleansing conditioner… but this leave-in is just so - so….</li>
            <li> Honestly i didnt not notice a difference in my hair or my kids hair.  </li>
            <li> Loving the way it makes my color treated aging hair feel.</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent</li>
            <li> This remedied itself and now comes out in a very nice, fine mist.</li>
            <li> The original product was great- scent as well as effect on my unruly hair.</li>
            <li> I have the kind of kinky curly hair that is suitable for afros.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did, it smells amazing and my hair feels amazing.</li>
            <li> It is easily applied and smells good.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply to my hair.</li>
            <li> And I wasnt a fan of the smell, its very strong.</li>
            <li> Also smells so good, a warm yet clean scent.</li>
            <li> but the Spray leaves your hair smooth and soft,and it smells good too</li>
            <li> This detangler and leave-in conditioner has a pleasant, mild fragrance.</li>
            <li> Very lite weight product yet surprisingly moisturizing and good at getting rid of frizz.</li>
            <li> the downside, the scent is really strong and kind of cloying.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling fuller with more defined wave/curl.  </li>
            <li> This product uses Amodimethicone, which ,most of us know by now, coats hair with a film and does not allow moisture in to the hair, eventually drying out the strands.</li>
            <li> Love the evercreme line of products.</li>
            <li> LOVE using this after each shower.</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It works ok</li>
            <li> Ok so I am 61</li>
            <li> Love this, never see it in the store anymore.</li>
            <li> love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I both love this.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> The EverSleek products are fabulous though!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it every time I shampoo, but more like once a week.</li>
            <li> It does not flatten it out at all , it makes it more hydrated looking.</li>
            <li> Having used many leave-ins for my curly color-treated hair, I have to say I am more than pleased.</li>
            <li> It works better for him than shampoos.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s perfect for coarse keratin treated hair....</li>
            <li> smells great and takes tangles out very well.  </li>
            <li> Will be purchasing 2 more bottles</li>
            <li> I sprayed this product on my hair and the fragrance is cloying and overwhelming.</li>
            <li> My hair is healthy and untreated in any way.</li>
            <li> I just wish it had a bit more of a moisturizing effect on MY hair.</li>
            <li> but it is not cruelty-free which I know is not the concern of everyone but is for many others.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s not what you want! :)</li>
            <li> I am totally in love with this Product and</li>
            <li> i love the scent and texture.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more of a cream than a liquid</li>
            <li> It retains the moisture pretty good</li>
            <li> Very, very strong, sickly sweet smell.  </li>
            <li> I just got this last week at Target mostly b/c of the great smell, but after using it, my hair shines, it&#x27;s not as frizzy, my fly-aways are under control, and my hair looks healthy.</li>
            <li> I love this spray to moisture my hair, its comfortable to use and the effect is immediate</li>
            <li> Love all of loreal&#x27;s sulfate free hair care.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice a difference in softness for my hair (which is why I give it 4 stars), but it does smell good.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s fairly easy to find, and it works well for styling.</li>
            <li> I love this leave-in conditioner by L&#x27;Oreal to leave my hair feeling soft and smelling good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very very good for dry indian hair</li>
            <li> My baby fine fine loves this product.</li>
            <li> I have fine spiral curls.  </li>
            <li> Not heavy, smells good, easy to control application/spray.</li>
            <li> This spray smells wonderful and I am usually not a lover of smelly hair stuff and it leaves my hair feeling soft and frizz free.</li>
            <li> Really i have used like all kind of hair spray&#x27;s before to get my hair smooth but not greasy and THIS IS THE ONE ..</li>
            <li> it keep it smooth and hydrated for all day along ..</li>
            <li> Have bought my second,  is great for curly hair</li>
            <li> It is light and seems to work well.</li>
            <li> With that said, I only gave it three stars because while it is certainly great for detangling, I don&#x27;t feel that it ADDS any moisture to my hair.</li>
            <li> Works great on my coarse, curly, color-treated hair.</li>
            <li> Spray it on, scrunch it in, and enjoy the curls.</li>
            <li> yet it still sprays out of the nozzle evenly and like a light mist.</li>
            <li> It smells so good and leaves my hair so soft</li>
            <li> This product leave my hair so soft and smelling so good.</li>
            <li> My hair tangles very easily, and this product gets the knots out very well.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite product - EverCreme does it again!</li>
            <li> Great for detangling, smells good, like vanilla creme, some people might think it&#x27;s too strong, but the smell doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try it</li>
            <li> I was so excited to discover this product.</li>
            <li> My hair warmed up to this new leave-in  quite nicely.  </li>
            <li> Have to use a lot to get your hair clean</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten a few compliments on how good it smells, but I can&#x27;t justify buying these products just because it makes my hair smell nice.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very soft and gives it a nice shine.</li>
            <li> I was really happy to find this on Amazon, as i could not find it in local stores after the first purchase.</li>
            <li> The consistecy is wonderful, not watery, and not too thick.</li>
            <li> My hair has never been softer, and full of bounce.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft, smooth &amp; very light.</li>
            <li> - Smells very good, like a sweet vanilla/sugary scent with a small hint of something herbal.</li>
            <li> I have seen tremendous results with my hair.</li>
            <li> My favorite leave in conditioner, mainly because of the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Now my hair doesn&#x27;t need the normal routine of Organix products going through it as my hair looks so much better with this product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten good results using this on dry hair and it doesn&#x27;t help with frizziness in humid weather.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find the consistency more cream-like than a liquid.  </li>
            <li> Overall I am happy with this so far.</li>
            <li> I bought this product about two weeks ago and started using it right away...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at ALL (which when you have VERY fine hair like me, is really easy to do).  </li>
            <li> use all of the other products in this line, excluding the co-wash, and they are excellent for extremely dry hair.</li>
            <li> An exception could be made if regulatory authorities required it for safety or regulatory purposes.&amp;#34;  There are many, many other vegan and cruelty-free hair products that are excellent and do not wimp out on the last part, because the last part simply means &amp;#34;If</li>
            <li> , I would totally give it a try, its cheap too :) you can Spray it in your hands and apply it to the areas that are more dry ....</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Nourishing leave in spray and most people were liking it,and writing their hair was not weighed down, if you have  fine hair like me</li>
            <li> Not terrible, but, at the end of the day, when I brush it through, there&#x27;s definitely product residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;ll elaborate further.....</li>
            <li> - Moisturizes/smoothes my hair pretty well.</li>
            <li> Just spray it on and run your finger through the hair first.</li>
            <li> First of all, let me tell you my hair type so that you can make an informed decision.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday for good results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even started using this after regular showers at home because I love how it makes my hair feel, and it smells absolutely wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I either blow dry or air dry and have great results either way.  </li>
            <li> I originally purchased this from Amazon and have only recently gotten it again, although I love it.  </li>
            <li> Certainly [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> A little too strong and sweet for my taste, but my husband likes it and says my hair smells like candy haha!</li>
            <li> I have fine, Blonde highlighted , shoulder blade length hair</li>
            <li> My whole family uses this as a detangler/conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This stuff is very conditioning without being greasy.</li>
            <li> not we spray her before the pool and after her shower to keep he hair smooth all day and into the next day.</li>
            <li> It acted too much like glue.  </li>
            <li> I bought the intense nourishing shampoo, conditioner, leave in spray and hair mask</li>
            <li> Much to my surprise this Leave-in spray didn&#x27;t seem to do that; my hair was really fly-away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this line.</li>
            <li> Thanks L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li> It is VERY close to matching theirs</li>
            <li> All Loreal evercreme products are really excelent.</li>
            <li> This really makes your hair smooth!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff</li>
            <li> Conditions very well.</li>
            <li> It works good in my thick semi curly frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I use this right before blow drying and it makes my hair incredibly soft and it feels very moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, so i was worried about it weighing it down...</li>
            <li> I have EVER used better than any other</li>
            <li> I like the smell better than any other leave-in conditioner I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li> (I have long, fine hair that reaches to mid-back).</li>
            <li> This new spray is simple fabulous.  </li>
            <li> It also works wonders on our son&#x27;s hair which is curly but kind of on the dry side (he is mixed).</li>
            <li> It keeps the cuticle of my hair lying flat, which means less frizz and more smooth, shiny hair.  </li>
            <li> I have baby fine blond hair that is highlighted &amp; dry.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I really like this product and will most likely be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> NOW I know what is it that a woman who sits near me at work is using that makes me want to gag ;).  </li>
            <li> My mid-back length, fine hair feels completely natural after application, even the next day.</li>
            <li> It is pretty strong so you will not need a lot so a bottle will last several months.</li>
            <li> Do your research, read the labels and educate yourself on the good and bad ingredients so you will be better informed.</li>
            <li> Be sure to just spray the bottom half of your hair, not to close to the scalp or hair will be greasy.</li>
            <li> the less, I get a better deal on Amazon for it anyway</li>
            <li> My kids are bi-racial with their hair being more towards the black side.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brands from drugstores and salons, and this isn&#x27;t the worst, but it isn&#x27;t the best either.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the best for detangling hair and if it needs hydration at the same time without being a heavy formula that weighs your hair down.</li>
            <li> I am really picky about hair/skin products since I have Rosacea, and extremely sensitive skin...which includes my scalp.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it on and off for a few years.</li>
            <li> Though it claims to be free of heavy waxes, that is is exactly what it feels like on my hair.</li>
            <li> Find an argon oil (one that is pure, not silicone based) or some other organic oil to moisturize your hair, you will notice more lasting results.</li>
            <li> Love this for conditioning my dry hair daily.</li>
            <li> and it has caused my hair to become more stressed out, kinda crunchy in places and Dry especially the ends.</li>
            <li> This actually makes my hair kind of shiny, which is pretty hard to do.</li>
            <li> Probably because this stuff is really thick, and most detangling strays are much watery-er.</li>
            <li> if your hair is super dry I would advise that you give this product a try.</li>
            <li> This product works well without weighing my fine hair down.</li>
            <li> Especially in dry cold weather, my hair can get almost brittle unless I add moisture and this stuff is perfect AND not outrageously expensive.</li>
            <li> dry\\&quot; but considering that the product line is not necessarily geared towards my hair type (at least not from the advertisements) an \\&quot;extra dry hair\\&quot; formula might work best for me.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair soft and wavy!</li>
            <li> It does exactly as promised as well as leaving my hair especially shiny.</li>
            <li> I have only used one other product that works better.</li>
            <li> I spray it on my hand or directly onto my hair, starting with the ends first and working it throughout the rest.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s pretty strong to my nose - enough to mess with my usual scent and too strong for hubby.</li>
            <li> i use it daily on wet hair before a quick dry and i feel that it does serve as a light heat protection as well.</li>
            <li> All the sulfate free products i had been using had turned my hair into a tangly,gluey mess.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it&#x27;s hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping with minimal packaging too!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft thati keep playing with it.</li>
            <li> or I can spray directly on my hair, which is my preferred method.  </li>
            <li> Have natural curly frizzy hair but this helps</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this twice now and it keeps my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I still have really soft, shiny hair</li>
            <li> This stuff leaves it feeling manageable and soft.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping for something I could use in the morning to revitalize my 3B curls without having to completely rewet my hair.</li>
            <li> I have a ton of very think, somewhat coarse, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t spray directly on hair though.</li>
            <li> ever used it leaves the hair soft and fully moisturized.</li>
            <li> it really necessary to have THAT MUCH scent in anything?</li>
            <li> Soft, supple.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so silky soft.</li>
            <li> Smells like old women.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve realized that its difficult to find products that are not drying on my hair and smell good.</li>
            <li> I have badly wild ends due to breakage and using this is the only way I can look like I didn&#x27;t put my finger in a light socket.</li>
            <li> My hair is a little thin, very fine and light natural blond.  </li>
            <li> I bought this from my local drug store and was a little hesitant because of the price (higher than listed here on Amazon), but I convinced myself it would be worth it.</li>
            <li> The Good:&lt;br /&gt;- Smells FABULOUS.&lt;br /&gt;- Goes on easy wet or dry.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair ready for flat ironing and it does indeed help stop breakage.</li>
            <li> but it really makes my hair soft and as long as my girlfriend likes the feel of my hair</li>
            <li> First because it seemed like it was actually drying out my hair, and second because it doesn&#x27;t protect it from snarls.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use and highly recommend the entire Evercreme line.  </li>
            <li> I am African American with natural hair that I wear straight.</li>
            <li> Even after long term use, I did not see much of an improvement.</li>
            <li> bought this form my daughter who is a swimming pool dolphin after she spend to full days back to back and at the end of the second day looked like a white Rastafarian took almost an hour to detangle.  </li>
            <li> I have very curly hair which tends to get dry</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely dry from bleaching, so using this on non-wash days really helps the look and texture of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I forgot how long my first bottle lasted me, so I guess I&#x27;ll have to wait and see when I finish my current one to see how often I&#x27;ll be buying it.  </li>
            <li> I was very surprised when I sprayed this on my hair because I was used to the regular watery leave-ins...</li>
            <li> Maybe L&#x27;Oreal could make a leave in for \\&quot;extra dry hair\\&quot; which would contain a few more humectants.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair with fine, wavy strands.</li>
            <li> I use this after using Garnier Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine Intensely Smooth Leave in Conditioner, and lately in conjunction with the EverCreme Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
            <li> But I tried it anyway because it has omega acids in it which clearly was not enough</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a drugstore spray leave in conditioner that is somewhat similar to Enjoy&#x27;s and after trying a few others hit on a winner in this one!  </li>
            <li> It gives my hair the extra wave, while giving it the soft, touchable look.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not heavy at all but definitely leaves a silky layer that i can feel is conditioning the ends.</li>
            <li> To keep it short this product made my already dry hair feel very rough and more dry.</li>
            <li> leaves hair soft and hydrated , Tencho wicks and my hair is difficult to disentangle is weak and thin, with this product, my hair is perfect styling and a smooth , glossy finish .</li>
            <li> It seems kind of expensive for only 8.5 oz.</li>
            <li> It really did nothing but weighed down my hair.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly, dry, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> After trying the the similar WEN products--this one is just as good and much, much less expensive.</li>
            <li> My hair had good days &amp; bad.</li>
            <li> I will admit I am a sucker for new products, especially hair products, so when I saw this new line by Loreal,</li>
            <li> Would not recommend this product for anyone with normal to slightly oily hair.</li>
            <li> The directions tell you to spray it on after a wash and condition, so this would mean wet or damp hair which is fine, but my hair likes it sprayed on when dry, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this spray every day on damp or dry hair, and no matter how much I put in it, my hair doesn&#x27;t get greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> w/ a flat iron, and will use hairspray to keep my bangs in place.</li>
            <li> Now with my hair being natural and past my shoulders, I use this product after shampooing and deep conditioning my kinky hair.</li>
            <li> and how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a spray lotion, so it doesn&#x27;t run when you apply it, it moisturizes without being greasy, and it lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a must have and I will always continue to use it as long as Loreal makes it.</li>
            <li> I have long untreated hair these days</li>
            <li> Other brands also left my hair feeling crispy like straw after about 20 minutes or so and it never went away.</li>
            <li> Also, the last 4 inches of my hair are extremely damaged.</li>
            <li> I found I had the same issue with the other EverCreme products I tried, so it seems they&#x27;re just not for me.</li>
            <li> other thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it didn&#x27;t help at all with detangling, which personally I think is required.</li>
            <li> I have only used this on damp hair but will try on dry too, per other reviews.</li>
            <li> I apply a lot of it after I get out of the shower and towel dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff every day because I have dry hair</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my dry, blonde, 2c curly hair greasy or heavy, even after several days in a row of application.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have long hair that is not exactly straight.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy, color treated hair with highlights and my hair naturally leans towards the dry side.</li>
            <li> I get a little bit of the \\&quot;crunch factor\\&quot; that was mentioned in an earlier review.</li>
            <li> I am an African American woman with very dry and thick 4B/C type hair.</li>
            <li> I spray it when my hair is half dry then blow dry.</li>
            <li> I do that, the Spray is not really watery, but Its not slimy</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel weighted down and dry (crispy) after 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had tried a few products that claim to rebuild your hairs structure but what I failed to understand is that too much Protein can actually be damaging, you can read articles on line</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep buying it, but I find I have to rotate it in/out with other products to &amp;#34;rejuvenate&amp;#34; its efficacy.</li>
            <li> I have ordered several of these because am not able to find them in stores.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a while and the one bottle lasts longer than any other leave-in conditioner I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> anyways I decided to drop the other products and read reviews for this</li>
            <li> Someone with thin hair would only need a tiny amount.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t way down my hair at all or make it look greasy like other products I have used.</li>
            <li> my hair becuase is a  dry, crunchy, tangled MESS!</li>
            <li> My hair has been harder to detangle, drier, and a little crunchy feeling (this could be from the leave in?)</li>
            <li> and I felt it was not worth it.</li>
            <li> It can be used DAILY (at least in my opinion) with oily no-build-up or stickiness.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly, wavy hair that I wash daily.</li>
            <li> This conditioner makes my hair super-shiny without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Works well to detangle my hair, but not weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> dilute it down by 50% with water.</li>
            <li> , I find that leave in products weigh my hair down, or make it greasy.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li> I mean after you use the Evercreme shampoo and conditioner, the next product should be a detangler/nourishing one.  </li>
            <li> Received item and it was half empty!!</li>
            <li> Cons: - I wish it cost less.</li>
            <li> , I won&#x27;t subject my family, friends, coworkers or myself to having to smell this on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Heavy and causes my hair to look as if I never washed it in less than an hour after use.  </li>
            <li> This gives my hair a little pick me up.</li>
            <li> i cannot imagine now not using it everyday on my hair ..</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t heavy and my hair stays bouncy.</li>
            <li> So I need heavy conditioning.</li>
            <li> I was using &amp;#34;Wen&amp;#34; for a few months .</li>
            <li> Too heavy for fine/thin hair</li>
            <li> I usually straighten my bangs</li>
            <li> I bought this in replacement of my usual product.</li>
            <li> The 1st few uses I was concerned that the product was too thick</li>
            <li> Not sure why I can&#x27;t find it on store shelves, anymore.</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you how well it works, as I cannot get past the smell.</li>
            <li> Not sure how that would have affected the performance of the product, though, as I am NOT a chemist.</li>
            <li> Not sure I would buy again.</li>
            <li> it seemed to have a hard time getting out</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve found that can manage my crazy curly hair, but I can&#x27;t seem to find it in any stores anymore.</li>
            <li> I felt kinda frustrated as I only cut my hair a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair that&#x27;s been bleached and dyed a lot.</li>
            <li> I use this and no more knots!</li>
            <li> so seeing split ends so soon was kinda not good....</li>
            <li> this product is neither to thick, or too thin.</li>
            <li> This is a watered down version, which is too bad.</li>
            <li> The odor isn&#x27;t heavy or annoying either.</li>
            <li> It was getting to expensive</li>
            <li> Sorry, don&#x27;t care if it works or not</li>
            <li> Recently my hair has been breaking and just looking awful.</li>
            <li> disappointing experience.  </li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t be afraid of it.</li>
            <li> and I just knew it was going to be a hair miracle, but sadly it was not at all!</li>
            <li> disappointed ...</li>
            <li> Its terrible and smells aweful</li>
            <li> It smells horrible!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The Good:&lt;br /&gt;- Smells FABULOUS.&lt;br /&gt;- Goes on easy wet or dry. Great for detangling kids&#x27; hair.&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t make my dry, blonde, 2c curly hair greasy or heavy, even after several days in a row of application.&lt;br /&gt;- Adds shine &amp; did I mention the heavenly scent?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;- The pump gets clogged, have to rinse it regularly.&lt;br /&gt;- It tends to make my hair a bit... crunchy? Akin to a salt water spray. Not terrible, but, at the end of the day, when I brush it through, there&#x27;s definitely product residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: I&#x27;ll keep buying it, but I find I have to rotate it in/out with other products to &amp;#34;rejuvenate&amp;#34; its efficacy.</li>
            <li> NOT at all Like WEN--- Its terrible and smells aweful</li>
            <li> This detangler and leave-in conditioner has a pleasant, mild fragrance. Plus it gives my hair shine, body and manageability. It also reduces frizziness. Sometimes it&#x27;s all I need.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length wavy hair.  I spray 5 pumps on my hands and distribute through my damp hair.  I either blow dry or air dry and have great results either way.  Leaves my hair feeling fuller with more defined wave/curl.  I use and highly recommend the entire Evercreme line.  I have seen tremendous results with my hair.</li>
            <li> If you are under the impression, as I was, that L&#x27;Oreal Evercreme system is sulfate-free and silicone-free, think again. This product uses Amodimethicone, which ,most of us know by now, coats hair with a film and does not allow moisture in to the hair, eventually drying out the strands. Find an argon oil (one that is pure, not silicone based) or some other organic oil to moisturize your hair, you will notice more lasting results. Though it is pricey, I recommend Josie Maran&#x27;s Argon Oil.</li>
            <li> My whole family uses this as a detangler/conditioner.  Smells great and works perfect.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find in stores, and it works great!</li>
            <li> I bought this product about two weeks ago and started using it right away...I LOVE IT! I apply a lot of it after I get out of the shower and towel dry my hair. It leaves my hair very soft and gives it a nice shine. It doesn&#x27;t way down my hair at all or make it look greasy like other products I have used.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so soft. Best i have tried</li>
            <li> I cant find it in stores. I am going to put it on auto ship.</li>
            <li> The most amazing spray from L&#x27;Oreal !! Really i have used like all kind of hair spray&#x27;s before to get my hair smooth but not greasy and THIS IS THE ONE .. i cannot imagine now not using it everyday on my hair .. it keep it smooth and hydrated for all day along .. definitely will keep purchase FOREVER !!</li>
            <li> Works well, just wish my hair were softer feeling with it in.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that is not exactly straight. It lives to form knots to give me headaches. I use this and no more knots! It isn&#x27;t heavy and my hair stays bouncy. The odor isn&#x27;t heavy or annoying either.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Shipment received in timely manner!</li>
            <li> If you can  believe it... This product has RUBBING alcohol in it! Enough said  but i&#x27;ll elaborate further..... I have relaxed hair and something  as drying as rubbing alcohol should NOT be PLACED ON MY HAIR. But I tried it anyway because it has omega acids in it which clearly was not enough my hair becuase is a  dry, crunchy, tangled MESS! Just like I figured it would be.  Avoid!</li>
            <li> Love the evercreme line of products. My hair is so soft thati keep playing with it.</li>
            <li> My hair warmed up to this new leave-in  quite nicely.  I was surprised to find the consistency more cream-like than a liquid.  The product is fluid, but it is not runny.  I can spray it into my hands and rub them together or I can spray directly on my hair, which is my preferred method.  The directions tell you to spray it on after a wash and condition, so this would mean wet or damp hair which is fine, but my hair likes it sprayed on when dry, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product smells really wonderful.  It wakes my hair up in the morning, giving it a nourishing drink of water without drying it out, like using just  water will eventually  do.  It keeps the cuticle of my hair lying flat, which means less frizz and more smooth, shiny hair.  I also like that it doesn&#x27;t leave a tacky, sticky residue on my mane or give me the crunchies.  This bottle will last quite a while because I also find that I don&#x27;t need to spray a ton of  product on to get the moisture benefits.  All that, along with the price, makes this Nourishing Leave-In Spray a keeper for me.</li>
            <li> LOVE using this after each shower. Keeps my hair soft and wavy!</li>
            <li> leaves hair soft and hydrated , Tencho wicks and my hair is difficult to disentangle is weak and thin, with this product, my hair is perfect styling and a smooth , glossy finish . I love</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff. It smells so good and leaves my hair so soft</li>
            <li> It works ok but I am not a big fan of the smell.</li>
            <li> This product works well without weighing my fine hair down. For me, I like the smell, it&#x27;s not overpowering or it doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling like you came out of a salon.</li>
            <li> Ok so I am 61 this has to be the best hair Product I have EVER used better than any other</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this from Amazon and have only recently gotten it again, although I love it.  Pros: - Smells very good, like a sweet vanilla/sugary scent with a small hint of something herbal. - Moisturizes/smoothes my hair pretty well. I have naturally curly, dry, frizzy hair. I use this after using Garnier Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine Intensely Smooth Leave in Conditioner, and lately in conjunction with the EverCreme Shampoo and Conditioner. I spray it on my hand or directly onto my hair, starting with the ends first and working it throughout the rest. This actually makes my hair kind of shiny, which is pretty hard to do. - I like how it comes in a spray bottle.  Cons: - I wish it cost less. It seems kind of expensive for only 8.5 oz. (I paid $7.74 for it). I forgot how long my first bottle lasted me, so I guess I&#x27;ll have to wait and see when I finish my current one to see how often I&#x27;ll be buying it.  Overall, I really like this product and will most likely be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> Have natural curly frizzy hair but this helps</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!  After trying the the similar WEN products--this one is just as good and much, much less expensive. My hair is a little thin, very fine and light natural blond.  I have ordered several of these because am not able to find them in stores.  I also use the &amp;#34;shampoo-type&amp;#34; product that goes along with this.  I will use these from now on.</li>
            <li> its ok.. not the best…i bought this because i loved the cleansing conditioner… but this leave-in is just so - so….</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this twice now and it keeps my hair soft and manageable. I have very curly hair which tends to get dry but this conditioner helps. It is easily applied and smells good. I use it in addition to my conditioner that is rinsed out.</li>
            <li> Received item and it was half empty!!</li>
            <li> Too oily for my hair.  Heavy and causes my hair to look as if I never washed it in less than an hour after use.  Would not recommend this product for anyone with normal to slightly oily hair.</li>
            <li> Have bought my second,  is great for curly hair</li>
            <li> Love this, never see it in the store anymore. Be sure to just spray the bottom half of your hair, not to close to the scalp or hair will be greasy. I spray it when my hair is half dry then blow dry.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel weighted down and dry (crispy) after 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff.  I swim 3x a week at the local Y, which everyone knows is overly chlorinated.  I still have really soft, shiny hair and I thank this product for that.  I&#x27;ve even started using this after regular showers at home because I love how it makes my hair feel, and it smells absolutely wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at ALL (which when you have VERY fine hair like me, is really easy to do).  Other brands also left my hair feeling crispy like straw after about 20 minutes or so and it never went away. This stuff leaves it feeling manageable and soft.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Great product. Very easy to apply to my hair. It leaves my hair soft, smooth &amp; very light. It does not add any weight to my hair at all.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it&#x27;s hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Great for detangling, smells good, like vanilla creme, some people might think it&#x27;s too strong, but the smell doesn&#x27;t last long. I use it after every shower. I have thick, wavy hair that&#x27;s been bleached and dyed a lot. So I need heavy conditioning. This stuff is very conditioning without being greasy. Someone with thin hair would only need a tiny amount. I use like 20 sprays though. I&#x27;ve had it for a while and the one bottle lasts longer than any other leave-in conditioner I&#x27;ve had. Probably because this stuff is really thick, and most detangling strays are much watery-er. So this stuff is basically concentrated. I think it&#x27;s a good value for it&#x27;s price and how long it lasts. I will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> To keep it short this product made my already dry hair feel very rough and more dry. Did not add moisture to it at all. I won&#x27;t buy this again and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone. It gets 2 stars cause of the packaging and the smell.</li>
            <li> keeps my hair moisturized, but occasionally it feels like a film running to my eyes that kinda burns like sweat.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair with fine, wavy strands. This conditioner makes my hair super-shiny without weighing it down. Also, the last 4 inches of my hair are extremely damaged. Using this brings them back to life.</li>
            <li> It really did nothing but weighed down my hair. It smells really good, but that&#x27;s it. I just threw it away...  disappointed ...</li>
            <li> I was hoping for something I could use in the morning to revitalize my 3B curls without having to completely rewet my hair. I haven&#x27;t gotten good results using this on dry hair and it doesn&#x27;t help with frizziness in humid weather.</li>
            <li> bought this form my daughter who is a swimming pool dolphin after she spend to full days back to back and at the end of the second day looked like a white Rastafarian took almost an hour to detangle.  not we spray her before the pool and after her shower to keep he hair smooth all day and into the next day.</li>
            <li> Honestly i didnt not notice a difference in my hair or my kids hair.  And I wasnt a fan of the smell, its very strong.</li>
            <li> My favorite product! I have wavy hair and this product makes brushing a breeze after I wash my hair! Great price on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I just got this last week at Target mostly b/c of the great smell, but after using it, my hair shines, it&#x27;s not as frizzy, my fly-aways are under control, and my hair looks healthy. I have thick, curly, wavy hair that I wash daily. I usually straighten my bangs w/ a flat iron, and will use hairspray to keep my bangs in place. Now my hair doesn&#x27;t need the normal routine of Organix products going through it as my hair looks so much better with this product. I plan on buying the shampoo and conditioner after work today and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll find more great results!</li>
            <li> My husband and I both love this. It is light and seems to work well.</li>
            <li> Almost a perfect product. It&#x27;s a spray lotion, so it doesn&#x27;t run when you apply it, it moisturizes without being greasy, and it lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the downside, the scent is really strong and kind of cloying. Why do they have to over-perfume everything?</li>
            <li> Loved this product! It was delivered on time too.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It gives my hair the extra wave, while giving it the soft, touchable look.  My local store quit carrying the L&#x27;Oreal Leave-in Conditioner.  I tried a different brand and it didn&#x27;t even compare.  It acted too much like glue.  That&#x27;s when i started the on-line search for the L&#x27;Oreal brand i was used to and i found it on Amazon.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the best for detangling hair and if it needs hydration at the same time without being a heavy formula that weighs your hair down.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it on and off for a few years. I am African American with natural hair that I wear straight. I also used this leave-in when I wore my hair relaxed before transitioning and it worked wonders then. Now with my hair being natural and past my shoulders, I use this product after shampooing and deep conditioning my kinky hair. I use this right before blow drying and it makes my hair incredibly soft and it feels very moisturized. It makes my hair ready for flat ironing and it does indeed help stop breakage. It also works wonders on our son&#x27;s hair which is curly but kind of on the dry side (he is mixed). This is a must have and I will always continue to use it as long as Loreal makes it.</li>
            <li> I will admit I am a sucker for new products, especially hair products, so when I saw this new line by Loreal, I *had* to try it. I bought this from my local drug store and was a little hesitant because of the price (higher than listed here on Amazon), but I convinced myself it would be worth it. I have long, thick, wavy, color treated hair with highlights and my hair naturally leans towards the dry side. Anytime I see something that says moisturizing (add to it nourishing) then I am pulled away from my go to brand (Infusium 23). I was excited to try it and I just knew it was going to be a hair miracle, but sadly it was not at all! I bought the intense nourishing shampoo, conditioner, leave in spray and hair mask and I have been using all four items for over a week now. My hair has been harder to detangle, drier, and a little crunchy feeling (this could be from the leave in?) The only positives I can say is that my hair does seem to be a bit curlier and it smells wonderful. I&#x27;ve gotten a few compliments on how good it smells, but I can&#x27;t justify buying these products just because it makes my hair smell nice. I&#x27;ve tried many brands from drugstores and salons, and this isn&#x27;t the worst, but it isn&#x27;t the best either.</li>
            <li> I have a ton of very think, somewhat coarse, wavy hair. Though it claims to be free of heavy waxes, that is is exactly what it feels like on my hair. I found I had the same issue with the other EverCreme products I tried, so it seems they&#x27;re just not for me. The EverSleek products are fabulous though!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite product - EverCreme does it again! I use this spray every day on damp or dry hair, and no matter how much I put in it, my hair doesn&#x27;t get greasy or heavy. My hair is extremely dry from bleaching, so using this on non-wash days really helps the look and texture of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use all of the other products in this line, excluding the co-wash, and they are excellent for extremely dry hair.</li>
            <li> Amazing to use. Not heavy, smells good, easy to control application/spray. I have badly wild ends due to breakage and using this is the only way I can look like I didn&#x27;t put my finger in a light socket.</li>
            <li> My favorite leave in conditioner, mainly because of the fragrance. But it also works well, will add moisture to your hair. It is pretty strong so you will not need a lot so a bottle will last several months.</li>
            <li> Great product! I bought this in replacement of my usual product. I&#x27;m glad I did, it smells amazing and my hair feels amazing. My baby fine fine loves this product. I will order again!</li>
            <li> I love this spray to moisture my hair, its comfortable to use and the effect is immediate</li>
            <li> Have to use a lot to get your hair clean</li>
            <li> Love all of loreal&#x27;s sulfate free hair care. Very lite weight product yet surprisingly moisturizing and good at getting rid of frizz. I don&#x27;t spray directly on hair though. I spray several pumps on my hand so I can evenly apply it. Also smells so good, a warm yet clean scent.</li>
            <li> I have long untreated hair these days and I purchased this product because I wanted something to keep the ends from drying out.  Much to my surprise this Leave-in spray didn&#x27;t seem to do that; my hair was really fly-away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it didn&#x27;t help at all with detangling, which personally I think is required. I mean after you use the Evercreme shampoo and conditioner, the next product should be a detangler/nourishing one.  Certainly [[ASIN:B0047ETODO L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s EverSleek, Humidity Defying Leave-In Cr&amp;egrave;me]] includes detangling as one of it&#x27;s functions.  And that&#x27;s the product that I&#x27;m going to go back to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A disappointing experience.  I think L&#x27;Oreals&#x27; Nourishing Leave-in spray doesn&#x27;t do enough. First because it seemed like it was actually drying out my hair, and second because it doesn&#x27;t protect it from snarls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pam T~</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve found that can manage my crazy curly hair, but I can&#x27;t seem to find it in any stores anymore. Thank Goodness Amazon still carries it.</li>
            <li> My must have hair product for my curly hair!!!  I have fine spiral curls.  I use everyday!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
            <li> I was using &amp;#34;Wen&amp;#34; for a few months . It was getting to expensive and I felt it was not worth it. My hair had good days &amp; bad. Even after long term use, I did not see much of an improvement. When I saw the L&#x27;Oreal, I figured for the price I would try it. I left it in the hair for 30 min. I was very happy with the results. I don&#x27;t use it every time I shampoo, but more like once a week. I have baby fine blond hair that is highlighted &amp; dry.  This gives my hair a little pick me up. It does not flatten it out at all , it makes it more hydrated looking. I will try the L&#x27;Oreal hair mask next. Overall I am happy with this so far.</li>
            <li> I really like this line. It works good in my thick semi curly frizzy hair. I use it everyday for good results.</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with it&#x27;s cleasing conditioner counterpart. Having used many leave-ins for my curly color-treated hair, I have to say I am more than pleased. This keeps the frizz at bay, while also keeping my curls defined. All without the wet/crunch look. I LOVE the smell! Just don&#x27;t overdo it, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend use on oily hair.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff every day because I have dry hair and I like how it makes my hair feel..</li>
            <li> I love this leave-in conditioner by L&#x27;Oreal to leave my hair feeling soft and smelling good. It does exactly as promised as well as leaving my hair especially shiny. My husband loves it too! He spritz some on every morning to prevent his dandruff. It works better for him than shampoos. Every time I buy a bottle, I buy 2! 1 for me and 1 for him. Quick shipping with minimal packaging too! Thanks L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li> This is the best and most lightweight leave in conditioner I have used. And it&#x27;s perfect for coarse keratin treated hair....no residue left!</li>
            <li> Too heavy for fine/thin hair</li>
            <li> I am an African American woman with very dry and thick 4B/C type hair. I&#x27;ve realized that its difficult to find products that are not drying on my hair and smell good. I was so excited to discover this product. This product leave my hair so soft and smelling so good. if your hair is super dry I would advise that you give this product a try. Keep in mind that this product does have alcohol in it however it is not the drying alcohol. I read that any alcohol that starts with the letter C or the letter S is moisturizing alcohol. So don&#x27;t be afraid of it. Do your research, read the labels and educate yourself on the good and bad ingredients so you will be better informed.</li>
            <li> I use 8 - 10 pumps after the shower, daily. (I have long, fine hair that reaches to mid-back). The 1st few uses I was concerned that the product was too thick bc it seemed to have a hard time getting out, I had to press with a good amount of pressure. This remedied itself and now comes out in a very nice, fine mist. I have only used this on damp hair but will try on dry too, per other reviews. My mid-back length, fine hair feels completely natural after application, even the next day. This replaced my Nexxus spray which I loved too. At about 1/2 the price, you can&#x27;t beat this.</li>
            <li> smells great and takes tangles out very well.  Just spray it on and run your finger through the hair first. Works great.</li>
            <li> This is the best leave in I ever used it leaves the hair soft and fully moisturized. Will be purchasing 2 more bottles</li>
            <li> Ugh.  Used this only once and won&#x27;t again.  It smells horrible!  Very, very strong, sickly sweet smell.  NOW I know what is it that a woman who sits near me at work is using that makes me want to gag ;).  Sorry, don&#x27;t care if it works or not, I won&#x27;t subject my family, friends, coworkers or myself to having to smell this on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it really necessary to have THAT MUCH scent in anything?</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, and this is a great detangler.  Works well, and the price is great!</li>
            <li> Love this for conditioning my dry hair daily.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and conditions my hair well</li>
            <li> Works well to detangle my hair, but not weigh it down.  I don&#x27;t use it every day, but probably 4x&#x27;s a week.  I like the smell better than any other leave-in conditioner I&#x27;ve found.  And I&#x27;ve tried many!  Not sure why I can&#x27;t find it on store shelves, anymore. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dilute it down by 50% with water. Works just as well and makes it last longer.</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you how well it works, as I cannot get past the smell. I sprayed this product on my hair and the fragrance is cloying and overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a drugstore spray leave in conditioner that is somewhat similar to Enjoy&#x27;s and after trying a few others hit on a winner in this one!  You don&#x27;t have to use a ton of it to get the conditioning effects of this spray.  It is VERY close to matching theirs and it smells great too!</li>
            <li> First of all, let me tell you my hair type so that you can make an informed decision. I have the kind of kinky curly hair that is suitable for afros. My hair is healthy and untreated in any way. So...I&#x27;ll start with the positives. YES, it has GREAT slip. It also smells fantabulous!!! The consistecy is wonderful, not watery, and not too thick. It can be used DAILY (at least in my opinion) with oily no-build-up or stickiness. It makes my afro shape up nicely and is great for my morning hair refresher. It doesn&#x27;t aggravate my sensistive scalp, either. With that said, I only gave it three stars because while it is certainly great for detangling, I don&#x27;t feel that it ADDS any moisture to my hair. I get a little bit of the \\&quot;crunch factor\\&quot; that was mentioned in an earlier review. I DO wish that L&#x27;Oreal would have left out the isopropryl alcohol and the amodimethicone. Not sure how that would have affected the performance of the product, though, as I am NOT a chemist. All in all , I would recommend it because it&#x27;s not oily, it&#x27;s fairly easy to find, and it works well for styling. I just wish it had a bit more of a moisturizing effect on MY hair. Maybe L&#x27;Oreal could make a leave in for \\&quot;extra dry hair\\&quot; which would contain a few more humectants. I don&#x27;t consider muy hair \\&quot;extra dry\\&quot; but considering that the product line is not necessarily geared towards my hair type (at least not from the advertisements) an \\&quot;extra dry hair\\&quot; formula might work best for me.</li>
            <li> Loving the way it makes my color treated aging hair feel. Soft, supple. It has a nice scent but it&#x27;s pretty strong to my nose - enough to mess with my usual scent and too strong for hubby. Hoping they&#x27;ll make one unscented!</li>
            <li> It may be on the vegan list but it is not cruelty-free which I know is not the concern of everyone but is for many others.  They state &amp;#34;The Group no longer tests on animal, anywhere in the world, and does not delegate this task to others. An exception could be made if regulatory authorities required it for safety or regulatory purposes.&amp;#34;  There are many, many other vegan and cruelty-free hair products that are excellent and do not wimp out on the last part, because the last part simply means &amp;#34;If China or anywhere else we can make extra money requires it, we will do it&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I was using the WEN products. Like the product but could not afford the hefty price tag. So I looked for alternatives and found the L&#x27;Oreal Evercreme. I have been very happy with the results of this product (and the cleansing conditioner) and the price is a lot easier to swallow than the WEN products!</li>
            <li> All Loreal evercreme products are really excelent. I buy them everytime month!! This new spray is simple fabulous.  Leaves hair shiny</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Makes my hair so silky soft.</li>
            <li> Great product my hair loves it</li>
            <li> Recently my hair has been breaking and just looking awful. I have fine, Blonde highlighted , shoulder blade length hair, I find that leave in products weigh my hair down, or make it greasy. I had tried a few products that claim to rebuild your hairs structure but what I failed to understand is that too much Protein can actually be damaging, you can read articles on line and so I stopped doing those kinds of treatments. I am currently using  JOICO  moisture recovery shampoo and conditioner I had bought some JOICO  K Pak products thinking it was going to help, but having bought them then read some articles about hair care treatments and I think I realized I have been giving my hair a \\&quot;overload\\&quot; and it has caused my hair to become more stressed out, kinda crunchy in places and Dry especially the ends. I felt kinda frustrated as I only cut my hair a few weeks ago so seeing split ends so soon was kinda not good....anyways I decided to drop the other products and read reviews for this L&#x27;Oreal Nourishing leave in spray and most people were liking it,and writing their hair was not weighed down, if you have  fine hair like me that&#x27;s not what you want! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;well I have used this Spray now 3 times and in conjunction to the JOICO  shampoo and conditioner my hair has done a turn around I do think its probably the combination of all 3 things  but the Spray leaves your hair smooth and soft,and it smells good too , I would totally give it a try, its cheap too :) you can Spray it in your hands and apply it to the areas that are more dry ....I do that, the Spray is not really watery, but Its not slimy it does not make my blonde hair looks greasy.......I am totally in love with this Product and if your  hair is fried  give this a try.</li>
            <li> It truly does help with fly aways and frizz, but not on humid days</li>
            <li> This really makes your hair smooth!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very very good for dry indian hair</li>
            <li> Works great on my coarse, curly, color-treated hair. Spray it on, scrunch it in, and enjoy the curls.</li>
            <li> I was really happy to find this on Amazon, as i could not find it in local stores after the first purchase. The original product was great- scent as well as effect on my unruly hair. This is a watered down version, which is too bad. Not sure I would buy again.</li>
            <li> i love the scent and texture. it&#x27;s not heavy at all but definitely leaves a silky layer that i can feel is conditioning the ends. i use it daily on wet hair before a quick dry and i feel that it does serve as a light heat protection as well. it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair. it&#x27;s more of a cream than a liquid yet it still sprays out of the nozzle evenly and like a light mist. it&#x27;s one of my go-to favorites for hair care!</li>
            <li> Smells like old women.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff, I am a guy but it really makes my hair soft and as long as my girlfriend likes the feel of my hair I will continue to use it. My local Wal-Mart is either no it any longer carrying this product or are always out,,,none the less, I get a better deal on Amazon for it anyway</li>
            <li> This smells great, and gives my hair a sleek shiny look. Conditions very well. My hair tangles very easily, and this product gets the knots out very well. I have only used one other product that works better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice a difference in softness for my hair (which is why I give it 4 stars), but it does smell good. A little too strong and sweet for my taste, but my husband likes it and says my hair smells like candy haha!</li>
            <li> I am really picky about hair/skin products since I have Rosacea, and extremely sensitive skin...which includes my scalp. All the sulfate free products i had been using had turned my hair into a tangly,gluey mess. I was very surprised when I sprayed this on my hair because I was used to the regular watery leave-ins...this product is neither to thick, or too thin. You can spray some in your hand and rub it through your hair, and it works perfect. I have very fine hair, so i was worried about it weighing it down...it actually did the opposite. My hair has never been softer, and full of bounce.</li>
            <li> This spray smells wonderful and I am usually not a lover of smelly hair stuff and it leaves my hair feeling soft and frizz free. Especially in dry cold weather, my hair can get almost brittle unless I add moisture and this stuff is perfect AND not outrageously expensive.</li>
            <li> Everything is not for everyone. But for us this works great and is very easy to use. My kids are bi-racial with their hair being more towards the black side. However, they each have different textured hair. But it seems to work on all. It retains the moisture pretty good and since it is a leave in spray it is easier to use than the conditioner you use after a wash (but they condition wash anyhow). With the spray I can add it when I actually am styling their hair.&lt;br /&gt;Actually, the L&#x27;Oreal shampoo conditioner is really good also as you wash once and then do not need to put in any added conditioner. Anyhow that is a review for another product.</li>
            <li> This detangler is amazing!!</li>
