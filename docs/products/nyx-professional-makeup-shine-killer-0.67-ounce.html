            <li>I absolutely love the Shine Killer&lt;br /&gt;!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super impressed and am so glad I ran across this at Ulta (which I believe is cheaper than the cost here).</li>
            <li>amazing product,it works 100%,i</li>
            <li>it really does kill my shine when i put it on and makes my face look literally flawless with the pore filler.</li>
            <li>Shipping was really fast and the product is awesome!</li>
            <li>I was just kind of doing a comparison study and the NYX made me break</li>
            <li>I have finally found the best product to control my shine.</li>
            <li>might need about 2 or 3 applications throughout the day though to keep it matte :)</li>
            <li>I Love this stuff</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t read the reviews before making this purchase.  </li>
            <li>and I absolutely love how it keeps my oily skin from shining.  </li>
            <li>No need to spend big dollars on name brand products when NYX works great!.</li>
            <li>but i love NYX eye shadows and lip sticks and eye primer.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>This product is definitely better than not having anything on to control the oiliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NYX</li>
            <li>I will use both to see if it works better together.</li>
            <li>My skin is not matte all day, but the shine is more reasonable/natural looking, (maybe manages to look &#x27;dewy&#x27;?)</li>
            <li>I love how my face doesn&#x27;t look shiny.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone with oily skin. :)</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel the strong need to blot my face even though it looked dewy.</li>
            <li>If I had the average t-zone oil issues it would be perfect and am quessing it will be my go-to primer during the winter months.</li>
            <li>its just as fine...</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have super oily skin, it may work for you, but for me it did not help!</li>
            <li>Literally 5-10 minutes later my face is drenched in oil Lol.</li>
            <li>It feels smooth on the skin.</li>
            <li>I put my makeup on over it, and my face stays oil free for maybe an hour.</li>
            <li>I have a frying vat on my face and while I enjoy some NYX products, I can&#x27;t give this a thumbs up.</li>
            <li>Works great, kills shines instantly</li>
            <li>This makes my skin extremely smooth.</li>
            <li>This is a color free product...</li>
            <li>Feels nice going on, very soft and light.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and have tried so many things</li>
            <li>It really just works OK.</li>
            <li>A new favorite</li>
            <li>It really works!!</li>
            <li>But the NYX works perfectly -  better than my original Oil Control by Bare Minerals.  </li>
            <li>Well worth</li>
            <li>For the price, it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>As someone with a very oily t zone, I was excited to find this and at the price it is.</li>
            <li>and I can see the shine diminish right away.</li>
            <li>I use a moisturizer, then the NYX, then my Bare Minerals foundation, and my skin looks great and it still isn&#x27;t oily hours later.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad product but maybe for my more oily girls I would recommend a longer lasting product.</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s pretty normal to expect that (particularly because I have SUPER oily skin, but I doubt most people would need to blot after they use it).</li>
            <li>Works good as primer, I still get a little oily, but of course, that&#x27;s hours after I applied it.</li>
            <li>Actually made my face more oily than it already was.</li>
            <li>Using too much product will leave your face feeling oily!</li>
            <li>day.definitely will buy this again when i m done with the first one</li>
            <li>it worked really well otherwise and is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>So after reading so many reviews I decided to purchase one of these especially since I have oily</li>
            <li>i think i may have wiped most of it off by mid afternoon.</li>
            <li>it kills the shine you really need to try it !</li>
            <li>It really works!  </li>
            <li>This product works very well!</li>
            <li>Shine Killer REALLY works though!</li>
            <li>and then it works pretty well for me.</li>
            <li>It feels so smooth and soft when applying it and no creases.</li>
            <li>Plus, it makes your skin super soft.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin somewhat matte and has actually kept my skin more clear than before I started using it!</li>
            <li>This product was ok not much of a difference it says shine killer</li>
            <li>I have really oily skin</li>
            <li>It really does keep my face from being oily.</li>
            <li>I have a very oily face.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for my skin, I was still shiny after a couple hours.</li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>It really does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>Just a light layering all around the face (for me, for others maybe your T zone is enough) and my skin stays matte all day.</li>
            <li>I have really oily skin</li>
            <li>But I can tell you that my skin is really oily.</li>
            <li>I decided to try it once more a week later, thinking the first time may have just been a fluke, but the same thing happened again.</li>
            <li>I only blot lightly once or twice during the day to get it down to a more &#x27;matte&#x27; look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin so soft and it really does kill the shine!</li>
            <li>using Shine Killer, I feel I&#x27;m able to cut down that oiliness by about 70%.</li>
            <li>i live in Texas and i sweat so this product didn&#x27;t really do much for me through out the day.</li>
            <li>I have oily combination skin and my problem area is mainly my T-Zone</li>
            <li>i highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend ❤️</li>
            <li>this is a dream product makes me look normal</li>
            <li>I have struggled with greasy, oily, blotting all day, powder all the time skin for a while now and Shine Killer is the only product that has pretty much resolved these issues.</li>
            <li>like you don&#x27;t have powder on, and I can live with that.</li>
            <li>However, if you just have only a light problem with shine, this may be enough.</li>
            <li>I bought this for the simple reason that summers where I live are hot and humid and I had hoped that during the summer this would help keep some of the shine from surfacing on my face and messing up my makeup.  </li>
            <li>I used de-slick from urban decay before buying this one, it&#x27;s pretty close and a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this is what caused it, but I only use this on special occasions, where the nights are long! :)</li>
            <li>But I can use my finger and pat a little more on over my make at this point after I have blotted and it will last another four ish hours.</li>
            <li>Its a clear gel so it can work for any skin colour</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a clear gel that feels like oil, yet somehow it</li>
            <li>It also comes on clear and it has no build up or cakey feeling to it.</li>
            <li>I used this product without makeup, as one product suggestion and amazed at how natural it looks</li>
            <li>I was shining again before my makeup application was complete.</li>
            <li>Do not waste money if you have oily skin.</li>
            <li>In the past, I&#x27;ve had to blot pretty much every 2 hours and really by lunchtime, my makeup has all come off.</li>
            <li>and so far, this product hasn&#x27;t made me break out at all either.</li>
            <li>I have really oily skin - especially in the summer time.  </li>
            <li>wow wow</li>
            <li>wow ....</li>
            <li>I do have naturally oily skin, but I do not regret buying at all.</li>
            <li>I love that a little goes a long way with this primer, my makeup does not move when I wear this and it does not feel oily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Shine Killer for almost a week and there is a major improvment!</li>
            <li>I have oily skin, this really helps to make my skin mat all day long.</li>
            <li>The shine killer has the same texture of pore filler and it&#x27;s clear.</li>
            <li>In any event, after doing my makeup routine as I normally do,( the difference using &amp;#34;Shine Killer&amp;#34;) I went about my day though not doing anything out of the ordinary, just a relaxing day at home just to see how this product held up and in about three hours, checked my face in the mirror.  </li>
            <li>I used Prime Time oil control by Bare Minerals for years until they stopped making it.  </li>
            <li>this on after you&#x27;ve finished all steps of your makeup or on a bare face.  </li>
            <li>So, on the first 80 degree day, I got it out and put it on as directed and hoped I had found the answer to the problem I have every summer-oil slick face induced by high humidity, especially on my &amp;#34;t-zone&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>It has a slick texture and you can tell right away it is going to give you a shiny texture with makeup.</li>
            <li>This was truly a waste of money and I am disappointed because I own several NYX products that I enjoy.</li>

            <li> But I can use my finger and pat a little more on over my make at this point after I have blotted and it will last another four ish hours.</li>
            <li> Its a clear gel so it can work for any skin colour</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a clear gel that feels like oil, yet somehow it</li>
            <li> It also comes on clear and it has no build up or cakey feeling to it.</li>
            <li> I used this product without makeup, as one product suggestion and amazed at how natural it looks</li>
            <li> I was shining again before my makeup application was complete.</li>
            <li> Do not waste money if you have oily skin.</li>
            <li> In the past, I&#x27;ve had to blot pretty much every 2 hours and really by lunchtime, my makeup has all come off.</li>
            <li> and so far, this product hasn&#x27;t made me break out at all either.</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin - especially in the summer time.  </li>
            <li> wow wow</li>
            <li> wow ....</li>
            <li> I do have naturally oily skin, but I do not regret buying at all.</li>
            <li> I love that a little goes a long way with this primer, my makeup does not move when I wear this and it does not feel oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Shine Killer for almost a week and there is a major improvment!</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, this really helps to make my skin mat all day long.</li>
            <li> The shine killer has the same texture of pore filler and it&#x27;s clear.</li>
            <li> In any event, after doing my makeup routine as I normally do,( the difference using &amp;#34;Shine Killer&amp;#34;) I went about my day though not doing anything out of the ordinary, just a relaxing day at home just to see how this product held up and in about three hours, checked my face in the mirror.  </li>
            <li> I used Prime Time oil control by Bare Minerals for years until they stopped making it.  </li>
            <li> this on after you&#x27;ve finished all steps of your makeup or on a bare face.  </li>
            <li> So, on the first 80 degree day, I got it out and put it on as directed and hoped I had found the answer to the problem I have every summer-oil slick face induced by high humidity, especially on my &amp;#34;t-zone&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> It has a slick texture and you can tell right away it is going to give you a shiny texture with makeup.</li>
            <li> This was truly a waste of money and I am disappointed because I own several NYX products that I enjoy.</li>
            <li> Works a little better than others that I have tried and tapping a little on after a few hours will keep my makeup in place a bit longer.</li>
            <li> last two days after applying at 6 am I tried blotting my face mid-day and noticed that there was significantly less oil rather than the typical oil slick requiring a small tree&#x27;s worth of blotting paper to normalize (my face is always disco-ball shiny, so this is a HUGE improvement and the lowest maintenance way to stay</li>
            <li> Shine Killer definitely works, although (on my skin) not for a very long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a silicone based product so such thing should be expected.</li>
            <li> and it keeps my face matte all day long.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind, I am 51 and suffer from dry skin but in the summer, my face does a complete 180 and becomes an oil slick as aforementioned.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;- and any other makeup necessary</li>
            <li> I allowed it to dry</li>
            <li> My entire face is greasy after half an hour of putting on makeup.</li>
            <li> find this product affordable and you only need to use a little amount (for me, just to cover the T-zone).</li>
            <li> but that is expected cuz my forehead is so oily, it can outshine britney doing a performance to toxic.</li>
            <li> Let me preface this review by saying that I&#x27;ve never really used primer before (for my face), so I can&#x27;t compare this with other anti-shine primers.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is it is a small size.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still an oil slick, I&#x27;m starting to think nothing works besides those oil blotting sheets.</li>
            <li> Not worth it for ME.</li>
            <li> AND it&#x27;s half the price of the NYX.</li>
            <li> less greasy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So i ordered it and it came after a week and a half</li>
            <li> Use a little bit of product.</li>
            <li> In addition to slowing down the shine and oil, my skin has cleared up substantially!</li>
            <li> The shine continued, and it clogged a few of my pores, so I didn&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> i dont know why and when i wait a few hours to do anything in life i have an oily T zone</li>
            <li> I used it for a few weeks and then gave up.  </li>
            <li> I was oily within a few hours.</li>
            <li> To my chagrin, what I saw was the same oil slick I have always seen since I can recall!!!</li>
            <li> The size is small for the price.</li>
            <li> Oil slick oily.</li>
            <li> i usually wear it alone</li>
            <li> I like how it mattifys your skin&#x27;s look, but yes, it is a bit small....</li>
            <li> I think the shine killer makes my face look a little less oily, but makes my face feel worse.</li>
            <li> This holds my shine at least five hours</li>
            <li> It keeps my face looking matte and oil-free for at least 6 hours.</li>
            <li> Its a very small tube&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> When I ran out of the shine control cream I use from Smashbox, I decided to give this a try because it&#x27;s so much less expensive.</li>
            <li> Major disappointment!</li>
            <li> it sucks it so expensive</li>
            <li> I was broken out by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not great.</li>
            <li> If anything it made my &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; problem worse.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t cause any unnecessary breakouts -- or any breakouts, for that matter.</li>
            <li> After that, it&#x27;s a BIT less oily/shiny, but it&#x27;s still bad.</li>
            <li> Disappointing and not made for people with serious oil issues.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of money to buy expensive make up products</li>
            <li> If I touch my face, it&#x27;s just slick and disgusting.</li>
            <li> out- bad-</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The worst is the feel.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Major disappointment! Literally 5-10 minutes later my face is drenched in oil Lol.</li>
            <li> Works wonders under my cosmetics and doesn&#x27;t cause any changes in my application or look of my make up. A new favorite and I&#x27;ll definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love this! It leaves my skin so soft and it really does kill the shine! I have very oily skin and have tried so many things so I was so glad this works! The shine killer has the same texture of pore filler and it&#x27;s clear.</li>
            <li> Actually made my face more oily than it already was.</li>
            <li> I have dealt with oily skin since I&#x27;ve been a teenager. I have finally found the best product to control my shine. This holds my shine at least five hours and I&#x27;ll take that any day.</li>
            <li> This product has no color, it just helps makeup go on smoother and is a great primer.  The only issue I have is it is a small size.</li>
            <li> I used this product without makeup, as one product suggestion and amazed at how natural it looks and it does remove shine.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me at all!</li>
            <li> I like this product. It keeps my oily face shine-free for about 4-5 hours. It&#x27;s transparent so it doesn&#x27;t leave streaks on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Little tip. Use a little bit of product. Using too much product will leave your face feeling oily! It&#x27;s a silicone based product so such thing should be expected.</li>
            <li> amazing product,it works 100%,i loved it.my face stayed matt trough entire day.definitely will buy this again when i m done with the first one</li>
            <li> recevied on time..&lt;br /&gt;like the product</li>
            <li> I bought this about a week ago and I&#x27;ve been using it alongside the pore filler. it really does kill my shine when i put it on and makes my face look literally flawless with the pore filler. throughout the day, however, my forehead will get shiny. but that is expected cuz my forehead is so oily, it can outshine britney doing a performance to toxic. it worked really well otherwise and is well worth the money. i highly recommend. might need about 2 or 3 applications throughout the day though to keep it matte :)</li>
            <li> Def controls shine for 12hr work day</li>
            <li> This product was ok not much of a difference it says shine killer but I don&#x27;t think it worked well I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again .</li>
            <li> This product does control the shine, Loved it! Highly recommend ❤️</li>
            <li> Does not work AT ALL. Save your money. I&#x27;m still an oil slick, I&#x27;m starting to think nothing works besides those oil blotting sheets.</li>
            <li> I started using this as a primer, and it works wonders. I have really oily skin and it keeps my face matte all day long. Shipping was really fast and the product is awesome! Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I tried NYX Cosmetics Shine Killer, but in a tropical climate like the Caribbean, it didn&#x27;t hold up too well.  I have combo/oily skin, and gave this a try when my BareMinerals primer was done.  The shine continued, and it clogged a few of my pores, so I didn&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> I Love this stuff it sucks it so expensive but Well Well worth it i allways have a shinny face even when i wash my face it is shinny i dont know why and when i wait a few hours to do anything in life i have an oily T zone so  this is a dream product makes me look normal i love it!</li>
            <li> It really does keep my face from being oily. Great product.</li>
            <li> It serves it&#x27;s purpose I guess</li>
            <li> So after reading so many reviews I decided to purchase one of these especially since I have oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;- Its a very small tube&lt;br /&gt;- Its a clear gel so it can work for any skin colour&lt;br /&gt;- After I applied it all over my face I allowed it to dry but it didn&#x27;t stay as matte as described&lt;br /&gt;- I then applied my foundation&lt;br /&gt;- and any other makeup necessary&lt;br /&gt;However after about 2 hours I had to use a blotting paper, and reapply some powder especially around my t zone after about 4 hours.</li>
            <li> Very effective, lightweight, non-comedogenic.  The only reason I dropped one star is that it is white, and leaves a bit of a chalky appearance on the skin.</li>
            <li> It feels smooth on the skin. But it doesn&#x27;t stop shine in my skin. And it&#x27;s a bite oily.</li>
            <li> I like it. it serves it&#x27;s purpose. Does what it says it will do and I couldn&#x27;t ask for my for my combonation oily skin.</li>
            <li> I have a very oily face. My entire face is greasy after half an hour of putting on makeup. When I put this shine killer on my face, it immediately made my face feel oily. I put my makeup on over it, and my face stays oil free for maybe an hour. After that, it&#x27;s a BIT less oily/shiny, but it&#x27;s still bad. The worst is the feel. If I touch my face, it&#x27;s just slick and disgusting. I think the shine killer makes my face look a little less oily, but makes my face feel worse.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  It keeps shine away all day.</li>
            <li> Not worth it for ME. I have very oily skin and I decided to use this, as well as the Maybelline Baby Skin (not at the same time.) I was just kind of doing a comparison study and the NYX made me break out- bad- by the end of the day. It clogged my pores in a way I&#x27;ve never dealt with before. I decided to try it once more a week later, thinking the first time may have just been a fluke, but the same thing happened again. I was broken out by the end of the day. The Maybelline is wonderful for me. It keeps my skin somewhat matte and has actually kept my skin more clear than before I started using it! Plus, it makes your skin super soft. AND it&#x27;s half the price of the NYX.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for my skin, I was still shiny after a couple hours. The size is small for the price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have an oily t-zone. I have a frying vat on my face and while I enjoy some NYX products, I can&#x27;t give this a thumbs up. It really didn&#x27;t work for me. I was shining again before my makeup application was complete. Disappointing and not made for people with serious oil issues. However, if you just have only a light problem with shine, this may be enough.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that decreases the shine on my face. The best product ever. I have searched for a product like this forever!</li>
            <li> I used Prime Time oil control by Bare Minerals for years until they stopped making it.  They replaced it with Prime Time foundation primer and it does not work for me.  Then I bought Sephora anti-shine which didn&#x27;t work for me at all.  But the NYX works perfectly -  better than my original Oil Control by Bare Minerals.  I use a moisturizer, then the NYX, then my Bare Minerals foundation, and my skin looks great and it still isn&#x27;t oily hours later.</li>
            <li> When I ran out of the shine control cream I use from Smashbox, I decided to give this a try because it&#x27;s so much less expensive. It really just works OK. I&#x27;ll just stick to what I know works, even though it&#x27;s more expensive.</li>
            <li> Does not work for oily skin. It has a slick texture and you can tell right away it is going to give you a shiny texture with makeup. Do not waste money if you have oily skin.</li>
            <li> i live in Texas and i sweat so this product didn&#x27;t really do much for me through out the day. i think i may have wiped most of it off by mid afternoon. defiantly not a necessary product for my basic make up routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t read the reviews before making this purchase.  I absolutely love the Shine Killer&lt;br /&gt;!  I&#x27;ve been uisng it for 4 days now and I absolutely love how it keeps my oily skin from shining.  I only have to touch-up my nose once as apposed to 5 times a day now.</li>
            <li> I wear this under my foundation and I like it because it does initially get rid of the shine but it doesn&#x27;t last all day. I have oily combination skin and my problem area is mainly my T-Zone so maybe after a hour or so I&#x27;m back to being shiny like a Christmas tree. It&#x27;s not a bad product but maybe for my more oily girls I would recommend a longer lasting product.</li>
            <li> It really does what it is supposed to do. it kills the shine you really need to try it !</li>
            <li> It really works!! I have oily skin and this Kees it away</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t elimanate the shine from your facd</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, this really helps to make my skin mat all day long.</li>
            <li> Works great, kills shines instantly</li>
            <li> For the price this products works great.  No need to spend big dollars on name brand products when NYX works great!.</li>
            <li> Works good as primer, I still get a little oily, but of course, that&#x27;s hours after I applied it. It does help me out with my T-Zones, though. Then again, I would get pimples during the use. I&#x27;m not sure if this is what caused it, but I only use this on special occasions, where the nights are long! :)</li>
            <li> As someone with a very oily t zone, I was excited to find this and at the price it is. I don&#x27;t have a lot of money to buy expensive make up products but i love NYX eye shadows and lip sticks and eye primer. So I took a chance on this. It does help somewhat but it&#x27;s not great. About four hours after I&#x27;ve worn my make up, I&#x27;m patting my t zone again. But I can use my finger and pat a little more on over my make at this point after I have blotted and it will last another four ish hours.</li>
            <li> Paraben-free anti-shine solution that won&#x27;t break the bank &#x3D; happiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last two days after applying at 6 am I tried blotting my face mid-day and noticed that there was significantly less oil rather than the typical oil slick requiring a small tree&#x27;s worth of blotting paper to normalize (my face is always disco-ball shiny, so this is a HUGE improvement and the lowest maintenance way to stay less greasy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a clear gel that feels like oil, yet somehow it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put this on after you&#x27;ve finished all steps of your makeup or on a bare face.  This product does NOT work if applied under makeup and does NOT work if mixed into foundation.</li>
            <li> Perfect i use it before the niy setting spray</li>
            <li> Seems to cut shine somewhat, but I still need to apply powder mid-day.</li>
            <li> I have severly oily skin! I&#x27;ve used all kinds of different primers from Smashbox and MAC to Loreal and Revlon. I&#x27;ve been using the Shine Killer for almost a week and there is a major improvment! For the price, it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It really works!  In addition to slowing down the shine and oil, my skin has cleared up substantially!</li>
            <li> This product works very well! I used de-slick from urban decay before buying this one, it&#x27;s pretty close and a fraction of the price. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> when i try it, after some times i have  shine on T-zone</li>
            <li> the shine killer does nothing to alleviate shine! the product is faulty. If anything it made my &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; problem worse.</li>
            <li> Made my skin break out but just about everything does. 😟</li>
            <li> I have hopes for this.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with greasy, oily, blotting all day, powder all the time skin for a while now and Shine Killer is the only product that has pretty much resolved these issues. In the past, I&#x27;ve had to blot pretty much every 2 hours and really by lunchtime, my makeup has all come off. Shine Killer REALLY works though! Just a light layering all around the face (for me, for others maybe your T zone is enough) and my skin stays matte all day. I DO have to blot just one time, *maybe* twice, but that&#x27;s about it and I think it&#x27;s pretty normal to expect that (particularly because I have SUPER oily skin, but I doubt most people would need to blot after they use it). I&#x27;ve tried much more expensive primers and nothing else has worked the way that Shine Killer does. I&#x27;m super impressed and am so glad I ran across this at Ulta (which I believe is cheaper than the cost here). Try it out!! Also, I am definitely prone to break outs and so far, this product hasn&#x27;t made me break out at all either.</li>
            <li> It did not work to kill the shine for my face.  I used it for a few weeks and then gave up.  It did not clog my pores.  If you don&#x27;t have super oily skin, it may work for you, but for me it did not help!</li>
            <li> This makes my skin extremely smooth. Evens out makeup coverage.</li>
            <li> So i&#x27;m reviewing from my dad&#x27;s account. After i initially saw this product in a Canadian store, i went back to the US and was determined to find the product. Wheni tested it in Canada, it worked wonders for my nose. I was in delight when i realized that my nose was no longer shiny after a tiny blob i put on. So i ordered it and it came after a week and a half or maybe it was two weeks... But anyways, i tried it on after my foundation and it didn&#x27;t seem to work as well. I had to put several tiny blobs on my nose rather than just one and i had to gingerly blot the potion onto my nose rather than rub it in. If i rubbed it in, the shine would reappear. I guess it works on different skin. so i use a matte powder to finish off and then it works pretty well for me.</li>
            <li> I used this after I cleansed, moisturized and applied sunscreen. During my 4-hr road trip, my skin was not as oily as it would&#x27;ve been without it. It definitely wasn&#x27;t a matte finish but it reduced the shine and oiliness by 80%. I didn&#x27;t feel the strong need to blot my face even though it looked dewy. This product is definitely better than not having anything on to control the oiliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NYX Matte Setting Spray works well. I will use both to see if it works better together.</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin and it took me a while to find something that kills the shine. And after I found this oh my gosh, its wonderful.</li>
            <li> This is a color free product...</li>
            <li> Works a little better than others that I have tried and tapping a little on after a few hours will keep my makeup in place a bit longer. I have really oily skin - especially in the summer time.  This works just &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; for me during the humid days. If I had the average t-zone oil issues it would be perfect and am quessing it will be my go-to primer during the winter months. Good price.</li>
            <li> Let me preface this review by saying that I&#x27;ve never really used primer before (for my face), so I can&#x27;t compare this with other anti-shine primers. But I can tell you that my skin is really oily. Oil slick oily. Mirror reflective oily. After two hours of leaving the house in the morning, it looks like I&#x27;ve dipped my T-zone in a vat of grease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using Shine Killer, I feel I&#x27;m able to cut down that oiliness by about 70%. My skin is not matte all day, but the shine is more reasonable/natural looking, (maybe manages to look &#x27;dewy&#x27;?) like you don&#x27;t have powder on, and I can live with that. I only blot lightly once or twice during the day to get it down to a more &#x27;matte&#x27; look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this product affordable and you only need to use a little amount (for me, just to cover the T-zone). It also did not make me break out, but I can&#x27;t guarantee that for all skin types.</li>
            <li> Keep looking. I had a shiny face within an hour. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love that a little goes a long way with this primer, my makeup does not move when I wear this and it does not feel oily. It feels so smooth and soft when applying it and no creases. Definitely recommend this primer</li>
            <li> wow wow wow .... this is what i needed for a flawless look. i usually wear it alone ( no makeup) its just as fine...infact, perfect. will always use this product!</li>
            <li> I have tried several products to eliminate the shine on my face. I have tried the milk of magnesia which I like and will continue to use because this product did not work. I have tried using this product for weeks. Upon application, there was no immediate matte effect and none thereafter. This was truly a waste of money and I am disappointed because I own several NYX products that I enjoy.</li>
            <li> While I have been very happy with NYX Butter Gloss and Mascara, this product did not cut the mustard. I was oily within a few hours.</li>
            <li> I like how it mattifys your skin&#x27;s look, but yes, it is a bit small....</li>
            <li> It works really great. Every time I use it I don&#x27;t get oily throughout the day. I love how my face doesn&#x27;t look shiny. The only thing I dislike is that I have to apply it before I apply my foundation if I apply it after, my face will look oily throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It did not help me to cover the oily areas</li>
            <li> I bought this for the simple reason that summers where I live are hot and humid and I had hoped that during the summer this would help keep some of the shine from surfacing on my face and messing up my makeup.  So, on the first 80 degree day, I got it out and put it on as directed and hoped I had found the answer to the problem I have every summer-oil slick face induced by high humidity, especially on my &amp;#34;t-zone&amp;#34;.  Keep in mind, I am 51 and suffer from dry skin but in the summer, my face does a complete 180 and becomes an oil slick as aforementioned.  In any event, after doing my makeup routine as I normally do,( the difference using &amp;#34;Shine Killer&amp;#34;) I went about my day though not doing anything out of the ordinary, just a relaxing day at home just to see how this product held up and in about three hours, checked my face in the mirror.  To my chagrin, what I saw was the same oil slick I have always seen since I can recall!!! This product did not work for me at all, so I resign myself from looking for &amp;#34;miracle products in a bottle&amp;#34; and will stock up on blotter paper for the entire summer.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work the best for me. I apply by 6am and by 9 my T zone is oily again.</li>
            <li> Great product. I always use NYX</li>
            <li> I really love this product. I have oily skin so I put this on often and I can see the shine diminish right away. I put it on before I put my foundation on and sometimes I will add extra after I&#x27;m done putting my makeup on. It keeps my face looking matte and oil-free for at least 6 hours. It also comes on clear and it has no build up or cakey feeling to it. I would recommend this to anyone with oily skin. :)</li>
            <li> Shine Killer definitely works, although (on my skin) not for a very long time. I do have naturally oily skin, but I do not regret buying at all. Feels nice going on, very soft and light. Didn&#x27;t cause any unnecessary breakouts -- or any breakouts, for that matter.</li>
