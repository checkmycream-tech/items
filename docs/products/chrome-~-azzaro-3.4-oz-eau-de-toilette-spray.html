            <li> I began wearing a few years ago after a friend introduced me to it. The scent never overpowers me or my clothes, and lasts well into the day. In my life, I&#x27;ve never received the amount of positive feedback for any other cologne I&#x27;ve worn. Literally at least once a week, someone, usually a woman, notices it and compliments the fragrance.
