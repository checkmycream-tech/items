            <li>But even after I straighten my hair it still smells wonderful and keeps my hair looking amazing.</li>
            <li>Great conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s just say my hair suffered greatly at the hands of a beautician who colored it</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy it, but the sample might be good to keep on hand in case of of a hair emergency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well, I gave it a try and LOVED IT.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells great and feels even better when you shingle it through your hair.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>It does leave my hair very soft and it feels wonderful running my fingers through it.  </li>
            <li>It has a very strong chemical tone to that bubblegum scent which is nauseating.</li>
            <li>this is by far the best thing for hair care.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and it smells so sweet!!</li>

            <li>and I&#x27;ve got about three more treatments before it&#x27;s gone</li>
            <li>I think I even like it better than my Macadamia Nut conditioner.</li>
            <li>It makes me feel better</li>
            <li>And I love it.</li>
            <li>And I love the bubble gum smell.</li>
            <li>Great product, but the price is a bit much for me.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and I love how soft ad beautiful</li>
            <li>Now I am off to buying the full size of this! :)</li>
            <li>Excellent mask for really dry curly hair</li>
            <li>You get a good amount too that should last for a good while.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great and no heavy oils!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get top.</li>
            <li>I noticed my hair grew pretty fast using this regularly,and my hair looked great .I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>It is very sweet, reminds me of candy, but once rinsed out, the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to linger for those not into sweet scents.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, I tried it anyway because Miss Jessie&#x27;s has promotions where they periodically send out free samples, so I figured \\&quot;What the hell?\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make the hair fell soft ,and smell good</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t abhor this particular product, but honestly it didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair gets frizzy after I use it (because it finally has some moisture), but I love this product because it keeps my hair healthy!</li>
            <li>This product worked okay for my hair; I think it&#x27;s better on 100% natural hair.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like... obnoxiously sweet.</li>
            <li>Miss Jessie&#x27;s Super Sweetback Treatment detangles my hair and keeps it moisturized.</li>
            <li>Miss Jessie&#x27;s had the Super Sweetback Treatment on sale a couple months ago.</li>
            <li>this made my hair very soft and manageable..amoazon always come thru love the proudut will</li>
            <li>/&gt;I won&#x27;t go as far as to say that the product itself is just the bane of hair care, but we all know (most of us through trial and error</li>
            <li>My hair absorbed it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Always love this product and how soft it makes my hair</li>
            <li>For me it was worth the 30 minute wait.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny that I don&#x27;t mind paying for the buttercreme but balk at the treatment.  </li>
            <li>I love the way a deep conditioner can still keep a scent after two days.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner as a detangler and deep moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I love this deep treatment!</li>
            <li>also, my husband suffers from some kind of dermatitis and after trying many medicated shampoo&#x27;s and oils for over a year with no relief, this product alleviated his itchy scalp. .</li>
            <li>The directions suggest you sit under a dryer or let the steam from a hot shower help it along.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have a dryer and my hot water heater wasn&#x27;t going to allow for a 15 minute steam, but after a five minute steam, the product seemed to work well.</li>
            <li>I am on a fixed income and I try to use products that are rich in returns as for as making my hair moist, but I cannot continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my natural hair feels sooooo soft</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to fight with her to wash and condition her hair because she wants her hair &amp;#34;to smell like it too&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>My hair was much healthier after I used this along with an oil based product like Moroccan oil.</li>
            <li>It really grows my 4c hair.</li>
            <li>but much less than Kerastase, (which I love)</li>
            <li>that every product isn&#x27;t for everybody, but this particular one isn&#x27;t for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do have enough left for one more treatment</li>
            <li>I can now be outside on a very hot day and my head will not smell of sweat or anything.</li>
            <li>It made my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very soft and silky.</li>
            <li>This conditioner leaves my hair soft for at least three days and the shine is so healthy and not too much.</li>
            <li>SST is pink and when you first open the jar it has a sweet sugary smell, it reminded me of cotton candy.</li>
            <li>I have long, thick &amp; wavy hair and this product works really good for me.</li>
            <li>My hair felt very soft when the treatment was complete.  </li>
            <li>Why do I need a product, designed for natural hair care, to smell like childrens candy?</li>
            <li>No, not silky but soft and detangled.  </li>
            <li>It was so much cheaper on amazon which is the the only reason I bought it.</li>
            <li>and I have curly that I don&#x27;t wear natural because I just don&#x27;t like it like this.</li>
            <li>It makes make hair soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>My hair is extremely soft after I use this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a different kind of thick.</li>
            <li>Initially I was put off by Miss J&#x27;s products because mineral oil is a main ingredient in the buttercreme, &amp;amp; curly puddings.</li>
            <li>And you know what, it was worth the wait (even though it came in less than 5 days).</li>
            <li>and I started using this product after I moved to the high desert (extremely dry conditions).</li>
            <li>I used to have to wash my hair every other day and would end up with very frizzy hair.</li>

            <li> leaves my hair feeling super soft &amp;amp; silky after showering, akin to Wen products in feel, and just as expensive.</li>
            <li> I started using this product in Afghanistan when deployed and would flat iron my hair and week after week.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just different than other deep conditioners I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> My hair was so soft and fluffy.</li>
            <li> I will use this conditioner for a long time.</li>
            <li> However, I think being exposed to the air has caused the scent to change to a strange chemical smell.</li>
            <li> I have dry, curly hair</li>
            <li> I had seen the item on the website and was curious on how it worked, but I was intimidated by the price; $48 is a lot of money for some conditioner.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was due to the ingredients or my imagination.</li>
            <li> My hair is actually a little on the dry side after using this.</li>
            <li> Wow, I&#x27;m in love with this treatment, but it is mad expensive.  </li>
            <li> Felt way too heavy &amp;amp; greasy for my delicate fine dry curls, even the smallest amount resulted in limp oily sad hair.</li>
            <li> It kinda clumps together when you scoop it from the jar, so be careful not to waste it if youre using it in the shower.</li>
            <li> totally way too expensive...</li>
            <li> and I usually leave it in over night.</li>
            <li> if you are thinking about it think no more buy it.....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use hair or beauty treatments that take a lot of time to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; or use as I don&#x27;t have the patience for waiting.</li>
            <li> Hard to get rid of after use as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a Lil hard to explain, but it&#x27;s thick.</li>
            <li> The consistency is slippery and really thick.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and it moisturizers it.</li>
            <li> I hated the smell, first off.</li>
            <li> I have tried to look for another less expensive product but nothing works like this.</li>
            <li> That routine has my 4C textured hair moisturized for at least a week!</li>
            <li> been addicted since.</li>
            <li> This smells terrible.</li>
            <li> I just HATE the smell!</li>

            <li> Love the way it makes my natural hair feels sooooo soft</li>
            <li> I hated the smell, first off. Why do I need a product, designed for natural hair care, to smell like childrens candy? It&#x27;s like... obnoxiously sweet. Yuck...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I tried it anyway because Miss Jessie&#x27;s has promotions where they periodically send out free samples, so I figured \\&quot;What the hell?\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I don&#x27;t abhor this particular product, but honestly it didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair.

That routine has my 4C textured hair moisturized for at least a week!</li>
            <li> Smells lovely and helps keep my hair healthy</li>
            <li> Great purchase, came in great time. Wife loves the product.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and feels even better when you shingle it through your hair. The consistency is slippery and really thick. It kinda clumps together when you scoop it from the jar, so be careful not to waste it if youre using it in the shower. After I let the product sit in my hair for 30 min or so, I rinsed and it felt alright. Nothing special. Felt like when I deep condition my hair with creme of nature shampoo. Save your dough.</li>
            <li> Initially I was put off by Miss J&#x27;s products because mineral oil is a main ingredient in the buttercreme, &amp;amp; curly puddings. Felt way too heavy &amp;amp; greasy for my delicate fine dry curls, even the smallest amount resulted in limp oily sad hair. Then I hit the Sweetback treatment. This stuff is great and no heavy oils! leaves my hair feeling super soft &amp;amp; silky after showering, akin to Wen products in feel, and just as expensive. I leave in @ 5-15 mins, rinse &amp;amp; sometimes put a very tiny amount on my hair mixed w/ a leave in, I find it helps my curls keep their shape.&lt;br /&gt;I find the candy smell cloying, but it doesn&#x27;t stick around and make your hair smell weird.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s totally way too expensive... but much less than Kerastase, (which I love) and you get a giant tub that lasts a while.</li>
            <li> Wow, I&#x27;m in love with this treatment, but it is mad expensive.  I have the 2 oz container and I&#x27;ve got about three more treatments before it&#x27;s gone and I&#x27;ve got quite a bit of hair.  Still, I&#x27;m blown away by the price.    So, yeah, great conditioner.  My hair absorbed it.  I used my heating cap, but next time I think I won&#x27;t just because the instructions don&#x27;t instruct you to use heat.  Detangled quite well.  My hair felt very soft when the treatment was complete.  The smell is divine.  It is very sweet, reminds me of candy, but once rinsed out, the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to linger for those not into sweet scents.  It&#x27;s funny that I don&#x27;t mind paying for the buttercreme but balk at the treatment.  Perhaps because it is a treatment.  Instructions say to use it once per week.  It has the texture of custard.  Did my hair feel siky afterwards?  No, not silky but soft and detangled.  Had I used a rinse, I would have gotten silky, but I was focused on strictly using Miss Jessie&#x27;s products so that I could rate it properly.  I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> This product worked okay for my hair; I think it&#x27;s better on 100% natural hair.</li>
            <li> This smells terrible. It has a very strong chemical tone to that bubblegum scent which is nauseating. Hard to get rid of after use as well.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT! Miss Jessie&#x27;s Super Sweetback Treatment detangles my hair and keeps it moisturized.</li>
            <li> I like how the product works on my hair. I have thick curly hair and it moisturizers it. I just HATE the smell! It smells like bubble gum. It was so much cheaper on amazon which is the the only reason I bought it. I wasn&#x27;t paying the regular $45 price.</li>
            <li> I got this in my Birchbox a while back and I just stuck it into a box where I keep all my samples. One day I ran out of my Macadamia Nut deep conditioner that I swear by and I was looking for one that I could use. I looked for one in my sample box and said whatever I will just give it a try. Well, I gave it a try and LOVED IT. I think I even like it better than my Macadamia Nut conditioner. I love the way a deep conditioner can still keep a scent after two days. It makes me feel better and I always get compliments. This conditioner leaves my hair soft for at least three days and the shine is so healthy and not too much. I know it is intended for curly hair and I have curly that I don&#x27;t wear natural because I just don&#x27;t like it like this. But even after I straighten my hair it still smells wonderful and keeps my hair looking amazing. I recommend this 100%! Now I am off to buying the full size of this! :)</li>
            <li> Excellent mask for really dry curly hair</li>
            <li> Great conditioner.  I use it as a prepoo and I usually leave it in over night.</li>
            <li> the best conditioner for hair - I love this stuff and it smells so sweet!! Boyfriend loves how this smells and I love how soft ad beautiful this makes my hair!!</li>
            <li> I have dry, curly hair and I started using this product after I moved to the high desert (extremely dry conditions). My hair started breaking and falling out after the move so I invested in this stuff, used it 1-3 times a month and noticed a big difference in my hair. My hair gets frizzy after I use it (because it finally has some moisture), but I love this product because it keeps my hair healthy!</li>
            <li> this made my hair very soft and manageable..amoazon always come thru love the proudut will but again...if you are thinking about it think no more buy it.....</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner as a detangler and deep moisturizer. I use it for myself and my daughter. I don&#x27;t think I would function without it.</li>
            <li> Although it smells like bubble gum, i like it. It makes make hair soft and moisturized. You get a good amount too that should last for a good while.</li>
            <li> Searching since 2000&lt;br /&gt;finally.&lt;br /&gt;thankyou!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get top. And you know what, it was worth the wait (even though it came in less than 5 days). It&#x27;s just different than other deep conditioners I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s a different kind of thick. It&#x27;s a Lil hard to explain, but it&#x27;s thick. And I love it. It made my hair very soft. I even used it as a leave I condish. My hair was so soft and fluffy. It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I love this deep treatment! It leaves my hair very soft and silky. It&#x27;s the best conditioner I have found to date. And I love the bubble gum smell. My daughter loves the smell too so I don&#x27;t have to fight with her to wash and condition her hair because she wants her hair &amp;#34;to smell like it too&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> this is by far the best thing for hair care. I used to have to wash my hair every other day and would end up with very frizzy hair. after I started using Miss Jessie&#x27;s I wash my hair every 5 days. I can now be outside on a very hot day and my head will not smell of sweat or anything. I have long, thick &amp; wavy hair and this product works really good for me. I have tried to look for another less expensive product but nothing works like this. also, my husband suffers from some kind of dermatitis and after trying many medicated shampoo&#x27;s and oils for over a year with no relief, this product alleviated his itchy scalp. .</li>
            <li> Great product, but the price is a bit much for me.  I am on a fixed income and I try to use products that are rich in returns as for as making my hair moist, but I cannot continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> This conditioning treatment is superb!!!!  My hair is extremely soft after I use this product.  I will use this conditioner for a long time.</li>
            <li> Always love this product and how soft it makes my hair</li>
            <li> Make the hair fell soft ,and smell good</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use hair or beauty treatments that take a lot of time to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; or use as I don&#x27;t have the patience for waiting. Let&#x27;s just say my hair suffered greatly at the hands of a beautician who colored it and I needed a deep conditioning to try and start the reparation process. The directions suggest you sit under a dryer or let the steam from a hot shower help it along. I didn&#x27;t have a dryer and my hot water heater wasn&#x27;t going to allow for a 15 minute steam, but after a five minute steam, the product seemed to work well. My hair was much healthier after I used this along with an oil based product like Moroccan oil. For me it was worth the 30 minute wait.</li>
            <li> It is the best product for curly hairs.</li>
            <li> It really grows my 4c hair.I started using this product in Afghanistan when deployed and would flat iron my hair and week after week.I noticed my hair grew pretty fast using this regularly,and my hair looked great .I&#x27;ve been addicted since.Love it.</li>
            <li> Miss Jessie&#x27;s had the Super Sweetback Treatment on sale a couple months ago. I had seen the item on the website and was curious on how it worked, but I was intimidated by the price; $48 is a lot of money for some conditioner. Since the item was being sold temporarily at a discount, I decided to purchase it. SST is pink and when you first open the jar it has a sweet sugary smell, it reminded me of cotton candy. However, I think being exposed to the air has caused the scent to change to a strange chemical smell. I have used the product twice already, applying and leaving it on my hair for 30 minutes before rinsing it out. It does leave my hair very soft and it feels wonderful running my fingers through it.  One thing I noticed is that some of the conditioner got on my lips and after I wiped it off there was a numbing sensation on my lips. I don&#x27;t know if it was due to the ingredients or my imagination. I do have enough left for one more treatment and I think after that I&#x27;ll probably occasionally buy the 2 oz containers. Even though I think the price is ridiculous, Super Sweetback Treatment definitely delivers what it promises.</li>
