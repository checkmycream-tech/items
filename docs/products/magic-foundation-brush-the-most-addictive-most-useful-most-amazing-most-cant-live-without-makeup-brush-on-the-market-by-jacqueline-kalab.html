            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>The brush fits in my hand nicely.</li>
            <li>&amp; it really does apply them so flawlessly, you can&#x27;t see lines or creases in the makeup created by the brush because it doesn&#x27;t create any.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can honestly say it is more than I bargained for.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>This the key to perfect make-up.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to use and love this brush since it does have mostly great reviews but for paying $40 for a brush I would hope that it would not arrive in this condition</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I splurged on this brush.</li>
            <li>I really would still love to try it!!</li>
            <li>The brush is super soft and feels wonderful against my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also compact and the easy carry case allows you to tuck away safely.</li>
            <li>love the handle because it makes it easy to hold instead of sliding out of my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Love this brush, it is fabulous.</li>
            <li>The little pocket that the brush comes in is just brilliant!</li>
            <li>As a professional makeup artist working in the industry for over 14years I truly believe this is the best foundation brush I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>Oh, and its  great  for a  facial massage.</li>
            <li>Looks cheaply made or maybe it&#x27;s just the one I received.</li>
            <li>nakeup goes on smooth....</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money and more.</li>
            <li>I currently own over 10 different foundation brushes and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I do not use this brush much because it is not my favorite for mineral powder foundation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll be buying more for my kit and one for my own personal use ;)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not what it says it does..not worthy it...</li>
            <li>I love experimenting with new beauty products, so</li>
            <li>The handle is thick and smooth and fits nicely in my hand, which makes it very easy for me to buff my foundation out to perfection.</li>
            <li>I received this item to share my honest opinions and experiences with potential future buyers, and I can honestly say this brush has been getting a ton of use.</li>
            <li>whatever foundation you use will look and feel more natural.</li>
            <li>It is so cute and very soft and applies makeup very well.</li>
            <li>It is so soft on your skin and easily handled.</li>
            <li>The first time you apply your make-up, concealer ect.</li>
            <li>I find myself reaching for my Sigma F82 first.</li>
            <li>I have many brushes of various quality.</li>
            <li>foundation brush comes with a small leather pouch for storage, and I really like having a way to keep it nice and clean when it is in my makeup kit.</li>
            <li>The brush is compact yet has a very high quality, sleek appearance.</li>
            <li>The synthetic hairs are very densely packed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Right out of the box, the first thing that I noticed is how soft and dense the brush is.</li>
            <li>So Jacqueline, if you could make it more round and change the texture of the bristles at the very end of the brush,it would be 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this brush.</li>
            <li>now I may be able to throw my other brushes away!!</li>
            <li>This foundation brush is by far my absolute favourite.</li>
            <li>I wish the head of the brush was more round than oblong.</li>
            <li>Brush arrived today and it does not look new.</li>
            <li>but I was able to apply the base so quickly (which I usually put the most emphasis on) with this magic brush that I got all of the bridal party done 20mins</li>
            <li>as soon as you apply it blends, no streaks, no residue and no uneven application no need to buff it into the skin!</li>
            <li>This brush leaves no streaks, no residue and no uneven application.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for primer, concealer, cream foundation &amp; moisturiser so far</li>
            <li>So soft and feels so professional.</li>
            <li>The bristles are so, so soft, even, fluffy, yet nice and tight.</li>
            <li>you know I sat right down and put this lil fella to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m impressed.&amp;#34; As a makeup artist I often look at certain things other woman may not.</li>
            <li>That being said, it takes nearly twenty four hours for it to dry after washing The brush may be too dense.</li>
            <li>I did a wedding last weekend of 4 people, they were an hour and a half late, I was sure I would not have time for all of them</li>
            <li>I find that it hangs on to a little too much product.</li>

            <li> I am using this brush for Bare Minerals loose Foundation.</li>

            <li> I have not had any issues with the brush shedding, and it has kept its shape even after quite a few washes.</li>
            <li> This makes for an uneven application.</li>
            <li> I have had a serious obsession with make up and make up tools since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> I have brushes from all walks of life designer make up brand, MAC, Napoleon, Ben NYE as well as the random brush here</li>

            <li> This brush feels soooo amazing on your skin, it’s like a mini morning massage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It applies and blends so easily, a flawless and fabulous finish...</li>
            <li> I had heard a lot of good things about this foundation brush and as soon as it came in the mail I just couldn&#x27;t wait to give it a try. I love experimenting with new beauty products, so you know I sat right down and put this lil fella to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right out of the box, the first thing that I noticed is how soft and dense the brush is. It is a shorter brush than I am used to working with, but I think I have found that I actually prefer that now. The handle is thick and smooth and fits nicely in my hand, which makes it very easy for me to buff my foundation out to perfection. I have to say, my foundation blended out beautifully and comes out completely flawless with this brush. I typically apply my foundation with a Tarte Airbrush Finish Bamboo Foundation Brush and this little guy is definitely giving my Tarte brush a run for its money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foundation brush comes with a small leather pouch for storage, and I really like having a way to keep it nice and clean when it is in my makeup kit. I have not had any issues with the brush shedding, and it has kept its shape even after quite a few washes. I received this item to share my honest opinions and experiences with potential future buyers, and I can honestly say this brush has been getting a ton of use. I use it several times a week and I&#x27;m still impressed with it every time, my foundation comes out smooth, even and blended flawlessly.</li>
            <li> Love! One of the best makeup brushes I own.</li>
            <li> The first time you apply your make-up, concealer ect. with this brush. It just sells it&#x27;s self. Keep up with it, because you will not like applying make-up without it. whatever foundation you use will look and feel more natural. Just get it, you will love it! Oh, and its  great  for a  facial massage.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It is so cute and very soft and applies makeup very well. It&#x27;s my fave brush out of the ones I own :D&lt;br /&gt;I love the handle because it makes it easy to hold instead of sliding out of my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to clean. No shedding has occurred. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> This brush blends make-up flawlessly! This the key to perfect make-up. This brush saves product and time with an even finish. I&#x27;ve used this brush with MAC products and Makeup Forever. I currently own over 10 different foundation brushes and this is my favorite. I actually prefer this brush over my stippling foundation brush and my beauty sponge. It&#x27;s also compact and the easy carry case allows you to tuck away safely. This brush leaves no streaks, no residue and no uneven application. Amazing!!</li>
            <li> I use less of my mineral makeup with this brush. Love it. Wish had found it earlier.</li>
            <li> I am ashamed to say That I had never used a makeup brush before using this one. I will never go back to fingers! It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> Brush arrived today and it does not look new. Looks cheaply made or maybe it&#x27;s just the one I received. The metal part that meets the brush handle is already bent and the wood part looks already scratched up and there is a gap. I&#x27;m  afraid it will fall apart if I use it or wash it. I really wanted to use and love this brush since it does have mostly great reviews but for paying $40 for a brush I would hope that it would not arrive in this condition 😳 Please Jacqueline have the quality of the brush checked before being sold and shipped. I really would still love to try it!! I guess I will have to return.</li>
            <li> Love this brush, it is fabulous.The quality is superb, and using it is a pleasure. I HIGHLY recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what it says it does..not worthy it...keep whar u have...Laura feller has the best brushes..especially their kabuki brush..nakeup goes on smooth....no to this product...</li>
            <li> I am using this brush for Bare Minerals loose Foundation. The brush is super soft and feels wonderful against my skin. The synthetic hairs are very densely packed. I have yet to see it loose any hairs with washing. That being said, it takes nearly twenty four hours for it to dry after washing The brush may be too dense. I find that it hangs on to a little too much product. This makes for an uneven application. The brush fits in my hand nicely. It also comes with a storage sleeve,so the bristles don&#x27;t splay. I wish the head of the brush was more round than oblong. I find myself reaching for my Sigma F82 first. There is something about the bristles at the end of the F82 that seem to make all the difference for me. So Jacqueline, if you could make it more round and change the texture of the bristles at the very end of the brush,it would be 5 stars.  This is an update to my previous review. I do not use this brush much because it is not my favorite for mineral powder foundation. I have washed this brush three times. I never submerge my brushes in water when cleaning. I lay all my brushes flat to dry. Today I noticed that the ferrule is separating from the handle. I have many brushes of various quality. I have never had a brush do this. I have only had this brush since the beginning of December 2014. I cannot recommend this brush. I hope I can get my money back. Stay tuned for another update.  I am happy to say that I received my refund without an issue.</li>
            <li> Great quality brush.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I splurged on this brush. It&#x27;s pricey but the quality is good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been one for writing reviews unless I&#x27;m absolutely passionate about something. As a professional makeup artist working in the industry for over 14years I truly believe this is the best foundation brush I&#x27;ve used so far. All the other well known brands in my brush roll have been neglected ever since I&#x27;ve owned it! Everyone I use it on loves how it feels and the finish it gives. It&#x27;s a must for professionals and for personal use too. I&#x27;ve lent this brush to fellow makeup artists to try and they&#x27;ve all been converted. I must purchase another before they are a sellout!</li>
            <li> This brush is just absolutely brilliant! It&#x27;s so time &amp; product saving. I&#x27;ve used it for primer, concealer, cream foundation &amp; moisturiser so far &amp; it really does apply them so flawlessly, you can&#x27;t see lines or creases in the makeup created by the brush because it doesn&#x27;t create any.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a professional makeup artist &amp; this is a god send when it comes to a big wedding in minimal time! I did a wedding last weekend of 4 people, they were an hour and a half late, I was sure I would not have time for all of them but I was able to apply the base so quickly (which I usually put the most emphasis on) with this magic brush that I got all of the bridal party done 20mins early!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be buying more for my kit and one for my own personal use ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Jacqueline Kalab!&lt;br /&gt;Xo&lt;br /&gt;Love Jo</li>
            <li> I love this brush!! I have had a serious obsession with make up and make up tools since I was a teenager. I have everything and anything you could imagine. I have brushes from all walks of life designer make up brand, MAC, Napoleon, Ben NYE as well as the random brush here and there from different places. I currently have over 100 brushes and 7 foundation brushes. This foundation brush is by far my absolute favourite. I LOVE IT!!! as soon as you apply it blends, no streaks, no residue and no uneven application no need to buff it into the skin! this brush does it all at once!!! I cannot wait to get the rest of the set now I may be able to throw my other brushes away!!</li>
            <li> So soft and feels so professional.</li>
            <li> My eyes widened and I thought to myself &amp;#34;wow, I&#x27;m impressed.&amp;#34; As a makeup artist I often look at certain things other woman may not. The brush is compact yet has a very high quality, sleek appearance. The little pocket that the brush comes in is just brilliant! The bristles are so, so soft, even, fluffy, yet nice and tight. This brush JUST by the look alone has me drooling as a makeup artist. I can honestly say it is more than I bargained for. It is so soft on your skin and easily handled. Definitely worth the money and more. I would buy this over a MAC brush ANY day!!!</li>
