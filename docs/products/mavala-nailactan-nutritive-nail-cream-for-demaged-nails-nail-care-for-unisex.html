    <ol>
            <li>Excellent for cuticles</li>
            <li>I think it works best without polish; I find that when I use it with polish on my nails, my polish doesn&#x27;t hold up.</li>

            <li>Try it; I hope you will be as pleased as I am!</li>
            <li>Rubbing it in every night, even with polish on your nails, can produce amazing results.  </li>
            <li>but this treatment was not as effective.</li>
            <li>Not only does he have the best price</li>
            <li>I have used it for a number of years with lasting results, beautiful nails!</li>
            <li>Within a couple days the nails are shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li>so many cuticle creams out there; but this one seems to do what it says it will do</li>
            <li>the pen works better for me.</li>
            <li>This nail treatment is okay, but I get an immediate relief with the pen.</li>
            <li>This is a Swiss company and the aim of this seminar was to show how using these healthy products could regenerate peeling, splitting and cracking nails.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just like magic.....</li>
            <li>She has beautiful long manicured nails now</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited...</li>
            <li>It moisturises the nails and makes them look nice and soft.</li>
            <li>While with the jar you may be able to get a tiny bit more product, I find the tube easier to apply.</li>
            <li>She loves it and and has seen a tremendous improvement in her nails.</li>
            <li>I bought another product to use on my nails that works better for MY particular problem ...</li>
            <li>A tad expensive,but worth the price.</li>
            <li>The first time I ever purchased this product was when I was 14 when they use to sell Mavala products in JcPenny&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I happened upon a nail seminar that spoke of using only healthy products: specifically , Mavala.  </li>
            <li>The bonus for me is that not only are my nails healthier but my cuticles are perfect and only need pushing back with a towel.  </li>
            <li>You need only a very small amount each day to have you nails looking their best.  </li>
            <li>Had a lot of trouble with my nails peeling on top at the tips; since using Nailactan, I haven&#x27;t had that problem AT ALL!  </li>
            <li>I apply a tiny dap of this to my cuticles before bed and it has made a huge difference in my cuticles and nails.  </li>
            <li>works very well  </li>
            <li>but also he ships the product fast.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Nailactan &amp; also Mavaderma by Mavala, if you want your nails to grow out faster &amp; healthier!</li>
            <li>The nailactin has restored pliability and sheen to my nails and much needed moisture to the nail bed and cuticles.</li>
            <li>The Nailactin is an intense moisturizer that works on the matrix of the nail.  </li>
            <li>It worked very well.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other cuticle creams and oils, but always return to this product.  </li>
            <li>The price seems high at first, but the jar lasts months, so the cost is actually a good price point (a little goes a long way).</li>
            <li>My finger nails feel smoother and my cuticles are adequately moisturized without having to constantly apply lotion all day.</li>
            <li>Absorbed quickly ,I do see a different in my nails ,Use the complete set  the oil,nail cream ,harder to get the full benefit for it to work .It</li>
            <li>Considering that I work in healthcare and wash my hands countless times throughout the day and my cuticles are healthy and not cracked and cross speaks volumes to how far this stuff goes!</li>
            <li>This product allowed my nails to grow long &amp; healthy, as long as I&#x27;m not chewing them up!</li>
            <li>I discovered this cuticle cream several years ago, it is a fantastic for dry cuticles.</li>
            <li>This actually works very well.</li>
            <li>I tried all the growth and strengtheners but none seemed to help much and it was tedious having to apply a fresh coat each day to clean nails.</li>
            <li>I then resorted to acrylic nails which looked pretty but essentially did further damage with grinding them with power tools.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I purchased this product , actually for my teenage daughter.</li>
            <li>The price is not bad considering that you only use a bit every night, so the container should last a long time.</li>
            <li>The program suggests removing all polish every 6 to 8 days and using the Nailactin on your bare nails for an overnight treatment before repolishing.  </li>
            <li>They were a hot mess.</li>
            <li>As a little girl I always wanted my mom to have beautiful long manicured nails, unfortunately even after years of treatment including injections, supplements, lotions.....</li>
            <li>It does make my once paper thin nails strong.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price, and a very little goes a long way.</li>

            <li> I just loved this product! My nails are growing much long now!</li>
            <li> My wife uses it every night at bedtime.  Then sit&#x27;s and smells her fingers as she likes the aroma so well.  Works great on repairing and growing nails.</li>
            <li> I discovered this cuticle cream several years ago, it is a fantastic for dry cuticles.</li>
            <li> Excellent for cuticles</li>
            <li> This actually works very well. I think it works best without polish; I find that when I use it with polish on my nails, my polish doesn&#x27;t hold up. It does make my once paper thin nails strong. However, if you want to keep them that way, you have to use this regularly. The price seems high at first, but the jar lasts months, so the cost is actually a good price point (a little goes a long way).</li>
            <li> Absorbed quickly ,I do see a different in my nails ,Use the complete set  the oil,nail cream ,harder to get the full benefit for it to work .It works very well  yes I would order this again .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a while.  My nails have grown so I guess it&#x27;s working.  Will keep using to see if it makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Rec&#x27;d in timely manner and product seems to be very good, I use it every day and cannot wait for results.  I&#x27;m excited...</li>
            <li> I have been a nail biter since I was a little girl &amp; have very weak chewed up ugly nails that have trouble growing out fast. The first time I ever purchased this product was when I was 14 when they use to sell Mavala products in JcPenny&#x27;s. I am now 35 &amp; have always had great results using Nailactan. This product allowed my nails to grow long &amp; healthy, as long as I&#x27;m not chewing them up! I have tried using other products that are out there, but this one is the only one that seems to actually work. The price is not bad considering that you only use a bit every night, so the container should last a long time. I usually only purchase this product from this seller, unless he is out of stock. Not only does he have the best price but also he ships the product fast. I highly recommend Nailactan &amp; also Mavaderma by Mavala, if you want your nails to grow out faster &amp; healthier!</li>
            <li> As a nurse who is constantly washing my hands, I have peeling dry cuticles.  I apply a tiny dap of this to my cuticles before bed and it has made a huge difference in my cuticles and nails.  Also has helped me to stop biting my nails.</li>
            <li> great for cracked nails. It moisturises the nails and makes them look nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Great product. I have used it for a number of years with lasting results, beautiful nails!</li>
            <li> I have used this nutritive cream for several years.  It is a perfect moisturizer for your cuticles and nail. Your nails will grow without effort.  The strength of your nails will be pleasing.  Would recommend this cream and this seller.</li>
            <li> My mom has used this cream since I was a kid. Now I use it. It&#x27;s the best on the market!</li>
            <li> Love this product - it helped revive my nails after they were seriously dehydrated following gel treatments continuously for a few years!! Cannot recommend highly enough (only thing I would mention is the smell is a bit like your granny&#x27;s perfume but you get used to it)</li>
            <li> I picked my nails my entire life  (I&#x27;m 29) and when I say pick I mean my nails were so short swiping a nail brush horizontally across my nail would completely cover the entire fingernail. They were a hot mess. I tried all the growth and strengtheners but none seemed to help much and it was tedious having to apply a fresh coat each day to clean nails. I then resorted to acrylic nails which looked pretty but essentially did further damage with grinding them with power tools. I had extremely dry and flaky cuticles no matter how often I applied oil and lotion nothing seemed to help. That all changed when I tried Mavala!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mavala does wonders!!!  All it takes is applying the lotion on the nails massaging cuticles before bed. It absorbs so quickly so it really only takes maybe a minute or 2 to do. Within a couple days the nails are shiny and healthy.  It works with the nails you have now so you wont have to wait and wait to see improvement. My finger nails feel smoother and my cuticles are adequately moisturized without having to constantly apply lotion all day. Considering that I work in healthcare and wash my hands countless times throughout the day and my cuticles are healthy and not cracked and cross speaks volumes to how far this stuff goes! A little bit goes a long way! If you miss a couple days your nails don&#x27;t look too awful as opposed to other products once you stop using it your nails go back to where you started. While with the jar you may be able to get a tiny bit more product, I find the tube easier to apply.</li>
            <li> Loved the cuticle cream but this treatment was not as effective.</li>

You need only a very small amount each day to have you nails looking their best.  I&#x27;ve gotten compliments ... so I recommend you give this a try ... you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Ordered this based on the excellent reviews online . . . and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  My nails and cuticles look the best they&#x27;ve looked in years - if ever - and they just keep improving.  Had a lot of trouble with my nails peeling on top at the tips; since using Nailactan, I haven&#x27;t had that problem AT ALL!  Definitely worth the price, and a very little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> works well to keep cuticles in shape.  use at night and it&#x27;ll improve your nails a lot.  its good for nails</li>
            <li> This is the first time I purchased this product , actually for my teenage daughter.She loves it and and has seen a tremendous improvement in her nails.A tad expensive,but worth the price.</li>
            <li> Been using for years - wonderful</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as a result of having my nails polised with a shellac polish which I will never do again. The nailactin has restored pliability and sheen to my nails and much needed moisture to the nail bed and cuticles.</li>
            <li> I used this several times. I didn&#x27;t notice a difference. I bought another product to use on my nails that works better for MY particular problem ... http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000J40H3W/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1 ... I wash &amp; / or use alcohol based cleansers HUNDREDS of times a day at work (health care worker) and my ends split &amp; tear and the pen works better for me. This nail treatment is okay, but I get an immediate relief with the pen. I will keep using the Malava Nailactan Nutritive Treatment at the cuticle to see if it helps in the longer run ...</li>
            <li> Two years ago I was talking to doctors about my problem nails, with no results.  I happened upon a nail seminar that spoke of using only healthy products: specifically , Mavala.  This is a Swiss company and the aim of this seminar was to show how using these healthy products could regenerate peeling, splitting and cracking nails.  It sounded just like me.  The Nailactin is an intense moisturizer that works on the matrix of the nail.  Rubbing it in every night, even with polish on your nails, can produce amazing results.  The program suggests removing all polish every 6 to 8 days and using the Nailactin on your bare nails for an overnight treatment before repolishing.  The bonus for me is that not only are my nails healthier but my cuticles are perfect and only need pushing back with a towel.  Try it; I hope you will be as pleased as I am!</li>
            <li> So happy to find this. I found it a store years ago. It worked very well.</li>
            <li> As a little girl I always wanted my mom to have beautiful long manicured nails, unfortunately even after years of treatment including injections, supplements, lotions..... her nails remained weak, thin and it could not grow longer than two millimeters. It was only 10 years ago that I discovered Mavala products and and begged my mom to give it a try. AMAZING results!!! She has beautiful long manicured nails now, it&#x27;s just like magic.....</li>
