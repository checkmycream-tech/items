            <li>Lol.</li>
            <li>Great for bathing with.</li>
            <li>Lol</li>
            <li>:) Very happy with this soap.</li>
            <li>It is good for things like feet and underarms.  </li>
            <li>I love this soap and so does ALL of my family!</li>
            <li>I got this soap because I wanted something cruelty free but still had a great scent to it.</li>
            <li>Jason is a good product and easy to recommend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s organic, not tested on animals and with no animal ingredients, which is very important to me.  </li>
            <li>Been using for years and love it.</li>
            <li>We shall see ongoing :)</li>
            <li>I just love the scent of this hand soap.  </li>
            <li>and this is one of my favorite hand soaps.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you will love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the hand soap anyways.</li>
            <li>have very sensitive skin and have had great results with this cleanser.</li>
            <li>JASON&#x27;s Tea Tree Melaleuca Satin Hand Soap is silky smooth, naturally-sourced and the scent is lovely.  </li>
            <li>I honestly bought this at the store years ago specifically because I heard that tea tree oil was the new natural cleanser that was great for any skin type.</li>
            <li>Overall, great product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;How can it clean the skin with an antiseptic without drying it?</li>
            <li>The smell is good and hands are not dry after using it.</li>
            <li>It honestly reminds me of Soft Soaps shea butter body wash.</li>
            <li>Great for if you have ring worm or other rashes.</li>
            <li>but it actually is surprisingly mild and non-drying.</li>
            <li>However, I still use it for my face as tea tree oil has a great natural astrigent property that makes my face feel oil-free while the Olive Oil and Vitamin E keep my face from completely drying out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s rare to find so many natural and beneficial ingrdients in a soap or face wash.</li>
            <li>The description and title needs to be more clear to indicate that this is, in fact, hand soap.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>This does it for you so you not only have cleaner hands, but better skin on your face as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the fact that I am able to order several so that I always have it on hand.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery too!</li>
            <li>Plus the item arrived a day late as I&#x27;ve been noticing more and more with Amazon Prime &amp;#34;2-day&amp;#34; delivery.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if you are looking for a nice, pure &amp; natural cleansing product that lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>This is great hand soap, but I found it too harsh for a facial soap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I learned much and try to share it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It came very well packed on time.</li>
            <li>Very deceptive and misleading .</li>
            <li>This product used to originally say &amp;#34;for hands and face&amp;#34; and they recently changed it to say &#x27;hand soap&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I only need to use one pump on my loofa and that&#x27;s more than enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and all of their products.</li>
            <li>I will have to be more careful next time when I order.</li>
            <li>I worked in cosmetic ingredient sales for several years meaning I sold the ingredients directly to large manufacturers and worked with the scientists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a natural antiseptic and blemish cure yet having to dilute a bottle of it and then apply that mixture to skin isn&#x27;t all that convenient.</li>
            <li>Be careful though, I ended up paying almost exactly the same amount for shipping as I did the product.</li>
            <li>For the price, the size, and how little you have to use, this is well worth the money because it will last a long time.</li>

            <li> Great soap, smells wonderful, cleans without drying. Been using for years and love it. Be careful though, I ended up paying almost exactly the same amount for shipping as I did the product. Too late to correct.</li>
            <li> I got this soap because I wanted something cruelty free but still had a great scent to it. This is definitely a winner. It doesn&#x27;t smell medicinal like you&#x27;d think a tea tree oil soap wood. It honestly reminds me of Soft Soaps shea butter body wash. I only need to use one pump on my loofa and that&#x27;s more than enough to get the job done. For the price, the size, and how little you have to use, this is well worth the money because it will last a long time. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel like there&#x27;s a film on it after washing like some soaps feel. :) Very happy with this soap.</li>
            <li> This is great hand soap, but I found it too harsh for a facial soap. Overall, great product.</li>
            <li> I worked in cosmetic ingredient sales for several years meaning I sold the ingredients directly to large manufacturers and worked with the scientists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I learned much and try to share it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s rare to find so many natural and beneficial ingrdients in a soap or face wash. This is a cleanser for oily skin according to the bottle front but it actually is surprisingly mild and non-drying. But the big bonus for me is the tea tree. This is a natural antiseptic and blemish cure yet having to dilute a bottle of it and then apply that mixture to skin isn&#x27;t all that convenient. This does it for you so you not only have cleaner hands, but better skin on your face as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How can it clean the skin with an antiseptic without drying it? It also contains olive oil, another great skin helper. So between the two you are cleaning, removing bacteria, as well as moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin and have had great results with this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I love this soap and so does ALL of my family! I have 6 kids and they all lie the way it smells and feels.So they actually wash their hands now like they&#x27;re supposed to.</li>
            <li> Like this soap.  It is good for things like feet and underarms.  The tea tree oil helps with preventing athletes foot.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s what I wanted in a cleansing product but I don&#x27;t care for the smell. We shall see ongoing :)</li>
            <li> I just love the scent of this hand soap.  It&#x27;s organic, not tested on animals and with no animal ingredients, which is very important to me.  I like the fact that I am able to order several so that I always have it on hand.  It came very well packed on time.</li>
            <li> I like Jason products. I misread the description, so I gave this to my mom. It&#x27;s hand soap. Lol. Jason is a good product and easy to recommend. I just don&#x27;t like how fake it smells.</li>
            <li> This product used to originally say &amp;#34;for hands and face&amp;#34; and they recently changed it to say &#x27;hand soap&amp;#34;. However, I still use it for my face as tea tree oil has a great natural astrigent property that makes my face feel oil-free while the Olive Oil and Vitamin E keep my face from completely drying out. I honestly bought this at the store years ago specifically because I heard that tea tree oil was the new natural cleanser that was great for any skin type. I&#x27;ve been using this specific product ever since. I have medium to oily skin and I use Jason Ester-C face lotion in conjunction with this product and the combination works wonders for me, plus the face lotion has SPF 30, which is a must-have. I highly recommend this product if you are looking for a nice, pure &amp; natural cleansing product that lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product thinking it was the body soap.  The description and title needs to be more clear to indicate that this is, in fact, hand soap.</li>
            <li> great product and great value!</li>
            <li> JASON&#x27;s Tea Tree Melaleuca Satin Hand Soap is silky smooth, naturally-sourced and the scent is lovely.  I highly recommend it and all of their products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Jason&#x27;s products for over ten years and this is one of my favorite hand soaps. I like it because unlike other hand soaps this doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. It also has comforting ingredients like aloe, lavender and chamomile. For those who care about such things this product doesn&#x27;t contain any petrolatum, sodium lauryl or laureth sulfates. Give this a try I&#x27;m sure you will love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
            <li> The ingredients in this product are totally different than the ingredients listed in the product info. on Amazon. Very deceptive and misleading . Plus the item arrived a day late as I&#x27;ve been noticing more and more with Amazon Prime &amp;#34;2-day&amp;#34; delivery. Oh yea- and the package was split open with no packing slip.</li>
            <li> The description of this product contradicts to what the ingredients contain. It says no Sodium lauryl but that&#x27;s what it contains? Fact check please.</li>
            <li> I thought I was purchasing body wash, but purchased hand soap. I will have to be more careful next time when I order. I love the hand soap anyways. Fast delivery too!</li>
            <li> Great for if you have ring worm or other rashes. Great for bathing with. Kicks butt on arm pit odor! Lol</li>
            <li> I like it very much. But then I like all of the Jason products I&#x27;ve tried. Especially the C Serum.</li>
            <li> The smell is good and hands are not dry after using it. I purchased it for my child and she loves it as well.</li>
