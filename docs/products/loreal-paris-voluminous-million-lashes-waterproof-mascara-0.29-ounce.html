            <li>Very nice mascara</li>
            <li>the best mascara I have ever used! :)</li>
            <li>I love mascara and am always looking for the best one.  </li>
            <li>It gave my lashes a longer appearance which is great, but I was kind of looking for volume.</li>
            <li>It would probably be good for doubling up mascara on though</li>
            <li>works really good.</li>
            <li>This mascara is really good for thickening and length.</li>
            <li>good mascara</li>
            <li>Good for all day wear.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>I purchased this mascara as an inexpensive add-on item after reading some of the good reviews.</li>
            <li>The mascara is good</li>
            <li>They are delighted with the quality.</li>
            <li>This one applies perfect and clean.  </li>
            <li>With all the great reviews I thought that this would be a better mascara.</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely and the color is good</li>
            <li>Having light colored eyelashes I have tried so many mascara brands, this one is the best.  </li>
            <li>Does not smudge, even after many hours-no raccoon eyes!  </li>
            <li>(This has been my favorite, until now!)  </li>
            <li>I love this mascara!</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m loving it..</li>
            <li>,  I liked it,  it lengthen my lashes and did not smudge.  </li>
            <li>Nothing spectacular about it.  </li>
            <li>With just one coat you get a nice even look and</li>
            <li>(it does a nice job with defining lashes).</li>
            <li>This is a nice mascara and goes on well</li>
            <li>nice mascara, no smudge and clumps.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many many many mascaras, and my friend already have one, so i fall in love, i&#x27;m so glad i order it!!!</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!!</li>
            <li>I definitely highly recommend it if you want your lashes looking great without spending an arm and a leg!</li>
            <li>Easy to take off with a good eye makeup remover, I use Mary Kay&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>would use sender again.price is right and make up great.</li>
            <li>great product always exceeds expectations, is not the first time that I buy and I will continue buying.</li>
            <li>This is a great product once my niece got the brush out of it that broke off in it while trying to pull it out for the first time.</li>
            <li>First of all thank you Amazon for a great price.</li>
            <li>Contented wife, mistress happy girlfriend love me very much.</li>
            <li>I also loved the price, very reasonable!</li>
            <li>I would have enjoyed this more if it lasted longer than four hours.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li>i love this make up.</li>
            <li>I truly love this mascara</li>
            <li>I would recommend you apply two coats for the best look, one coat isn&#x27;t enough for this mascara.</li>
            <li>This is simply the best mascara I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I like the product I am satisfied with the shipping time and the treatment I received would buy the seller</li>
            <li>Since I tried L&#x27;Oreal, there is no going back :D</li>
            <li>It is what it says and more.</li>
            <li>Love this mascara..</li>
            <li>I love this mascara, not prone to giving you the &amp;#34;super clump&amp;#34; lashes that I find most waterproofs give me.</li>
            <li>This brush is more of like a bunch of plastic bristles that would be on a comb, whereas the F&amp;S brush is more like bristles that would be on a hairbrush.</li>
            <li>Love how it goes on and doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
            <li>This is a waterproof mascara that stays put most of the day with my oily eye lids.</li>
            <li>Love the brush.</li>
            <li>I love to give gifts to women.</li>
            <li>This mascara has attracted many women.</li>
            <li>one of my fave mascara&#x27;s :)</li>
            <li>I think this if my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>I used Maybelline for many years, but times change</li>
            <li>I was able to get to every lash without a problem and there were no clumps.  </li>
            <li>I was also able to do more than one coat, which is often a problem with waterproof mascara.  </li>
            <li>OMG I&#x27;ve been trying over 50 mascaras, and I can say this one is my favorite in the drugstore line.</li>
            <li>Not that much volume, but great for lengthening.</li>
            <li>This one is much better.  </li>
            <li>I love L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous.  </li>
            <li>I really love this mascara.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this mascara</li>
            <li>Mostly waterpoof--still smudged a bit if I wore it all day and had some tears</li>
            <li>No horrible face swelling either.</li>
            <li>The color will smudge at mid shift under the eyes and it isn&#x27;t perfectly waterproof.</li>
            <li>The Million Lashes is okay</li>
            <li>but I find that the Extra-Volume Collagen Waterproof Mascara gave me much more volume</li>
            <li>and I like the way it applies better.</li>
            <li>It has awesome coverage over your entire lash, no clumps and spreads evenly for that finished look!!!.</li>
            <li>It clumps my lashes together and doesn&#x27;t give me more volume.  </li>
            <li>I just bought this mascara yesterday at Walmart for about 75 cents more.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I stumbled upon this product.</li>
            <li>My eye lashes stayed curled and this mascara gives more volume to them.</li>
            <li>but I love Loreal products still</li>
            <li>It was OK.</li>
            <li>Love this its my favorite mascara ever.</li>
            <li>However, it excellently separates lashes and actually lengthens as well.</li>
            <li>but as I used it more, it did clump a bit.  </li>
            <li>and I still love it.</li>
            <li>Ok</li>
            <li>Love it and will order again.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good substitute for the product they phased out, Lash Out waterproof mascara.  </li>
            <li>decided to try a new mascara and gave this a shot...very happy with it.</li>
            <li>I am very picky about my mascara, and this mascara id fantastic and is a great price.</li>
            <li>It clumps up more than Maybelliene great lash which surprised me.  </li>
            <li>its a great product and i was surprised to find it for so cheap on amazon!</li>
            <li>So I tried it and although the brush is huge, it seems to be OK.  </li>
            <li>I also like the container, and that the top clicks in place, so I know that it is on securely and won&#x27;t leak if I carry it in my purse.</li>
            <li>It lengthens my lashes, has no clumps and makes my lashes very fine, and is bold.</li>
            <li>Million Lashes doesn&#x27;t clump, doesn&#x27;t smear, and cleans off your skin easily if you do make an accidental swipe when you put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It came off to easily in my opinion.</li>
            <li>This mascara is quite easy to apply, but it is not so waterproof and voluminous.</li>
            <li>Great thickening mascara that barely clumps.</li>
            <li>This seems to work fine.  </li>
            <li>some waterproof formulas irritate my contacts but this one is fine.  </li>
            <li>It was shipped fine, no problems.</li>
            <li>No smears, no flakes, comes off easily with my good old reliable Albolene (a fabulous moisturizing face cleanser I&#x27;ve been using for over 30 years).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I see some vendors still selling it but for a HUGE price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well, all I can say is fabulous.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;ve been getting constant compliments on how great my lashes are since I started using it.</li>
            <li>Just bought it to bring my purchase up to a dollar amount that enabled free shipping</li>
            <li>but so far so good.  </li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal Paris proves once again why their cosmetic line rules the runways!</li>
            <li>This mascara wins the award for beating my allergy eyes!</li>
            <li>Definitely is the best mascara I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>I am a local MUA and this by far is the BEST mascara I have ever used on myself or my clients.!!!</li>
            <li>have very sensitive eyes and severe skin allergies, and experienced no negative reactions at all from Million Lashes.  </li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t go on very smoothly and doesn&#x27;t do much to make me have fuller or longer lashes.</li>
            <li>It gives me full lashes that arent clumpy.</li>
            <li>Really wanted this to be more water proof than what it was.</li>
            <li>Its awesome, they last soo much and would not do a messat your make up, if you close your eyes to fast.</li>
            <li>I work in a hospital and it can get warm or humid at times when busy.</li>
            <li>I do like the full brush and the case which is easier to hold than some of the tapered mascara</li>
            <li>loved using regular black/noir Voluminous for over 10 years.  </li>
            <li>CALIDAD Y SUPER ACORDE CON EL TAMAÑO  </li>
            <li>The formula is kind of dry, but easy to apply and won&#x27;t get it all over your eyelids.</li>
            <li>My new favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>I thought this was going to be my new favorite mascara as I heard so many people rave about it (and even compared it to benefits they&#x27;re real mascara), but it really isn&#x27;t anything that special.</li>
            <li>Really love it , gives a very natural look .  </li>
            <li>This mascara had great reviews and was recommended in a few magazines and websites</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pity, too, because the mascara really does a great job with my lashes.</li>
            <li>While I still love my old mascara</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty true to its word about not clumping.</li>
            <li>I developed severe allergies to fragrance this year and had to stop using my favorite mascaras.</li>
            <li>The only thing I liked was that it did not clump my lashes when applied.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very black, separates well, and provides great lift.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty brand loyal when it comes to mascara</li>
            <li>and so must we, right?  </li>
            <li>Had to take my contacts out right away.  </li>
            <li>Just not the right one for me.</li>
            <li>a great product.&lt;br /&gt;However, this particular one isnt worth purchasing again due its bulky shape or the brush/bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was using Bare Minerals mascara and it started out ok</li>
            <li>Voluminous Extra-Volume Collagen Waterproof Mascara in Blackest Black as this one is my absolute favorite!!  </li>
            <li>super sticky and doesnt give much length</li>
            <li>Nope it looks better than the old stuff, but it does not come off much easier</li>
            <li>thank you very much</li>
            <li>My lashes looked like a have alot more than I actually do.  </li>
            <li>really pop!  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>It stays on pretty well even through sweating and all day wear.</li>
            <li>But i wish it was more lasting (hence the 1 star dropped).</li>
            <li>As fr waterproof, most definitely.</li>
            <li>I use a good eye makeup remover, and still have a lot of trouble getting it all off.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t quite live up to my favorite mascara (Rimmel of London&#x27;s Sexy Curves, which is no longer available locally) in terms of drama and boldness, but it does give me nice long, defined, dark lashes that look good for everyday wear.</li>
            <li>Thanks very much</li>
            <li>love mascara that makes my lashes long and plenty of them</li>
            <li>But, it&#x27;s nice and dark and doesn&#x27;t make my eyelashes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased countless tubes, it&#x27;s seriously the best!</li>
            <li>It takes some serious scrubbing and tons of face wash/makeup remover to get this stuff off which is totally a pain at night but excellent throughout the day - not smearing or flaking!</li>
            <li>This mascara can last through the heat and humidity of summer, but it can flake off at the end of the day, and needs a strong makeup remover to take it all off.</li>
            <li>Really adds oomph to my lashes.</li>
            <li>this mascara works very well for me, it doen&#x27;t smear break or fleak, for at leat 10 hrs</li>
            <li>they deliver so fast and the product itself is great.i</li>
            <li>This mascara works very well.</li>
            <li>For the price, i would rececommend this product and it is gentle on eyes.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to this mascara.</li>
            <li>This mascara does not clump and holds very well.</li>
            <li>Never clumpy, but still really grabs your lashes, separates and extends.</li>
            <li>I really like L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s products</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I use a lash curler before applying it, and it really locks in the curl.  </li>
            <li>tried this mascara again on a day when I wasn&#x27;t wearing my contacts and still the mascara flaked so much</li>
            <li>Real the blackest.</li>
            <li>This mascara really lengthens and separated my lashes almost eliminating the need for a lash comb.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that even though the tubes aren&#x27;t the same size, the screw top works.  </li>
            <li>Was excited to try but fell way short.  </li>
            <li>I have blond lashes so a good black mascara is essential.</li>
            <li>it makes your lashes look long and full more than any other mascara I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I had previously purchased the kind with the little round ball applicator, which was good at reaching the tiny lashes but kind of flimsy overall.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the brush much and the mascara is pretty dry right out of the package.  </li>
            <li>I have been hunting for a decent mascara for a while -</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve ordered this mascara twice now and will continue to unless L&#x27;Oreal does another dumb thing and pulls a perfectly good product from its line.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this mascara after reading some of the reviews</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to the high end stuff, but my Lancome mascaras were making my face swell up like a balloon.</li>
            <li>price just too high...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend giving it a try; at this price, why not?</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this mascara.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend, there are other far better brands.</li>
            <li>I have long lashes, so perhaps the large brush doesn&#x27;t bother me as much as it would bother someone with short or fine lashes.</li>
            <li>this is actually my favorite mascara ive tried so far for the reason that its dark, it does offer some volume, and IT DOESNT CLUMP.</li>
            <li>I normally dont get excitef about a make up product, but this stuff works.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try a new product, but it came delivered dry.</li>
            <li>Makes lashes nice and long with minimal clumping!</li>
            <li>I know I have to roll with the times and try something new when circumstances demand it.  </li>
            <li>I had hoped it would lengthen and separate more as described, but, as usual, it was just the way they all are.  </li>
            <li>Actually I never intended on buying waterproof to begin with the first time I purchased this at Rite Aid.</li>
            <li>The applicator takes longer than I am used to and does not seem to make lashes as full as I expected.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump, gives you that long, false eyelash look without the falsies (use two coats for a really stunning look), and cleans off easily at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>normally after curling my lashes and applying a mascara the lashes go back straight</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re Real, but this mascara actually feels exactly the same.</li>
            <li>still prefer the traditional style brush, but I did learn how to deal with the large brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not stiff</li>
            <li>I have Asian lashes (i.e. straight and not very long) but this works really well for me.</li>
            <li>I love the way it goes on and how it looks, but getting it off at the end of the day is just too hard on my eyelids and lashes.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s hard to wipe off on the top of the tube to remove any clummps before applying.  </li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t wow me at all.</li>
            <li>The tube-neck really does keep extra mascara from building up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clumpy and it takes several swipes to get a reasonable amount of colour from it.</li>
            <li>It seperated your lashes well, hold curl all day even for my straight short lashes.</li>
            <li>I have fairly sensitive eyes and</li>
            <li>This mascara \\&quot;dethroned\\&quot; Covergirl Professional</li>
            <li>I tried this in desperation and was very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I would give this mascara a five on looks and performance, but can only give it a 3 because it REALLY irritated my eyes.</li>
            <li>My eyes are so sensitive.</li>
            <li>I buy this frequently</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump my upper lashes at all, but it is a bit much for my wispy lower lashes.</li>
            <li>However, it had a CVS sticker on it when I received it so it could&#x27;ve been an old tube.  </li>
            <li>Makes my lashes long and full, and is definitely waterproof.</li>
            <li>Now that it is spring, and my eyes are constantly watering it&#x27;s lovely to know that I don&#x27;t have mascara running down my face or giving me raccoon eyes by the middle of the day.</li>
            <li>But I used other brands and I must say it did not add length or volume, and after repeated use, like every other day, it makes my lashes fall off, not like one or two, more like 5 or 6 lashes at a time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a really good mascara, it volumizes my lashes instantly with about two coats, and stays put all day long as it&#x27;s waterproof, but it&#x27;s pretty difficult to get off even with an oil-based eye makeup remover</li>
            <li>I generally favor drier mascaras, but this is pretty dry.</li>
            <li>No better than the cheap brands at walmart, it doesn&#x27;t lengthen my lashes and it smears under my eyes, which a waterproof should not do.</li>
            <li>, I live itits the 3rd time I buy it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, after checking different L&#x27;Oreal mascaras and other brands too (some were, in a word, terrible), I decided to give this a try and was glad to find that it does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li>Is definitely no smudge and long wearing, as well as gentle to my eyes.</li>
            <li>The brush is fabulous but the mascara was too thick and blobbed up on my lashes.  </li>
            <li>The only con, which isn&#x27;t really that much of a negative, is that I can&#x27;t wear it several days in a row due to build up on my lashes that will make it more likely to clump up.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the same problem when I switch back to my old mascara, so there must be an ingredient that I am reactive to.  </li>
            <li>The wand is a little bit bendy which worried me at first</li>
            <li>They are average length and straight.</li>
            <li>Of course, it is somewhat harder to get off then what I am used to since I normally used non-water-proof.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After using it again, I realize my true frustration is not have the time to delicately apply mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Very close to Benefit&#x27;s &amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real!&amp;#34; but for much less money.</li>
            <li>Not happy with product smell either, too strong.  </li>
            <li>this is the only mascara i use &amp;&amp; will never change it for any other brand highly recommend A+++</li>
            <li>This mascara really adds volume and even a little length.  </li>

            <li> the best mascara I have ever used! :)</li>
            <li> I love mascara and am always looking for the best one.  </li>
            <li> It gave my lashes a longer appearance which is great, but I was kind of looking for volume.</li>
            <li> It would probably be good for doubling up mascara on though</li>
            <li> works really good.</li>
            <li> This mascara is really good for thickening and length.</li>
            <li> good mascara</li>
            <li> Good for all day wear.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> I purchased this mascara as an inexpensive add-on item after reading some of the good reviews.</li>
            <li> The mascara is good</li>
            <li> They are delighted with the quality.</li>
            <li> This one applies perfect and clean.  </li>
            <li> With all the great reviews I thought that this would be a better mascara.</li>
            <li> It goes on nicely and the color is good</li>
            <li> Having light colored eyelashes I have tried so many mascara brands, this one is the best.  </li>
            <li> Does not smudge, even after many hours-no raccoon eyes!  </li>
            <li> (This has been my favorite, until now!)  </li>
            <li> I love this mascara!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m loving it..</li>
            <li> ,  I liked it,  it lengthen my lashes and did not smudge.  </li>
            <li> Nothing spectacular about it.  </li>
            <li> With just one coat you get a nice even look and</li>
            <li> (it does a nice job with defining lashes).</li>
            <li> This is a nice mascara and goes on well</li>
            <li> nice mascara, no smudge and clumps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many many many mascaras, and my friend already have one, so i fall in love, i&#x27;m so glad i order it!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!!</li>
            <li> I definitely highly recommend it if you want your lashes looking great without spending an arm and a leg!</li>
            <li> Easy to take off with a good eye makeup remover, I use Mary Kay&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> would use sender again.price is right and make up great.</li>
            <li> great product always exceeds expectations, is not the first time that I buy and I will continue buying.</li>
            <li> This is a great product once my niece got the brush out of it that broke off in it while trying to pull it out for the first time.</li>
            <li> First of all thank you Amazon for a great price.</li>
            <li> Contented wife, mistress happy girlfriend love me very much.</li>
            <li> I also loved the price, very reasonable!</li>
            <li> I would have enjoyed this more if it lasted longer than four hours.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li> i love this make up.</li>
            <li> I truly love this mascara</li>
            <li> I would recommend you apply two coats for the best look, one coat isn&#x27;t enough for this mascara.</li>
            <li> This is simply the best mascara I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I like the product I am satisfied with the shipping time and the treatment I received would buy the seller</li>
            <li> Since I tried L&#x27;Oreal, there is no going back :D</li>
            <li> It is what it says and more.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara..</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, not prone to giving you the &amp;#34;super clump&amp;#34; lashes that I find most waterproofs give me.</li>
            <li> This brush is more of like a bunch of plastic bristles that would be on a comb, whereas the F&amp;S brush is more like bristles that would be on a hairbrush.</li>
            <li> Love how it goes on and doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
            <li> This is a waterproof mascara that stays put most of the day with my oily eye lids.</li>
            <li> Love the brush.</li>
            <li> I love to give gifts to women.</li>
            <li> This mascara has attracted many women.</li>
            <li> one of my fave mascara&#x27;s :)</li>
            <li> I think this if my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> I used Maybelline for many years, but times change</li>
            <li> I was able to get to every lash without a problem and there were no clumps.  </li>
            <li> I was also able to do more than one coat, which is often a problem with waterproof mascara.  </li>
            <li> OMG I&#x27;ve been trying over 50 mascaras, and I can say this one is my favorite in the drugstore line.</li>
            <li> Not that much volume, but great for lengthening.</li>
            <li> This one is much better.  </li>
            <li> I love L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous.  </li>
            <li> I really love this mascara.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara</li>
            <li> Mostly waterpoof--still smudged a bit if I wore it all day and had some tears</li>
            <li> No horrible face swelling either.</li>
            <li> The color will smudge at mid shift under the eyes and it isn&#x27;t perfectly waterproof.</li>
            <li> The Million Lashes is okay</li>
            <li> but I find that the Extra-Volume Collagen Waterproof Mascara gave me much more volume</li>
            <li> and I like the way it applies better.</li>
            <li> It has awesome coverage over your entire lash, no clumps and spreads evenly for that finished look!!!.</li>
            <li> It clumps my lashes together and doesn&#x27;t give me more volume.  </li>
            <li> I just bought this mascara yesterday at Walmart for about 75 cents more.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I stumbled upon this product.</li>
            <li> My eye lashes stayed curled and this mascara gives more volume to them.</li>
            <li> but I love Loreal products still</li>
            <li> It was OK.</li>
            <li> Love this its my favorite mascara ever.</li>
            <li> However, it excellently separates lashes and actually lengthens as well.</li>
            <li> but as I used it more, it did clump a bit.  </li>
            <li> and I still love it.</li>
            <li> Ok</li>
            <li> Love it and will order again.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good substitute for the product they phased out, Lash Out waterproof mascara.  </li>
            <li> decided to try a new mascara and gave this a shot...very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I am very picky about my mascara, and this mascara id fantastic and is a great price.</li>
            <li> It clumps up more than Maybelliene great lash which surprised me.  </li>
            <li> its a great product and i was surprised to find it for so cheap on amazon!</li>
            <li> So I tried it and although the brush is huge, it seems to be OK.  </li>
            <li> I also like the container, and that the top clicks in place, so I know that it is on securely and won&#x27;t leak if I carry it in my purse.</li>
            <li> It lengthens my lashes, has no clumps and makes my lashes very fine, and is bold.</li>
            <li> Million Lashes doesn&#x27;t clump, doesn&#x27;t smear, and cleans off your skin easily if you do make an accidental swipe when you put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It came off to easily in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This mascara is quite easy to apply, but it is not so waterproof and voluminous.</li>
            <li> Great thickening mascara that barely clumps.</li>
            <li> This seems to work fine.  </li>
            <li> some waterproof formulas irritate my contacts but this one is fine.  </li>
            <li> It was shipped fine, no problems.</li>
            <li> No smears, no flakes, comes off easily with my good old reliable Albolene (a fabulous moisturizing face cleanser I&#x27;ve been using for over 30 years).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I see some vendors still selling it but for a HUGE price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well, all I can say is fabulous.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;ve been getting constant compliments on how great my lashes are since I started using it.</li>
            <li> Just bought it to bring my purchase up to a dollar amount that enabled free shipping</li>
            <li> but so far so good.  </li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris proves once again why their cosmetic line rules the runways!</li>
            <li> This mascara wins the award for beating my allergy eyes!</li>
            <li> Definitely is the best mascara I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> I am a local MUA and this by far is the BEST mascara I have ever used on myself or my clients.!!!</li>
            <li> have very sensitive eyes and severe skin allergies, and experienced no negative reactions at all from Million Lashes.  </li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t go on very smoothly and doesn&#x27;t do much to make me have fuller or longer lashes.</li>
            <li> It gives me full lashes that arent clumpy.</li>
            <li> Really wanted this to be more water proof than what it was.</li>
            <li> Its awesome, they last soo much and would not do a messat your make up, if you close your eyes to fast.</li>
            <li> I work in a hospital and it can get warm or humid at times when busy.</li>
            <li> I do like the full brush and the case which is easier to hold than some of the tapered mascara</li>
            <li> loved using regular black/noir Voluminous for over 10 years.  </li>
            <li> CALIDAD Y SUPER ACORDE CON EL TAMAÑO  </li>
            <li> The formula is kind of dry, but easy to apply and won&#x27;t get it all over your eyelids.</li>
            <li> My new favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> I thought this was going to be my new favorite mascara as I heard so many people rave about it (and even compared it to benefits they&#x27;re real mascara), but it really isn&#x27;t anything that special.</li>
            <li> Really love it , gives a very natural look .  </li>
            <li> This mascara had great reviews and was recommended in a few magazines and websites</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pity, too, because the mascara really does a great job with my lashes.</li>
            <li> While I still love my old mascara</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty true to its word about not clumping.</li>
            <li> I developed severe allergies to fragrance this year and had to stop using my favorite mascaras.</li>
            <li> The only thing I liked was that it did not clump my lashes when applied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very black, separates well, and provides great lift.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty brand loyal when it comes to mascara</li>
            <li> and so must we, right?  </li>
            <li> Had to take my contacts out right away.  </li>
            <li> Just not the right one for me.</li>
            <li> a great product.&lt;br /&gt;However, this particular one isnt worth purchasing again due its bulky shape or the brush/bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was using Bare Minerals mascara and it started out ok</li>
            <li> Voluminous Extra-Volume Collagen Waterproof Mascara in Blackest Black as this one is my absolute favorite!!  </li>
            <li> super sticky and doesnt give much length</li>
            <li> Nope it looks better than the old stuff, but it does not come off much easier</li>
            <li> thank you very much</li>
            <li> My lashes looked like a have alot more than I actually do.  </li>
            <li> really pop!  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> It stays on pretty well even through sweating and all day wear.</li>
            <li> But i wish it was more lasting (hence the 1 star dropped).</li>
            <li> As fr waterproof, most definitely.</li>
            <li> I use a good eye makeup remover, and still have a lot of trouble getting it all off.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t quite live up to my favorite mascara (Rimmel of London&#x27;s Sexy Curves, which is no longer available locally) in terms of drama and boldness, but it does give me nice long, defined, dark lashes that look good for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> Thanks very much</li>
            <li> love mascara that makes my lashes long and plenty of them</li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;s nice and dark and doesn&#x27;t make my eyelashes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased countless tubes, it&#x27;s seriously the best!</li>
            <li> It takes some serious scrubbing and tons of face wash/makeup remover to get this stuff off which is totally a pain at night but excellent throughout the day - not smearing or flaking!</li>
            <li> This mascara can last through the heat and humidity of summer, but it can flake off at the end of the day, and needs a strong makeup remover to take it all off.</li>
            <li> Really adds oomph to my lashes.</li>
            <li> this mascara works very well for me, it doen&#x27;t smear break or fleak, for at leat 10 hrs</li>
            <li> they deliver so fast and the product itself is great.i</li>
            <li> This mascara works very well.</li>
            <li> For the price, i would rececommend this product and it is gentle on eyes.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to this mascara.</li>
            <li> This mascara does not clump and holds very well.</li>
            <li> Never clumpy, but still really grabs your lashes, separates and extends.</li>
            <li> I really like L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s products</li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I use a lash curler before applying it, and it really locks in the curl.  </li>
            <li> tried this mascara again on a day when I wasn&#x27;t wearing my contacts and still the mascara flaked so much</li>
            <li> Real the blackest.</li>
            <li> This mascara really lengthens and separated my lashes almost eliminating the need for a lash comb.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that even though the tubes aren&#x27;t the same size, the screw top works.  </li>
            <li> Was excited to try but fell way short.  </li>
            <li> I have blond lashes so a good black mascara is essential.</li>
            <li> it makes your lashes look long and full more than any other mascara I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased the kind with the little round ball applicator, which was good at reaching the tiny lashes but kind of flimsy overall.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the brush much and the mascara is pretty dry right out of the package.  </li>
            <li> I have been hunting for a decent mascara for a while -</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve ordered this mascara twice now and will continue to unless L&#x27;Oreal does another dumb thing and pulls a perfectly good product from its line.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this mascara after reading some of the reviews</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to the high end stuff, but my Lancome mascaras were making my face swell up like a balloon.</li>
            <li> price just too high...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend giving it a try; at this price, why not?</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this mascara.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend, there are other far better brands.</li>
            <li> I have long lashes, so perhaps the large brush doesn&#x27;t bother me as much as it would bother someone with short or fine lashes.</li>
            <li> this is actually my favorite mascara ive tried so far for the reason that its dark, it does offer some volume, and IT DOESNT CLUMP.</li>
            <li> I normally dont get excitef about a make up product, but this stuff works.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try a new product, but it came delivered dry.</li>
            <li> Makes lashes nice and long with minimal clumping!</li>
            <li> I know I have to roll with the times and try something new when circumstances demand it.  </li>
            <li> I had hoped it would lengthen and separate more as described, but, as usual, it was just the way they all are.  </li>
            <li> Actually I never intended on buying waterproof to begin with the first time I purchased this at Rite Aid.</li>
            <li> The applicator takes longer than I am used to and does not seem to make lashes as full as I expected.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump, gives you that long, false eyelash look without the falsies (use two coats for a really stunning look), and cleans off easily at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> normally after curling my lashes and applying a mascara the lashes go back straight</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re Real, but this mascara actually feels exactly the same.</li>
            <li> still prefer the traditional style brush, but I did learn how to deal with the large brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not stiff</li>
            <li> I have Asian lashes (i.e. straight and not very long) but this works really well for me.</li>
            <li> I love the way it goes on and how it looks, but getting it off at the end of the day is just too hard on my eyelids and lashes.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to wipe off on the top of the tube to remove any clummps before applying.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t wow me at all.</li>
            <li> The tube-neck really does keep extra mascara from building up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clumpy and it takes several swipes to get a reasonable amount of colour from it.</li>
            <li> It seperated your lashes well, hold curl all day even for my straight short lashes.</li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive eyes and</li>
            <li> This mascara \\&quot;dethroned\\&quot; Covergirl Professional</li>
            <li> I tried this in desperation and was very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I would give this mascara a five on looks and performance, but can only give it a 3 because it REALLY irritated my eyes.</li>
            <li> My eyes are so sensitive.</li>
            <li> I buy this frequently</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump my upper lashes at all, but it is a bit much for my wispy lower lashes.</li>
            <li> However, it had a CVS sticker on it when I received it so it could&#x27;ve been an old tube.  </li>
            <li> Makes my lashes long and full, and is definitely waterproof.</li>
            <li> Now that it is spring, and my eyes are constantly watering it&#x27;s lovely to know that I don&#x27;t have mascara running down my face or giving me raccoon eyes by the middle of the day.</li>
            <li> But I used other brands and I must say it did not add length or volume, and after repeated use, like every other day, it makes my lashes fall off, not like one or two, more like 5 or 6 lashes at a time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a really good mascara, it volumizes my lashes instantly with about two coats, and stays put all day long as it&#x27;s waterproof, but it&#x27;s pretty difficult to get off even with an oil-based eye makeup remover</li>
            <li> I generally favor drier mascaras, but this is pretty dry.</li>
            <li> No better than the cheap brands at walmart, it doesn&#x27;t lengthen my lashes and it smears under my eyes, which a waterproof should not do.</li>
            <li> , I live itits the 3rd time I buy it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, after checking different L&#x27;Oreal mascaras and other brands too (some were, in a word, terrible), I decided to give this a try and was glad to find that it does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li> Is definitely no smudge and long wearing, as well as gentle to my eyes.</li>
            <li> The brush is fabulous but the mascara was too thick and blobbed up on my lashes.  </li>
            <li> The only con, which isn&#x27;t really that much of a negative, is that I can&#x27;t wear it several days in a row due to build up on my lashes that will make it more likely to clump up.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the same problem when I switch back to my old mascara, so there must be an ingredient that I am reactive to.  </li>
            <li> The wand is a little bit bendy which worried me at first</li>
            <li> They are average length and straight.</li>
            <li> Of course, it is somewhat harder to get off then what I am used to since I normally used non-water-proof.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After using it again, I realize my true frustration is not have the time to delicately apply mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Very close to Benefit&#x27;s &amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real!&amp;#34; but for much less money.</li>
            <li> Not happy with product smell either, too strong.  </li>
            <li> this is the only mascara i use &amp;&amp; will never change it for any other brand highly recommend A+++</li>
            <li> This mascara really adds volume and even a little length.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> It last all day long without need for reapplying it and it doesn&#x27;t clump eyelashes during application.</li>
            <li> Gets clumpy but only after you&#x27;ve had it for a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to take off, too much work required and sometimes it doesnt even come out completly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to remove though, which means that it will really stay put.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are still quite long, so I don&#x27;t need a lengthening mascara, just a volumizing one.  </li>
            <li> I have long lashes &amp; this does not clump them up at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use the waterproof one when I know it&#x27;s going to be a long day</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have mentioned, the brush is very big and bulky, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be a problem.</li>
            <li> It does less than nothing to lengthen my lashes and only a meager effort to give them more volume.  </li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT WAS AS DRY AS THE GROUND WHEN I GOT IT.</li>
            <li> Came dry as the desert.</li>
            <li> I recently tried this mascara because my old one, Maybelline Define-A-Lash, has changed the brush to a ridiculous flexible one.  </li>
            <li> All dry!</li>
            <li> I have straight, thin, somewhat long lashes.  </li>
            <li> And my friend who has this has said it is very dry too.</li>
            <li> It avoided clumping but after a while the insert to remove extra mascara came off and was a rather goopy mess.</li>
            <li> The Voluminous brush often left little globs on the end of my lashes that I ended having to pinch off with a tissue.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is it does flake a little bit, but not a lot at all</li>
            <li> Totally waterproof once it&#x27;s dried.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t even smear if gets wet.</li>
            <li> I wonder why women/girls don&#x27;t use this waterproof mascara instead of the one&#x27;s that run when getting wet.</li>
            <li> As expected, you need a eye makeup remover to get remove.</li>
            <li> I have tried and wasted a lot of money on products that simply just don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> and I get my face wet at work, so I thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> I dont consider this waterproof and only wear it at home, so I dont have black down my face.</li>
            <li> product came promptly with other Amazon purchases.</li>
            <li> Just like any other ...</li>
            <li> It gives me the volume other mascaras don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have (minor really) is that it&#x27;s hard to build up a lot for a dramatic look.</li>
            <li> I would compare this as the pharmacy MAC Haute and Naughty Mascara.</li>
            <li> I will try using this again once the weather cools down, as my face is oily.....</li>
            <li> it gives me some volume and a little bit of length, but it&#x27;s not great and definitely not better than my usual go to, maybe lines the colossal waterproof.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, sparse, straight eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> This is a typical mascara.  </li>
            <li> Black splotches on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The one downside is that it does leave some black marks on my lower eyelid after a twelve hour shift, but what mascara doesn&#x27;t?</li>
            <li> The only think I DON&#x27;T like about it is the fact that it is REALLY hard to remove!</li>
            <li> I had not used waterproof mascara in about 30 years, so I thought it would be less harsh than it used to be</li>
            <li> The wrong product was shipped and a representive contacted me and he took care of all concerns and was very, very professional...</li>
            <li> The brush is a little fat to work with.</li>
            <li> A little jury rigged but hey, it works.</li>
            <li> It seemed as if it were dried up...</li>
            <li> and it invariably takes a few lashes off, which I don&#x27;t like at all.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Clumpy and messy.</li>
            <li> Product came to me dried up</li>
            <li> Pros: Doesn&#x27;t transfer to skin once it has dried.</li>
            <li> The one that I received had no mascara in it or it had dried up.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> used this again because it was all I had for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried a few and this works for me.</li>
            <li> I also like that it&#x27;s very black.  </li>
            <li> Once I got used to using the brush applicator, I had very little clumping.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what happened to this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used L&#x27;Oreal for years but usually get Voluminous.  </li>
            <li> I wear glass, not contacts, so I&#x27;m not sure how it would be for contact lens wearers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took forever &amp; washed it off twice, so I stick by the brush being excessively large.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li> I usually wear Benefit</li>
            <li> I used it and had a hard time getting the mascara off after washing my face with soap and water.</li>
            <li> You do need to take it off with an eye make up remover, not just face wash, as it is hard to get off otherwise.</li>
            <li> I use cleansing oil to remove it and don&#x27;t think any water-based cleanser will take it off no matter how hard you rub.</li>
            <li> Because this is so hard to remove, I&#x27;m planning on buying the washable type to wear on an everyday-basis.</li>
            <li> Sucks</li>
            <li> Came in time and makes my eyelashes seperate just the way I like them, although I do have to do a couple coats for them to turn out thick.</li>
            <li> I mean it, my eyes water almost every day until about 11am, regardless of whatever miracle allergy medicine or eye drops</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> But allthough i understand it being waterproof, i dislike that its so tough to wash off.</li>
            <li> Not happy with the wand.</li>
            <li> It performs worse than the mascara I purchased from the dollar store.</li>
            <li> and I think I have lost and broken lashes from wearing it.</li>
            <li> I use this along with my false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I have been stopped and asked if I am using false lashes.</li>
            <li> , I havent had any problems with flaking, but it smears down my face so badly,</li>
            <li> A little disappointed.</li>
            <li> Probably won&#x27;t get a refund which sucks!!</li>
            <li> Using this I dont need to curl my lashes and people comment on how my lashes look fake all the time.  </li>
            <li> people think I have on fake eye lashes.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried a range of expensive and drugstore brands.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> The brush is weird.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are very thin, so when I don&#x27;t have mascara on, they are practically invisible, but with this mascara, I have eyelashes again.</li>
            <li> Reaching the base of the lash with ease is pointless with</li>
            <li> this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;The wand/brush is bulky making it difficult to get close to the base of the eyelash without hitting the eye</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It seemed as if it were dried up...I have purchased this before and it was a quality product. Not sure what happened to this one.</li>
            <li> Really adds oomph to my lashes.</li>
            <li> Initially I had mixed feelings about this, I&#x27;d heard a lot about it, so just decided to try it out. It&#x27;s definitely a really good mascara, it volumizes my lashes instantly with about two coats, and stays put all day long as it&#x27;s waterproof, but it&#x27;s pretty difficult to get off even with an oil-based eye makeup remover and it invariably takes a few lashes off, which I don&#x27;t like at all.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it does clump a bit, and I prefer my (cheaper) Maybelline Great Lash Mascara over this which seems lighter on my eyes.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t wow me at all. It didn&#x27;t last that long. It gave my lashes a longer appearance which is great, but I was kind of looking for volume. The brush is a little fat to work with. I would have enjoyed this more if it lasted longer than four hours.</li>
            <li> Only con: The brush is so tiny</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara.  It stays on in any kind of weather.  No raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li> Makes my eyelashes big!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to take off, too much work required and sometimes it doesnt even come out completly.</li>
            <li> I thought this was going to be my new favorite mascara as I heard so many people rave about it (and even compared it to benefits they&#x27;re real mascara), but it really isn&#x27;t anything that special. it gives me some volume and a little bit of length, but it&#x27;s not great and definitely not better than my usual go to, maybe lines the colossal waterproof. It would probably be good for doubling up mascara on though, maybe I&#x27;ll try that next time.</li>
            <li> this mascara works very well for me, it doen&#x27;t smear break or fleak, for at leat 10 hrs, I live itits the 3rd time I buy it</li>
            <li> I was using Bare Minerals mascara and it started out ok but this, this is great.&lt;br /&gt;I love mascara that makes my lashes long and plenty of them, this does just that. Then if i cry or sleep in it, i don&#x27;t end up looking like a racoon!</li>
            <li> I am always in search of the perfect mascara.  I have straight, thin, somewhat long lashes.  I bought this on impulse, with a coupon. What a find!  I must say, the brush keeps lashes from clumping, but adds volume and definition.  Does not smudge, even after many hours-no raccoon eyes!  I must say, this is the closest to a Chanel mascara, which sells for $30.00 a tube. (This has been my favorite, until now!)  I will definately purchase this product regularly.  I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue or change the formula or brush.  Truely, a great mascara!</li>
            <li> i love this make up. they deliver so fast and the product itself is great.i would use sender again.price is right and make up great.</li>
            <li> This mascara can last through the heat and humidity of summer, but it can flake off at the end of the day, and needs a strong makeup remover to take it all off.</li>
            <li> the only thing that keeps these cows lashes curled.</li>
            <li> I truly love this mascara</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried tons and tons of mascaras at this price point but always come back to this one. I&#x27;ve purchased countless tubes, it&#x27;s seriously the best! I would recommend you apply two coats for the best look, one coat isn&#x27;t enough for this mascara.</li>
            <li> Not good. Clumpy and messy. Was excited to try but fell way short.  Not happy with product smell either, too strong.  :-\</li>
            <li> Loved this! Came in time and makes my eyelashes seperate just the way I like them, although I do have to do a couple coats for them to turn out thick.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but this mascara irritates my eyes.  I have tried several times to use it and my eyes turn red, water and get crusty.  I don&#x27;t have the same problem when I switch back to my old mascara, so there must be an ingredient that I am reactive to.  It&#x27;s a pity, too, because the mascara really does a great job with my lashes.</li>
            <li> Totally waterproof once it&#x27;s dried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used L&#x27;Oreal for years but usually get Voluminous.  Thought I&#x27;d try this one.  The brush is fabulous but the mascara was too thick and blobbed up on my lashes.  As a remedy, I took the brush out and now use it with Voluminous.  It&#x27;s a PERFECT combination.  I was surprised that even though the tubes aren&#x27;t the same size, the screw top works.  The Voluminous brush often left little globs on the end of my lashes that I ended having to pinch off with a tissue.  This one applies perfect and clean.  A little jury rigged but hey, it works.</li>
            <li> This is simply the best mascara I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I like the product I am satisfied with the shipping time and the treatment I received would buy the seller is excellent its very good</li>
            <li> Makes lashes nice and long with minimal clumping!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! It does not clump or make your lashes look spiky. And it does not run or rub off under your eyes! Perfect and also reasonably priced. I am a repeat buyer and so is my daughter.</li>
            <li> Since I tried L&#x27;Oreal, there is no going back :D the best mascara I have ever used! :)</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris proves once again why their cosmetic line rules the runways! Million Lashes doesn&#x27;t clump, doesn&#x27;t smear, and cleans off your skin easily if you do make an accidental swipe when you put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive eyes and severe skin allergies, and experienced no negative reactions at all from Million Lashes.  It doesn&#x27;t clump, gives you that long, false eyelash look without the falsies (use two coats for a really stunning look), and cleans off easily at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try a new product, but it came delivered dry. All dry! And my friend who has this has said it is very dry too. Do not buy!</li>
            <li> I liked it. It avoided clumping but after a while the insert to remove extra mascara came off and was a rather goopy mess.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this mascara after reading some of the reviews but it just doesn&#x27;t deliver.  It does less than nothing to lengthen my lashes and only a meager effort to give them more volume.  I don&#x27;t like the brush much and the mascara is pretty dry right out of the package.  Not my thing.</li>
            <li> Having light colored eyelashes I have tried so many mascara brands, this one is the best.  It gives me full lashes that arent clumpy. Using this I dont need to curl my lashes and people comment on how my lashes look fake all the time.  Get this for great lashes!  It stays on forever, so you will need remover to take it off.</li>
            <li> This mascara works very well. My lashes looked like a have alot more than I actually do.  For the price, i would rececommend this product and it is gentle on eyes.</li>
            <li> Not happy with the wand. The applicator takes longer than I am used to and does not seem to make lashes as full as I expected. I need to go over the lashes time and time again to achieve the coverage I want.</li>
            <li> works really good. doesn&#x27;t even smear if gets wet. love it!!</li>
            <li> It is what it says and more. It last all day long without need for reapplying it and it doesn&#x27;t clump eyelashes during application. I&#x27;m loving it..</li>
            <li> Love this mascara..it does not clump and pulls my eye lashed out.  people think I have on fake eye lashes.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to this mascara. It goes on nicely and the color is good, I havent had any problems with flaking, but it smears down my face so badly, I dont consider this waterproof and only wear it at home, so I dont have black down my face. I will try using this again once the weather cools down, as my face is oily.....but as for now, I will not be re-purchasing this.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, not prone to giving you the &amp;#34;super clump&amp;#34; lashes that I find most waterproofs give me. It&#x27;s truly waterproof, and stays put throughout my day. Now that it is spring, and my eyes are constantly watering it&#x27;s lovely to know that I don&#x27;t have mascara running down my face or giving me raccoon eyes by the middle of the day. The only con, which isn&#x27;t really that much of a negative, is that I can&#x27;t wear it several days in a row due to build up on my lashes that will make it more likely to clump up.</li>
            <li> This mascara is really good for thickening and length.</li>
            <li> This mascara makes my eyelashes look fuller and longer. This mascara is waterproof and will last all day and night. Must use makeup remover to get all the mascara off.</li>
            <li> Great mascara - the brush is great, and the &amp;#34;declumping&amp;#34; neck of the tube works well. I have been hunting for a decent mascara for a while - I do like &amp;#34;Full and Soft&amp;#34; but the brush clumps up after a bunch of uses. This brush is more of like a bunch of plastic bristles that would be on a comb, whereas the F&amp;S brush is more like bristles that would be on a hairbrush. The tube-neck really does keep extra mascara from building up. the waterproof mascara stays all day, and you do need soap to get it off, but it does come off with soap and water.</li>
            <li> I am very picky about my mascara, and this mascara id fantastic and is a great price. Thanks very much</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Love how it goes on and doesn&#x27;t flake. I wonder why women/girls don&#x27;t use this waterproof mascara instead of the one&#x27;s that run when getting wet. This does not smudge either. I love it!</li>
            <li> This is a waterproof mascara that stays put most of the day with my oily eye lids. As expected, you need a eye makeup remover to get remove. It does the job.</li>
            <li> A little disappointed. Does not thicken or lengthen lashes at all.  This big fat container leads one to think of big fat lashes...not.</li>
            <li> Love the brush. Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> very good mascara. Contented wife, mistress happy girlfriend love me very much. I love to give gifts to women. This mascara has attracted many women.</li>
            <li> Really love it , gives a very natural look .  I made a very good purchase.  Happy with my new lashes !!!!!</li>
            <li> one of my fave mascara&#x27;s :)</li>
            <li> Very nice mascara,  I liked it,  it lengthen my lashes and did not smudge.  I  will definitely  purchase the L&#x27;Oreal brand mascara again.</li>
            <li> This is a typical mascara.  I had hoped it would lengthen and separate more as described, but, as usual, it was just the way they all are.  Nothing spectacular about it.  It wears well and doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li> This mascara had great reviews and was recommended in a few magazines and websites so I gave it a try.  It&#x27;s clumpy and it takes several swipes to get a reasonable amount of colour from it.</li>
            <li> super sticky and doesnt give much length</li>
            <li> This mascara does not clump and holds very well. It does not flake under my eyes as well. It is a great inexpensive drugstore mascara. I would definitely recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> Great product, Great seller!rverythinh</li>
            <li> this is actually my favorite mascara ive tried so far for the reason that its dark, it does offer some volume, and IT DOESNT CLUMP. But allthough i understand it being waterproof, i dislike that its so tough to wash off. please create a non-waterproof version!</li>
            <li> I think this if my favorite mascara. Never clumpy, but still really grabs your lashes, separates and extends. Very close to Benefit&#x27;s &amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real!&amp;#34; but for much less money.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> great product always exceeds expectations, is not the first time that I buy and I will continue buying. wonderful, waterproof, does not smudge</li>
            <li> I recently tried this mascara because my old one, Maybelline Define-A-Lash, has changed the brush to a ridiculous flexible one.  I used Maybelline for many years, but times change and so must we, right?  I was caught by the line on the packaging of this mascara that stated that the tube was designed to avoid product buildup on the brush.  That&#x27;s one of my pet peeves.  So I tried it and although the brush is huge, it seems to be OK.  I was able to get to every lash without a problem and there were no clumps.  I was also able to do more than one coat, which is often a problem with waterproof mascara.  And it&#x27;s definitely waterproof.  I also like that it&#x27;s very black.  My eyelashes are still quite long, so I don&#x27;t need a lengthening mascara, just a volumizing one.  This seems to work fine.  While I still love my old mascara the best (so I&#x27;m giving this four stars not five) I know I have to roll with the times and try something new when circumstances demand it.  I&#x27;m pretty brand loyal when it comes to mascara and I&#x27;ve tried a range of expensive and drugstore brands.  I think a $9 mascara works as well as a $30 one.  So save your pennies.  Give this one a try.  I think you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> good mascara...happy with this purchase I would  buy this again.I shop on Amazon for everything and think they are great!</li>
            <li> Really wanted this to be more water proof than what it was. It came off to easily in my opinion.</li>
            <li> OMG I&#x27;ve been trying over 50 mascaras, and I can say this one is my favorite in the drugstore line. It seperated your lashes well, hold curl all day even for my straight short lashes. The formula is kind of dry, but easy to apply and won&#x27;t get it all over your eyelids. Not that much volume, but great for lengthening. Waterproof, no smudge, great mascara.</li>
            <li> Great thickening mascara that barely clumps.</li>
            <li> I love mascara and am always looking for the best one.  I really like L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s products so I decided to purchase this one.  I had previously purchased the kind with the little round ball applicator, which was good at reaching the tiny lashes but kind of flimsy overall.  This one is much better.  With just one coat you get a nice even look and no clumps!  The wand is a little bit bendy which worried me at first but so far so good.  Add a second coat and your eyes really pop!  I have fairly sensitive eyes and some waterproof formulas irritate my contacts but this one is fine.  Doesn&#x27;t run with sweat or tears.  Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Great for the price. No smudges .</li>
            <li> The wrong product was shipped and a representive contacted me and he took care of all concerns and was very, very professional...</li>
            <li> I love L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous.  I have used it for years but I always use the non-water-proof.  I needed to find a water-proof formula for swimming and a funeral I was preparing to go to.  I decided to stick with L&#x27;Oreal and Voluminous despite the reviews complaining about the brush.  I have no problem with the brush or the product.  I really like it.  Of course, it is somewhat harder to get off then what I am used to since I normally used non-water-proof.  I would purchase again.  However, I will continue to use my L&#x27;Oreal-Voluminous Non-water-proof formula for daily use and use the water-proof formula for situations that I feel call for it.  It was shipped fine, no problems.</li>
            <li> EXCELENTE PRODUCTO EXCELENTE CALIDAD Y SUPER ACORDE CON EL TAMAÑO  LOS FELICITO POR PRESENTAR PRODUCTOS DE ESTA CALIDAD JSIUDIUDF IYDFIUYF</li>
            <li> Product came to me dried up and I threw out.</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast shipping! Thank you! A+</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty true to its word about not clumping. It stays on pretty well even through sweating and all day wear. The only complaint I have (minor really) is that it&#x27;s hard to build up a lot for a dramatic look. The plus side of that though is that this is very usable as an everyday mascara.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, sparse, straight eyelashes.  I can&#x27;t believe what this mascara did with my lashes! I use a lash curler before applying it, and it really locks in the curl.  This mascara really adds volume and even a little length.  Once I got used to using the brush applicator, I had very little clumping.  It stays on well throughout the day.  To remove it, I use Neutrogena Hydrating Eye Makeup Remover Lotion.  This mascara \\&quot;dethroned\\&quot; Covergirl Professional All in One waterproof mascara as my favorite!</li>
            <li> The best mascara I&#x27;ve ever bought! Lashes look great no clumps and it stays on til you take it off! And the price is great too!</li>
            <li> The pros: goes on nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons: flakes, a lot!  Had to take my contacts out right away.  Black splotches on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this mascara again on a day when I wasn&#x27;t wearing my contacts and still the mascara flaked so much I had to wash my eyes out.  Just not the right one for me.</li>
            <li> I really love this mascara. It went on evenly for me and without clumps. My lashes are very thin, so when I don&#x27;t have mascara on, they are practically invisible, but with this mascara, I have eyelashes again. I also like the container, and that the top clicks in place, so I know that it is on securely and won&#x27;t leak if I carry it in my purse. I will definitely purchase this again. I also loved the price, very reasonable!</li>
            <li> My hair stylist did hair and makeup for my daughter&#x27;s wedding. She specifically asked us to get this mascara for the big day.</li>
            <li> My new favorite mascara. I have long lashes &amp; this does not clump them up at all. It makes them look longer.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good substitute for the product they phased out, Lash Out waterproof mascara.  Don&#x27;t know why they did that.  It was the best ever. I see some vendors still selling it but for a HUGE price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, after checking different L&#x27;Oreal mascaras and other brands too (some were, in a word, terrible), I decided to give this a try and was glad to find that it does a pretty good job. No smears, no flakes, comes off easily with my good old reliable Albolene (a fabulous moisturizing face cleanser I&#x27;ve been using for over 30 years).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve ordered this mascara twice now and will continue to unless L&#x27;Oreal does another dumb thing and pulls a perfectly good product from its line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, well.</li>
            <li> Product works great. Definitely is the best mascara I&#x27;ve tried so far. Gets clumpy but only after you&#x27;ve had it for a long time.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara this is the only mascara i use &amp;&amp; will never change it for any other brand highly recommend A+++</li>
            <li> This mascara is quite easy to apply, but it is not so waterproof and voluminous. In all, It is ok!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Is definitely no smudge and long wearing, as well as gentle to my eyes.</li>
            <li> I like the color of the mascara and the applicator. I am only giving three stars because the product smears if I apply it to my lower lashes. The product is waterproof and you will need a makeup remover to take it off.</li>
            <li> Mostly waterpoof--still smudged a bit if I wore it all day and had some tears</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing product..!!!</li>
            <li> I developed severe allergies to fragrance this year and had to stop using my favorite mascaras. I&#x27;m used to the high end stuff, but my Lancome mascaras were making my face swell up like a balloon. I tried this in desperation and was very pleasantly surprised. It&#x27;s very black, separates well, and provides great lift. No clumps. No horrible face swelling either. The one downside is that it does leave some black marks on my lower eyelid after a twelve hour shift, but what mascara doesn&#x27;t?</li>
            <li> I would give this mascara a five on looks and performance, but can only give it a 3 because it REALLY irritated my eyes.</li>
            <li> Pros: Doesn&#x27;t transfer to skin once it has dried. Brush is awesome at separating lashes. Good for all day wear.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Doesn&#x27;t volumize or lengthen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many many many mascaras, and my friend already have one, so i fall in love, i&#x27;m so glad i order it!!! Its awesome, they last soo much and would not do a messat your make up, if you close your eyes to fast. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I work in a hospital and it can get warm or humid at times when busy. The color will smudge at mid shift under the eyes and it isn&#x27;t perfectly waterproof. I do like the full brush and the case which is easier to hold than some of the tapered mascara cases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product came promptly with other Amazon purchases. The price was like drugstore price 7-8 dollar range. I&#x27;m still wearing it (it does a nice job with defining lashes). But i wish it was more lasting (hence the 1 star dropped). If they improve the formula, 5 stars then.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT WAS AS DRY AS THE GROUND WHEN I GOT IT. I WILL NEVER BUY THIS TPYE OF PRODUCT AGAIN</li>
            <li> I had purchased this mascara because at the time I could not find L&#x27;Oreal Paris Voluminous Extra-Volume Collagen Waterproof Mascara in Blackest Black as this one is my absolute favorite!!  The Million Lashes is okay and it does last well, but I find that the Extra-Volume Collagen Waterproof Mascara gave me much more volume and I like the way it applies better.</li>
            <li> This is a great product once my niece got the brush out of it that broke off in it while trying to pull it out for the first time.</li>
            <li> I am a local MUA and this by far is the BEST mascara I have ever used on myself or my clients.!!! It has awesome coverage over your entire lash, no clumps and spreads evenly for that finished look!!!. I recommend it to anyone!! its a great product and i was surprised to find it for so cheap on amazon!</li>
            <li> I generally favor drier mascaras, but this is pretty dry. That being said, it does do what a mascara should do - separates, lengthens, and adds some volume. Oh, and colors your lashes of course. I have blond lashes so a good black mascara is essential. As fr waterproof, most definitely. It takes some serious scrubbing and tons of face wash/makeup remover to get this stuff off which is totally a pain at night but excellent throughout the day - not smearing or flaking!</li>
            <li> I use this along with my false eyelashes. Well, all I can say is fabulous. I will buy this again. I recommend the product and its seller.</li>
            <li> This is a nice mascara and goes on well</li>
            <li> It LOOKS great! And it doesn&#x27;t clump at all, which is a very good thing. If you want mascara that doesn&#x27;t look like you applied mascara, you might like this. The only think I DON&#x27;T like about it is the fact that it is REALLY hard to remove! I use a good eye makeup remover, and still have a lot of trouble getting it all off. For that reason I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> It clumps my lashes together and doesn&#x27;t give me more volume.  It performs worse than the mascara I purchased from the dollar store.</li>
            <li> First of all thank you Amazon for a great price. I just bought this mascara yesterday at Walmart for about 75 cents more. Now about the mascara. I have tried and wasted a lot of money on products that simply just don&#x27;t work. Actually I never intended on buying waterproof to begin with the first time I purchased this at Rite Aid. I did not notice it was waterproof.  I used it and had a hard time getting the mascara off after washing my face with soap and water. Then I realized it was waterproof. I am so glad I stumbled upon this product. I am 45 and noticing thinning my lashes. They are average length and straight. I must use an eye lash curler in order to get definition. BUT HERE IS WHERE THIS MASCARA IS AWESOME....normally after curling my lashes and applying a mascara the lashes go back straight and they smudge. But this Loreal mascara is GREAT. My eye lashes stayed curled and this mascara gives more volume to them. I normally dont get excitef about a make up product, but this stuff works. You do need to take it off with an eye make up remover, not just face wash, as it is hard to get off otherwise. So I apply eye make up remover and then I wash my face afterwards to get the oil off and it works great.</li>
            <li> My eyes are so sensitive. I have not had problems with this mascara though. I wear glass, not contacts, so I&#x27;m not sure how it would be for contact lens wearers.</li>
            <li> Not the best...wouldnt buy it again...doesnt lengthen or thicken as it claims..price just too high...but I love Loreal products still</li>
            <li> I buy this frequently</li>
            <li> This mascara wins the award for beating my allergy eyes! I mean it, my eyes water almost every day until about 11am, regardless of whatever miracle allergy medicine or eye drops I try. This mascara outlasts the weepiness as well as my oily lids. Easy to take off with a good eye makeup remover, I use Mary Kay&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mascara as an inexpensive add-on item after reading some of the good reviews. As other reviewers have mentioned, the brush is very big and bulky, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be a problem. I have long lashes, so perhaps the large brush doesn&#x27;t bother me as much as it would bother someone with short or fine lashes. It doesn&#x27;t clump my upper lashes at all, but it is a bit much for my wispy lower lashes. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with flaking or smudging. It doesn&#x27;t quite live up to my favorite mascara (Rimmel of London&#x27;s Sexy Curves, which is no longer available locally) in terms of drama and boldness, but it does give me nice long, defined, dark lashes that look good for everyday wear. I&#x27;d highly recommend giving it a try; at this price, why not?</li>
            <li> I have bought this product before. It was OK. The one that I received had no mascara in it or it had dried up.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy from this shop.</li>
            <li> The only thing I liked was that it did not clump my lashes when applied. But I used other brands and I must say it did not add length or volume, and after repeated use, like every other day, it makes my lashes fall off, not like one or two, more like 5 or 6 lashes at a time. I would not recommend, there are other far better brands.</li>
            <li> With all the great reviews I thought that this would be a better mascara. I was wrong. No better than the cheap brands at walmart, it doesn&#x27;t lengthen my lashes and it smears under my eyes, which a waterproof should not do. I think I will go back to my wash off waterproof from Avon, never should have tried another.</li>
            <li> Love this its my favorite mascara ever. I have short eyelashes but this makes them look great</li>
            <li> I love the way it goes on and how it looks, but getting it off at the end of the day is just too hard on my eyelids and lashes. I had not used waterproof mascara in about 30 years, so I thought it would be less harsh than it used to be and I get my face wet at work, so I thought I would give it a try. Nope it looks better than the old stuff, but it does not come off much easier and I think I have lost and broken lashes from wearing it.</li>
            <li> decided to try a new mascara and gave this a shot...very happy with it. will buy again</li>
            <li> Reaching the base of the lash with ease is pointless with this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;The wand/brush is bulky making it difficult to get close to the base of the eyelash without hitting the eye lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved using regular black/noir Voluminous for over 10 years.  So the mascara itself is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;However, this particular one isnt worth purchasing again due its bulky shape or the brush/bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/12 UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I used this again because it was all I had for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;I still prefer the traditional style brush, but I did learn how to deal with the large brush.&lt;br /&gt;It took forever &amp; washed it off twice, so I stick by the brush being excessively large.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last note:&lt;br /&gt;After using it again, I realize my true frustration is not have the time to delicately apply mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I need to get it done and go.&lt;br /&gt;That is why I think I prefer the traditional brush to this bulky cactus of a wand.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a waterproof mascara and this is, it gets the job done. But it doesn&#x27;t go on very smoothly and doesn&#x27;t do much to make me have fuller or longer lashes. It is just...eh.</li>
            <li> I bought this not knowing it was waterproof until I tried taking it off with foaming cleanser. It would not budge AT ALL. It is also excellent at holding curled eyelashes. It might not give you the oomph some people expect in one swipe. However, it excellently separates lashes and actually lengthens as well. If you want the extra volume, I suggest layering. I have Asian lashes (i.e. straight and not very long) but this works really well for me. I usually wear Benefit They&#x27;re Real, but this mascara actually feels exactly the same. It&#x27;s really great. It&#x27;s hard to remove though, which means that it will really stay put. I use cleansing oil to remove it and don&#x27;t think any water-based cleanser will take it off no matter how hard you rub. Because this is so hard to remove, I&#x27;m planning on buying the washable type to wear on an everyday-basis. I&#x27;ll use the waterproof one when I know it&#x27;s going to be a long day or when I&#x27;m at the beach or pool.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!! I highly recommend this mascara. Thought bout buying it on amazon just to test it out by the reviews, but bought it at walmart instead and i am impressed. It lengthens my lashes, has no clumps and makes my lashes very fine, and is bold. Definitely a must buy.</li>
            <li> nice mascara, no smudge and clumps. i&#x27;ve tried a few and this works for me. i will buy again.</li>
            <li> Real the blackest. This mascara remains all day and it has a great waterproof protection, well done as always L&#x27;Oreal</li>
            <li> The brush is weird.  It&#x27;s not stiff so it&#x27;s hard to wipe off on the top of the tube to remove any clummps before applying.  It clumps up more than Maybelliene great lash which surprised me.  However, it had a CVS sticker on it when I received it so it could&#x27;ve been an old tube.  But, it&#x27;s nice and dark and doesn&#x27;t make my eyelashes \\&quot;uncurl\\&quot; when I put it on.  It&#x27;s definitely waterproof.</li>
            <li> Product was already used and it was opened. The mascara is good but I didn&#x27;t like how I received a damaged product. Probably won&#x27;t get a refund which sucks!!</li>
            <li> Works well.  It didn&#x27;t clump in the beginning but as I used it more, it did clump a bit.  Overall, I like it and will get it again when I run out or within three months.</li>
            <li> arrived in great shape</li>
            <li> Bought to use at my wedding and it&#x27;s awesome. I use it every day now. Makes my lashes long and full, and is definitely waterproof.</li>
            <li> Came dry as the desert. Sucks but it&#x27;s cheap. What did I expect? Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> This mascara is AWESOME. It blows away even much more expensive ones I&#x27;ve tried-- it makes your lashes look long and full more than any other mascara I&#x27;ve used. In fact, I&#x27;ve been getting constant compliments on how great my lashes are since I started using it. The only thing is it does flake a little bit, but not a lot at all and I still love it. I definitely highly recommend it if you want your lashes looking great without spending an arm and a leg!</li>
            <li> it is very good quality. Wife bought gifts for her friends. They are delighted with the quality. thank you very much</li>
            <li> This mascara really lengthens and separated my lashes almost eliminating the need for a lash comb. I just love it!</li>
            <li> ME gusto mucho , yo lo recomendó , compre para una amiga e pude usarlo  deja las con volumen. Ok</li>
            <li> Love it and will order again.</li>
            <li> Just like any other ... Just bought it to bring my purchase up to a dollar amount that enabled free shipping</li>
            <li> YES! I have been stopped and asked if I am using false lashes. It gives me the volume other mascaras don&#x27;t. I would compare this as the pharmacy MAC Haute and Naughty Mascara.</li>
