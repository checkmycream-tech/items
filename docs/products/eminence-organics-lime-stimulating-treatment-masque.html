            <li>I made my purchase today after having tried the sample &amp; getting those truly amazing results after the one use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a mask that delivers this kind of result so immediately.  </li>
            <li>All the great reviews are right!</li>
            <li>This masque give you a good strong tingling feeling that is supposed to bring blood to the surface and stimulate circulation and kill toxins.</li>
            <li>Boy am I glad I kept &amp; tried this one! :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s intense, but incredible.</li>
            <li>Definitely MORE effective w/ water.  </li>
            <li>This seems almost too good to be true.</li>
            <li>My skin is softer, with a more even tone.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>After the third use, my skin did purge, which is excellent to get rid of all the bacteria and excess oil.</li>
            <li>Be sure to hydrate with a serum and follow up with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this masque.  </li>
            <li>I love this mask and it came in well packed.</li>
            <li>If I am even spending the \\&quot;$30\\&quot;; you better believe I&#x27;ve done my research &amp; \\&quot;seen it to believe it\\&quot; for myself.</li>
            <li>I most of the time just throw away.</li>
            <li>Love this masque.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Eminence for years, and I love their products.  </li>
            <li>I love this line.</li>
            <li>Mind you, I also followed the directions they give you (to clean off the product with a warm wash-cloth).</li>
            <li>My product arrived quickly and was nicely packaged.</li>
            <li>Easy to use ..</li>
            <li>My skin can tolerate a lot of strong peels</li>
            <li>This just really seems too good to be true...</li>
            <li>HUGE WORD OF CAUTION,</li>
            <li>I bought this one because it seemed to fit the need of both myself and my partner so we can</li>
            <li>I am not one to write many reviews, but this one is well worth the time.</li>
            <li>This mask makes your face turn red for a bit after use, but the way my skin looks after usage is great.  </li>
            <li>The Eminence products I&#x27;ve used so far have all been good, but this is the one I wouldn&#x27;t be without.  </li>
            <li>It has a very warm feeling to it and your skin is red when you was it off.</li>
            <li>Beautifully clean skin.  </li>
            <li>A true miracle for my skin all in a matter of 15 minutes</li>
            <li>I hopethis review really helps those that are not too sure &amp; don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;d be wasting their money.</li>
            <li>I just splash some cool water on my face after I take it off.</li>
            <li>This was my go to mask for years and stopped using while pregnant.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin pretty smooth too.</li>
            <li>For most of the Eminence line, sample size containers (google is your friend) are available if you want to try something without sinking the full price into a regular size jar.</li>
            <li>I love how my skin is so soft afterwards!</li>
            <li>Love Eminence products, my adult acne is 95% gone because of this line.</li>
            <li>Worth to buy.</li>
            <li>but I woke up the next morning to beautiful skin so don&#x27;t be worried that you get red.</li>
            <li>This one says hot on label and it really is!!</li>
            <li>I am so happy that I found this stuff &amp; all by happening to try out one of those samples for once that I usually throw out.</li>
            <li>but it goes away very fast after you wash your face.</li>
            <li>also mind you while exfoliating it (hence the baby butt soft skin) &amp; diminished the fine lines on my forehead all after one use.</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>This masque is very stimulating!</li>
            <li>Make sure you only use it in the evening when you&#x27;re in for the night!</li>
            <li>but then again, I did have living proof, as evidenced by the results I got after using it for my first time.</li>
            <li>If you want something that works &amp; does exactly what it says it does, then this is the product for you.</li>
            <li>Not as hot as the mud mask, but still very stimulating.</li>
            <li>You may want to dilute it with another Eminence masque if you are easily alarmed by such things.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m back to my normal glowing acne free face!</li>
            <li>Believe me when I say I&#x27;m a product junkie, and have tried pretty much all brands from drugstore to high end.</li>
            <li>in a jar, you wonder to yourself, is this stuff really going to do something?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is absolutely radiant after I use it.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use much.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t wait to get it in the mail!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I really like results.</li>
            <li>Other masque I LOVE is Kale and Citrus.</li>
            <li>And keep a cool damp cloth nearby if you suddenly feel the need to get this off.  </li>
            <li>Skin looks soft and fresh and complexion so clear.</li>
            <li>I highly.</li>
            <li>The reason is that I pursed other kind of masque with the same brand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 45 year old and just got turned on to Eminence brand!!</li>
            <li>I like it much better than the pumpkin enzyme mask and the eight green phyto mask.</li>
            <li>cuz I just can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li>Skins stays pink for awhile but my pores where not noticeable and skin looked smooth and felt so soft.</li>
            <li>It does tingle a bit while it&#x27;s on the skin, but when it comes off the very light burning sensation/tingle starts to dissipate within a hour or two (at least it did for me).</li>
            <li>i think this mast is the best one , at the beginning is very hot and a little painful but it works on my face.</li>
            <li>is RED RED RED for about 45 minutes and then ... smooth, soft skin!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s helped to clear up some acne flare-ups .</li>
            <li>Clear glowing skin.</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>Post baby, my skin completely broke out.</li>
            <li>Recommend it, and I have sensitive skin-</li>
            <li>I just really hope I still get the same results with continuous use &amp; that this isn&#x27;t a product which your skin just starts getting used to after a while &amp; then doesn&#x27;t work as well over that period of time.</li>
            <li>There is whole series on YouTube of different Eminence products that are beneficial when used together!!</li>
            <li>This particular product is like a vacuum cleaner for your pores.  </li>
            <li>All of the reviews are correct and use a little water with products (which I&#x27;m fine with since it makes last longer!).</li>
            <li>So far this is 3rd mask I got</li>
            <li>and I am 1/2 asian and 1/2 polish with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Until you know how it effects your skin, you probably don&#x27;t want to use this right before an outing unless you want folks to wonder you stood a little too close to the microwave.  </li>
            <li>Definitely is hot and your face will feel sunburned and firm for about an hour afterwards....</li>
            <li>/&gt;Wonder no more, this stuff certainly does something!  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> /&gt;Wonder no more, this stuff certainly does something!  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The burning is actually a tingling, due to some of the ingredients, (I think Paprika is one), and the redness goes away in about an hour.</li>
            <li> This product has cleared my small blemishes, made my skin baby butt  soft, balanced my oily skin...</li>
            <li> Just use at night and certainly not before any event or dinner.</li>
            <li> I mask during my evening skin care regimen due to sun sensitivity.</li>
            <li> A bit scary at first</li>
            <li> Wholly cow</li>
            <li> After only one use, it lightened and brightened my dull looking skin and minimized my breakouts.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try other Eminence products!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, when you look at a pricey little bit of glop (gl&amp;ouml;pue?)</li>
            <li> I leave it on for 20 minutes, add a little water and massage into my skin, then rinse.&lt;br /&gt;Skin</li>
            <li> the directions and add a little water.  </li>
            <li> (Very spicy, if you are not fond of the sensation remove with a cold face towel)</li>
            <li> This has put an end to the small blemishes I&#x27;ve been dealing with, and makes a noticeable difference in my complexion.  </li>
            <li> Not sure about the product itself.</li>
            <li> And that one came with a product brochure and a small spoon like tool which were not any where in this one.</li>
            <li> I never buy any facial product over $30, as I am not wealthy &amp; don&#x27;t like to buy expensive products just to try them out.</li>
            <li> I am truly shocked, because I got this as a sample in one of those little plastic, one-time use-</li>
            <li> but now I&#x27;m addicted!</li>
            <li> It is \\&quot;stimulating\\&quot; to the point where I look like I was badly sunburned for an hour or so afterward.  </li>
            <li> , you&#x27;ll look like you have a really bad sunburn.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> And the worst thing is that the bottle isn&#x27;t sealed!</li>

            <li> This masque give you a good strong tingling feeling that is supposed to bring blood to the surface and stimulate circulation and kill toxins. I got this mask after having a facial at a spa recently. They used another stimulating mask similar to this in Eminence. I bought this one because it seemed to fit the need of both myself and my partner so we can share.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s working my skin looks and feels good.  Well once the red sunburnt look fades after about 30 minutes. It&#x27;s helped to clear up some acne flare-ups .</li>
            <li> I lveo this masque. It leaves my face looking very red for about 2 hours afterwards so I only use it at night but my skin feels &amp; looks fab after.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, when you look at a pricey little bit of glop (gl&amp;ouml;pue?) in a jar, you wonder to yourself, is this stuff really going to do something?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonder no more, this stuff certainly does something!  It is \\&quot;stimulating\\&quot; to the point where I look like I was badly sunburned for an hour or so afterward.  When a product claims to increase circulation to your skin, expect your skin to show a lot of color, and to feel hot/warm.  You don&#x27;t take their word for it, you can see increased circulation!  ;)  You may want to dilute it with another Eminence masque if you are easily alarmed by such things.  And keep a cool damp cloth nearby if you suddenly feel the need to get this off.  Until you know how it effects your skin, you probably don&#x27;t want to use this right before an outing unless you want folks to wonder you stood a little too close to the microwave.  Use it the night before, you&#x27;ll still look fab, trust me.  I&#x27;ve used it on the same day and with an hour or so, the redness is gone.  Just know how your skin responds before you try that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The payoff?  Beautifully clean skin.  This has put an end to the small blemishes I&#x27;ve been dealing with, and makes a noticeable difference in my complexion.  My skin is softer, with a more even tone.  I use this about once a week, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.  The Eminence products I&#x27;ve used so far have all been good, but this is the one I wouldn&#x27;t be without.  For most of the Eminence line, sample size containers (google is your friend) are available if you want to try something without sinking the full price into a regular size jar.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.I seen results as soon as I removed it from my face. WOW</li>
            <li> Love this spicy mask!!! Post baby, my skin completely broke out. This was my go to mask for years and stopped using while pregnant. After only one use, it lightened and brightened my dull looking skin and minimized my breakouts. I started using it three times a week, then reduced to twice a week and now once a week. I mask during my evening skin care regimen due to sun sensitivity. Redness does occur while masking and stays for about 3hours or so. It&#x27;s like a workout for your face. My skin looks amazing!! After the third use, my skin did purge, which is excellent to get rid of all the bacteria and excess oil. I&#x27;m back to my normal glowing acne free face! Be sure to hydrate with a serum and follow up with a moisturizer. Highly recommend this product!! (Very spicy, if you are not fond of the sensation remove with a cold face towel)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s intense, but incredible. Do it at night and in the morning your face looks amazing. I highly. Recommend it, and I have sensitive skin- but it might not be good for all.</li>
            <li> Love this product! A bit scary at first but now I&#x27;m addicted! I love how my skin is so soft afterwards!</li>
            <li> Love,love, love! Got turned on to this through a facial. Decided to buy so I could do at home weekly. Definitely is hot and your face will feel sunburned and firm for about an hour afterwards.... But the results are great. Clear glowing skin. Love Eminence products, my adult acne is 95% gone because of this line.</li>
            <li> i think this mast is the best one , at the beginning is very hot and a little painful but it works on my face. So i like it</li>
            <li> Excellent mask ..will buy again and again ..will recommend to my friend. Worth to buy. Easy to use .. Safe to use!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this masque.  I leave it on for 20 minutes, add a little water and massage into my skin, then rinse.&lt;br /&gt;Skin is RED RED RED for about 45 minutes and then ... smooth, soft skin!  Also, evens out skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hooked!  I will use this forever.&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;03-09-14&lt;br /&gt;Advice:&lt;br /&gt;Follow the directions and add a little water.  Definitely MORE effective w/ water.  Works like a charm!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS! All the great reviews are right! After one use, amazing plump, glowing skin. Can&#x27;t wait to try other Eminence products!</li>
            <li> Not as hot as the mud mask, but still very stimulating.</li>
            <li> I mix this with the Red Currant Rapid Infusion Masque per direction from my esthetician. Used it for a year now - great results!</li>
            <li> Quite upset when I received the product. Not sure about the product itself. But I think it was opened and used. The reason is that I pursed other kind of masque with the same brand. And that one came with a product brochure and a small spoon like tool which were not any where in this one. And the worst thing is that the bottle isn&#x27;t sealed! It was opened already. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love this mask and it came in well packed. I like it much better than the pumpkin enzyme mask and the eight green phyto mask. The mask turns you red and you feel the burn but it goes away very fast after you wash your face. My skin can tolerate a lot of strong peels so I keep this for 15 minutes. The effect of the mask last about 2 days I think. I use it 2x a week. Eminence is a great company and I have used many of their products and most of them are good.</li>
            <li> God I wish it&#x27;s cheaper cuz I just can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this product. This masque is very stimulating! My skin is absolutely radiant after I use it. It has a very warm feeling to it and your skin is red when you was it off. Make sure you only use it in the evening when you&#x27;re in for the night! My product arrived quickly and was nicely packaged. You don&#x27;t have to use much. It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I got this as a sample with another purchase I had made on Amazon through it&#x27;s seller~Pretty4Less. This masque is truly simply amazing! I am not one to write many reviews, but this one is well worth the time. This product has cleared my small blemishes, made my skin baby butt  soft, balanced my oily skin... also mind you while exfoliating it (hence the baby butt soft skin) &amp; diminished the fine lines on my forehead all after one use. This seems almost too good to be true. I never buy any facial product over $30, as I am not wealthy &amp; don&#x27;t like to buy expensive products just to try them out. If I am even spending the \\&quot;$30\\&quot;; you better believe I&#x27;ve done my research &amp; \\&quot;seen it to believe it\\&quot; for myself. I am truly shocked, because I got this as a sample in one of those little plastic, one-time use- trial size packages; which I most of the time just throw away. Boy am I glad I kept &amp; tried this one! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I made my purchase today after having tried the sample &amp; getting those truly amazing results after the one use. Mind you, I also followed the directions they give you (to clean off the product with a warm wash-cloth). It does tingle a bit while it&#x27;s on the skin, but when it comes off the very light burning sensation/tingle starts to dissipate within a hour or two (at least it did for me). I am so happy that I found this stuff &amp; all by happening to try out one of those samples for once that I usually throw out. Lol. I really can&#x27;t wait to get it in the mail!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  A true miracle for my skin all in a matter of 15 minutes (the time I kept it on my skin). I just really hope I still get the same results with continuous use &amp; that this isn&#x27;t a product which your skin just starts getting used to after a while &amp; then doesn&#x27;t work as well over that period of time. This just really seems too good to be true...but then again, I did have living proof, as evidenced by the results I got after using it for my first time. Only time &amp; continuous use will tell. I hopethis review really helps those that are not too sure &amp; don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;d be wasting their money. If you want something that works &amp; does exactly what it says it does, then this is the product for you. Rest assured... I am more than happy with the results!</li>
            <li> Love this masque. Skins stays pink for awhile but my pores where not noticeable and skin looked smooth and felt so soft.</li>
            <li> Works like it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Eminence for years, and I love their products.  Believe me when I say I&#x27;m a product junkie, and have tried pretty much all brands from drugstore to high end. I only use Eminence now. This particular product is like a vacuum cleaner for your pores.  You&#x27;ll see how cleaned out your pores are after using it. Also, reduces any surface bumps starting to creep up. I don&#x27;t suggest using this if you are having a severe breakout. Leaves your skin pretty smooth too. HUGE WORD OF CAUTION, so you don&#x27;t get scared. Leave this mask on for no longer than 10 minutes. While it&#x27;s on, your face will feel like it&#x27;s BURNING. it will get so red, you&#x27;ll look like you have a really bad sunburn. Fear not!! The burning is actually a tingling, due to some of the ingredients, (I think Paprika is one), and the redness goes away in about an hour. If you use before an event, give yourself ample time for the redness to go away. I just splash some cool water on my face after I take it off. I love this mask!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 45 year old and just got turned on to Eminence brand!! Wholly cow I love this line. So far this is 3rd mask I got and I really like results. Skin looks soft and fresh and complexion so clear. All of the reviews are correct and use a little water with products (which I&#x27;m fine with since it makes last longer!). This one says hot on label and it really is!! My face was sooooooo red afterwards but I woke up the next morning to beautiful skin so don&#x27;t be worried that you get red. Just use at night and certainly not before any event or dinner. Unless you have 2-3 hours before you go. Other masque I LOVE is Kale and Citrus. Wonderful!! Plus you can use together. There is whole series on YouTube of different Eminence products that are beneficial when used together!! Happy beauty night ladies 😃</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a mask that delivers this kind of result so immediately.  I&#x27;m 43 and I am 1/2 asian and 1/2 polish with sensitive skin.  This mask makes your face turn red for a bit after use, but the way my skin looks after usage is great.  I look as if I have sun kissed look.  This will be a staple in my regimen.</li>
