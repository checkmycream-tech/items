            <li>It&#x27;s great!  </li>
            <li>great suggestion!!</li>
            <li>This one is awesome!  </li>
            <li>It works beautifully!</li>
            <li>Excellent!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absorbs so perfectly and won&#x27;t make your face oily and shiny.</li>
            <li>and it is very, very good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I&#x27;m happy with it though</li>
            <li>I go through&amp;#34;tubs&amp;#34; of sunblock in a years time so that is a great plus.</li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>Great protection for problem skin.</li>
            <li>While both products are great and do not make me break out the Zinc</li>
            <li>Great sunblock for working out -- I swim, bike, and run in it and never get burned.  </li>
            <li>It is great.  </li>
            <li>My dermatologist says good job at finding a great sunscreen.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go.  </li>
            <li>I am a Retin-a user, so need a good sunscreen for my face.</li>
            <li>Doing some research, I found that zinc oxide gives the best sun protection of all available sunscreen ingredients.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite fair skinned so even with an spf 55 chemical sunscreens</li>
            <li>I buy the one with a tint since I am so fair skinned.</li>
            <li>the best sunscreen - worth the price.</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>I love the texture of this sunscreen!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li>The COTZ doesn&#x27;t do that - it doesn&#x27;t sting and it goes on nicely and remains where I put it.</li>
            <li>It blends in nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave any whitish cast.</li>
            <li>Way too greasy for warm weather.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist gave me a sample of this and it was so nice that I ordered a tube.  </li>
            <li>It seems to play nicely with my makeup.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this - their lip balm and the tinted face sunscreen are also without question the BEST I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>and this is by far one of the best sunscreens I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Wish Spf was higher, but a great product.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s mineral-based.  </li>
            <li>all I could think about was how many chemicals must have been in that product.  </li>
            <li>I had to find something better.</li>
            <li>It does seem more suited for drier skin as it&#x27;s a bit heavy/greasy, but I find that dusting some translucent powder on top takes care of that.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this product and will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Ultra sunblock for years, which I also love.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>Same thing, a great product!</li>
            <li>Be sure when ordering if you want the tinted sunblock not to order this one.  </li>
            <li>Love how this goes on.</li>
            <li>Something that is sheer, not oily and absorbs perfectly, otherwise the humidity will sweat it out.</li>
            <li>I use a bit more soap and wash twice.  </li>
            <li>Very reliable, easy to rub in, and provides great protection.</li>
            <li>This contains 20% zinc oxide which is adequate for effective</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>but it feels fine to me after about five minutes.</li>
            <li>Cotz acts almost like a face make-up over which I can add a light face powder</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>Not greasy, not heavy but works good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had really good luck with both the Face Cotz and the Cotz Sensitive.  </li>
            <li>The tinted face rubs in even easier than my regular face lotion, it&#x27;s AMAZING!</li>
            <li>I probably wouldn&#x27;t wear it as an every day sunscreen because it isn&#x27;t super light, but I don&#x27;t notice it when I&#x27;m working out</li>
            <li>First, it actually works (I&#x27;ve bought many that were EWG approved and we&#x27;ve been burned while wearing them - we are fair skinned.)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying a lot of sunscreens lately, and this is one of the best.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t break me out and only has zinc - which is good for your skin.</li>
            <li>It is chemical free, feels as great as Ulta, and is actually less pricey than Ulta.</li>
            <li>Great product, i really like the texture -it does not appear white once applied to skin.</li>
            <li>This particular sunscreen is my favorite of the varieties I have used.</li>
            <li>It has a slight oily texture, but that&#x27;s the great thing about it</li>
            <li>I rarely leave home without, summer, spring, winter or fall</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film which means I can put my makeup right over it</li>
            <li>Excellent product, especially for very sensitive facial skin.  </li>
            <li>Nice protection for winter when skin feels dry.</li>
            <li>Smooth, soft, covers well -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit greasy at first</li>
            <li>only Cotz &#x27;feels better&#x27; on my skin.</li>
            <li>I have also noticed that the Zinc reduces the redness and flushing my face experiences when I get hot or overheat.</li>
            <li>It also lasts really well on the skin unlike the chemical sunscreens which stop working once they have absorbed their maximum level of UV and UVB rays.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m allergic to most sunscreens but this one is different</li>
            <li>I prefer the texture of the blue labeled face cotz because of its matte finish, but this is okay, too.</li>
            <li>This is one of the only sunscreens that I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve tried many) that doesn&#x27;t make me break out in a rash when out in the sun.</li>
            <li>Basically, a sunscreen should provide coverage of both the UVA (wavelengths that age and deeply damage the skin) and UVB ( cause tanning and more superficial damage) spectrum.  </li>
            <li>The formula is rich and would be better for those with normal to dry skin.  </li>
            <li>This does not leave a white film, easy to apply, and competly protects face from sunburn.</li>
            <li>I love the Cotz natural skin tone sunscreen but the tint was to dark for my light skin.</li>
            <li>I have Lupus and it really helps with the rays</li>
            <li>Thanks, Dermatologist:</li>
            <li>Having just had a blue light treatment for skin cancer</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m living in Miami, Florida and the sun along with the humidity demands very selective sunscreen.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much better than any other product</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes like many other sunscreens</li>
            <li>and it does the job better than any other sunblock I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Third, it does not dry so fast that you can&#x27;t apply more than 3 square inches at a time.</li>
            <li>I used a much more expensive sunscreen from a dermatologist but this is very affordable and has much more zinc in it and therefore keeps my MELASMA at a minimum.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, sinks into my skin, is not greasy but is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and matte, and since it has only mineral sunscreen ingredients, not chemicals, it is effective without irritating the skin.</li>
            <li>I live in Seattle and wear sunscreen every day, rain or shine.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Works good, however it is very heavy, rich, thick sunscreen.</li>
            <li>However, if it doesn&#x27;t look whitish when you first put it on you aren&#x27;t getting enough.  </li>
            <li>carry zinc sunscreen products as well, but they are low content (just a few percent of the total content) and not as good.</li>
            <li>It does blend well with no white cast, but it was really greasy on my combination sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I use this religiously every day, no matter where I&#x27;m going to be or how much sun is shining.  </li>
            <li>I picked the Cotz sensitive and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>My husband said I was ready for Kabuki Theatre-turned my face white!</li>
            <li>and it seems to work well as far as I can tell</li>
            <li>My facial skin is very tempermental.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something without a bunch of chemicals in it and found Cotz Sensitive.</li>
            <li>I like this product, because it does not cause problems for my sensitive skin and seems to do its job.  </li>
            <li>I have been on a quest for years to find something that will not burn or sting when applied to my son&#x27;s face - all the products that say they are for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I hesitated due to the expense but determined it was worth the trial.</li>
            <li>leave a white cast, has a strong chemically smell, and a bit greasy after a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no irritation from its ingredients and really does protect for a long time before having to reapply.</li>
            <li>I would still get a little pink after an hour or more in the Florida sun.  </li>
            <li>I live in Arizona, sun protection is critical.</li>
            <li>Has a slight &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; cast when applied but quickly is absorbed.</li>
            <li>Overall, I really like this, especially for use in winter.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easily, is not greasy, doesn&#x27;t show its white zinc (20% of the content) at all, and makes me feel comfortable when I&#x27;m out in the sun that I won&#x27;t burn -- and I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>i spent a week in aruba and it really protected my skin.  </li>
            <li>I feel very protected using the Cotz and have not noticed any dark spots forming.</li>
            <li>The Sensitive will make your skin initially look white which can lead to not putting enough on initially so it doesn&#x27;t look white.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is good for small areas, like the back of your hands, due to the fact that it&#x27;s pretty greasy and might be uncomfortable on your face.  </li>
            <li>The major difference between the two is that Face Cotz has Zinc and Titanium Dioxide as the active ingredients and Cotz Sensitive only has Zinc.</li>

            <li> I like this product, because it does not cause problems for my sensitive skin and seems to do its job.  </li>
            <li> I have been on a quest for years to find something that will not burn or sting when applied to my son&#x27;s face - all the products that say they are for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I hesitated due to the expense but determined it was worth the trial.</li>
            <li> leave a white cast, has a strong chemically smell, and a bit greasy after a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no irritation from its ingredients and really does protect for a long time before having to reapply.</li>
            <li> I would still get a little pink after an hour or more in the Florida sun.  </li>
            <li> I live in Arizona, sun protection is critical.</li>
            <li> Has a slight &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; cast when applied but quickly is absorbed.</li>
            <li> Overall, I really like this, especially for use in winter.  </li>
            <li> It goes on easily, is not greasy, doesn&#x27;t show its white zinc (20% of the content) at all, and makes me feel comfortable when I&#x27;m out in the sun that I won&#x27;t burn -- and I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> i spent a week in aruba and it really protected my skin.  </li>
            <li> I feel very protected using the Cotz and have not noticed any dark spots forming.</li>
            <li> The Sensitive will make your skin initially look white which can lead to not putting enough on initially so it doesn&#x27;t look white.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is good for small areas, like the back of your hands, due to the fact that it&#x27;s pretty greasy and might be uncomfortable on your face.  </li>
            <li> The major difference between the two is that Face Cotz has Zinc and Titanium Dioxide as the active ingredients and Cotz Sensitive only has Zinc.</li>
            <li> My skin feels nice and smooth, and I don&#x27;t have any of that horrible eye stinging that other products produce.  </li>
            <li> When I put it on, had to rub in for long time and let it absorb before I could apply makeup.</li>
            <li> My skin leans a bit dry these days and this is a bit on the heavy side for summer, but I&#x27;ve used it on days where my skin is feeling a bit sensitive and therefore I don&#x27;t want to use one of my sunscreens that has chemical uv filters, fragrance, or alcohol.</li>
            <li> There are very few products it will tolerate including the ones formulated for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> it left my skin feeling dry and tight underneath a veil of grease.  </li>
            <li> The tint is not noticeable on my skin (perhaps I blindly chose the right one?) and does not rub off on clothing.  </li>
            <li> I usually only have to re-apply if I&#x27;ve been in the pool or sweated excessively, even in the Florida sun.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s greasy and uncomfortable to wear on a hot summer day.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t sting like other sunscreens can.</li>
            <li> Does not irritate my skin as other sunscreens do.</li>
            <li> so I am very careful to read the ingredients before I purchase.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s sister product that has an spf protection of 50 something and a slight tint.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a vanishing formula, which typically means nanoparticles of zinc oxide.  </li>
            <li> I use this everyday on my face under my makeup and have been doing so for about a year.  </li>
            <li> I have used Cotz products for approximately 5 years and can&#x27;t speak highly enough about them!</li>
            <li> It would be heavy and greasy for oily skin.  </li>
            <li> It may be too heavy for summer.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin and struggled with adult acne prior to using this sunscreen as a base coat.</li>
            <li> I use on my neck also, wish it was larger and not as expensive</li>
            <li> My acne cleared within that 3-month period and my face continues to stay clear as long as I use this as my base coat.</li>
            <li> I am very pale and I always use a sunscreen on my face.</li>
            <li> Been using Jansen thick, gooey zinc oxide for the past 2 years - dries my face out.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit hard to remove form your hands after applying fut</li>
            <li> I am a sunscreen fanatic.</li>
            <li> I use it as a base coat year round and wait a few minutes before applying powder foundation.</li>
            <li> The Titanium is very slightly irritating (although since Face Cotz is tinted I use it as a foundation when needed).  </li>
            <li> There are a lot of poorly formulated sunscreens out there</li>
            <li> so used someone&#x27;s Neutrogena product out of desperation;  it got in my eyes and stung them so bad</li>
            <li> a star or two if it does cause, depending on how bad the results are!!!!!!!!!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Wish Spf was higher, but a great product.  I have Lupus and it really helps with the rays</li>
            <li> Smooth, soft, covers well - my face loves it.  Been using Jansen thick, gooey zinc oxide for the past 2 years - dries my face out.  Cotz acts almost like a face make-up over which I can add a light face powder and I&#x27;m good to go.  My face has improved in the past couple of weeks - even wearing it at higher altitude.  I&#x27;m tempted to try the color tone.... might just do that and mix these two as another reviewed suggested and I won&#x27;t then leave the house without my sunscreen again.  I ride horses so I&#x27;m out in the sun all the time.  It&#x27;s great!  And I&amp;#34;ve tried a lot of different sunscreens.  :)</li>
            <li> Initial Review:  4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast, has a strong chemically smell, and a bit greasy after a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m happy with it though and it&#x27;s much better than any other product available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I have yet to see if it will cause breakouts, so I will be back to report and drop it a star or two if it does cause, depending on how bad the results are!!!!!!!!!  Or I&#x27;ll up it a star if it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;1 week later:&lt;br /&gt;Dropping it  2 stars because it did cause a breakout, and mid-day it left my skin feeling dry and tight underneath a veil of grease.  It looks like this will NOT be my daily sunblock.  The search continues...</li>
            <li> I use this stuff multiple times a day to protect myself. My dermatologist says good job at finding a great sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I love the Cotz natural skin tone sunscreen but the tint was to dark for my light skin. I got this because all the zinc oxide. It does blend well with no white cast, but it was really greasy on my combination sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I use this religiously every day, no matter where I&#x27;m going to be or how much sun is shining.  I love that it&#x27;s mineral-based.  I was out on a boat recently and left it at home so used someone&#x27;s Neutrogena product out of desperation;  it got in my eyes and stung them so bad all I could think about was how many chemicals must have been in that product.  The COTZ doesn&#x27;t do that - it doesn&#x27;t sting and it goes on nicely and remains where I put it.</li>
            <li> I am a Retin-a user, so need a good sunscreen for my face. I had been using Neutrogena spf 70 diligently, yet noticed hyperpigmentation spots forming on my cheeks. I had to find something better. Doing some research, I found that zinc oxide gives the best sun protection of all available sunscreen ingredients. I picked the Cotz sensitive and couldn&#x27;t be happier. It has a whopping 20% zinc oxide and that&#x27;s it (in terms of actives)!! There is no fragrance and it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes like many other sunscreens tend to do. It blends in nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave any whitish cast. It does seem more suited for drier skin as it&#x27;s a bit heavy/greasy, but I find that dusting some translucent powder on top takes care of that. I also need to use a cleansing oil at night to take this off as it is tenacious. I feel very protected using the Cotz and have not noticed any dark spots forming. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this product and will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this! I live in Arizona, sun protection is critical. I&#x27;ve been using Ultra sunblock for years, which I also love. I happened to try this on the recommendation of a plastic surgeon friend. It is chemical free, feels as great as Ulta, and is actually less pricey than Ulta. I go through&amp;#34;tubs&amp;#34; of sunblock in a years time so that is a great plus.</li>
            <li> I tried this product in one of marathon event expo. It works great. Not greasy, not heavy but works good.</li>
            <li> Works good, however it is very heavy, rich, thick sunscreen. When I put it on, had to rub in for long time and let it absorb before I could apply makeup. My husband said I was ready for Kabuki Theatre-turned my face white!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist, who said I used up my lifetime quota of sun about 3 decades ago, recommended this and it is very, very good. It goes on easily, is not greasy, doesn&#x27;t show its white zinc (20% of the content) at all, and makes me feel comfortable when I&#x27;m out in the sun that I won&#x27;t burn -- and I don&#x27;t. Walgreens, CVS, etc. carry zinc sunscreen products as well, but they are low content (just a few percent of the total content) and not as good. And -- it is not that much more expensive than what you find in the store from Sea &#x27;n Ski or Coppertone. Thanks, Dermatologist: great suggestion!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying a lot of sunscreens lately, and this is one of the best. It&#x27;s a bit greasy at first but it feels fine to me after about five minutes. My skin leans a bit dry these days and this is a bit on the heavy side for summer, but I&#x27;ve used it on days where my skin is feeling a bit sensitive and therefore I don&#x27;t want to use one of my sunscreens that has chemical uv filters, fragrance, or alcohol. It stays on well during exercise.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t break me out and only has zinc - which is good for your skin. winner winner winner.</li>
            <li> Great product, i really like the texture -it does not appear white once applied to skin. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> the best sunscreen - worth the price. i spent a week in aruba and it really protected my skin.  i would definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this product for skin cancer and it seems to work well as far as I can tell</li>
            <li> Great protection for problem skin. There&#x27;s no irritation from its ingredients and really does protect for a long time before having to reapply.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, especially for very sensitive facial skin.  Not oily, Protects well and doesn&#x27;t irritate.  Has a slight &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; cast when applied but quickly is absorbed.</li>
            <li> My facial skin is very tempermental. There are very few products it will tolerate including the ones formulated for sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve lost track of how may sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried and they all either made me itch, they made my skin feel like it was burning or they made me break out.  I&#x27;ve had really good luck with both the Face Cotz and the Cotz Sensitive.  The major difference between the two is that Face Cotz has Zinc and Titanium Dioxide as the active ingredients and Cotz Sensitive only has Zinc. While both products are great and do not make me break out the Zinc only Cotz &#x27;feels better&#x27; on my skin. The Titanium is very slightly irritating (although since Face Cotz is tinted I use it as a foundation when needed).  The Sensitive will make your skin initially look white which can lead to not putting enough on initially so it doesn&#x27;t look white. However, if it doesn&#x27;t look whitish when you first put it on you aren&#x27;t getting enough.  Be patient, the whitish look disappears after a few minutes and if there are still whitish patches just gently rub in or blot excess. I have also noticed that the Zinc reduces the redness and flushing my face experiences when I get hot or overheat. I no longer look like a tomato on vacation. It also lasts really well on the skin unlike the chemical sunscreens which stop working once they have absorbed their maximum level of UV and UVB rays. I usually only have to re-apply if I&#x27;ve been in the pool or sweated excessively, even in the Florida sun.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is good for small areas, like the back of your hands, due to the fact that it&#x27;s pretty greasy and might be uncomfortable on your face.  I put it on my arms and it felt sticky.  However, it does seem to work well.</li>
            <li> I love the texture of this sunscreen! It doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen either. It goes on smooth and matte, and since it has only mineral sunscreen ingredients, not chemicals, it is effective without irritating the skin.</li>
            <li> It is the only one I have found that does not cause me to break out in a rash. I even started using it on my face - and no breakouts. Furthermore, I have noticed an improvement in my rosacea since I started using it. I would highly recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of physical sunscreens in an effort to minimize the chemicals myself and my family put on our skin.  This one is awesome!  First, it actually works (I&#x27;ve bought many that were EWG approved and we&#x27;ve been burned while wearing them - we are fair skinned.)  Second, you can rub the lotion in and not look ghost like.  Third, it does not dry so fast that you can&#x27;t apply more than 3 square inches at a time.</li>
            <li> Package came on time as always from Amazon. Having just had a blue light treatment for skin cancer I needed something that would not sting my face. This product did the trick!</li>
            <li> Sunscreen feels cloying on skin.  It&#x27;s greasy and uncomfortable to wear on a hot summer day.  Will not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I am a skin care junkie. I live in Seattle and wear sunscreen every day, rain or shine. I was looking for something without a bunch of chemicals in it and found Cotz Sensitive. I love it. It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film which means I can put my makeup right over it and I&#x27;m not all shiny. There&#x27;s no noticeable smell and it doesn&#x27;t sting when you put it on.</li>
            <li> This does not leave a white film, easy to apply, and competly protects face from sunburn. I use on my neck also, wish it was larger and not as expensive or I would use it for my entire body.....I have face sensitivity and this causes no problems....Love it...</li>
            <li> Great sunblock for working out -- I swim, bike, and run in it and never get burned.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t wear it as an every day sunscreen because it isn&#x27;t super light, but I don&#x27;t notice it when I&#x27;m working out and it does the job better than any other sunblock I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;m quite fair skinned so even with an spf 55 chemical sunscreens I would still get a little pink after an hour or more in the Florida sun.  With this sunblock?  nothing!</li>
            <li> Nice protection for winter when skin feels dry. Way too greasy for warm weather. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for humid areas or oily/combination skin.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this. In use it every day under my foundation. Sometimes I just use compact powder over it. It works well. And I dot have age spots!</li>
            <li> I use this everyday on my face under my makeup and have been doing so for about a year.  I used a much more expensive sunscreen from a dermatologist but this is very affordable and has much more zinc in it and therefore keeps my MELASMA at a minimum.  I love it!  Goes on smooth, sinks into my skin, is not greasy but is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Works well but still leaves a bit of a white residue on my face. Doesn&#x27;t sting like other sunscreens can.</li>
            <li> I am a sunscreen fanatic. I rarely leave home without, summer, spring, winter or fall and this is by far one of the best sunscreens I&#x27;ve used. Very reliable, easy to rub in, and provides great protection. I highly recommend this - their lip balm and the tinted face sunscreen are also without question the BEST I&#x27;ve ever used.  The tinted face rubs in even easier than my regular face lotion, it&#x27;s AMAZING! I&#x27;ve used this at the equator and not even a tinge of a sunburn (I did reapply as recommended)</li>
            <li> My dermatologist gave me a sample of this and it was so nice that I ordered a tube.  I can&#x27;t wear sunscreen without irritation or outright rashes.  This one does not irritate my skin at all.  My skin feels nice and smooth, and I don&#x27;t have any of that horrible eye stinging that other products produce.  The tint is not noticeable on my skin (perhaps I blindly chose the right one?) and does not rub off on clothing.  I used it in the tropics and it performed well.</li>
            <li> I have used Cotz products for approximately 5 years and can&#x27;t speak highly enough about them! This particular sunscreen is my favorite of the varieties I have used. I use it as a base coat year round and wait a few minutes before applying powder foundation. It works beautifully! Not only does it protect my face from burning, but it has helped my complexion. I have extremely oily skin and struggled with adult acne prior to using this sunscreen as a base coat. I decided I would give it a 3-month trial to see what would happen. I hesitated due to the expense but determined it was worth the trial. I&#x27;m so glad I did! My acne cleared within that 3-month period and my face continues to stay clear as long as I use this as my base coat. I am a customer for life!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to most sunscreens but this one is different and I don&#x27;t break out in a rash when I use it in the sun.</li>
            <li> I like this product, because it does not cause problems for my sensitive skin and seems to do its job.  I prefer the texture of the blue labeled face cotz because of its matte finish, but this is okay, too.</li>
            <li> Excellent!  I have been on a quest for years to find something that will not burn or sting when applied to my son&#x27;s face - all the products that say they are for sensitive skin. None have worked for my son, but this one does!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff does it&#x27;s job well!  Not only does it keep the sun rays at bay, it moisturizes and replaces my moisturizer during the day.  It has a slight oily texture, but that&#x27;s the great thing about it -- my skin looks radiant when I have it on. I use this and it&#x27;s sister product that has an spf protection of 50 something and a slight tint. Same thing, a great product!</li>
            <li> Be sure when ordering if you want the tinted sunblock not to order this one.  Ordered by mistake.  It is for sensitive skin but it is white and not tinted.</li>
            <li> Love how this goes on. Leaves skin feeling smooth and silky. I buy the one with a tint since I am so fair skinned.</li>
            <li> This is one of the only sunscreens that I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve tried many) that doesn&#x27;t make me break out in a rash when out in the sun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m living in Miami, Florida and the sun along with the humidity demands very selective sunscreen. Something that is sheer, not oily and absorbs perfectly, otherwise the humidity will sweat it out. With this one, you won&#x27;t feel the sensation of something being on your face. It&#x27;s absorbs so perfectly and won&#x27;t make your face oily and shiny. Finally got what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li> It is great.  It is easy to apply.  It is not sticky.  Does not affect clothing.  It is a bit hard to remove form your hands after applying fut I use a bit more soap and wash twice.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Does not irritate my skin as other sunscreens do.</li>
            <li> I am very pale and I always use a sunscreen on my face. There are a lot of poorly formulated sunscreens out there so I am very careful to read the ingredients before I purchase.  Basically, a sunscreen should provide coverage of both the UVA (wavelengths that age and deeply damage the skin) and UVB ( cause tanning and more superficial damage) spectrum.  Zinc oxide is one component that protects against both UVA and UVB rays.  This contains 20% zinc oxide which is adequate for effective protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a vanishing formula, which typically means nanoparticles of zinc oxide.  The formula is rich and would be better for those with normal to dry skin.  It would be heavy and greasy for oily skin.  It seems to play nicely with my makeup.  Overall, I really like this, especially for use in winter.  It may be too heavy for summer.</li>
