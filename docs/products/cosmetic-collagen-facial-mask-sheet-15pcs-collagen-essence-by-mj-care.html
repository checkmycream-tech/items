            <li> It was ok. Nothing special.</li>
            <li> These feel great!  There&#x27;s a generous amount of product on each mask!  THANK YOU!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to use, I like i</li>
            <li> A great mask for the price.  These work really well and fell good on your face.</li>
            <li> You can feel these masks really doing its &#x27;thing&#x27; on your skin. They come out the package wet; have someone place the mask over your face for you. 15-20 min later after taking off the mask you will find that the mask becomes dry. The collagen formula really does seep in the skin and leaves your face feeling refreshed. I use this product after I have showered and after a deep pore mask. Works great! I even got my Fianc&amp;eacute; to use them ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered two shipments of these masks.  Really notice a difference in the smoothness of my skin.  I don&#x27;t use them three times a week as the packaging suggests- just once a week and even with that, I&#x27;m happy with the results!</li>
            <li> So far have only used one mask - and it feels great</li>
            <li> Love these masks. Plumps up all of my little wrinkles.</li>
            <li> The product is amazing and see that the pack is on the face for more than 30-40 min.It makes my skin so smooth</li>
            <li> These are amazing they really help my skin I keep them on until it&#x27;s dry and rub the excess and what&#x27;s in the bag on my neck and chest. When I take it off it&#x27;s like magic. Seriously try these I read about them in an interview with Kesha of all people!</li>

            <li> Good facial mask. does its job.</li>
            <li> I used it for my husbans and my brother! I cleaned my brother&#x27;s face and I put the mask, after removing the black heads the result was amazing. Even next day it was much better! I am going to use it myself</li>
