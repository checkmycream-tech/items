            <li>these are great for painting finger nails and also model building ,, i have  painted finely detailed  parts  with great success</li>
            <li>but they are very light and feel very cheap.</li>
            <li>These brushes are very cheap feeling and preform that way too.</li>
            <li>I was able to do.</li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>I ordered these, knowing they had sort of mixed reviews and hoping for the best.</li>
            <li>They started to fray out very easily and didn&#x27;t produce a clean line</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t even work fine, the nail polish don&#x27;t not come off, and most importantly it takes forever to ship, by the time it comes to you, you don&#x27;t even want to use it.</li>
            <li>so it help with the easy handling.  </li>
            <li>Brussels comes out easily</li>
            <li>I am very pleased and highly recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li>They are a little cheaply made, but they work perfectly.</li>
            <li>Everything was accurate.</li>
            <li>now i know why they were so cheap.</li>
            <li>cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li>Prefect and cheap the price</li>
            <li>Thanks for my brushes!!!</li>
            <li>It good but is very thin and some is coming off but apart from that great prodcut is greate and hope u buy it</li>
            <li>Took me a while to get this order when I did I fell in love with new nail ideas</li>
            <li>Broke the first time I used it!</li>
            <li>They really should change the title of this product and stop trying to get people in by misleading them into thinking they&#x27;re buying something they most certainly are not.</li>
            <li>I guess you get what you pay for, but they weren&#x27;t even worth that.</li>
            <li>so in all well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, to create lines, curves, they are not heavy</li>
            <li>, I wasn&#x27;t too worried because I had a few nail stripers but to have universal to dip in every color sooner is awesome.</li>
            <li>I was worried at first that it wouldn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>so I could make straight lines on my nails.</li>
            <li>But, they seemed to work really well for me..</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>To easy to use avery single time</li>
            <li>The bristles of this product easily became loose after I opened the package.</li>
            <li>Being so inexpensive should have been my first warning that something was off, but I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised before.</li>
            <li>I was being very gentle with the tool (the tips looked very fragile)</li>
            <li>Handle is a little light.</li>
            <li>But have used it for other artistic applications.  </li>
            <li>Wow</li>
            <li>I accidentally put on the acetone and it completely ruined</li>
            <li>I only really needed the shortest one</li>
            <li>When I used the green brush (medium length) for the first time with nail polish, all of the bristles came out while in use!</li>
            <li>Everyone is always shocked when I have perfect little lines on my nails.</li>
            <li>I then tried using the blue brush (long length) &amp; it is hard to manipulate the brush because the bristles are also becoming loose with use.</li>

            <li> I understand things can wear down after multiple uses, but this was the first time I used them &amp; they are now broken.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re actually hollow plastic sticks with strands of brush on the ends.&lt;br /&gt;Almost like drinking straws.  </li>
            <li> not worth it.</li>
            <li> Just wish they were a little thinner.</li>
            <li> I was a little shocked when I opened the package (which I received way before eta.. bonus!), the brushes were a light weight plastic.</li>
            <li> Not a very good set of brushes..</li>
            <li> Sort of hard to do designs.</li>
            <li> It was a very poor design</li>
            <li> When you use them the brush spreads out, making it impossible to draw a line.</li>
            <li> When i got them i was so disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Save your money, these are worthless.</li>

            <li> These are awesome. They are a little cheaply made, but they work perfectly. Everyone is always shocked when I have perfect little lines on my nails.</li>
            <li> Got these, am looking forward to trying them out and doing different designs on nails. I have been looking at videos on how to use the the brushes.</li>
            <li> I do nails all the time and these brushes work great with the gel nail polish to do swirls and lines</li>
            <li> When i got them i was so disappointed.  They look like plastic tubes with ink pen heads attached. Wow now i know why they were so cheap.</li>
            <li> You get what you paid for. I.already tossed it out after the second time using it. It was not the seller&#x27;s fault. Everything was accurate. Like I said, you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS. These tools are not what they look like. They don&#x27;t even work fine, the nail polish don&#x27;t not come off, and most importantly it takes forever to ship, by the time it comes to you, you don&#x27;t even want to use it.</li>
            <li> I got these nail brushes so I could make straight lines on my nails. I was being very gentle with the tool (the tips looked very fragile) and when I dipped it into the nail polish and tried to make a line on my nail,It split and bent sideways. It was a very poor design and I would not recommend buying it.</li>
            <li> One of the tips fell off as I was taking it out of the package.  They&#x27;re actually hollow plastic sticks with strands of brush on the ends.&lt;br /&gt;Almost like drinking straws.  I guess you get what you pay for, but they weren&#x27;t even worth that.</li>
            <li> These brushes work well, i use them for my nail art. I am very pleased and highly recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> Thanks for my brushes!!! They r plastic which is great cause u can set them in nail polish remover and NOT have to worry abt them being all sticky like wooden painted ones</li>
            <li> I love these nail brushes!</li>
            <li> Broke the first time I used it!</li>
            <li> The bristles of this product easily became loose after I opened the package.

            <li> Not a very good set of brushes.. They started to fray out very easily and didn&#x27;t produce a clean line</li>
            <li> cheap and flimsy. not worth it.</li>
            <li> These do the job but they are very light and feel very cheap. I accidentally put on the acetone and it completely ruined it:/ They work good though.</li>
            <li> my backup set of striper brushes and great price!!</li>
            <li> Very fine brushes and excellent for nail art</li>

            <li> Took me a while to get this order when I did I fell in love with new nail ideas I was able to do.</li>
            <li> Nice she like thank you</li>
            <li> Brussels comes out easily</li>
            <li> Took me a bit longer to get a handle on the use.  But have used it for other artistic applications.  Handle is a little light.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 5 stars because it works great. I was worried at first that it wouldn&#x27;t work but after I washed the brush before I used them and tested them out I was very impressed with the performance of the brush. I would recommend this product to anyone that loves to deign nails with acrylic paints.</li>
            <li> I use these all the time and I love them. Great price, too. I only really needed the shortest one but it&#x27;s nice to have extras.</li>
            <li> Prefect and cheap the price</li>
            <li> Good quality brushes. Just wish they were a little thinner. Sort of hard to do designs. But everything came on time!</li>
            <li> I was a little shocked when I opened the package (which I received way before eta.. bonus!), the brushes were a light weight plastic. But, they seemed to work really well for me.. so in all well worth the price. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Just as described, speedy shipping!  Thanks</li>
            <li> I have been dreaming of getting these and it does ship from china but some how I got it in 2 weeks and it was estimated a  month, I wasn&#x27;t too worried because I had a few nail stripers but to have universal to dip in every color sooner is awesome. So stoked to use this!</li>
            <li> I ordered these, knowing they had sort of mixed reviews and hoping for the best. Being so inexpensive should have been my first warning that something was off, but I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised before. They are not sable, but synthetic bristles. They are passable, but not what I was expecting. They really should change the title of this product and stop trying to get people in by misleading them into thinking they&#x27;re buying something they most certainly are not.</li>
            <li> Is these produc wonderful I make my nails beatuful let me mix colors on disen is. To easy to use avery single time</li>
