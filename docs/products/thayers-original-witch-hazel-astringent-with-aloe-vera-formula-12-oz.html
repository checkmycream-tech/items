            <li>I like the way it feels and the aloe vera is a nice touch</li>

            <li>Have used this product for so many years, would use nothing else.</li>
            <li>Glad I found this product.  </li>
            <li>This just feels refreshing, but nothing that lasted.</li>
            <li>This stuff is magic.  </li>
            <li>Personally I love the way it smells too</li>
            <li>I am not quite sure what happened</li>
            <li>I used Dickinson&#x27;s witch hazel before, and this is significantly better.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I used to use chain-brand, and Dickinson&#x27;s, but this feels better.</li>
            <li>It helps so many things.</li>
            <li>Love this witch hazel brand.</li>
            <li>and I like how this product gives me more moisture.</li>
            <li>Great purchase, as described by seller, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this witch hazel is my favorite way to remove all my make up.  </li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t really in love with my face smelling like lilies and roses.  </li>
            <li>and I love the aloe in it.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping and great product.</li>
            <li>i am satisfied</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Clean and effective for a skin refresher and astringent.</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful for things like insect bites, flaky scalp, minor itches.  </li>
            <li>The best part about this product is it contains no alcohol so it won&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>This is a great toner for sensitive skin and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>Make sure you order the ALCOHOL FREE.....</li>
            <li>Leaves a clean, refreshing, cooling sensation withou drying the skin.</li>
            <li>I am very fair and sensitive, but still very oily and acne-prone, so this is a god-send!</li>
            <li>It feels super refreshing when you apply it.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly - will order from them again!</li>
            <li>This product has a lovely fresh scent, something like baby whips.</li>
            <li>My wife got me this for a gift along with some essential oils to add to it to make a great and manly smelling aftershave.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this toner.  </li>
            <li>Also great enough to use on</li>
            <li>After using Alum for a good while I noticed it dried my skin even with using a good post balm, after washing away the alum salts from my face.</li>
            <li>it is so far superior to what is available in the drug store........trust me.  </li>
            <li>Something about witch hazel on my face that feels so fresh and clean!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the Thayer Witch Hazel, 12 Ounce - Original sold by OxKom yet.  </li>
            <li>It did clean my face of dirt like a toner.</li>
            <li>I use it every night on a cotton ball with a drop of of tea tree oil to get my face really clean.</li>
            <li>, skin feels instantly more relaxed and soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>It soothes my skin and helps to clean it after shaving.</li>
            <li>You would have thought after all of that my face would be as clean as it could ever get...</li>
            <li>, it really has a cool, refreshing, cleansing feel.  </li>
            <li>Curel&#x27;s intense lotion works a million times better.</li>
            <li>There is not any more really too be said.  </li>
            <li>This is more aloe than witch hazel, but I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and love the way my face feels afterwards.</li>
            <li>Skin feels so clean and fresh after using.</li>
            <li>quick shipping.  </li>
            <li>They sent the product quickly and it arrived in pristine condition.  </li>
            <li>and it made my face produce more oil than normal</li>
            <li>The scent is not very strong and smells better than witch hazel on its own.</li>
            <li>but since this is natural and very light it works for me.</li>
            <li>My skin already looks visibly more clear within a days use.</li>
            <li>in terms of if it works or not I have no clue cuz i had to put it away right after I opened because i dislike the smell of it.</li>
            <li>Yes, you&#x27;re going to have to open your wallet a tad more, but aren&#x27;t you and your skin worth it?</li>
            <li>But, this one is smooth and leaves my skin fresh and soft.</li>
            <li>and I like it very much.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle and cleansing</li>
            <li>This brand has organic Aloe in it so it is very gentle.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like putting any more toxins onto my body than is absolutely necessary.  </li>
            <li>Even after I wash with facial soap I manage to get more dirt off my face with this toner.</li>
            <li>but it actually makes it even better.  </li>
            <li>I was hooked after the first use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure my skin will thank me for it later.</li>
            <li>Effective for itching, hives, and other skin irritations.</li>
            <li>The lavender and rosewater scents are way better than this original, I expected this original will smell more natural than the other two</li>
            <li>A true throwback to the barbershop days of old.  </li>
            <li>My make-up comes off so easily and fast that I actually do it before bed!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn, nor have much of a fragrance, and it works.</li>
            <li>so anyway this really helps clarifying my skin after I wash it.  </li>
            <li>It really regulates the pH of my skin.</li>
            <li>Really like that it is organic ...</li>
            <li>For the real gents.</li>
            <li>This one I&#x27;m not afraid to put directly on my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never purchased witch hazel before, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to.  </li>
            <li>I still use it because my skin feels so much softer after.</li>
            <li>but this brand will give you some excess oil on your face which is very noticeable.</li>
            <li>It feels very luxurious.</li>
            <li>I shave with a straight razor and this just takes the sting out when used as an aftershave...</li>
            <li>It really softens the skin, it&#x27;s minty too.</li>
            <li>I also feel like my face creams are working much</li>
            <li>I use this product daily as an aftershave.........alcohol free and unscented, it soothes, cools, heals and cleanses.  </li>
            <li>I really like this brand which I purchased from OxKom here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Although slightly different from the original I grew up with, I like it.</li>
            <li>I paid over $12 for a fancy French thermal spring atomizer for skin (smh) before remembering this tried and true astringent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been a big toner person, and only started using one recently because I got one in a gift bag and my friend loved it.  </li>
            <li>I read about it on a shaving sight from a post by an older gent who has used it for years</li>
            <li>highly recommend everyone try this before going out and spending $40 on some department store toner.</li>
            <li>Make sure to apply with a cotton ball after you washed and dried your face.</li>
            <li>I completed one round of isotrentinoin, better known as accutane,</li>
            <li>only wish it were a little more affordable for me!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought this stuff many times before, works well and is a good base for my homemade toner.  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>The lemon has a nice fresh light smell, I normally hate fragrance in anything</li>
            <li>Sometimes going with the old time-tested is all you need.  </li>
            <li>Even when I haven&#x27;t put on make-up on (which is really often now that I&#x27;ve had my second child)</li>
            <li>Gently hydrating and penetrating fairly deep.</li>
            <li>product leaves your skin soft</li>
            <li>This witch hazel has a blend that dried my skin and left it feeling sticky instead of smooth.</li>
            <li>It does wonders for your face after shaving and also for general skin care (it seems to help with eczema on my hands).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 24 year old female witch acne.</li>
            <li>I use this as a natural &amp;#34;alcohol&amp;#34; for homemade products such as air fresheners &amp; hand sanitizers.</li>
            <li>cannot express how surprised I was with the amount of dirt that came off my skin even after having not only used a makeup remover, but a face wash with the Clarsonic.  </li>
            <li>It does smell a bit mediciney, but the smell goes away pretty quickly, no one will be noticing it 30 minutes after applications</li>
    </ol>

            <li> and I love the aloe in it.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great product.</li>
            <li> i am satisfied</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Clean and effective for a skin refresher and astringent.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful for things like insect bites, flaky scalp, minor itches.  </li>
            <li> The best part about this product is it contains no alcohol so it won&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great toner for sensitive skin and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Make sure you order the ALCOHOL FREE.....</li>
            <li> Leaves a clean, refreshing, cooling sensation withou drying the skin.</li>
            <li> I am very fair and sensitive, but still very oily and acne-prone, so this is a god-send!</li>
            <li> It feels super refreshing when you apply it.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly - will order from them again!</li>
            <li> This product has a lovely fresh scent, something like baby whips.</li>
            <li> My wife got me this for a gift along with some essential oils to add to it to make a great and manly smelling aftershave.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this toner.  </li>
            <li> Also great enough to use on</li>
            <li> After using Alum for a good while I noticed it dried my skin even with using a good post balm, after washing away the alum salts from my face.</li>
            <li> it is so far superior to what is available in the drug store........trust me.  </li>
            <li> Something about witch hazel on my face that feels so fresh and clean!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the Thayer Witch Hazel, 12 Ounce - Original sold by OxKom yet.  </li>
            <li> It did clean my face of dirt like a toner.</li>
            <li> I use it every night on a cotton ball with a drop of of tea tree oil to get my face really clean.</li>
            <li> , skin feels instantly more relaxed and soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> It soothes my skin and helps to clean it after shaving.</li>
            <li> You would have thought after all of that my face would be as clean as it could ever get...</li>
            <li> , it really has a cool, refreshing, cleansing feel.  </li>
            <li> Curel&#x27;s intense lotion works a million times better.</li>
            <li> There is not any more really too be said.  </li>
            <li> This is more aloe than witch hazel, but I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and love the way my face feels afterwards.</li>
            <li> Skin feels so clean and fresh after using.</li>
            <li> quick shipping.  </li>
            <li> They sent the product quickly and it arrived in pristine condition.  </li>
            <li> and it made my face produce more oil than normal</li>
            <li> The scent is not very strong and smells better than witch hazel on its own.</li>
            <li> but since this is natural and very light it works for me.</li>
            <li> My skin already looks visibly more clear within a days use.</li>
            <li> in terms of if it works or not I have no clue cuz i had to put it away right after I opened because i dislike the smell of it.</li>
            <li> Yes, you&#x27;re going to have to open your wallet a tad more, but aren&#x27;t you and your skin worth it?</li>
            <li> But, this one is smooth and leaves my skin fresh and soft.</li>
            <li> and I like it very much.  </li>
            <li> Very gentle and cleansing</li>
            <li> This brand has organic Aloe in it so it is very gentle.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like putting any more toxins onto my body than is absolutely necessary.  </li>
            <li> Even after I wash with facial soap I manage to get more dirt off my face with this toner.</li>
            <li> but it actually makes it even better.  </li>
            <li> I was hooked after the first use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure my skin will thank me for it later.</li>
            <li> Effective for itching, hives, and other skin irritations.</li>
            <li> The lavender and rosewater scents are way better than this original, I expected this original will smell more natural than the other two</li>
            <li> A true throwback to the barbershop days of old.  </li>
            <li> My make-up comes off so easily and fast that I actually do it before bed!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn, nor have much of a fragrance, and it works.</li>
            <li> so anyway this really helps clarifying my skin after I wash it.  </li>
            <li> It really regulates the pH of my skin.</li>
            <li> Really like that it is organic ...</li>
            <li> For the real gents.</li>
            <li> This one I&#x27;m not afraid to put directly on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never purchased witch hazel before, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to.  </li>
            <li> I still use it because my skin feels so much softer after.</li>
            <li> but this brand will give you some excess oil on your face which is very noticeable.</li>
            <li> It feels very luxurious.</li>
            <li> I shave with a straight razor and this just takes the sting out when used as an aftershave...</li>
            <li> It really softens the skin, it&#x27;s minty too.</li>
            <li> I also feel like my face creams are working much</li>
            <li> I use this product daily as an aftershave.........alcohol free and unscented, it soothes, cools, heals and cleanses.  </li>
            <li> I really like this brand which I purchased from OxKom here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Although slightly different from the original I grew up with, I like it.</li>
            <li> I paid over $12 for a fancy French thermal spring atomizer for skin (smh) before remembering this tried and true astringent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a big toner person, and only started using one recently because I got one in a gift bag and my friend loved it.  </li>
            <li> I read about it on a shaving sight from a post by an older gent who has used it for years</li>
            <li> highly recommend everyone try this before going out and spending $40 on some department store toner.</li>
            <li> Make sure to apply with a cotton ball after you washed and dried your face.</li>
            <li> I completed one round of isotrentinoin, better known as accutane,</li>
            <li> only wish it were a little more affordable for me!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this stuff many times before, works well and is a good base for my homemade toner.  </li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> The lemon has a nice fresh light smell, I normally hate fragrance in anything</li>
            <li> Sometimes going with the old time-tested is all you need.  </li>
            <li> Even when I haven&#x27;t put on make-up on (which is really often now that I&#x27;ve had my second child)</li>
            <li> Gently hydrating and penetrating fairly deep.</li>
            <li> product leaves your skin soft</li>
            <li> This witch hazel has a blend that dried my skin and left it feeling sticky instead of smooth.</li>
            <li> It does wonders for your face after shaving and also for general skin care (it seems to help with eczema on my hands).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 24 year old female witch acne.</li>
            <li> I use this as a natural &amp;#34;alcohol&amp;#34; for homemade products such as air fresheners &amp; hand sanitizers.</li>
            <li> cannot express how surprised I was with the amount of dirt that came off my skin even after having not only used a makeup remover, but a face wash with the Clarsonic.  </li>
            <li> It does smell a bit mediciney, but the smell goes away pretty quickly, no one will be noticing it 30 minutes after applications</li>
            <li> I got a new bottle when the one I previously purchased was about an inch from the bottom.  </li>
            <li> Long story short</li>
            <li> However, despite having long since received the second bottle, I have not yet opened it because the existing one just lasts and lasts.</li>
            <li> I thought it would help with the itchy dry skin of my legs (especially after shaving)..</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and all you need are some cotton balls; or dry, cotton, facial pads.  </li>
            <li> Also doesn&#x27;t have a strange smell.</li>
            <li> I have used witch hazel since being a teenager--quite a long time.</li>
            <li> I am amazed at how long it lasts.  </li>
            <li> I get enough exposure to motor oil and other chemicals as it is.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry or over hydrate.  </li>
            <li> , I air dry my face by (wafting my hands), and follow up with a quality moisturizer (Anthony Brand).  </li>
            <li> I have really dry skin</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin...</li>
            <li> I have been using this for two things, dry skin and seborrheic dermatitis or scalp psoriasis, depends on which doctor you ask.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Granted it hasn&#x27;t made my dry skin go away permanently, but it does make a difference when applied.  </li>
            <li> Ever since I&#x27;ve started using this, my random breakouts have decreased dramatically and I love that it&#x27;s all natural too.</li>
            <li> At least put the new sticker on the bottom of the bottle where it isn&#x27;t visible.</li>
            <li> smells strange, as if the bottle is filled with chemicals and artificial stuff.</li>
            <li> when I was 20/21 my skin had recently started to break out again (planning on a second round of accutane which I highly recommend to people with SERIOUS skin problems because the side effects are rough but worth it if your acne is bad enough)</li>
            <li> Once it ran out, I investigated other toners, as the one I received was super expensive</li>
            <li> it is just what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Not much to say.  </li>
            <li> careful packaging.  </li>
            <li> This product is exactly as expected.  </li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> Item came sooner than expected and it cleared off my Acne</li>
            <li> I produce much less oil since using this product.</li>
            <li> its&#x27; never irritated my eyes and I wear a lot of black eyeliner and</li>
            <li> this witch hazel removes all the black.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I started using it as a toner, I&#x27;ve had a lot less congestion in my skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very hydrating and not as expensive as other department store brands that I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I dont know how I do without this for even a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I usually use Dickinson&#x27;s but decided to try this.</li>
            <li> I was turned off by witch hazel as a teenager using the commercial ones, which always have a weird after smell.</li>
            <li> so this is gentle enough to work but not cause horrible breakouts.</li>
            <li> I also use the plain as well as the cucumber!</li>
            <li> I was buying expensive toners and this doesn&#x27;t dry out you face like they seem to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed some cheap off-brands one have a really horrible smell.</li>
            <li> but this was not a good way to impress.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;d had thought wrong.  </li>
            <li> and it had this unpleasant feel to the skin</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the case here, but it sends a bad message.  </li>
            <li> , it would&#x27;ve saved me so much grief!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product has a lovely fresh scent, something like baby whips.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful for things like insect bites, flaky scalp, minor itches.  It doesn&#x27;t burn, nor have much of a fragrance, and it works.</li>
            <li> This is a great toner for sensitive skin and acne prone skin. It helped a lot with my acne. The best part about this product is it contains no alcohol so it won&#x27;t dry out your skin. It feels super refreshing when you apply it. Make sure to apply with a cotton ball after you washed and dried your face.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for so many years, would use nothing else.</li>
            <li> Fine--just as described</li>
            <li> Glad I found this product.  Good shipping and resonable too.</li>
            <li> Speedy shipping.  Great product!</li>
            <li> This witch hazel has a blend that dried my skin and left it feeling sticky instead of smooth. It did clean my face of dirt like a toner.</li>
            <li> I use this as an aftershave.  It soothes razor burn fairly well, and doesn&#x27;t do anything I don&#x27;t like.  It has a fairly nice smell, and my girlfriend likes it.  This is probably what I will continue to use for aftershave.</li>
            <li> Long story short I&#x27;m a 24 year old female witch acne. I completed one round of isotrentinoin, better known as accutane, when I was 20/21 my skin had recently started to break out again (planning on a second round of accutane which I highly recommend to people with SERIOUS skin problems because the side effects are rough but worth it if your acne is bad enough) so anyway this really helps clarifying my skin after I wash it.  It doesn&#x27;t dry or over hydrate.  It really regulates the pH of my skin. Who cares how it smells if it works.</li>
            <li> it is just what I expected.  I was very pleased.</li>
            <li> My wife got me this for a gift along with some essential oils to add to it to make a great and manly smelling aftershave.  Leaves my skin feeling great after my morning shave!  Really like that it is organic ... I don&#x27;t like putting any more toxins onto my body than is absolutely necessary.  I get enough exposure to motor oil and other chemicals as it is.</li>
            <li> I thought it would help with the itchy dry skin of my legs (especially after shaving).. Curel&#x27;s intense lotion works a million times better. This just feels refreshing, but nothing that lasted.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic.  There is not any more really too be said.  It does smell a bit mediciney, but the smell goes away pretty quickly, no one will be noticing it 30 minutes after applications</li>
            <li> I use this every time I shave and it works great at soothing the skin.  I use this in addition to an alum block as part of my post-shave routine.</li>
            <li> What a nice toner- I use it every night on a cotton ball with a drop of of tea tree oil to get my face really clean. Even after I wash with facial soap I manage to get more dirt off my face with this toner.</li>
            <li> Old fashion astringent..........works the best.</li>
            <li> Really nice.  Very refreshing.  I didn&#x27;t realize it contains aloe (my oversight) but it actually makes it even better.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I use Thayer Witch Hazel after I get out of the shower and/or shaving (also mid-day for a nice pick-me-up sensation).  It lasts a long time and all you need are some cotton balls; or dry, cotton, facial pads.  Sometimes going with the old time-tested is all you need.  Personally I love the way it smells too, it really has a cool, refreshing, cleansing feel.  After I use Thayer Witch Hazel, I air dry my face by (wafting my hands), and follow up with a quality moisturizer (Anthony Brand).  I was hooked after the first use.  A true throwback to the barbershop days of old.  For the real gents.</li>
            <li> I use this as a natural &amp;#34;alcohol&amp;#34; for homemade products such as air fresheners &amp; hand sanitizers. Works well. Also doesn&#x27;t have a strange smell. I&#x27;ve noticed some cheap off-brands one have a really horrible smell. This one I&#x27;m not afraid to put directly on my skin. Works well for killing odor-causing bacteria as well.</li>
            <li> Not much to say.  It&#x27;s witch hazel and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I used to buy a pricey toner, but not any more! This works really great and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Read the ingredients before ordering.  This is more aloe than witch hazel, but I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> excellent witch hazel.  quick shipping.  careful packaging.  very happy with this buy, good price.  shipped to my door.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this toner.  I use it after a shower and as a refresher.  Ever since I&#x27;ve started using this, my random breakouts have decreased dramatically and I love that it&#x27;s all natural too. It&#x27;s also very hydrating and not as expensive as other department store brands that I&#x27;ve used in the past. I&#x27;m honestly so happy I found this!  I wish I would&#x27;ve known about it as a pimply teenager, it would&#x27;ve saved me so much grief!</li>
            <li> Great product - does the job! Shipped quickly - will order from them again!</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as expected.  I&#x27;ve never purchased witch hazel before, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to.  The product arrived on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> So ... I&#x27;m THAT girl. The girl who doesn&#x27;t take off her make-up at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is great! My make-up comes off so easily and fast that I actually do it before bed! I&#x27;m sure my skin will thank me for it later. Even when I haven&#x27;t put on make-up on (which is really often now that I&#x27;ve had my second child) I still use it because my skin feels so much softer after. I&#x27;m so glad I took a chance on this product!</li>
            <li> I am upset the bottle arrived with contents spilled. I am not quite sure what happened but this was not a good way to impress.</li>
            <li> I use Witch Hazel Oil after I shave everytime. I usually use Dickinson&#x27;s but decided to try this. I like the way it feels and the aloe vera is a nice touch but this brand will give you some excess oil on your face which is very noticeable. Its either the brand, or me, but when I use Dickinson&#x27;s I don&#x27;t get the oil. Good stuff though, everyone has a preference for things. Try it but also try the Dickinson&#x27;s to see what you like. Both are the same price.</li>
            <li> I have used witch hazel since being a teenager--quite a long time. This is by far the best I have ever used</li>
            <li> very great toner for my face. no bumps. zero bumps. skin like a baby. wife loves it. for what it does great price.</li>
            <li> Great product! Excellent for pain! I use it all the time for myself and my animals for cleansing and pain reducer.</li>
            <li> Excellent to mix with water in a squirt bottle for post partum healing. Also great enough to use on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product. Gently hydrating and penetrating fairly deep. Effective for itching, hives, and other skin irritations.</li>
            <li> I love this witch hazel!!! You can FEEL it balance your skin&#x27;s pH, skin feels instantly more relaxed and soft and healthy. I love that it&#x27;s alcohol free!! I am very fair and sensitive, but still very oily and acne-prone, so this is a god-send! I produce much less oil since using this product. It feels very luxurious. I used Dickinson&#x27;s witch hazel before, and this is significantly better.</li>
            <li> I love this product. A friend recommended I try it after I shave since I get irritation sometimes. It soothes my skin and helps to clean it after shaving.</li>
            <li> I believe I have already reviewed this product but in any event, I can still say that it is a great brand of Witch Hazel.  I use it as an aftershave.  I am amazed at how long it lasts.  I got a new bottle when the one I previously purchased was about an inch from the bottom.  However, despite having long since received the second bottle, I have not yet opened it because the existing one just lasts and lasts.</li>
            <li> Everything was great. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Very good product and services ,good price</li>
            <li> Clean and effective for a skin refresher and astringent. Very refreshing after a shave for both men and women. I used to use chain-brand, and Dickinson&#x27;s, but this feels better. Yes, you&#x27;re going to have to open your wallet a tad more, but aren&#x27;t you and your skin worth it?</li>
            <li> I paid over $12 for a fancy French thermal spring atomizer for skin (smh) before remembering this tried and true astringent. My pores have reduced with just one use.</li>
            <li> Although slightly different from the original I grew up with, I like it. It helps so many things. It&#x27;s a must have on the shelf.</li>
            <li> Its pretty awesome! Using it with essential oils! only wish it were a little more affordable for me! But best i could find!</li>
            <li> The product is working great for taking the itch out of my Puririgo Nodularis (skin condition) and drying the nodules up.</li>
            <li> Love this witch hazel brand. Great for a mister refresher after make up application or a cooling spritz any time of the day.. No alcohol and good ingredients. Been using this stuff for years. The lemon has a nice fresh light smell, I normally hate fragrance in anything but since this is natural and very light it works for me. I also use the plain as well as the cucumber! Go Thayers!</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin and I like how this product gives me more moisture. I also have noticed my pores getting smaller.</li>
            <li> Best toner skin looks amazing!!! Thayers has great products</li>
            <li> good size bottle for the price</li>
            <li> Great product and packing super!</li>
            <li> Pleasant feeling, refreshing, very light scent that smells good. I use it after a shower as a toner and it has helped nurture my skin. I have skin that hates abrasive products so this is gentle enough to work but not cause horrible breakouts.</li>
            <li> Something about witch hazel on my face that feels so fresh and clean! Will continue to buy!</li>
            <li> A great product for dog owners.</li>
            <li> I recently got into wetshaving like four months ago. After using Alum for a good while I noticed it dried my skin even with using a good post balm, after washing away the alum salts from my face. Looking for a alternative I turned to Thayers. My skin already looks visibly more clear within a days use. It will be apart of my shave routine for now on. Great Product!</li>
            <li> Arrived timely. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful product. Leaves a clean, refreshing, cooling sensation withou drying the skin. Brought back memories of childhood and having my grandmother dab Witch Hazel on mosquito bites or sooth a sun burn. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I dont know how I do without this for even a few weeks. Skin feels so clean and fresh after using. I shave with a straight razor and this just takes the sting out when used as an aftershave...</li>
            <li> Helped my son&#x27;s face soon after he began using this! Will definitely keep restocking</li>
            <li> Probably does not make a bald guy grow hair, but I thought I&#x27;d try.&lt;br /&gt;Smells absolutely wonderful.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin...product leaves your skin soft</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the Thayer Witch Hazel, 12 Ounce - Original sold by OxKom yet.  But, I have been using the item for over two years and I like it very much.  If the ones I bought from OxKom is the same product as I&#x27;m using now, it should b great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years. I was buying expensive toners and this doesn&#x27;t dry out you face like they seem to do.</li>
            <li> It really softens the skin, it&#x27;s minty too. But it can get sticky.</li>
            <li> Great purchase, as described by seller, fast delivery. I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It does what it says cleans very nice</li>
            <li> I have this sitting on my end table and every evening when I come in from work, I use cotton balls and remove all my makeup while sitting on my couch watching tv.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this witch hazel is my favorite way to remove all my make up.  I have very oily skin and love the way my face feels afterwards. its&#x27; never irritated my eyes and I wear a lot of black eyeliner and this witch hazel removes all the black.  it&#x27;s an evening ritual and this aloe vera formula is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;excellent product and great service. :)</li>
            <li> Very gentle and cleansing</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best witch hazel I have ever used! I was turned off by witch hazel as a teenager using the commercial ones, which always have a weird after smell. But, this one is smooth and leaves my skin fresh and soft. I use it righteously and it works great for soothing bug bites too....!</li>
            <li> YAYAYYAYAY&lt;br /&gt;THE BEST TONER</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this stuff many times before, works well and is a good base for my homemade toner.  Took off some stars because the seller put a bar code sticker across the label, and it tore the label when I went to peel it off.  Also, re-barcoding products is a red flag that it&#x27;s an expired or counterfeit item.  I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the case here, but it sends a bad message.  At least put the new sticker on the bottom of the bottle where it isn&#x27;t visible.</li>
            <li> smells strange, as if the bottle is filled with chemicals and artificial stuff. The lavender and rosewater scents are way better than this original, I expected this original will smell more natural than the other two but it&#x27;s not the case. in terms of if it works or not I have no clue cuz i had to put it away right after I opened because i dislike the smell of it.</li>
            <li> vet recommended for puppy, puppy happy</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, good quality!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a big toner person, and only started using one recently because I got one in a gift bag and my friend loved it.  Once it ran out, I investigated other toners, as the one I received was super expensive and I wasn&#x27;t really in love with my face smelling like lilies and roses.  Another friend noticed I had a bottle of Thayer&#x27;s in the cabinet and told me to try it before I went out and bought a department store brand.  Wow!  Talk about a great idea, that is not going to break the bank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot express how surprised I was with the amount of dirt that came off my skin even after having not only used a makeup remover, but a face wash with the Clarsonic.  You would have thought after all of that my face would be as clean as it could ever get... you&#x27;d had thought wrong.  Once over the face with a cotton pad soaked in the Thayer&#x27;s and there is still dirt coming off my face.  Plus, the remnants of whatever eye makeup that was still left under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I started using it as a toner, I&#x27;ve had a lot less congestion in my skin.  (I don&#x27;t break out a lot visibly, but I can feel the clogged pores when I run my fingers across my face.)  I also feel like my face creams are working much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend everyone try this before going out and spending $40 on some department store toner.</li>
            <li> Good astringent. No burning. Used for years without any problems.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for two things, dry skin and seborrheic dermatitis or scalp psoriasis, depends on which doctor you ask. It has worked for both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted it hasn&#x27;t made my dry skin go away permanently, but it does make a difference when applied.  This is something you have to apply once or twice a day.</li>
            <li> Great product for after shave- soothing- no stink.</li>
            <li> Great product, and good pricing. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily as an aftershave.........alcohol free and unscented, it soothes, cools, heals and cleanses.  I read about it on a shaving sight from a post by an older gent who has used it for years and I decided to give it a try.  When I tried it, I immediately ordered another 3 bottles.  I keep it on hand.........it is so far superior to what is available in the drug store........trust me.  Make sure you order the ALCOHOL FREE.....It comes in several scents, but I chose the unscented with Aloe Vera.  Cannot recommend it highly enough.  If you don&#x27;t try it........it is your loss.</li>
            <li> I love witch hazel!  I use on my face, and on my dogs skin</li>
            <li> None burning,  and gets the job done. Witch hazel removes the excess dirt like alcohol, but without the burn.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect size and I love the aloe in it.  I would definitely get this again!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell and it made my face produce more oil than normal and it had this unpleasant feel to the skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M VERY PLEASED.  THIS IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT!  THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> Item came sooner than expected and it cleared off my Acne i am satisfied</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! It does wonders for your face after shaving and also for general skin care (it seems to help with eczema on my hands). The scent is not very strong and smells better than witch hazel on its own.</li>
            <li> I use Witch Hazel for skin care regularly.  I really like this brand which I purchased from OxKom here on Amazon.  They sent the product quickly and it arrived in pristine condition.  This brand has organic Aloe in it so it is very gentle.  Love it.</li>
