            <li> Although this soap hasn&#x27;t been used very long yet, there is concern that it may be drying, even though it certainly is made of naturally moisturizing and skin softening ingredients.  Primarily seeking a highly moisturizing soap for frequent hand washing, this may have not been the best choice of Terra Mia&#x27;s various soaps.  There is a mild scent to the soap.  This may work better as a facial soap for sensitive skin with acne or such.  Hooray to the goats, this is recommended for people seeking a healing soap.</li>
            <li> The absolute best soap I have ever used!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been searching EVERYWHERE for a great natural moisturizing soap, and I&#x27;m so happy I found it! I have been battling with dry skin and eczema for ever. This soap has a light fresh smell and is exceptionally moisturizing. It&#x27;s gentle and leaves my skin soft and smooth. Now I&#x27;m prepared for the winter. :) I highly recommend this soap for anyone that has dry, sensitive skin and those who have eczema like me. It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> good soap for skin, love it.</li>
            <li> Smell wasn&#x27;t my favorite</li>
            <li> I totally love this soap. I use it on my face.  However,  recently used it on your grandson . He broke out with Excema at 7 months.  No one excema for him. His skin is so soft not rough. We love it. It is expensive so I personally don&#x27;t use it on your body. I wish I could afford to.</li>
            <li> This product is drying to the skin. I have a water softening system, and the ingredients left my skin dry and rough.</li>
            <li> This was bought for my granddaughter who had eczema. The results are excellent. Her skin has cleared up so well. It was so effective for her that I started using it to wash my face. I totally like what I see. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great soap and great for traveling on an airplane.</li>
            <li> Just washed my face this morning with the emily soap face bar. IT IS AMAZING. It made my face feel instantly awaken, it is light, gentle, and washes away easily. I have somewhat of combination/oily and acne prone skin. This seems like it is a good match for me and it can control my face&#x27;s ph. I love it!</li>
            <li> It works but DO NOT LET THIS GET ANYWHERE NEAR YOUR EYES_IT WILL BURN LIKE HELL! Also it dries out very quickly on your face! I used it on my head as well,  but again DO NOT GET THIS IN YOUR EYES --you will have to suspend shaving and flush the eyes really well for several times with RUNNING WATER.  Also if you rinse your razor in a sink of standing water and then rinse your face with this it will BURN! Maybe I&#x27;m crazy but this has been my experience. Also it does not last very many shaves before the cake starts to thin out which also has an effect on the amount of lather created which is less. Does anyone reading this have the same experience? The plus side is that the ingredients appear to be ALL natural- no chemicals- I am disappointed!</li>
            <li> Would have given it 5 ratings,but it&#x27;s kind of small compared to the picture</li>
            <li> Love it...love it. ..only had it for 4 days. I can see a big difference in my face...help control the oil..very nice soap.</li>
            <li> excellent ... .As all their other soaps. excellent product and probably the best soap I ever tried</li>
            <li> love goats milk soap, feels great on the skin,</li>
            <li> Many people might wonder why a person would pay seven dollars, or more for a bar of soap. I purchased this soap, and it is worth every penny. This soap makes my skin feel so soft!! As the saying goes, \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;. This soap is made with high quality organic ingredience. I also like the fact the company who makes this soap, treats their goats humanely, and with kindness. I learned about this, when I researched the soap company. I will absolutely purchase more of this high quality soap.</li>
            <li> I loved this soap so much, I gave one to my girlfriend and she also loved it too. Her hands and fingers were cracked and she tried everything to fix this problem, but couldn&#x27;t, no matter what she used it did not work. Even a dermotologist couldn&#x27;t cure her problem. She used this soap and she is amazed, so am I. I use it to cleanse my face and I even bathe in it, my face looks great and my skin looks nourished, no dry skin. I wish I would have known about this years ago, but thank goodness I know now, what I&#x27;ve been missing. I look pretty young for my age 63, but now I even look better. Thank You and your family so much, I&#x27;m very fortunate to have found a reliable soap that I&#x27;m not afraid to use on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You again,&lt;br /&gt;Gail</li>
            <li> Good but was a bit drying for me.</li>
            <li> I love this soap! I started using it and couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my face was. It cleared up my acne too. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Creamy feeling after I used Tierra Mia Organics RAw Goat Milk Soap! I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This soap is wonderful for sensitive skin! I I have very sensitive fair skin and find that goat milk soaps are the best for moisturizing. I keep plain lye soap around, but it does not moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This smelled really nice, too. Not too overpowering, but milk - tickled the senses.</li>
            <li> Very soothing on my face.</li>
