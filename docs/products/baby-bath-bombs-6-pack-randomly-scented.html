            <li>Sister loved this gift and said the assortment smells great.</li>
            <li>but they we&#x27;re still good.</li>
            <li>on my recommended list of good reviews is Level Naturals.</li>
            <li>but we loved the scents.</li>
            <li>This is a good deal for the amount of bath bombs you get.  </li>
            <li>If you are &amp;#34;checking out&amp;#34; Moon&#x27;s Harvest this is a good way to start.  </li>
            <li>Loved the way it smelt and made my skin feel</li>
            <li>Great quality, huge, smell great</li>
            <li>These are fizzy and fun, and smell awesome.  </li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>I really love these!</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>feel nice on the skin after bath</li>
            <li>Honestly i cant choose between the two yet.</li>
            <li>Some of the scents I liked, but</li>
            <li>The ones above smell great, great fizz, good moisture, etc.</li>
            <li>The aromas are strong and bright, not muddled, and you can tell that quality products were used to make them.  </li>
            <li>I am honestly abt to buy some more for the spoiled one.</li>
            <li>Awesome alternative to pricy Lush.</li>
            <li>Also the scents in these are STRONG!</li>
            <li>I love them</li>
            <li>So Sooooooothing.!!!:)   </li>
            <li>although they smell great, the colors don&#x27;t really spread throughout the water well.</li>
            <li>I love these</li>
            <li>Love these bath bombs.</li>
            <li>One more was also cracked but still held together.</li>
            <li>They are just okay.  </li>
            <li>This means that even if I fell in love with a scent I wouldn&#x27;t know which one it was to order it again.  </li>
            <li>variety pack was my favorite out of my Christmas time order.  </li>
            <li>They al smelled the same and it wasn&#x27;t very good.</li>
            <li>They leave my skin feeling amazing and its so much fun to wait and see what you get.</li>
            <li>The price is great and they make your skin so soft.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, not a single repeat in the order that I put in.</li>
            <li>I was worried that they would be too small and that I would need to use more than one in a bath, but they&#x27;re actually a great size and one is definitely the perfect</li>
            <li>The price for the 6 pack is great, but shipping is pretty high (2/3 of the price of the bombs).  </li>
            <li>Not as amazing as LUSH bath bombs, but does the job for a okay price.</li>
            <li>Make you feel relaxed and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I bought my wife the 6 pack from Moons Harvest, and so far she&#x27;s loved all the ones she&#x27;s tried.</li>
            <li>Anyway, the bath bombs I did receive were lovely, they didn&#x27;t dissolve for a good 6-7 minutes, the scents were great, the water looked fantastic, didnt stain my tub like other generic bath bomb, and my skin felt fantastic after using them.</li>
            <li>all each scent is sooo unique</li>
            <li>I was really excited for these.</li>
            <li>Super fun to watch dissolve and smelled heavenly!  </li>
            <li>From best to least favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe even a solid 4 because the quality js good.</li>
            <li>in case you were wondering, these are still a good size and you only need one.</li>
            <li>None of the scents I purchased in full size were duplicated here.  </li>
            <li>These are perfect items to relieve various kinds of stress that you experience all day long, they are virtually guaranteed in relaxing you.</li>
            <li>I dove in with both feet, but if you want to sample their product first this is the way to do it!</li>
            <li>None were broken (which i thought might happen during the mailing process) and they all smelled delicious!!</li>
            <li>make my skin feel much better than Lush&#x27;s products tend to do, and they fizz for longer as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with these bath bombs and I&#x27;m sure you will be too, the packaging is super cute and colorful, so it makes you want to keep the box it comes in, the scent is long lasting and it doesn&#x27;t stain your tub.</li>
            <li>they smelt great in the box but the flavors were just all so plain.</li>
            <li>They are just the right size for a large bath!  </li>
            <li>Love these bath bombs but when i looked back on here to look at the pictures on here and looked at which bath bombs i received, you dont get the bath bombs that are in the pictures.</li>
            <li>we didn&#x27;t get a pretty assortment</li>
            <li>But yes i would recommend trying this surprise set first.</li>
            <li>The smell with most likely fill your bathroom as well as waft into the rest of your house.</li>
            <li>Some of these scents can be a little strong, especially the more floral ones, but that&#x27;s just me; I like the fruitier and/or more earthy scents.</li>
            <li>I knew when I ordered how much shipping was, but I still think the vendor should offer other, more economical shipping options.</li>
            <li>I always smell yummy after a bath and it leaves my skin super soft</li>
            <li>If the shipping price is a little daunting, just make sure to make a LARGE order to diffuse the cost over 15-20 bombs, it is well worth it.  </li>
            <li>I received this product rather fast.</li>
            <li>This meant that I really had to be blown away by these bath bombs in order to justify purchasing them again, since I wouldn&#x27;t be saving any money once shipping was included.  </li>
            <li>It was a fun present from my fun daughter.</li>
            <li>These bombs are high quality and a delight to use in the bath.  </li>
            <li>so it was normal for me.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve got such a big variety of scents that it&#x27;s easy for me to find ones that will avoid the floral-y smells and still have lots to choose from.</li>
            <li>(Thats really the only downside to these bath bombs)</li>
            <li>When I got mine, two were completely cracked, and got dust everywhere.</li>
            <li>But both are a complete 5 stars plus some for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now for the ones i don&#x27;t recommend because they are like seriously cheap and a waste of a bath bomb experience.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ll be sticking with LUSH products</li>
            <li>The Cons: the only con is the high shipping price.</li>
            <li>Not too girly for my brother-in-law and very affordable in comparison to other brands.</li>
            <li>I purchased this random 6 pack on a whim, and also to see if this could be a cheaper alternative to my more mainstream bath bomb (LUSH) purchases.  </li>
            <li>I was always disappointed that Lush&#x27;s bombs didn&#x27;t make me smell good.</li>
            <li>Both are cheap with weak ingredients or something.</li>
            <li>It is a random assortment, so there have been a few scents I didnt love, but very moisturizing!</li>

            <li> The larger bombs are large enough to use twice, if you can bring yourself to take them out half way through the fizzing process!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll order again knowing that shipping will be an additional 2/3 as much as my purchase price.</li>
            <li> and I realized that the purple had turned the barrier of white surrounding it into a pink.</li>
            <li> I was new to Bath Bombs just late last year</li>
            <li> She always wants to buy them from Lush, but so expensive.</li>
            <li> For the last few years, I&#x27;ve purchased bath bombs from another well known vendor who had a store locally.</li>
            <li> Some people like their bombs to fizz quickly and violently, but I personally prefer a slower fizz and to enjoy the bath while the water slowly gets stronger in scent and color.</li>
            <li> None that she&#x27;s used so far have left any heavy residue in the tub like other&#x27;s in the past.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s always fun to see which random fragrances we get.</li>
            <li> It had not gotten wet or anything.</li>
            <li> When the store closed, I decided to check around online for another source and found these.</li>
            <li> I also buy the LUSH bath bombs but these are are cheaper and work just as well if not better !</li>
            <li> I use them to lure my little girl into the tub.</li>
            <li> This little treat got me hooked on this company though.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as nice as their other products.  </li>
            <li> My problem is they are small as idk</li>
            <li> Naturals and Village Naturals are the worse.</li>
            <li> They are not in the game anymore.</li>
            <li> My daughter is a bath bomb fanatic!!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> There are two in this set that also smell terrible.</li>
            <li> Also, they leave a horrible ring in my tub.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Not nearly as nice as their other products.  I&#x27;ll just drive to the store (different state) or do without. No thx.</li>
            <li> These are fizzy and fun, and smell awesome.  Love!</li>
            <li> I received this product rather fast. None were broken (which i thought might happen during the mailing process) and they all smelled delicious!!</li>
            <li> Great stuff, not a single repeat in the order that I put in. The baby bombs are bigger than some individual bombs that you get elsewhere. I was worried that they would be too small and that I would need to use more than one in a bath, but they&#x27;re actually a great size and one is definitely the perfect size.&lt;br /&gt;They make my skin feel much better than Lush&#x27;s products tend to do, and they fizz for longer as well. Some people like their bombs to fizz quickly and violently, but I personally prefer a slower fizz and to enjoy the bath while the water slowly gets stronger in scent and color. The smell sticks to your skin for hours afterwards too, which is a big plus for me. I was always disappointed that Lush&#x27;s bombs didn&#x27;t make me smell good. Some of these scents can be a little strong, especially the more floral ones, but that&#x27;s just me; I like the fruitier and/or more earthy scents. They&#x27;ve got such a big variety of scents that it&#x27;s easy for me to find ones that will avoid the floral-y smells and still have lots to choose from.</li>
            <li> Best bath bombs I&#x27;ve ever used! I suggest buying this product!!! &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li> Love these bath bombs but when i looked back on here to look at the pictures on here and looked at which bath bombs i received, you dont get the bath bombs that are in the pictures. Anyway, the bath bombs I did receive were lovely, they didn&#x27;t dissolve for a good 6-7 minutes, the scents were great, the water looked fantastic, didnt stain my tub like other generic bath bomb, and my skin felt fantastic after using them. I would buy again if the shipping price was lower. (Thats really the only downside to these bath bombs)</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 sets. Invoice said 2 sets. I only received 1. So I paid $70 for 1 set. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Hello and happy Holidays to MoonsHarvest!!   Thank you for these bathbombs. I love them all each scent is sooo unique i am giving everyone i know one of your bombs. They create a sancutary in my tub. So Sooooooothing.!!!:)   Thank you for these wonderful products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with these bath bombs and I&#x27;m sure you will be too, the packaging is super cute and colorful, so it makes you want to keep the box it comes in, the scent is long lasting and it doesn&#x27;t stain your tub. It&#x27;s absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li> They smell great and seem to be of good quality.</li>
            <li> feel nice on the skin after bath</li>
            <li> although they smell great, the colors don&#x27;t really spread throughout the water well. the oils make me break out all over my body and they gave me a severe UTI. would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Amazing. Make you feel relaxed and comfortable. Also includes a male scent!!! Definitely recommend to all of you guys! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I was really excited for these. they smelt great in the box but the flavors were just all so plain. they all smelt the same. but they we&#x27;re still good. I love these and I would definitely buy them again.</li>
            <li> These bath bombs are awesome ! I also buy the LUSH bath bombs but these are are cheaper and work just as well if not better ! I always smell yummy after a bath and it leaves my skin super soft</li>
            <li> These were great and smelled fantasitc</li>
            <li> Love these bath bombs. I use them to lure my little girl into the tub. Great quality, huge, smell great and it&#x27;s always fun to see which random fragrances we get. The price is great and they make your skin so soft.</li>
            <li> When I got mine, two were completely cracked, and got dust everywhere. One more was also cracked but still held together. There are two in this set that also smell terrible. I thought it was just me, but all of my friends thought it smelled wretched. The color also fades. I ordered mine a while back and I realized that the purple had turned the barrier of white surrounding it into a pink. It had not gotten wet or anything. I vote against these.</li>
            <li> as great as I had hoped these were.. we didn&#x27;t get a pretty assortment</li>
            <li> Wonderful! Will order again!</li>
            <li> Ok. I was new to Bath Bombs just late last year so i went on a testing spree. This review will be the same for each one except the stars will be different.&lt;br /&gt;Ok. From best to least favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My two best choices are Lush(only one I&#x27;m reviewing not sold on amazon) and Moon&#x27;s Harvest Bath &amp; Body Shop. Honestly i cant choose between the two yet. But both are a complete 5 stars plus some for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next. This one. Blissful Bath and Lather and Fizz Bath Boutique. These i think are the same company. Both are a 3 1/2 to 4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last on my recommended list of good reviews is Level Naturals. They are great quality. My problem is they are small as idk what. Like golf ball or smaller. I had to use 2 at a time which is why im giving them a 3. Scents are Earthy which i like. If they increase the size and keep the same quality, id have them at a 4 with the 2 above. Maybe even a solid 4 because the quality js good. Which would bring these to a second place(not a tie with the ones above).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the ones i don&#x27;t recommend because they are like seriously cheap and a waste of a bath bomb experience. Ps. The ones above smell great, great fizz, good moisture, etc. what you expect from a bath bomb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hugo Naturals and Village Naturals are the worse. I give them 1 star. Enough said. They are not in the game anymore. I used all 3 village ones that come in that pack at the same time and it still didnt come to a 2 star level. Both are cheap with weak ingredients or something. Ok. Thats all. Time to copy and paste this to all the others. Hope this helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just in case you were wondering, these are still a good size and you only need one. These are the size of the Blissful Bath regular size. I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; part in the description for the size so it was normal for me. This little treat got me hooked on this company though. But when i saw the regular size ones that look like a softball or something, i was like whoa! Lol. But yes i would recommend trying this surprise set first.</li>
            <li> I was not a fan of these. They al smelled the same and it wasn&#x27;t very good. i&#x27;ll be sticking with LUSH products</li>
            <li> The baby bath bombs arrived in record time for Christmas.  Not too girly for my brother-in-law and very affordable in comparison to other brands.</li>
            <li> Super fun to watch dissolve and smelled heavenly!  It was a fun present from my fun daughter.</li>
            <li> For the last few years, I&#x27;ve purchased bath bombs from another well known vendor who had a store locally. When the store closed, I decided to check around online for another source and found these. I bought my wife the 6 pack from Moons Harvest, and so far she&#x27;s loved all the ones she&#x27;s tried. Pros: None that she&#x27;s used so far have left any heavy residue in the tub like other&#x27;s in the past. Also the scents in these are STRONG! The smell with most likely fill your bathroom as well as waft into the rest of your house. Some may think it&#x27;s overpowering but we loved the scents. The Cons: the only con is the high shipping price. I knew when I ordered how much shipping was, but I still think the vendor should offer other, more economical shipping options. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll order again knowing that shipping will be an additional 2/3 as much as my purchase price.</li>
            <li> This is a good deal for the amount of bath bombs you get.  It is a random assortment, so there have been a few scents I didnt love, but very moisturizing!</li>
            <li> I purchased this random 6 pack on a whim, and also to see if this could be a cheaper alternative to my more mainstream bath bomb (LUSH) purchases.  The price for the 6 pack is great, but shipping is pretty high (2/3 of the price of the bombs).  This meant that I really had to be blown away by these bath bombs in order to justify purchasing them again, since I wouldn&#x27;t be saving any money once shipping was included.  Despite these being bath bombs, I was not blown away.  They are just okay.  Some of the scents I liked, but I couldn&#x27;t tell you what they were since they didn&#x27;t have labels on them.  This means that even if I fell in love with a scent I wouldn&#x27;t know which one it was to order it again.  Also, they leave a horrible ring in my tub.  I even had to bust out the ajax.  All in all, I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Not as amazing as LUSH bath bombs, but does the job for a okay price.</li>
            <li> These are perfect items to relieve various kinds of stress that you experience all day long, they are virtually guaranteed in relaxing you.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves these.</li>
            <li> These bombs are high quality and a delight to use in the bath.  The larger bombs are large enough to use twice, if you can bring yourself to take them out half way through the fizzing process!!  The aromas are strong and bright, not muddled, and you can tell that quality products were used to make them.  If the shipping price is a little daunting, just make sure to make a LARGE order to diffuse the cost over 15-20 bombs, it is well worth it.  I have yet to find a scent I don&#x27;t like and am already compiling a list for my next order.  Speedy shipping, great quality &amp; just so wonderful a product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This variety pack was my favorite out of my Christmas time order.  None of the scents I purchased in full size were duplicated here.  They are just the right size for a large bath!  If you are &amp;#34;checking out&amp;#34; Moon&#x27;s Harvest this is a good way to start.  I dove in with both feet, but if you want to sample their product first this is the way to do it!</li>
            <li> Loved the way it smelt and made my skin feel</li>
            <li> My daughter is a bath bomb fanatic!!! She always wants to buy them from Lush, but so expensive. These are a PERFECT substitute. We received 6, beautiful colors witj beautiful fragrances and all were labeled. These are great for yourself or as a gift. I am honestly abt to buy some more for the spoiled one. I totally recommend!! Happy Mom in NC!</li>
            <li> Sister loved this gift and said the assortment smells great. Awesome alternative to pricy Lush.</li>
            <li> I really love these! They leave my skin feeling amazing and its so much fun to wait and see what you get.</li>
