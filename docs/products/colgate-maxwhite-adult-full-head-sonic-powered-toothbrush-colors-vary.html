            <li>Great toothbrush and a great price.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush is great, but the color just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>great price.</li>
            <li>great buy.</li>
            <li>also great for getting things out from between your teeth</li>
            <li>After six weeks the battery is still good</li>
            <li>Good price and the toothbrush works well.</li>
            <li>It is good for travel/ gym bag/</li>
            <li>Bristles feel great and I am pleased with the grip and curvature of the handle.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>love em, keep them coming!</li>
            <li>i can get a replacement at interals of 1 to 6 moths  free shipping  GREAT VALUE</li>
            <li>amazing.</li>
            <li>makes it nice.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t have that kind of money.</li>
            <li>Brush head stays nice</li>
            <li>You can change the battery if you want, but in principal one shouldn&#x27;t have to.&lt;br /&gt;Though the life is variable, I wonder if the Amazon stock can be old, in which case Colgate should put a &#x27;best used by date&#x27; or something on the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Outside</li>
            <li>It is fantastic and a better price!</li>
            <li>Love these toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>I should have read the description better.  </li>
            <li>Much better than I was expecting for the price.</li>
            <li>If you use a Sonicare, they do a more than just vibrate as they do oscillate</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve used it for about a month, I can say that there are better brushes in the price range.</li>
            <li>great price &amp; fast shipping</li>
            <li>Four more words required.</li>
            <li>I think it cleans better also.  </li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush and the fact that it is a Subscribe &amp; Save item.....</li>
            <li>LOVE these buggers.  </li>
            <li>I like this toothbrush, but I think that I like the power toothbrushes with the spinning heads better.</li>
            <li>It also gets them very very very very clean.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is fine for a five dollar unit, but you&#x27;ll be money ahead to buy a better one.  </li>
            <li>Not only does this machine effortlessly clean my teeth but the invigorating vibrations are at the perfect frequency to jump start my brain in the morning.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect this brush to be as good as a Sonicare, given the price difference, however I was hoping to find an decent alternative to use while traveling a couple of days a month.</li>
            <li>... poor man&#x27;s sonic ... alkaline battery lasts about a month or more ... brush will wear out after three months or so ... very light and perfect travel power brush ...</li>
            <li>Would have been 2 stars if it wasn&#x27;t for a comfortable handle.</li>
            <li>Just been using it a short time, but I will buy another; it&#x27;s a great toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It is battery operated and does a fantastic job of brushing.</li>
            <li>My teeth felt so clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>A minimalist&#x27;s dream come true.  </li>
            <li>I am lucky if the battery in mine lasts one month.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone wanting whiter teeth and better teeth health.</li>
            <li>While the brush seemed to be good at first, every time I brushed my teeth</li>
            <li>This is a great little toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>i really enjoy this toothbrush, it really whitens your teeth.</li>
            <li>Not as powerful as I want,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on auto delivery of these for about a year, keeps my brush fresh.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have an electric toothbrush that I don&#x27;t have to put on a giant charger.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s about the only improvement I can suggest in this product, brush refills, but other than that it is AWESOME!  </li>
            <li>I love the extra clean feeling I get with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like this makes my teeth feel any more clean than using a regular non powered brush.</li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t vibrate as good as the other brands.</li>
            <li>it says right on the packaging to replace every 3 months.</li>
            <li>My dental hygienist said I was taking excellent care of my teeth and asked me what I was doing different from the previous 6 months.</li>
            <li>I like using soft bristles because they are more gentle on my gums, and teeth.</li>
            <li>I am obsessive about my teeth being clean, so much that I will brush my teeth several times before feeling satisfied.</li>
            <li>This has very light power and does not feel sufficient for daily use.</li>
            <li>Bought for my wife, who was most excited that the one we got was pink.  </li>
            <li>We have gone back to the Colgate spin brushes as just think they are a better option for our traveling needs.</li>
            <li>You do a better job with your regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t convinced that the vibrating head was doing anything effective at the brush level other than what a manual toothbrush would do.</li>
            <li>I really like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My whole family ordered one.</li>
            <li>For that price, my kids have enjoyed having their teeth  showing less decay.lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll</li>
            <li>Many electric brushes require a case larger than a standard travel case, not this one.  </li>
            <li>Highly, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Yes, this actually works and for me is worth it for me.</li>
            <li>I was also quite surprised to see that my subscribe and save bargain at slightly under 5 dollars was now costing me the better part of 9 dollars.</li>
            <li>I am currently undergoing chemotherapy right now</li>
            <li>FINALLY, all is right in the world of teeth</li>
            <li>a new one is delivered to me every month.</li>
            <li>i recommend this to anyone who wants and electric toothbrush with not too much power to hurt but just enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>It just needs to be lined up exactly for the bottom to open.</li>
            <li>Mine is still like new as far as the battery power goes.  </li>
            <li>Same result, though not as frequently as the first.</li>
            <li>Your better off buying this brush at walmart, youll save enough to buy the toothpast too and still be paying less.</li>
            <li>those issues, the brush works very well, especially if you compare to replacing SOnicare heads</li>
            <li>but the bristles are nearly &amp;#34;past their prime.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ll order these about every two months.</li>
            <li>soft.</li>
            <li>It still makes my teeth feel much cleaner than a standard toothbrush and is my travel toothbrush of choice.</li>
            <li>soft bristles.</li>
            <li>I love my SonicCare toothbrush, but not enough to waste space and weight when traveling.</li>
            <li>It is hard to imagine that it actually cleans your teeth any better than a manual brush.</li>
            <li>This is a great value for money and works out less expensive than buying the replaceable heads toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Instead, search Amazon for &amp;#34;Colgate Max White Sonic Power Toothbrush, Soft, 2 Count&amp;#34; to buy TWO of these for only $4.50 each.  </li>
            <li>However,  the  brissels wear down fast around the spin brush.</li>

            <li> However,  the  brissels wear down fast around the spin brush.</li>
            <li> You have brush up and down like a normal toothbrush, while the SonicCare only requires moving it to different teeth.  </li>
            <li> If you normally use a regular toothbrush, then you might find a slight improvement.</li>
            <li> (I thought they would when I saw the circle of bristles) and the &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; action is very, very minimal compared to the SonicCare.</li>
            <li> The bristles are quite soft and the brush is less noisy than similar battery powered toothbrushes</li>
            <li> No more shelling out big bucks for gizmos that don&#x27;t work and charge $15 for a new brush head!</li>
            <li> These brushes are quieter, about 1/4 of the price of Sonicare replacement brush heads, and take up far less room on the bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li> These powered tooth-brushes are really well made - have had 2 and each lasted at least 6 months...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many expensive teeth cleaners over the years and this beats them all, hands down.</li>
            <li> by the way - when the bristles are tired and you need a new one, don&#x27;t throw the old one away.</li>
            <li> I prefer other brands that actually spin.</li>
            <li> If you have used Sonicare or Oral-B, I don&#x27;t think you will find these brushes to have the same cleaning ability, due to lack of movement in the brush head.</li>
            <li> I ended up with a loose bristle or two in my mouth or caught in my throat.</li>
            <li> and it is a lot less noisy than similar battery powered toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> I gave it four stars because I&#x27;d like to see the bristles last a little longer.</li>
            <li> only replacing due to the brush wearing out just slightly.  </li>
            <li> if it seems a bit rough, tear out all the rubber bristles like I do.</li>
            <li> I ordered one intending it for a boy and got a pink one.  </li>
            <li> Put it to work cleaning the household nooks and crannies or put it in the tool box for other odd cleaning jobs.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel and look cleaner after using it (compared to the average toothbrush).  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if dentists approve of these little &amp;#34;electric&amp;#34; toothbrushes, but my family and I like them a lot.</li>
            <li> His is just about dead now.  </li>
            <li> this brush is listed at $8.63 instead of the previous price of about $5 (price at any store), so this is either a MISTAKE on Amazon&#x27;s part, or it is a SUCKER&#x27;S PRICE.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m out of the ordinary.</li>
            <li> this product is not good at all.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that it works well, but that doesn&#x27;t mean your brush will do all the work!</li>
            <li> I am not happy with this colgate maxwhite toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Amazon sends random model and color.  </li>
            <li> but it is impossible to change the battery and still have it work.</li>
            <li> Bad quality .</li>
            <li> Worst toothbrush ever.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years then tried an oral b battery brush. I prefer the oral b but it is impossible to change the battery and still have it work. So I&#x27;m headed back to Colgate.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. Seems to work about the same as a regular toothbrush, but the vibrating feels almost like going to the dentist for a cleaning. I  would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love these toothbrushes.  I also have it on auto delivery makes it nice.  I switched my son and I to these vibrating tooth brushes and we are getting rave reviews from our hygentist.</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife, who was most excited that the one we got was pink.  But, it does what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> toothbrush is cheaper than buying heads for an 110 volt-EXPENSIVE toothbrush  AND  by buying it on suscribe and save- i can get a replacement at interals of 1 to 6 moths  free shipping  GREAT VALUE</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush. I like using soft bristles because they are more gentle on my gums, and teeth. Whenever I buy a toothbrush I focus on comfort, control, and performance. This toothbrush has all three of those things. Overall I recommend this tootbrush.</li>
            <li> i really enjoy this toothbrush, it really whitens your teeth. It also gets them very very very very clean. I will not go back to manual toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Bristles feel great and I am pleased with the grip and curvature of the handle. I am currently undergoing chemotherapy right now so I sometimes have to use it without the power on and it still works great!</li>
            <li> I should have read the description better.  All this toothbrush does is vibrate the bristles.  I prefer other brands that actually spin.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as I want, but I don&#x27;t have that kind of money. Much better than I was expecting for the price.</li>
            <li> Wow! I used this for the 1st time this morning and I felt like I just got out of the dentist&#x27;s chair. My teeth felt so clean and smooth. And for that price?? What a bargain!! Highly, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush for under $5 using Amazon prime. This is a great value for money and works out less expensive than buying the replaceable heads toothbrushes. The bristles are quite soft and the brush is less noisy than similar battery powered toothbrushes</li>
            <li> Amazon sends random model and color.  Not as shown, the picture does not match what you get. Bad quality .</li>
            <li> it says right on the packaging to replace every 3 months. I am lucky if the battery in mine lasts one month. I brush my teeth 2x a day 2-3 min a pop, so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m out of the ordinary. You can change the battery if you want, but in principal one shouldn&#x27;t have to.&lt;br /&gt;Though the life is variable, I wonder if the Amazon stock can be old, in which case Colgate should put a &#x27;best used by date&#x27; or something on the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Outside those issues, the brush works very well, especially if you compare to replacing SOnicare heads</li>
            <li> We bought a couple of these to use as traveling toothbrushes as we needed to find something smaller than our Sonicare or even the battery operated Colgate spin-brushes I think they are called. If you use a Sonicare, they do a more than just vibrate as they do oscillate and I feel like with the extra movement, they help in cleaning the teeth. Even the Oral-B has a rotating head for extra cleaning. These brushes just seem to vibrate a lot, not only in the head, but also in the handle. If you have used Sonicare or Oral-B, I don&#x27;t think you will find these brushes to have the same cleaning ability, due to lack of movement in the brush head. If you normally use a regular toothbrush, then you might find a slight improvement. I didn&#x27;t expect this brush to be as good as a Sonicare, given the price difference, however I was hoping to find an decent alternative to use while traveling a couple of days a month. We have gone back to the Colgate spin brushes as just think they are a better option for our traveling needs.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if dentists approve of these little &amp;#34;electric&amp;#34; toothbrushes, but my family and I like them a lot.</li>
            <li> Currently (9 Jun 14) this brush is listed at $8.63 instead of the previous price of about $5 (price at any store), so this is either a MISTAKE on Amazon&#x27;s part, or it is a SUCKER&#x27;S PRICE. Instead, search Amazon for &amp;#34;Colgate Max White Sonic Power Toothbrush, Soft, 2 Count&amp;#34; to buy TWO of these for only $4.50 each.  Any drugstore sells this brush for about $5 each (and you get to choose your COLOR!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice brush ... poor man&#x27;s sonic ... alkaline battery lasts about a month or more ... brush will wear out after three months or so ... very light and perfect travel power brush ... if it seems a bit rough, tear out all the rubber bristles like I do.</li>
            <li> While the brush seemed to be good at first, every time I brushed my teeth I ended up with a loose bristle or two in my mouth or caught in my throat. I had bought a multi pack and thought it was just anomaly, so I tried a second brush different color. Same result, though not as frequently as the first. I had to toss them.</li>
            <li> Yes, this actually works and for me is worth it for me. I believe that my teeth are cleaner and look cleaner too. After six weeks the battery is still good but the bristles are nearly &amp;#34;past their prime.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ll order these about every two months. I gave it four stars because I&#x27;d like to see the bristles last a little longer.</li>
            <li> Works well, great price.  My whole family ordered one.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush and a great price.  My teeth feel and look cleaner after using it (compared to the average toothbrush).  I highly recommend it to anyone wanting whiter teeth and better teeth health.</li>
            <li> Obviously, I missed the part of the description where it must say colors vary and you have no choice.  I ordered one intending it for a boy and got a pink one.  The toothbrush is great, but the color just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Just bought one today at walmart for $3.48 . Your better off buying this brush at walmart, youll save enough to buy the toothpast too and still be paying less.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve used it for about a month, I can say that there are better brushes in the price range. This one doesn&#x27;t vibrate as good as the other brands. Would have been 2 stars if it wasn&#x27;t for a comfortable handle.</li>
            <li> A+++ great price &amp; fast shipping</li>
            <li> Love it! Brush head stays nice&lt;br /&gt;And soft.</li>
            <li> I love my SonicCare toothbrush, but not enough to waste space and weight when traveling. This is the perfect substitute.  The brushes do not spin at all (I thought they would when I saw the circle of bristles) and the &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; action is very, very minimal compared to the SonicCare. You have brush up and down like a normal toothbrush, while the SonicCare only requires moving it to different teeth.  It still makes my teeth feel much cleaner than a standard toothbrush and is my travel toothbrush of choice.</li>
            <li> soft bristles. sonic power. great price. great buy. i recommend this to anyone who wants and electric toothbrush with not too much power to hurt but just enough to get the job done. also great for getting things out from between your teeth</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is fine for a five dollar unit, but you&#x27;ll be money ahead to buy a better one.  The head of this toothbrush only vibrates--none of the bristles actually move.  It is hard to imagine that it actually cleans your teeth any better than a manual brush.</li>
            <li> wonderful, use it all the time. been about 6 months now and haven&#x27;t changed the battery. I brush twice  a day. At a $1.50 on sale it was a steal.</li>
            <li> Good price and the toothbrush works well. Initially couldn&#x27;t figure out how to get the battery out when needed, but eventually figured it out.  It just needs to be lined up exactly for the bottom to open.</li>
            <li> Just been using it a short time, but I will buy another; it&#x27;s a great toothbrush. Four more words required.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with this colgate maxwhite toothbrush.  It does not vibrate both heads only one does. I prefer oral- b. which i bought and used it. Compare to oral-b this product is not good at all.</li>
            <li> I used to get my toothbrushes at the store and on a whim I tried this one out on Amazon. It is fantastic and a better price! Plus I set up auto ship for every 3 months, that way I know when to change it out. It is battery operated and does a fantastic job of brushing.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush vibrates and it is a lot less noisy than similar battery powered toothbrushes.  I think it cleans better also.  I think it is a lot gentler than others.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush and the fact that it is a Subscribe &amp; Save item.....a new one is delivered to me every month.</li>
            <li> love em, keep them coming! I&#x27;ve been on auto delivery of these for about a year, keeps my brush fresh.</li>
            <li> I love the extra clean feeling I get with this toothbrush. I am obsessive about my teeth being clean, so much that I will brush my teeth several times before feeling satisfied. This brush allows me to only brush 3 times a day! Keep in mind that it works well, but that doesn&#x27;t mean your brush will do all the work! You still have to go through the motions.</li>
            <li> Many electric brushes require a case larger than a standard travel case, not this one.  However,  the  brissels wear down fast around the spin brush.</li>
            <li> These powered tooth-brushes are really well made - have had 2 and each lasted at least 6 months...only replacing due to the brush wearing out just slightly.  (Any brand/model with replaceable brushes?)  That&#x27;s about the only improvement I can suggest in this product, brush refills, but other than that it is AWESOME!  Came with the battery as well - another plus!</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist said I was taking excellent care of my teeth and asked me what I was doing different from the previous 6 months. This toothbrush was it.</li>
            <li> Not only does this machine effortlessly clean my teeth but the invigorating vibrations are at the perfect frequency to jump start my brain in the morning. This thing is a masseuse for the mouth... amazing. I&#x27;ve tried many expensive teeth cleaners over the years and this beats them all, hands down. $5 each and one simple AAA battery - are you kidding me! No more shelling out big bucks for gizmos that don&#x27;t work and charge $15 for a new brush head! This is the tool we&#x27;ve all been waiting for. From the bottom of my heart, thank you Colgate! FINALLY, all is right in the world of teeth cleaning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And by the way - when the bristles are tired and you need a new one, don&#x27;t throw the old one away. Put it to work cleaning the household nooks and crannies or put it in the tool box for other odd cleaning jobs. It&#x27;s the gift that keeps on giving!</li>
            <li> This is a great little toothbrush.  It&#x27;s nice to have an electric toothbrush that I don&#x27;t have to put on a giant charger.  I bought two.  One for me and one for my husband.  We have been using them for just over a month now.  Mine is still like new as far as the battery power goes.  I keep mine on the vanity.  My husband prefers to brush his teeth in the shower.  His is just about dead now.  Since we use them the same amount of time, I&#x27;m attributing his short battery vs. mine to the prolonged moisture in the shower.</li>
            <li> After my second Colgate Sonicwhatever toothbrush, I turfed my Sonicare.  These brushes are quieter, about 1/4 of the price of Sonicare replacement brush heads, and take up far less room on the bathroom counter.  I have one in the bathroom, one in the car, and one in my desk at work. LOVE these buggers.  A minimalist&#x27;s dream come true.  Never going back to having clunky appliances mucking up my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> This has very light power and does not feel sufficient for daily use. It is good for travel/ gym bag/ back up. You get what you pay for here.</li>
            <li> For that price, my kids have enjoyed having their teeth  showing less decay.lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll</li>
            <li> Worst toothbrush ever. It only vibrates, almost hurting your teeth. You do a better job with your regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t convinced that the vibrating head was doing anything effective at the brush level other than what a manual toothbrush would do. I was also quite surprised to see that my subscribe and save bargain at slightly under 5 dollars was now costing me the better part of 9 dollars. I canceled subscribe and save in favor of a rotating head model.</li>
            <li> I like this toothbrush, but I think that I like the power toothbrushes with the spinning heads better. I don&#x27;t feel like this makes my teeth feel any more clean than using a regular non powered brush.</li>
