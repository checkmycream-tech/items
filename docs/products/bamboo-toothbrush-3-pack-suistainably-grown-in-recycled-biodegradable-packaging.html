            <li>I have many problems with this</li>

            <li>There are many excellent rotating electric toothbrushes that sell on Amazon for a 100+ dollars that I actually prefer.</li>

            <li>I love the design and feel.</li>
            <li>I used mine immediately and was quite pleased.  </li>
            <li>this is a great toothbrush with soft bristles.  </li>
            <li>We received two bamboo brushes very quickly after ordering.</li>
            <li>I had a bit of a problem the first couple of times using it because the wood didn&#x27;t feel nice and smooth like plastic does, but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it</li>
            <li>and now it feels just fine.  </li>
            <li>It has a good feel and does a good job of brushing my teeth, with the added bonus of being made from a rapidly growing grass rather than from a petroleum product that may never break down.</li>
            <li>FABULOUS TOOTHBRUSH...</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s this amazing bonus, it is an environmentally responsible product.</li>
            <li>free sample was provided for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so far, so good.  </li>
            <li>Now if only they could figure out how to make everybody that uses one of these handsome or beautiful, they would really have something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s environmentally friendly</li>
            <li>This is an earth friendly artisanal toothbrush.</li>

            <li>The bristles are just right.</li>
            <li>(yeah OK, you can say it, I have a big mouth).</li>
            <li>i have to, respectfully, disagree with the person who gave this product a two-star review because of multiple pictures of the three-pack.</li>
            <li>When I compare that to all the plastic packaging for a normal toothbrush, and the plastic handle, none of which are recyclable; the BmBu toothbrush wins all around.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So something a little larger works great for me.</li>
            <li>Who really cares?</li>
            <li>I highly recommend itðŸ˜„!</li>
            <li>The bristles are pretty soft, but not ridiculously so.</li>
            <li>Made with High Quality, Sustainably Grown Bamboo &amp;#x2605; Biodegradable Packaging]]</li>
            <li>No waste in packaging really.</li>
            <li>The green bristles and bamboo epitomize the fact that this product is unique when you pick it up for the first time.</li>
            <li>Handle feels nice but the bristles feel firm not soft as advertised.</li>
            <li>, I have big hands, I have a reasonably large mouth</li>
            <li>Love the concept and lightness and grip, but the brush is waaaaaay too hard.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft enough to really brush my teeth without tearing up my gums.</li>
            <li>I like the soft bristles.</li>
            <li>Switched to these from plastic toothbrush, they work well, bamboo is naturally antibiotic (unlike plastic)</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, it was shipped in an envelope lined with bubble wrap, which is completely counterintuitive to the environmental no-plastic purpose of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the concept and lightness and grip, but the brush is waaaaaay too hard.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> I like the soft bristles. Got the firm for my spouse. He said it wasn&#x27;t firm enough. For me, a toothbrush is a toothbrush. I like the design. It does taste like wood since it&#x27;s made of bamboo. Just expect that. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Switched to these from plastic toothbrush, they work well, bamboo is naturally antibiotic (unlike plastic) and it&#x27;s environmentally friendly so I will continue to buy these.</li>
            <li> I have many problems with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it was shipped in an envelope lined with bubble wrap, which is completely counterintuitive to the environmental no-plastic purpose of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the angle of the brush does not allow good reach to the molars and other back teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The third and worst problem is the bristles. Although they are &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; the edges are sharp and cut my gums. Not only is this painful, it&#x27;s bad for gum health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this toothbrush. Since I&#x27;m concerned about the environment I&#x27;m now going to try preserve toothbrushes, which are plastic but made from recycled yogurt cups and are mailed back to the company for recycling.</li>
            <li> I like the concept, it&#x27;s just that the wood scraping against my lips was irritating once it the wood started getting saturated with moisture.</li>
            <li> Handle feels nice but the bristles feel firm not soft as advertised.</li>
            <li> 5 stars because it just feels like it didn&#x27;t damage the earth to construct and feels good on the teeth.  I had a bit of a problem the first couple of times using it because the wood didn&#x27;t feel nice and smooth like plastic does, but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it and now it feels just fine.  I feel like the bristles get in where they need to without being too hard.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush! It&#x27;s soft enough to really brush my teeth without tearing up my gums.</li>
            <li> FABULOUS TOOTHBRUSH...AND IT IS NOT MADE OF PLASTIC SO EXCELLENT WAY TO HELP SAVE OUR PLANET  BOUGHT SEVERAL OF THESE TO HAND OUT TO FRIENDS.  WILL BE MY TOOTHBRUSH PURCHASE FROM NOW ON</li>
            <li> Here I go, gushing over a toothbrush. Who really cares? My dentist gives me one every time I visit. The plastic ones are super cheap at Walgreens. I seem to have a million lying around the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh was I wrong - those junky plastic things, I now officially despise them. I love this BmBu toothbrush so much. It feels great in my hand. The bristles are big and cover a lot of teeth and gum at once. The thing fits perfectly in my mouth. And that bamboo - oh man that feels so good. How the heck could they make me go crazy over something this simple - a silly toothbrush?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BmBu is a great toothbrush. Well, I&#x27;m a man, I have big hands, I have a reasonably large mouth (yeah OK, you can say it, I have a big mouth). So something a little larger works great for me. I could imagine somebody with really small hands and a small mouth might not like this particular toothbrush. I&#x27;d still suggest you try this toothbrush. They aren&#x27;t very expensive. And if you hate it - these make the world&#x27;s best scrub brush / detailer brush for small parts or small areas in the world. You win all the way around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there&#x27;s this amazing bonus, it is an environmentally responsible product. The box is simplicity - simple recycled card stock. They don&#x27;t use fancy colored inks. There isn&#x27;t even a piece of plastic tape to hold the box closed. No waste in packaging really. The handle is made from bamboo, one of the most renewable resources in the world. And the bristles, well they have to be plastic - except they are one type and simply inserted into the bamboo. When I compare that to all the plastic packaging for a normal toothbrush, and the plastic handle, none of which are recyclable; the BmBu toothbrush wins all around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, the toothbrush feels great in my mouth. I actually like brushing my teeth with this. Now if only they could figure out how to make everybody that uses one of these handsome or beautiful, they would really have something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A free sample was provided for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have a firm version of the same toothbrush:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00SIG344W BmBu Natural ToothBrush &amp;#x2605; Firm Bristle &amp;#x2605; Made with High Quality, Sustainably Grown Bamboo &amp;#x2605; Biodegradable Packaging]]They have a firm version of the same toothbrush:  [[ASIN:B00SIG344W BmBu Natural ToothBrush &amp;#x2605; Firm Bristle &amp;#x2605; Made with High Quality, Sustainably Grown Bamboo &amp;#x2605; Biodegradable Packaging]]</li>
            <li> I Freakin&#x27; LOVE the Bmbu toothbrush! I highly recommend itðŸ˜„!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this brush, but the bristles are just too firm.</li>
            <li> This is an earth friendly artisanal toothbrush. The green bristles and bamboo epitomize the fact that this product is unique when you pick it up for the first time. Compared to other bamboo toothbrushes in its class, this feels superior, and I have no problem giving it 5 stars. Quality wise I&#x27;d expect to find this as a complimentary gift in a very exotic high end hotel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this the bar-none best toothbrush in existence? No. There are many excellent rotating electric toothbrushes that sell on Amazon for a 100+ dollars that I actually prefer. --&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HWS9GG/ref&#x3D;as_li_tl?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;camp&#x3D;1789&amp;creative&#x3D;390957&amp;creativeASIN&#x3D;B002HWS9GG&amp;linkCode&#x3D;as2&amp;tag&#x3D;deal0fb5-20&amp;linkId&#x3D;J2NASADGOIWANSDE\\&quot;&gt;Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Floss Action Precision 5000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush (packaging may vary)&amp;lt;/a&gt;&amp;lt;img src&#x3D;\\&quot;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t&#x3D;deal0fb5-20&amp;l&#x3D;as2&amp;o&#x3D;1&amp;a&#x3D;B002HWS9GG&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For 6 bucks though the quality of this toothbrush is really worth it.</li>
            <li> I am using this toothbrush to ween myself off of my longtime Colgate 360 extra-soft toothbrush.  so far, so good.  this is a great toothbrush with soft bristles.  fully recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit*** definitely not my fave toothbrush anymore. bristles get harder and stiffer over time</li>
            <li> these are really nice brushes. they are light, have the ultrasoft bristles that my dentist has asked me to use (to avoid making grooves in my teeth from brushing too hard), and i like the countour of both the bristles and the handle. i have to, respectfully, disagree with the person who gave this product a two-star review because of multiple pictures of the three-pack. there are pictures of both individual brushes as well as the three-pack and it is clear that from this page that you must select either the single or three-pack option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;by the way, my kids (8 and 10) love them too.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush is great! Been using it for a week now, and don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever buy something else.</li>
            <li> I love my new toothbrush! The bristles are pretty soft, but not ridiculously so. Just perfect!</li>
            <li> Should have bought firm</li>
            <li> I love the design and feel. The bristles are just right.</li>
            <li> We received two bamboo brushes very quickly after ordering. I used mine immediately and was quite pleased.  It has a good feel and does a good job of brushing my teeth, with the added bonus of being made from a rapidly growing grass rather than from a petroleum product that may never break down.</li>
