            <li>The smell is fab, too :)</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The moisture lasts longer than any over-the-counter lotion I&#x27;ve tried, and works better for my KP than any lotion to boot.</li>

            <li>I love the smell - smells like brown sugar.</li>

            <li>so I will buy more</li>
            <li>Buy this product! :-)</li>
            <li>This works better for us.  </li>
            <li>I Love the feel of this on my skin</li>
            <li>LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I love all of Alba&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite body oils</li>
            <li>I love this oil.  </li>
            <li>This oil smells great and moisturizes my skin really well.  </li>
            <li>I come to realize Aamazon is over charging for most of their stuff.</li>
            <li>Be sure to google your product of interest before making your purchase.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t have to wear lotion at all, but overall, a great product from a trustworthy company!</li>
            <li>so you&#x27;re more informed.</li>
            <li>My skin looks so healthy</li>
            <li>so there&#x27;s no greasy shine or excess oil sitting on top of your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A great product and the shipping was fast can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
            <li>also love the smell of it</li>
            <li>It almost reminds me of Hawaii or light beach fragrance!</li>
            <li>argan oil works better..</li>
            <li>This is very nice and has a nice soft sent to it as well.  </li>
            <li>Works great for massages... and other uses lol.</li>
            <li>and my husband doesn&#x27;t think it smells too feminine, sweet but nutty (kind of like my husband-</li>
            <li>It woul be nice to have a full ingredient list</li>
            <li>, is super moisturizing and has a handy lid that will allow you to control the flow of product, rather than having it all gush out.</li>
            <li>This body oil is PERFECT for giving a massage, or just putting on dry skin after a shower.  </li>
            <li>But this product could be better if it was more of a body oil spray because a light squeeze brings you a lot of oil on your palm.  </li>
            <li>While yes, it has a nice feel and quality and smell, you can buy sunflower oil for much cheaper, from honest dealers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, I still want to try some pure kukui nut oil; it&#x27;s supposed to be pretty great all on its own.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s paraben free and not tested on animals!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I am pleased to find that I do enjoy this oil.</li>
            <li>After reading most of the review on this product I decided to order it even though many had said that it smelled too sweet.  </li>
            <li>This is a great oil for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This oil has a lovely, light fragrance.  </li>
            <li>So much better than using cheap lotion and feeds your skin the way you want it to.</li>
            <li>Smells so good and is very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>What I love about this oil is that it&#x27;s a happy medium between a really greasy/slick feeling oil (like mineral oil) and a dryer oil (like argan oil) that absorbs right away</li>
            <li>It is great for making your skin soft and gives it a light shimmer for night time.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell, great for moisturizing the entire body,</li>
            <li>Easy to travel with size.  </li>
            <li>and I get ashy very quickly</li>
            <li>I put this on in the shower and it absorbs nicely, leaving my skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li>It smells really strongly of yummy coconut.</li>
            <li>Scent isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s strong.  </li>
            <li>This oil is very light, and soaks into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena Sesame Oil is great, but I prefer this one; a bit richer yet seems to soak in better, and I enjoy the scent immensely.</li>
            <li>the plus side, this body oil has a soft, pleasant scent that makes me want to keep applying it all day.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and works better than lotion to keep my skin moist.</li>
            <li>This is a nice and fragrant massage oil and certainly gives hint of a Tropical paradise.  </li>
            <li>This oil is light that is doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film on your skin.  </li>
            <li>it makes your skin smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cruelty free product by Alba, so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always on the lookout for body oils that have light scents.  </li>
            <li>This Kukui Nut oil is so great I&#x27;ve bought it for several of my friends and they become fans too.</li>
            <li>Great for summer beach time and definitely a must for winter skin.</li>
            <li>The smell fades a bit and has a light fragrance.</li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic, sort of like a tropical smell.</li>
            <li>This massage oil is fantastic.</li>
            <li>The kukui oil is light and sensuous.  </li>
            <li>It feels fantastic when applied and smells divine.</li>
            <li>In my opinion the consistency is light.</li>
            <li>Like the light fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It has a light scent that doesn&#x27;t linger and the oil absorbs well</li>
            <li>W at Amazon to express my concern, he told me I was free to buy from the competitor instead.</li>
            <li>I smooth on some of this kukui nut oil</li>
            <li>Just grabbed my second bottle of this stuff, it is great for all types of uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Product works really well-super moisturizing, smells nice.</li>
            <li>It smells good and my body feels soft.</li>
            <li>Oily at first, it absorbs quickly, leaving a nice feel and look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>BURNS GO AWAY, HELPS WITH DRY SKIN, SMELLS GREAT (VERY MILD BUT PLEASING SMELL)</li>
            <li>Love it, fast absorbing, nice easy smell.</li>
            <li>This oil smells fantastic and does a great job of combatting the dry skin we fight in the winter.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the smell of this stuff, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that since I started using it my skin is softer and healthier, and my hair has never been softer.</li>
            <li>so it does a great job of moisturizing for long periods of time.</li>
            <li>Works great, lasts long and smells yummy.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff so much!  </li>
            <li>The packaging is straightforward and the product lasts.</li>
            <li>Subtle but wonderful smell, but not too strong.  </li>
            <li>I suppose that I assumed that the oil itself would not be easily and quickly absorbed by the skin.</li>
            <li>Great for massages, tanning or dry winters.</li>
            <li>Amazing smell and makes the skin sooooo soft!</li>
            <li>and wow this is SO much better!</li>
            <li>Light, Fresh, No Residue, Quickly absorbed!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sensitive to smells, they can trigger migrains, so I can&#x27;t wear purfume or a lot of scented lotions which can be a bummer when a girl just wants to smell nice!</li>
            <li>This is a great product but the reason it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars is I feel I must use more than usual to spread on my skin.</li>
            <li>Periodically both products are offered at more reasonable prices; that&#x27;s when I stock up.</li>
            <li>Also, it didn&#x27;t really smell like Kukui Nut, it smells more like cotton candy.  </li>
            <li>I love this so much that I use it for everything.  </li>
            <li>Love it so much the smell alone is divine.</li>
            <li>Not a bad smell, but</li>
            <li>remains pretty strong throughout the day, so I can&#x27;t use perfume on the days I wear</li>
            <li>The oil is just the right consistency and gets absorbed easily.</li>
            <li>Excellent for massage, and we like the subtle fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product, the biggest bonus is that it can be used for so many different things.  </li>
            <li>I used while pregnant not a one stretch mark.</li>
            <li>It melts into the skin, but not too quickly.</li>
            <li>It will heat up to body temperature quickly.</li>
            <li>I got this oil because I am pregnant and wanted to soothe my itchy growing skin around by belly and breasts.</li>
            <li>Seller shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>does not absorb that quickly for me...</li>
            <li>I use this oil for daily moisturizing and love it, not too heavy and the smell is awesome.</li>
            <li>The good news is the smell does not stay for long.</li>
            <li>I will only use them now if the price is right, after searching for the best possible deal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an overpowering smell; and, it doesn&#x27;t really smell like a strong suntanning oil.  </li>
            <li>and I find that it works the best for me with long lasting moisture.</li>
            <li>I use it every day and find it less oily than most body oils, but equally effective.</li>
            <li>This is a nice oil that works well for back rubs (and if I&#x27;m lucky it transitions to front-rubs).</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, and manages to be lightweight and super moisturizing at the same time.  </li>
            <li>It leaves you smelling sweet and very, very sticky.  </li>
            <li>; reviews, they sound like the company paid for the review, but in this case, no, I&#x27;m not getting paid, this really did help me.</li>
            <li>I know professional therapists who use, and love, this oil.</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to fragrances, you might not like it, but I love it.  </li>
            <li>A bit pricey but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>Basically after I rinse at the end of my shower I apply a few drops to my arms and legs, smooth it in, and am good to go for the day.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and am sensitive to perfumes in lotions, as well as having fairly severe keratosis pilaris.</li>
            <li>this is quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li>IT IS ECONOMICAL  TO USE</li>
            <li>Works exceptional well for personal intimate use as well as a body massage oil.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s affordable in comparison to other oils and is a good value at 8.5 ounces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I put it on right after the shower</li>
            <li>I put my oil in a spray bottle and leave it right in the shower.  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on my legs right after shaving, and it doesn&#x27;t sting or burn.  </li>
            <li>I will make sure I pursue this further and have a prominent media source do a live coverage exposing amazon.</li>
            <li>I ordered this and NOW sweet almond body oil at the same time to compare them, but I like the NOW body oil better.</li>
            <li>Not too greasy, smells amazing, priced just right, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and exactly what I wanted - Thanks!</li>
            <li>The label calls it a kukui nut body oil, but ingredients show it is really a blend of tropical nut oils, consisting of sunflower, aleurites moluccana (kukui nut), coconut, macadamia, linseed and sweet almond</li>
            <li>It offers twice the amount for about the same price as Alba Botanica, and also has a nice light scent.  </li>
            <li>My experience has been that it wasn&#x27;t as much too sweet as it was too sticky.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and leaves skin feeling soft, clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>This might actually be a great product, I don&#x27;t know because I can&#x27;t get past the smell.</li>
            <li>but it does get absorbed pretty fast...not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>It takes a little more product than baby oil, but it seems like it moisturizes much better.</li>
            <li>typically don&#x27;t like sweet fragrances, but this one is different--a very light, clean smell.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell strong, its a subtle scent that isn&#x27;t really feminine or masculine- kind of a warm nutty smell.  </li>
            <li>The scent of this oil is not too strong when used in the bath or directly onto the body.</li>
            <li>I would use this more frequently, but I&#x27;ve found that it doesn&#x27;t sink in as much as lotion and the scent</li>
            <li>/&gt;The best way to use this is after you&#x27;ve dried off which is such a hassle for me.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll probably enjoy using it, leaves the skin very soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>We were very pleased to find such a good deal on a hard to find product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was nice smelling, but a little thick.&lt;br /&gt;Probably good for moisturizing dry skin.</li>
            <li>I regularly use it to moisturize my arms which is always dry and flaky and it does a very good job which lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li>It also creates a nice, subtle sheen when it&#x27;s soaked in - leaving my skin healthy and moisturized without being oily or greasy (when soaked in.)</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and it smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li>This product has twice the volume for half the cost of the other oil I was using and really liked, but when I found this I switched for good.</li>
            <li>Not greasy and leaves my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to others! :)</li>
            <li>By the time I&#x27;m ready to get dressed the oil has absorbed and not oily residue on my clothes.  </li>
            <li>and this did not break my back out at all.  :)</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t guarantee you&#x27;ll get the same result, but many stores sell this; if you find it, try the tester there and see if you like it, or risk buying a bottle.</li>
            <li>We have a hot tub and after the tub and shower, this gives her skin all it needs to be refreshed and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I can not wait to order more in the future.  </li>
            <li>I also use this w/ my hot massage</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick and smells great.</li>
            <li>IT HELPS  MY SKIN FEEL NATURAL AND MOIST AND SMOOTH  </li>
            <li>This kukui nut oil smells fabulous and keeps my family&#x27;s skin soft.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be ordering more this when I run out.</li>
            <li>It smells great, though the smell doesn&#x27;t last a long time.</li>
            <li>This is a good product.wife loves it as a massage oil and a everyday moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My wife and I regularly use it to massage each other and it does not have any funky odor, it smells nice and it is very light to the skin.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite moisturizer… it makes my skin very soft and it smells divinely natural.  </li>
            <li>I put it on right after a shower and put my robe on to finish getting ready.  </li>
            <li>Shipping could have been a bit more secure since a little bit spilled out.</li>
            <li>Your skin will be soft and smelling wonderful and you won&#x27;t go back to other body oils or lotions!</li>
            <li>They just smell nice and feel nice, plus they aren&#x27;t horribly expensive.</li>
            <li>The oil leaves my skin soft but not oily as it is absorbed in quickly; however much is not needed to cover a large area.</li>
            <li>that long with once-a-week use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this oil and adore the brown sugar smell; it&#x27;s fragrant, without being too cloying.  </li>
            <li>Works better than prescription medication for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>It soaks in nicely and leaves my skin looking slightly dewy and not at all greasy.</li>
            <li>Since switching to the oil cleansing method my skin has went from severely oily and irritated to smooth normal and soft.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a tad thick, but it smells really pleasant.  </li>
            <li>I use it everyday and love that it is organic!</li>
            <li>This really helps with my dry skin and it smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>After using this product my skin smells amazing (like white chocolate in my opinion), and is incredibly soft and smooth all day long!</li>
            <li>I have also used it on my face at night if I have had too much sun.  </li>
            <li>and it really does work</li>
            <li>Too much oil.  </li>
            <li>Very lite, not greasy.</li>
            <li>This is an ingredient in some of our handcrafted bath products, and we will get much use from it.</li>
            <li>I purchased the product and saw this one as promising.</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s made from real oils</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s synthetic not from the real nut.</li>
            <li>However, I found it to be too oily on the skin and didn&#x27;t really soak in even throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It really soaks into your skin.</li>
            <li>Works very well without being too &#x27;oily&#x27;, if that makes sense...</li>
            <li>It is much easier to grant her wish with the use of a body oil.</li>
            <li>Really treats your hair and body.</li>
            <li>It dries fast and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Alba Botanical products for about five or six years, and really like every product of theirs I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>rub it on faster and harder:)</li>
            <li>Smoothes without leaving too much oil.  </li>
            <li>I really like this.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs really fast without feeling greasy (unless you put waay too much on.</li>
            <li>It feels very luxurious.  </li>
            <li>meaning it doesn&#x27;t stay oily and absorbs fast on skin &amp; hair.</li>
            <li>And for the price it&#x27;s a real bargain that  you can not beat</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a really safe,organic oil.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a much lighter weight massage oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it feels so much betta.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Lasts a long time, Love it, can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>It has a really pleasant &amp;#34;nutty&amp;#34; fragrance that I just love, but it&#x27;s very heavy and doesn&#x27;t glide on as well as most other body oils I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>Those results are soft pretty skin.</li>
            <li>Love the slight scent of coconut.</li>
            <li>The actual bottle says Fragrance(parfum) which most likely  indicates a petroleum synthesized fragrance .</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin soft and the smell is so light and just enough, not over powering.  </li>
            <li>This is a blend of seven oils with sunflower oil as the main ingredient.</li>
            <li>Last night, after I washed up, I slathered it all over my face and neck, and my skin actually looks better this morning.</li>
            <li>I noticed the main ingredient is a vegetable oil.  </li>
            <li>It would just make the red areas no longer scaly white color, but more of a translucent scaly color.</li>
            <li>Decent product</li>
            <li>The main ingredient is sunflower oil.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this body oil for years and highly recommend it to anyone needing a high quality product.</li>
            <li>Has a nice, very natural smell that&#x27;s not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it for everyone -babies to elders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Mine didn&#x27;t smell like much but like the fact it&#x27;s not oily and organic using it for my 4 year old skin is soft but wished it smelled like the reviews said but doesn&#x27;t fast shipping</li>
            <li>I Really like this product, it gives me the natural glow that i want w/o leaving a greasy feel.</li>
            <li>Why not include a few massage tips on the bottle or enclosure, dare to offer more value?</li>
            <li>May dry a little more quickly then desired, but</li>
            <li>I actually got this item for FREE from Amazon after using combined shipping, because it turned out to be the SAME price as buying TWO items</li>
            <li>The subtle warm smell of coffee and vanilla is intoxicating.  </li>
            <li>I like using body oils verses lotions and body creams because my skin is always super dry, even in the summer time</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>More words necessary couldn&#x27;t find any other words!</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful and keeps my skin from feeling dry during the cold winter months.  </li>
            <li>The online product description list of ingredients has \\&quot;botanical fragrance\\&quot; at the end, implying fragrance from a natural source.  </li>
            <li>soft the scent is so dreamy.</li>
            <li>and it leaves their skin soft, and refreshed.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin really soft without leaving me feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>This body oil does leave your skin soft, but towards the end of the day, my skin looks ashy.  </li>
            <li>The 3 stars is because it does leave the skin soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>They will leave your skin feeling soft and supple all day long.&lt;br</li>
            <li>wow -</li>
            <li>The oil absorbs well into the skin leaving it soft.</li>
            <li>All natural stuff...</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have had no issues with this oil.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft even in the winter.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin soft all day, without being oily.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend loves the way my skin smells and how soft it is when I use this.  </li>
            <li>It is a little heavier than the average body oil but blends in nicely.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d think it&#x27;d be the main one, since it&#x27;s the only one listed on the front of the label.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>It also smells really nice, but very subtle smell</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little sweet but not too vanilla-ish.</li>
            <li>Even plain coconut oil works better than this stuff on my dry skin.</li>
            <li>Seems to calm down skin problems.</li>
            <li>It sinks in fast and really helps my dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I cannot see this being heavy on someone with oiler skin as it has such a light feel.</li>
            <li>I first thought it was simply due to the oils used, but there is fragrance added.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a marked improvement in my skin condition.</li>
            <li>so my feet are extra soft.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and this is great for those dry months, especially in winter, when your body just needs a little something extra.</li>
            <li>The smell is nutty but neither pleasant nor unpleasant.</li>
            <li>Original Bath &amp; Body Oil, 16 oz]] which is hard to find, but is sold on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product based on the reviews here, so I don&#x27;t really have any other body oils to compare it with.  </li>
            <li>We have been using massage oil from Bath and Body Works, but that smell is way too strong and the residual oily feeling is not pleasant.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also light enough that if you give a massage, the person doesn&#x27;t feel like they have to take a shower to wash off all the thick oil on their body.  </li>
            <li>The difference in my skin was immediately apparent after only one use of this body oil.</li>
            <li>The smell is delicate, sweet and nutty.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I made the right decision.  </li>
            <li>This keeps my skin soft and supply which is a challenge in the dry air of the Southwest.</li>
            <li>I have very, very dry skin that is eczema prone &amp; responds well to natural products.</li>

            <li> Love it.</li>

            <li> I Love the feel of this on my skin</li>
            <li> LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I love all of Alba&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite body oils</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  </li>
            <li> This oil smells great and moisturizes my skin really well.  </li>
            <li> I come to realize Aamazon is over charging for most of their stuff.</li>
            <li> Be sure to google your product of interest before making your purchase.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t have to wear lotion at all, but overall, a great product from a trustworthy company!</li>
            <li> so you&#x27;re more informed.</li>
            <li> My skin looks so healthy</li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s no greasy shine or excess oil sitting on top of your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A great product and the shipping was fast can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
            <li> also love the smell of it</li>
            <li> It almost reminds me of Hawaii or light beach fragrance!</li>
            <li> argan oil works better..</li>
            <li> This is very nice and has a nice soft sent to it as well.  </li>
            <li> Works great for massages... and other uses lol.</li>
            <li> and my husband doesn&#x27;t think it smells too feminine, sweet but nutty (kind of like my husband-</li>
            <li> It woul be nice to have a full ingredient list</li>
            <li> , is super moisturizing and has a handy lid that will allow you to control the flow of product, rather than having it all gush out.</li>
            <li> This body oil is PERFECT for giving a massage, or just putting on dry skin after a shower.  </li>
            <li> But this product could be better if it was more of a body oil spray because a light squeeze brings you a lot of oil on your palm.  </li>
            <li> While yes, it has a nice feel and quality and smell, you can buy sunflower oil for much cheaper, from honest dealers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I still want to try some pure kukui nut oil; it&#x27;s supposed to be pretty great all on its own.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s paraben free and not tested on animals!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I am pleased to find that I do enjoy this oil.</li>
            <li> After reading most of the review on this product I decided to order it even though many had said that it smelled too sweet.  </li>
            <li> This is a great oil for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This oil has a lovely, light fragrance.  </li>
            <li> So much better than using cheap lotion and feeds your skin the way you want it to.</li>
            <li> Smells so good and is very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> What I love about this oil is that it&#x27;s a happy medium between a really greasy/slick feeling oil (like mineral oil) and a dryer oil (like argan oil) that absorbs right away</li>
            <li> It is great for making your skin soft and gives it a light shimmer for night time.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell, great for moisturizing the entire body,</li>
            <li> Easy to travel with size.  </li>
            <li> and I get ashy very quickly</li>
            <li> I put this on in the shower and it absorbs nicely, leaving my skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li> It smells really strongly of yummy coconut.</li>
            <li> Scent isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s strong.  </li>
            <li> This oil is very light, and soaks into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Sesame Oil is great, but I prefer this one; a bit richer yet seems to soak in better, and I enjoy the scent immensely.</li>
            <li> the plus side, this body oil has a soft, pleasant scent that makes me want to keep applying it all day.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and works better than lotion to keep my skin moist.</li>
            <li> This is a nice and fragrant massage oil and certainly gives hint of a Tropical paradise.  </li>
            <li> This oil is light that is doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film on your skin.  </li>
            <li> it makes your skin smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cruelty free product by Alba, so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always on the lookout for body oils that have light scents.  </li>
            <li> This Kukui Nut oil is so great I&#x27;ve bought it for several of my friends and they become fans too.</li>
            <li> Great for summer beach time and definitely a must for winter skin.</li>
            <li> The smell fades a bit and has a light fragrance.</li>
            <li> The smell is fantastic, sort of like a tropical smell.</li>
            <li> This massage oil is fantastic.</li>
            <li> The kukui oil is light and sensuous.  </li>
            <li> It feels fantastic when applied and smells divine.</li>
            <li> In my opinion the consistency is light.</li>
            <li> Like the light fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It has a light scent that doesn&#x27;t linger and the oil absorbs well</li>
            <li> W at Amazon to express my concern, he told me I was free to buy from the competitor instead.</li>
            <li> I smooth on some of this kukui nut oil</li>
            <li> Just grabbed my second bottle of this stuff, it is great for all types of uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Product works really well-super moisturizing, smells nice.</li>
            <li> It smells good and my body feels soft.</li>
            <li> Oily at first, it absorbs quickly, leaving a nice feel and look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> BURNS GO AWAY, HELPS WITH DRY SKIN, SMELLS GREAT (VERY MILD BUT PLEASING SMELL)</li>
            <li> Love it, fast absorbing, nice easy smell.</li>
            <li> This oil smells fantastic and does a great job of combatting the dry skin we fight in the winter.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell of this stuff, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that since I started using it my skin is softer and healthier, and my hair has never been softer.</li>
            <li> so it does a great job of moisturizing for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> Works great, lasts long and smells yummy.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff so much!  </li>
            <li> The packaging is straightforward and the product lasts.</li>
            <li> Subtle but wonderful smell, but not too strong.  </li>
            <li> I suppose that I assumed that the oil itself would not be easily and quickly absorbed by the skin.</li>
            <li> Great for massages, tanning or dry winters.</li>
            <li> Amazing smell and makes the skin sooooo soft!</li>
            <li> and wow this is SO much better!</li>
            <li> Light, Fresh, No Residue, Quickly absorbed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to smells, they can trigger migrains, so I can&#x27;t wear purfume or a lot of scented lotions which can be a bummer when a girl just wants to smell nice!</li>
            <li> This is a great product but the reason it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars is I feel I must use more than usual to spread on my skin.</li>
            <li> Periodically both products are offered at more reasonable prices; that&#x27;s when I stock up.</li>
            <li> Also, it didn&#x27;t really smell like Kukui Nut, it smells more like cotton candy.  </li>
            <li> I love this so much that I use it for everything.  </li>
            <li> Love it so much the smell alone is divine.</li>
            <li> Not a bad smell, but</li>
            <li> remains pretty strong throughout the day, so I can&#x27;t use perfume on the days I wear</li>
            <li> The oil is just the right consistency and gets absorbed easily.</li>
            <li> Excellent for massage, and we like the subtle fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, the biggest bonus is that it can be used for so many different things.  </li>
            <li> I used while pregnant not a one stretch mark.</li>
            <li> It melts into the skin, but not too quickly.</li>
            <li> It will heat up to body temperature quickly.</li>
            <li> I got this oil because I am pregnant and wanted to soothe my itchy growing skin around by belly and breasts.</li>
            <li> Seller shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> does not absorb that quickly for me...</li>
            <li> I use this oil for daily moisturizing and love it, not too heavy and the smell is awesome.</li>
            <li> The good news is the smell does not stay for long.</li>
            <li> I will only use them now if the price is right, after searching for the best possible deal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an overpowering smell; and, it doesn&#x27;t really smell like a strong suntanning oil.  </li>
            <li> and I find that it works the best for me with long lasting moisture.</li>
            <li> I use it every day and find it less oily than most body oils, but equally effective.</li>
            <li> This is a nice oil that works well for back rubs (and if I&#x27;m lucky it transitions to front-rubs).</li>
            <li> It smells amazing, and manages to be lightweight and super moisturizing at the same time.  </li>
            <li> It leaves you smelling sweet and very, very sticky.  </li>
            <li> ; reviews, they sound like the company paid for the review, but in this case, no, I&#x27;m not getting paid, this really did help me.</li>
            <li> I know professional therapists who use, and love, this oil.</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to fragrances, you might not like it, but I love it.  </li>
            <li> A bit pricey but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Basically after I rinse at the end of my shower I apply a few drops to my arms and legs, smooth it in, and am good to go for the day.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and am sensitive to perfumes in lotions, as well as having fairly severe keratosis pilaris.</li>
            <li> this is quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li> IT IS ECONOMICAL  TO USE</li>
            <li> Works exceptional well for personal intimate use as well as a body massage oil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s affordable in comparison to other oils and is a good value at 8.5 ounces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I put it on right after the shower</li>
            <li> I put my oil in a spray bottle and leave it right in the shower.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on my legs right after shaving, and it doesn&#x27;t sting or burn.  </li>
            <li> I will make sure I pursue this further and have a prominent media source do a live coverage exposing amazon.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and NOW sweet almond body oil at the same time to compare them, but I like the NOW body oil better.</li>
            <li> Not too greasy, smells amazing, priced just right, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and exactly what I wanted - Thanks!</li>
            <li> The label calls it a kukui nut body oil, but ingredients show it is really a blend of tropical nut oils, consisting of sunflower, aleurites moluccana (kukui nut), coconut, macadamia, linseed and sweet almond</li>
            <li> It offers twice the amount for about the same price as Alba Botanica, and also has a nice light scent.  </li>
            <li> My experience has been that it wasn&#x27;t as much too sweet as it was too sticky.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and leaves skin feeling soft, clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> This might actually be a great product, I don&#x27;t know because I can&#x27;t get past the smell.</li>
            <li> but it does get absorbed pretty fast...not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> It takes a little more product than baby oil, but it seems like it moisturizes much better.</li>
            <li> typically don&#x27;t like sweet fragrances, but this one is different--a very light, clean smell.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell strong, its a subtle scent that isn&#x27;t really feminine or masculine- kind of a warm nutty smell.  </li>
            <li> The scent of this oil is not too strong when used in the bath or directly onto the body.</li>
            <li> I would use this more frequently, but I&#x27;ve found that it doesn&#x27;t sink in as much as lotion and the scent</li>
            <li> /&gt;The best way to use this is after you&#x27;ve dried off which is such a hassle for me.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll probably enjoy using it, leaves the skin very soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> We were very pleased to find such a good deal on a hard to find product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was nice smelling, but a little thick.&lt;br /&gt;Probably good for moisturizing dry skin.</li>
            <li> I regularly use it to moisturize my arms which is always dry and flaky and it does a very good job which lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li> It also creates a nice, subtle sheen when it&#x27;s soaked in - leaving my skin healthy and moisturized without being oily or greasy (when soaked in.)</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li> This product has twice the volume for half the cost of the other oil I was using and really liked, but when I found this I switched for good.</li>
            <li> Not greasy and leaves my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to others! :)</li>
            <li> By the time I&#x27;m ready to get dressed the oil has absorbed and not oily residue on my clothes.  </li>
            <li> and this did not break my back out at all.  :)</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t guarantee you&#x27;ll get the same result, but many stores sell this; if you find it, try the tester there and see if you like it, or risk buying a bottle.</li>
            <li> We have a hot tub and after the tub and shower, this gives her skin all it needs to be refreshed and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I can not wait to order more in the future.  </li>
            <li> I also use this w/ my hot massage</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and smells great.</li>
            <li> IT HELPS  MY SKIN FEEL NATURAL AND MOIST AND SMOOTH  </li>
            <li> This kukui nut oil smells fabulous and keeps my family&#x27;s skin soft.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be ordering more this when I run out.</li>
            <li> It smells great, though the smell doesn&#x27;t last a long time.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.wife loves it as a massage oil and a everyday moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My wife and I regularly use it to massage each other and it does not have any funky odor, it smells nice and it is very light to the skin.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite moisturizer… it makes my skin very soft and it smells divinely natural.  </li>
            <li> I put it on right after a shower and put my robe on to finish getting ready.  </li>
            <li> Shipping could have been a bit more secure since a little bit spilled out.</li>
            <li> Your skin will be soft and smelling wonderful and you won&#x27;t go back to other body oils or lotions!</li>
            <li> They just smell nice and feel nice, plus they aren&#x27;t horribly expensive.</li>
            <li> The oil leaves my skin soft but not oily as it is absorbed in quickly; however much is not needed to cover a large area.</li>
            <li> that long with once-a-week use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this oil and adore the brown sugar smell; it&#x27;s fragrant, without being too cloying.  </li>
            <li> Works better than prescription medication for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> It soaks in nicely and leaves my skin looking slightly dewy and not at all greasy.</li>
            <li> Since switching to the oil cleansing method my skin has went from severely oily and irritated to smooth normal and soft.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tad thick, but it smells really pleasant.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday and love that it is organic!</li>
            <li> This really helps with my dry skin and it smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> After using this product my skin smells amazing (like white chocolate in my opinion), and is incredibly soft and smooth all day long!</li>
            <li> I have also used it on my face at night if I have had too much sun.  </li>
            <li> and it really does work</li>
            <li> Too much oil.  </li>
            <li> Very lite, not greasy.</li>
            <li> This is an ingredient in some of our handcrafted bath products, and we will get much use from it.</li>
            <li> I purchased the product and saw this one as promising.</li>
            <li> The price was reasonable</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s made from real oils</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s synthetic not from the real nut.</li>
            <li> However, I found it to be too oily on the skin and didn&#x27;t really soak in even throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It really soaks into your skin.</li>
            <li> Works very well without being too &#x27;oily&#x27;, if that makes sense...</li>
            <li> It is much easier to grant her wish with the use of a body oil.</li>
            <li> Really treats your hair and body.</li>
            <li> It dries fast and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Alba Botanical products for about five or six years, and really like every product of theirs I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> rub it on faster and harder:)</li>
            <li> Smoothes without leaving too much oil.  </li>
            <li> I really like this.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs really fast without feeling greasy (unless you put waay too much on.</li>
            <li> It feels very luxurious.  </li>
            <li> meaning it doesn&#x27;t stay oily and absorbs fast on skin &amp; hair.</li>
            <li> And for the price it&#x27;s a real bargain that  you can not beat</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a really safe,organic oil.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a much lighter weight massage oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it feels so much betta.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time, Love it, can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> It has a really pleasant &amp;#34;nutty&amp;#34; fragrance that I just love, but it&#x27;s very heavy and doesn&#x27;t glide on as well as most other body oils I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> Those results are soft pretty skin.</li>
            <li> Love the slight scent of coconut.</li>
            <li> The actual bottle says Fragrance(parfum) which most likely  indicates a petroleum synthesized fragrance .</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin soft and the smell is so light and just enough, not over powering.  </li>
            <li> This is a blend of seven oils with sunflower oil as the main ingredient.</li>
            <li> Last night, after I washed up, I slathered it all over my face and neck, and my skin actually looks better this morning.</li>
            <li> I noticed the main ingredient is a vegetable oil.  </li>
            <li> It would just make the red areas no longer scaly white color, but more of a translucent scaly color.</li>
            <li> Decent product</li>
            <li> The main ingredient is sunflower oil.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this body oil for years and highly recommend it to anyone needing a high quality product.</li>
            <li> Has a nice, very natural smell that&#x27;s not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it for everyone -babies to elders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Mine didn&#x27;t smell like much but like the fact it&#x27;s not oily and organic using it for my 4 year old skin is soft but wished it smelled like the reviews said but doesn&#x27;t fast shipping</li>
            <li> I Really like this product, it gives me the natural glow that i want w/o leaving a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> Why not include a few massage tips on the bottle or enclosure, dare to offer more value?</li>
            <li> May dry a little more quickly then desired, but</li>
            <li> I actually got this item for FREE from Amazon after using combined shipping, because it turned out to be the SAME price as buying TWO items</li>
            <li> The subtle warm smell of coffee and vanilla is intoxicating.  </li>
            <li> I like using body oils verses lotions and body creams because my skin is always super dry, even in the summer time</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> More words necessary couldn&#x27;t find any other words!</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and keeps my skin from feeling dry during the cold winter months.  </li>
            <li> The online product description list of ingredients has \\&quot;botanical fragrance\\&quot; at the end, implying fragrance from a natural source.  </li>
            <li> soft the scent is so dreamy.</li>
            <li> and it leaves their skin soft, and refreshed.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin really soft without leaving me feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> This body oil does leave your skin soft, but towards the end of the day, my skin looks ashy.  </li>
            <li> The 3 stars is because it does leave the skin soft.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> They will leave your skin feeling soft and supple all day long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> wow -</li>
            <li> The oil absorbs well into the skin leaving it soft.</li>
            <li> All natural stuff...</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have had no issues with this oil.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft even in the winter.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin soft all day, without being oily.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves the way my skin smells and how soft it is when I use this.  </li>
            <li> It is a little heavier than the average body oil but blends in nicely.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d think it&#x27;d be the main one, since it&#x27;s the only one listed on the front of the label.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> It also smells really nice, but very subtle smell</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little sweet but not too vanilla-ish.</li>
            <li> Even plain coconut oil works better than this stuff on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Seems to calm down skin problems.</li>
            <li> It sinks in fast and really helps my dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I cannot see this being heavy on someone with oiler skin as it has such a light feel.</li>
            <li> I first thought it was simply due to the oils used, but there is fragrance added.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a marked improvement in my skin condition.</li>
            <li> so my feet are extra soft.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and this is great for those dry months, especially in winter, when your body just needs a little something extra.</li>
            <li> The smell is nutty but neither pleasant nor unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Original Bath &amp; Body Oil, 16 oz]] which is hard to find, but is sold on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the reviews here, so I don&#x27;t really have any other body oils to compare it with.  </li>
            <li> We have been using massage oil from Bath and Body Works, but that smell is way too strong and the residual oily feeling is not pleasant.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also light enough that if you give a massage, the person doesn&#x27;t feel like they have to take a shower to wash off all the thick oil on their body.  </li>
            <li> The difference in my skin was immediately apparent after only one use of this body oil.</li>
            <li> The smell is delicate, sweet and nutty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I made the right decision.  </li>
            <li> This keeps my skin soft and supply which is a challenge in the dry air of the Southwest.</li>
            <li> I have very, very dry skin that is eczema prone &amp; responds well to natural products.</li>
            <li> I use it before I go outside to tan, but it can be really messy if you use too much - use only a couple of drops, it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Though,I won&#x27;t have to buy   it often,because it last such a long time.</li>
            <li> The bottle won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> After using it for about a week and a half, I have noticed a definite improvement in my KP- my arms and legs are smoother and much softer, as well as looking less blotchy and red.</li>
            <li> I use it daily on my legs which tend to dry out and crack.  </li>
            <li> This with the body scrub is the only thing that works for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my husband&#x27;s coarse curly hair, for scalp massage and dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Not a fan of applying body oils out of the shower, they are harder to maneuver around your skin and can also get messy fast.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and need the ultimate in softening and moisturizing products.</li>
            <li> so I like when an oil sticks around for little while before completely disappearing into my skin.</li>
            <li> At first, it was a disappointment because I thought I was getting pure kukui nut oil, but I guess that&#x27;s my fault for not doing my homework and looking up the ingredients.</li>
            <li> The 8.5 fluid ounces will last a long time too, as only a few drops are needed per arm, leg, etc.  </li>
            <li> so it can leave you feeling greasy for a long time.</li>
            <li> Wish I had found it long ago.</li>
            <li> Long lasting fragrance that promises to never clash with other lotions.</li>
            <li> Just like the more expensive versions but a lot cheaper!</li>
            <li> The benefits of body oil is extremely underrated in western cultures.</li>
            <li> The body oil leaks into the package everywhere with other ordered items since the cap of the bottle is open.</li>
            <li> It lasts for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this because my skin was dry even after putting body lotion on.</li>
            <li> We use it after every shower, it helps to replenishes oils and helps dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I recommend both to anyone with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that I have really dry skin</li>
            <li> I have dry skin that is prone to breakouts</li>
            <li> I use after a bath as a moisturizer, for a massage oil, and as a leave-in treatment for my hair when it gets dry.</li>
            <li> Yes, I would tell others to use this or dry skin</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve started using it when my skin gets really dry.</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely dry in the Winter</li>
            <li> if you one island boy or girl who moved to the continental US and now have dry and cracked (sometimes bleeding) skin, then you need some of this.  </li>
            <li> It is a dry oil</li>
            <li> , it has a very subtle nutty/flower smell that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm you, and it glides on skin with just the right amount of friction.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have noted, only a small amount of the oil is needed, and even with daily use a single bottle should last quite a while.</li>
            <li> When you tip it back, excess oil slides down the sides of the bottle and puddles around the bottom of the bottle</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no pleasant smell (almost no smell at all, really)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the same bottle of this oil for about two years, but because you only need a small amount of it each time you use it, it&#x27;s lasted me</li>
            <li> Before getting out of the shower to dry off, simply put a few drops in your hand (at a time) to moisturize your body.</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit to go along way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I only wish it was a little thicker</li>
            <li> Only half bottle left plus all the mess!</li>
            <li> I use  it everyday,and you only need a few drops each time.  </li>
            <li> Once I began to use it, it wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> After my shower, I like to apply the body oil while I&#x27;m still wet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably use it here and there (for the smell) until the bottle is empty, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Please be awake that this is not pure kukui nut oil</li>
            <li> it is NOT pure kukui oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am extremely leery of products that are devoid of crimps or seals.</li>
            <li> I really prefer the Johnson &amp; Johnson&#x27;s cocoa butter gel oil and notice a difference even 24 hours after using it so this Alba body oil was a disappointment when the next morning my elbows felt as dry as ever.</li>
            <li> , it is a blend with other ingredients.</li>
            <li> It might be from the hype of alba&#x27;s other products.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and this stuff smells like candy!</li>
            <li> This product is selling for $5.59 on other sites.</li>
            <li> This one is pretty mediocre.</li>
            <li> Would buy again and recommend to other buyers.  </li>
            <li> no forget da okole we often taken for granted, a little dab will do ya to prevent dry and chafing skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried olive oil (too heavy), apricot oil (feels heavy but doesn&#x27;t moisturize well), almond oil (my second-place oil) and coconut oil (not as moisturizing as I&#x27;d like) as my carrier oils but prefer the Alba Botanica Kukui Nut Oil above all of the others I have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost disappointed that the scent isn&#x27;t a little stronger just because I love how it smells.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the way the bottle is made to dispense the oil (small hole in the middle under a snap on cap) tends to leak a little bit.  </li>
            <li> Personally not worth the price,.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s why I bought it again, not to mention that the price had gone down.  </li>
            <li> The scent is not evident, but the moisturizing is!</li>
            <li> When I received this product,lid wasn&#x27;t tightened and half leaked in the box,.</li>
            <li> I had bought this oil previously</li>
            <li> Just rub a small amount on wet skin and towel dry as usual.</li>
            <li> This oil is about half the cost, does not assault your olfactory nerves, and does not leave you feeling like you have been swimming in an oil spill.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m black).</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells something like that, couldn&#x27;t really narrow it down.</li>
            <li> A little goes along way.</li>
            <li> this is an oil blend with a little kukui oil added.   </li>
            <li> SO LITTLE  </li>
            <li> BECAUSE  IT TAKES  A LITTLE  </li>
            <li> Its a little thicker than I thought it would be</li>
            <li> I read a review about Alba Kukui Nut Body Oil a few months ago and decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to waste a drop.  </li>
            <li> It comes out slowly, so it doesn&#x27;t leak all over the shower like other oils, but again, the smell is musky and of vanilla, which I do not like at all.</li>
            <li> Was tired of lotions for dry skin, so gave this a shot.</li>
            <li> If I put it on in the morning, it&#x27;ll cake up by mid-day and start to flake off my skin - super annoying and unattractive.</li>
            <li> The oil is a little too thick for me.  </li>
            <li> You need very   little for desired results.</li>
            <li> It absorbs very well into your skin and doesn&#x27;t have a bad odor either.</li>
            <li> I add to a small spray bottle and keep it with me to spritz on throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why</li>
            <li> Why girlfriend and I usually use baby oil.</li>
            <li> , he likes the smell (smells like waffles to him) but applying it how I usually do leaves me ashy by</li>
            <li> the less dirty uses, I got a back rub with and without this.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave a very heavy feeling like some oils can.</li>
            <li> I tend to shy away from lotions and creams with long words I can&#x27;t pronounce or need a some sort of degree in science to know what is in the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this hard to find body oil on my damp skin as soon as I&#x27;ve showered.  </li>
            <li> My daughter suffers from dandruff quite often - we decided to try rubbing the oil into her scalp and shampooing the next day.  </li>
            <li> been using them for at least 11 years.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> Seriously though, try it, mind &#x3D; blown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mix it with inexpensive lotion for my body vs. expensive lotion with less benefits.</li>
            <li> Especially in the winter time; Auwe!  the hands get so cracked and painful.  </li>
            <li> I ordered through amazon b/c the local stores quit stocking it :((</li>
            <li> I have bad dry skin</li>
            <li> Addicted to this oil.</li>
            <li> Really sorry I bought 2 of these.</li>
            <li> I threw the bottle away, useless.</li>
            <li> This was disappointing in that they use fragrance</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not at all saying this is a bad product.</li>
            <li> But do I hate it?  </li>
            <li> I really hate &amp;#34;miracle cure&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Anyone posting that this does not contain kukui nut oil, as advertised, is an idiot.</li>
            <li> The smell was awful to me.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, the biggest bonus is that it can be used for so many different things.  I use for mani and pedi&#x27;s.  If you just as a drop to cuticles periodically it works wonders!!!  I use in my split ends, on my sons eczema(awesome). I add to a small spray bottle and keep it with me to spritz on throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell of this stuff, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that since I started using it my skin is softer and healthier, and my hair has never been softer. It comes out slowly, so it doesn&#x27;t leak all over the shower like other oils, but again, the smell is musky and of vanilla, which I do not like at all. The good news is the smell does not stay for long. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Works great and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I have scoured the stores looking for this oil which I had found on a whim years ago in a Walmart!  I love this oil--it smells like summer, makes your skin silky, isn&#x27;t sticky, penetrates your skin nicely....all in all a really nice alternative to sesame oil.  Note about the fragrance--it is not overwhelming--I still use my regular perfume when I use this oil and it doesn&#x27;t change the scent--the oil fragrance is gone within an hour or so.</li>
            <li> I LOVE kakui oil.  I always by the unscented.  I use it daily on my legs which tend to dry out and crack.  I rub it on while my skin is damp from the shower.  I have also used it on my face at night if I have had too much sun.  My daughter suffers from dandruff quite often - we decided to try rubbing the oil into her scalp and shampooing the next day.  Worked like a charm!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this oil. It smells really strongly of yummy coconut. I use it before I go outside to tan, but it can be really messy if you use too much - use only a couple of drops, it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This Kukui nut oil is a very nice massage oil. I&#x27;ll be buying more of this when the time comes. You&#x27;ll be happy with this!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff! It smells wonderful and makes your skin feel and look amazing!</li>
            <li> When I received this product,lid wasn&#x27;t tightened and half leaked in the box,.Still waiting to receive replacement bottle?</li>
            <li> Mine didn&#x27;t smell like much but like the fact it&#x27;s not oily and organic using it for my 4 year old skin is soft but wished it smelled like the reviews said but doesn&#x27;t fast shipping</li>
            <li> The online product description list of ingredients has \\&quot;botanical fragrance\\&quot; at the end, implying fragrance from a natural source.  The actual bottle says Fragrance(parfum) which most likely  indicates a petroleum synthesized fragrance .</li>
            <li> Great product.  I apply to my skin during showering.  Not greasy and leaves my skin soft and smooth.  Will order more.</li>
            <li> Just like the more expensive versions but a lot cheaper!</li>
            <li> love it ! thanx Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have been adding this to my moisturizer. It smells great and I feel moisturized when I use it.  Smells good:)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I mix it with lotion for daily moisture.</li>
            <li> My second bottle. I love this product. I will keep ordering. Great price too. I used while pregnant not a one stretch mark. Now using for my c section scar as well as over all amazing skin....soft the scent is so dreamy. I am in love</li>
            <li> I CAN EVEN USE THIS WONDERFUL, MILD, HEALING OIL ON MY FACE!! THIS OIL IS FILLED WITH WONDERFUL INGREDIENTS AND I USE IT EVERYWHERE. IT HELPS RAZOR BURNS GO AWAY, HELPS WITH DRY SKIN, SMELLS GREAT (VERY MILD BUT PLEASING SMELL) I&#x27;M ON MY SECOND BOTTLE AND WILL BUY A 3RD WHEN MY 2ND IS ALMOST GONE. BEEN USING SINCE JUNE 2011.</li>
            <li> I read a review about Alba Kukui Nut Body Oil a few months ago and decided to try it.  I have very dry skin and need the ultimate in softening and moisturizing products. All I can say is \\&quot;WOW!\\&quot;    This oil feels silkier on the skin and lasts longer than the Neutrogena Rainbath Body Oil which I have used for years and years.  I will definitely keep getting the Alba Botanica Kuklui Nut Body Oil.  Your skin will be soft and smelling wonderful and you won&#x27;t go back to other body oils or lotions!</li>
            <li> Very light oil and it really does work, I put it on right after the shower and I feel like eating my arm.  I only wish it came with a pump</li>
            <li> There is nothing I don&#x27;t like about this massage oil! We use this for back and leg rubs and it works great and smells so good without being too strong! I would definitely recommend this to others! :)</li>
            <li> Smooth and smells great.</li>
            <li> Works great for massages... and other uses lol. Seriously though, try it, mind &#x3D; blown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the less dirty uses, I got a back rub with and without this. Let&#x27;s just say I almost fell asleep after she used this stuff on my back.</li>
            <li> Amazing moisturizing oil.  I use it before I step out of the shower and I am set for the day.  Keeps my skin soft and the smell is so light and just enough, not over powering.  I put my oil in a spray bottle and leave it right in the shower.  I don&#x27;t want to waste a drop.  This oil is light that is doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film on your skin.  Price is excellent.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful massage oil. It melts into the skin, but not too quickly. This leaves a flowing surface for the hands to move of the skin. The smell is pleasing, the feels warm and lustrous. It will heat up to body temperature quickly. A great way to give those you care for a pleasant massage and it leaves their skin soft, and refreshed. Some of the best oil you can find. I know professional therapists who use, and love, this oil.</li>
            <li> This really helps with my dry skin and it smells fantastic! I use it every day and find it less oily than most body oils, but equally effective. I reorder it every time I run out.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It works so well and doesn&#x27;t make you feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this because my skin was dry even after putting body lotion on. It is so great! I love the way my skin feels afterwards and it smells awesome!</li>
            <li> This is a great body oil.  It makes my skin really soft without leaving me feeling greasy.  I put it on right after a shower and put my robe on to finish getting ready.  By the time I&#x27;m ready to get dressed the oil has absorbed and not oily residue on my clothes.  It also smells really nice, but very subtle smell so it doesn&#x27;t clash with perfume or body sprays.</li>
            <li> I love that this oil is not sticky. Great smell.</li>
            <li> We use it after every shower, it helps to replenishes oils and helps dry skin.  it makes your skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Its a good moisturizing oil just not what I thought it would be</li>
            <li> This body oil does leave your skin soft, but towards the end of the day, my skin looks ashy.  The smell is nutty but neither pleasant nor unpleasant. I had bought this oil previously and I liked the thickness of it and that&#x27;s why I bought it again, not to mention that the price had gone down.  I had forgotten about the flaky look of my skin and now I regret buying this.  It also seems a bit thinner than it used to be, but that&#x27;s not a big deal.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for summer because of the flakiness.  The 3 stars is because it does leave the skin soft. Really sorry I bought 2 of these.</li>
            <li> This body oil smells amazing!  It has a kind of vanilla-nut thing going on.  I first thought it was simply due to the oils used, but there is fragrance added.  If you are sensitive to fragrances, you might not like it, but I love it.  I use this oil for massage and as a bath and shower oil.  It is a great moisturizer to use in the shower during these the low-humidity winter months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lotion girl.  I bought this product based on the reviews here, so I don&#x27;t really have any other body oils to compare it with.  But this product could be better if it was more of a body oil spray because a light squeeze brings you a lot of oil on your palm.  Too much oil.  You only need a little bit to go along way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the lightness of sesame oil from Neutrogena.  But I wanted to get an alternate organic product.  I&#x27;m not sure I made the right decision.  The oil is a little too thick for me.  The smell also reminds me of some sort of Hawaiian tropic oil (suntan lotion).  I prefer a lighter and cleaner scent.  But do I hate it?  No.  It&#x27;s just okay for me.</li>
            <li> Nice doesn&#x27;t clog pores doesn&#x27;t smell to strong.  Its a nice oil  that&#x27;s not too greasy.  Doesn&#x27;t smell strong, its a subtle scent that isn&#x27;t really feminine or masculine- kind of a warm nutty smell.  ( hence the kukui nut). I have sensitive skin and this did not break my back out at all.  :)</li>
            <li> This product smells amazing. It doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky residue anywhere and the product is very easy to work with. I have never been one to use massage oil but after using this product I don&#x27;t think I could never not use it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.I&#x27;ve been using it a couple of months now and I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a marked improvement in my skin condition.Thankyou for your wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I love Alba Botanica Kukui Nut Organic Body Oil.  A little goes along way.I use it after showering  it is not greasy at all, and smells great.  I also use it in my bathwater.I love it.I use  it everyday,and you only need a few drops each time.  I will buy this oil again.Though,I won&#x27;t have to buy   it often,because it last such a long time.You need very   little for desired results.Those results are soft pretty skin.</li>
            <li> Works better than prescription medication for my dry skin. Persistent problems gone after about a week of use, where nothing else worked. I really hate &amp;#34;miracle cure&amp;#34; reviews, they sound like the company paid for the review, but in this case, no, I&#x27;m not getting paid, this really did help me. Can&#x27;t guarantee you&#x27;ll get the same result, but many stores sell this; if you find it, try the tester there and see if you like it, or risk buying a bottle. Hope it works as well for you as it does for me!</li>
            <li> Just got this yesterday. At first, it was a disappointment because I thought I was getting pure kukui nut oil, but I guess that&#x27;s my fault for not doing my homework and looking up the ingredients. This is a blend of seven oils with sunflower oil as the main ingredient. Kukui is just the second listed ingredient. You&#x27;d think it&#x27;d be the main one, since it&#x27;s the only one listed on the front of the label.&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, this body oil has a soft, pleasant scent that makes me want to keep applying it all day. Last night, after I washed up, I slathered it all over my face and neck, and my skin actually looks better this morning. What a surprise. If that keeps up, I&#x27;ll definitely want to keep a supply of this on hand. It&#x27;s a cruelty free product by Alba, so how can I lose?&lt;br /&gt;That said, I still want to try some pure kukui nut oil; it&#x27;s supposed to be pretty great all on its own.</li>
            <li> This oil is very light, and soaks into the skin quickly. Doesn&#x27;t leave a very heavy feeling like some oils can. Great for the bath or even the face to help dissolve makeup. Please be awake that this is not pure kukui nut oil, it is a blend with other ingredients. The smell is very pleasant, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Very lite, not greasy.</li>
            <li> Please!  Alba products are Chem-Clean.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve been using them for at least 11 years.&lt;br /&gt;What more can we say.&lt;br /&gt;Bill</li>
            <li> I switched to the Alba oil after using baby oil for years. A little goes a long way and it smells wonderful.  A bit pricey but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Love this works great!!!</li>
            <li> We were very pleased to find such a good deal on a hard to find product. Service was excellent as is the product. This is an ingredient in some of our handcrafted bath products, and we will get much use from it.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this. It smells amaaaaazing (as so many reviewers have said before me), is super moisturizing and has a handy lid that will allow you to control the flow of product, rather than having it all gush out. I will definitely buy this again...it&#x27;s great for my legs in winter!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always on the lookout for body oils that have light scents.  They replace the use of cologne and moisturize at the same time.  This was on sale elsewhere online for $6, so I gave it a shot and am glad I did.  The label calls it a kukui nut body oil, but ingredients show it is really a blend of tropical nut oils, consisting of sunflower, aleurites moluccana (kukui nut), coconut, macadamia, linseed and sweet almond oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically don&#x27;t like sweet fragrances, but this one is different--a very light, clean smell.  The 8.5 fluid ounces will last a long time too, as only a few drops are needed per arm, leg, etc.  Oily at first, it absorbs quickly, leaving a nice feel and look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another nice oil is [[ASIN:B001LFEM48 c. Booth Original Bath &amp; Body Oil, 16 oz]] which is hard to find, but is sold on Amazon.  It offers twice the amount for about the same price as Alba Botanica, and also has a nice light scent.  I recommend both to anyone with dry skin.  They will leave your skin feeling soft and supple all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Since writing this review, the cost of Booth Bath and Body Oil seems to have skyrocketed.  I&#x27;m not sure why and maybe it&#x27;s an Amazon thing because pet bird seed seems to be in the same category (price doubling).  Periodically both products are offered at more reasonable prices; that&#x27;s when I stock up.</li>
            <li> The smell was awful to me. But thats just me. Maybe it smells great to others. I gave mine away.</li>
            <li> I have replaced my Neutrogena Sesame Oil with the Alba Kukui Nut Oil in the shower. Basically after I rinse at the end of my shower I apply a few drops to my arms and legs, smooth it in, and am good to go for the day. No extra moisture needed. It soaks in nicely and leaves my skin looking slightly dewy and not at all greasy. It smells great, like sweet coconut, but it isn&#x27;t overpowering. Neutrogena Sesame Oil is great, but I prefer this one; a bit richer yet seems to soak in better, and I enjoy the scent immensely. Love it.</li>
            <li> this is a very nice oil and goes on smooth and not greasy .....nice fragrance...</li>
            <li> Awesome body oil. I have bad dry skin so I mix it with my lotion and put it on after I get out of the shower. This with the body scrub is the only thing that works for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this body oil several times already and will continue to do so.  It is great for making your skin soft and gives it a light shimmer for night time.  It smells really good and several people who have smelled it on me have said the same thing to me.  My only complaint is that the way the bottle is made to dispense the oil (small hole in the middle under a snap on cap) tends to leak a little bit.  When you tip it back, excess oil slides down the sides of the bottle and puddles around the bottom of the bottle so I keep it wrapped in the plastic that it arrives in to catch the oil.</li>
            <li> This Kukui Nut oil is so great I&#x27;ve bought it for several of my friends and they become fans too. Great for summer beach time and definitely a must for winter skin. This is one of my top 5 must have products in the beauty department!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this body oil for years and highly recommend it to anyone needing a high quality product. Works exceptional well for personal intimate use as well as a body massage oil. Long lasting fragrance that promises to never clash with other lotions.</li>
            <li> I purchased the product and saw this one as promising. I have dry skin so finding an oil I can use to seal in moisture is essential.Once I began to use it, it wasn&#x27;t what I expected.The smell is okay but  nothing amazing. The product is a mixture of oils, however the primary oil is sunflower oil (not the best for skin). Personally not worth the price,. It might be from the hype of alba&#x27;s other products. I will look for another moisturizing oil. Overall rating: 2.75.</li>
            <li> I love  alba products, have used them before. The price was reasonable</li>
            <li> This oil smells great and really helps my skin maintain moisture after showering.  Just rub a small amount on wet skin and towel dry as usual.</li>
            <li> I use this oil for daily moisturizing and love it, not too heavy and the smell is awesome. The smell fades a bit and has a light fragrance. Not too overpowering, so that you can wear a perfume or body spray as well.</li>
            <li> This body oil smells amazing and works great! It soaks in easily and makes for a great bath. I can&#x27;t go to bed without it.</li>
            <li> This is a nice and fragrant massage oil and certainly gives hint of a Tropical paradise.  I chiefly use a creamy lotion for massaging and then add several drops of this oil to allow me to work longer!  I ordered through amazon b/c the local stores quit stocking it :((</li>
            <li> I just got his but wow - I love the scent and the feel of this oil.  Looking forward to testing it out in a variety of applications.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice body oil to put on after your morning shower. It gives your skin a nice hydration and smells heavenly. It is a little heavier than the average body oil but blends in nicely.</li>
            <li> I use this for back rubs, and it works wonderful. I was just using lotion and wow this is SO much better! It lasts for a very long time. It smells wonderful. I love that it&#x27;s paraben free and not tested on animals!&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for a moisturizer, it would be great for your skin but it&#x27;s made from real oils so it can leave you feeling greasy for a long time.</li>
            <li> Ordered this product it smells nice, I didn&#x27;t try it though since it&#x27;s not what I wanted. I wanted kukui nut oil. Kukui oil is not even listed as an ingredient.</li>
            <li> For hair and skin this gets an A+ it does not leave anything feeling oily or greasy at all. Nice very light smell to it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good - moisturize the skin so good and smell good. I ordered this and NOW sweet almond body oil at the same time to compare them, but I like the NOW body oil better. But it&#x27;s still very good body oil without harmful chemicals like paraben.</li>
            <li> Well, I should have looked at the label before I ordered this one.  I like kukui nut, the smell and the absorption of the oil.  This was disappointing in that they use fragrance and I have a feeling it&#x27;s synthetic not from the real nut.</li>
            <li> I love this oil!!!! I still have it and we use a lot!!!!</li>
            <li> I actually got this item for FREE from Amazon after using combined shipping, because it turned out to be the SAME price as buying TWO items alone.&lt;br /&gt;The VISCOSITY is PERFECT for Massage and the Smell of the product is ok; Other oils can be just clarified Cooking oils, Without the Pleasant Odor and Texture.</li>
            <li> Am I the only one who doesn&#x27;t care for the smell? It smells almost like sunscreen lotion.  And I am more of a lotion girl however this was a gift and I am pleased to find that I do enjoy this oil. It&#x27;s not something I would personally buy, however I will definitely use it all up !</li>
            <li> The scent of this oil is not too strong when used in the bath or directly onto the body. It&#x27;s tropical but not too over bearing, just perfect. The oil leaves my skin soft but not oily as it is absorbed in quickly; however much is not needed to cover a large area.</li>
            <li> I noticed the main ingredient is a vegetable oil.  Not the one I was expecting that I used in Hawaii which was not cut with another oil.  I could have just used cooking oil.  Still works to soften my skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent for massage, and we like the subtle fragrance.  We have been using massage oil from Bath and Body Works, but that smell is way too strong and the residual oily feeling is not pleasant.  This oil is about half the cost, does not assault your olfactory nerves, and does not leave you feeling like you have been swimming in an oil spill.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this hard to find body oil on my damp skin as soon as I&#x27;ve showered.  It absorbs quickly and works better than lotion to keep my skin moist. Great product.  Kuikui nut oil seems to have healing properties and works well with coconut oil. The scent is not evident, but the moisturizing is!</li>
            <li> Smells absolutely wonderful and is a great moisturizer! What I love about this oil is that it&#x27;s a happy medium between a really greasy/slick feeling oil (like mineral oil) and a dryer oil (like argan oil) that absorbs right away so it does a great job of moisturizing for long periods of time. Keep in mind that I have really dry skin so I like when an oil sticks around for little while before completely disappearing into my skin.</li>
            <li> I liked everything about it, except it made me inch. I wish it hadnt. I would order it again. so I&#x27;m tring something difference.</li>
            <li> This body oil is great ! I put it on damp skin after the shower and also use it with a Mr Pumice foot scrubber so my feet are extra soft. I love alba products, and this product is no exception! The smell is fab, too :)</li>
            <li> this oil is absolutely awesome. My lady cannot brag on it enough. The smell, feeling of her skin after applied, always is a 5 star rating. We use this strictly for massages not intimacy. We have a hot tub and after the tub and shower, this gives her skin all it needs to be refreshed and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Love it. This oil leaves my skin feeling silky-smooth and not oily. The smell is fantastic, sort of like a tropical smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this Kukui Nut Oil to try to help with my psoriasis. However, I found it to be too oily on the skin and didn&#x27;t really soak in even throughout the day. I&#x27;m not at all saying this is a bad product. In fact it&#x27;s a very good one, just not what I was looking for in the treatment of psoriasis. Even after using it for a couple of weeks daily I didn&#x27;t see any signs of clearing my psoriasis. It would just make the red areas no longer scaly white color, but more of a translucent scaly color.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and am sensitive to perfumes in lotions, as well as having fairly severe keratosis pilaris. The difference in my skin was immediately apparent after only one use of this body oil. There is no irritation of my skin whatsoever when using this product, in fact it seems to soothe any irritation or redness I might have! After using this product my skin smells amazing (like white chocolate in my opinion), and is incredibly soft and smooth all day long! After using it for about a week and a half, I have noticed a definite improvement in my KP- my arms and legs are smoother and much softer, as well as looking less blotchy and red. As other reviewers have noted, only a small amount of the oil is needed, and even with daily use a single bottle should last quite a while. The moisture lasts longer than any over-the-counter lotion I&#x27;ve tried, and works better for my KP than any lotion to boot. I have been using this body oil after cleansing with [[ASIN:B00685KUGA SAL3® Salicylic Acid and Sulfur Soap]] to treat my KP, and my skin looks and feels better than it has in years! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone, and for $6.99 through Amazon&#x27;s addon program, it is a screaming deal!</li>
            <li> I love the smell - smells like brown sugar. I&#x27;m sensitive to smells, they can trigger migrains, so I can&#x27;t wear purfume or a lot of scented lotions which can be a bummer when a girl just wants to smell nice! This has served as a good alternative.</li>
            <li> This product has a wonderful smell and is also very moisturizing! I use it everyday and love that it is organic!</li>
            <li> Great for applying before spending the day at the lake</li>
            <li> A great product to use from head to toe!</li>
            <li> I love the way this moisturizes like baby oil without being overly greasy. It&#x27;s a mix between lotion and baby oil feel. It takes a little more product than baby oil, but it seems like it moisturizes much better. It really soaks into your skin.</li>
            <li> I love the product but had to be sent a replacement because the oil leaked out of the lid - this happened both times. The lid needs some sort of plastic cover to keep it from unscrewing and therefore leaking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tad thick, but it smells really pleasant.  You&#x27;ll probably enjoy using it, leaves the skin very soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> This massage oil is fantastic. Not too greasy, smells amazing, priced just right, lasts a long time. We definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.wife loves it as a massage oil and a everyday moisturizer.She also likes the smell also.</li>
            <li> this is very nice so get some today and make it a night to remember let the massage begin have fun,</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Was tired of lotions for dry skin, so gave this a shot. Works very well without being too &#x27;oily&#x27;, if that makes sense... nice scent, too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use as my carrier oil in the Oil Cleansing Method (OCM). I have dry skin that is prone to breakouts and that I could never seem to balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil is lightweight, smells good an feels great on my skin. I&#x27;ve tried olive oil (too heavy), apricot oil (feels heavy but doesn&#x27;t moisturize well), almond oil (my second-place oil) and coconut oil (not as moisturizing as I&#x27;d like) as my carrier oils but prefer the Alba Botanica Kukui Nut Oil above all of the others I have tried. I have found that it has a great feel on my skin and provides the right amount of moisture. I cannot see this being heavy on someone with oiler skin as it has such a light feel. It&#x27;s affordable in comparison to other oils and is a good value at 8.5 ounces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re considering starting the OCM, this is a great oil to try. If you haven&#x27;t heard of the OCM- it rocks. Look it up and try this oil with it. Your life will be changed and you will thank me when your skin balances! It&#x27;s great for removing eye makeup, too!</li>
            <li> My wife enjoys back rubs. It is much easier to grant her wish with the use of a body oil. I actually heard of Kukui Nut oil from an episode of Duck Dynasty in which Phil gets a message and they use the oil and he likes the scent. I don&#x27;t know if it was this product but it was kukui nut oil they used. This is a nice oil that works well for back rubs (and if I&#x27;m lucky it transitions to front-rubs). The oil absorbs well into the skin leaving it soft. My wife has not experience any acne from the use of this product.</li>
            <li> I Really like this product, it gives me the natural glow that i want w/o leaving a greasy feel. I sometimes use it on my face as a moisturizer. Will buy it again.....</li>
            <li> SUNFLOWER OIL. That&#x27;s the #1 ingredient. That, coconut and soybean oil. THIS IS NOT KUKUI NUT oil. While yes, it has a nice feel and quality and smell, you can buy sunflower oil for much cheaper, from honest dealers.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. All natural stuff...</li>
            <li> this is quickly absorbed. Nice scent</li>
            <li> Awesome oil.  The subtle warm smell of coffee and vanilla is intoxicating.  The kukui oil is light and sensuous.  What a yummy treat.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it smell wonderful and makes my skin really soft!!  I&#x27;m using in sugar scrub and it is amazing</li>
            <li> I really love this product. It feels fantastic when applied and smells divine. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Scent isn&#x27;t too strong. Feels great on my skin. Makes it feel softer. Shipping could have been a bit more secure since a little bit spilled out.</li>
            <li> Works great, lasts long and smells yummy.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff so much!  I have very sensitive skin and this works perfectly and smells amazing.  I use after a bath as a moisturizer, for a massage oil, and as a leave-in treatment for my hair when it gets dry.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  I use it in my hair and on my face and skin.  It&#x27;s light and smells nice.</li>
            <li> Loves this oil blend.  It has a wonderful smell and it does not feel greasy on the skin.</li>
            <li> After reading most of the review on this product I decided to order it even though many had said that it smelled too sweet.  My experience has been that it wasn&#x27;t as much too sweet as it was too sticky.  Also, it didn&#x27;t really smell like Kukui Nut, it smells more like cotton candy.  Just imagine liquifying cotton candy and putting it on your body.  It leaves you smelling sweet and very, very sticky.  I threw the bottle away, useless.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the feel of this body oil, it&#x27;s one of my favorites</li>
            <li> Love the smell, great for moisturizing the entire body,</li>
            <li> This has to be my favorite massage oil!  It smells wonderful; and, it absorbs well.  It works very well for a great massage oil.  I can not wait to order more in the future.  I love this so much that I use it for everything.  It has replaced my lotions and is great for use after shaving my legs and after being in the sun.  I also use this w/ my hot massage stones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I had was that it did not have a seal on it.  They did ship it in a separate plastic bag which was good since it did leak.  I do hope they do that w/ all orders since it did not have the seal under the lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you are looking for a massage oil that has a really good scent and feels good on your skin this is the one you want!!!  I&#x27;m almost disappointed that the scent isn&#x27;t a little stronger just because I love how it smells.  It&#x27;s not an overpowering smell; and, it doesn&#x27;t really smell like a strong suntanning oil.  It just smells really, really good (and there are a lot of massage oils that I do not like the scent of).</li>
            <li> This oil has virtually no smell, but moisturizes my skin nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* * * * * * * * *</li>
            <li> I love this oil. It&#x27;s thick and smells great. It&#x27;s Perfect for winter hydrating. And for summer time use especially after the pool!</li>
            <li> Addicted to this oil. Really treats your hair and body. I mix it with inexpensive lotion for my body vs. expensive lotion with less benefits. ENJOY! I HAVE for some time now.</li>
            <li> THIS OIL IS WONDERFUL. IT ABSORDS GREAT.</li>
            <li> This is not Kukui oil.  this is an oil blend with a little kukui oil added.   Read the label.     That being said, it&#x27;s a nice oil.  But the labeling is definately misleading.</li>
            <li> I LIKE  THIS OIL BECAUSE IT TAKES  SO LITTLE  TO DO A GOOD JOB  AND MOSTLY BECAUSE IT IS NOT GREASY.  IT HELPS  MY SKIN FEEL NATURAL AND MOIST AND SMOOTH  BUT AGAIN NOT STICKY OR GUMMY OR GREASY.  IT  SMELLS GOOD.  IT IS ECONOMICAL  TO USE BECAUSE  IT TAKES  A LITTLE  TO GET  A GOOD JOB DONE.</li>
            <li> The benefits of body oil is extremely underrated in western cultures. For centuries Asian cultures have used body oil to prevent damages and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;This body oil is a perfect combination of rich aromas and nutrients for my skin. I love it ! The oil is just the right consistency and gets absorbed easily. The smell is delicate, sweet and nutty. And it moisturizes skin as well as hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe with this purchase was that the bottle was not sealed at all when it arrived. I am extremely leery of products that are devoid of crimps or seals. Secondly some of the oil had leaked and the entire inside of the box was oily.</li>
            <li> Alba Botanica Kukui Nut Organic Hawaiian Body Oil has a wonderful, light scent and works beautifully as an after shower moisturizer. It absorbs quickly and leaves skin feeling soft, clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Subtle but wonderful smell, but not too strong.  It dries fast and is not greasy.  It leaves my skin feeling really nice!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Alba Botanical products for about five or six years, and really like every product of theirs I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ve had the same bottle of this oil for about two years, but because you only need a small amount of it each time you use it, it&#x27;s lasted me that long with once-a-week use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this oil and adore the brown sugar smell; it&#x27;s fragrant, without being too cloying.  I would use this more frequently, but I&#x27;ve found that it doesn&#x27;t sink in as much as lotion and the scent remains pretty strong throughout the day, so I can&#x27;t use perfume on the days I wear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on my legs right after shaving, and it doesn&#x27;t sting or burn.  It moisturizes well, and lasts for about ten hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like the smell of sugary goods in your body-care products, then I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This keeps my skin soft and supply which is a challenge in the dry air of the Southwest. I use it as an after shower lotion.My massage therapist loves to use it during my massage because it is so emolient and has a beautiful fragrance. It soaks into the skin rather than sitting on top. I just wish Amazon sold it in bulk.</li>
            <li> This kukui nut oil smells fabulous and keeps my family&#x27;s skin soft. Love it! Wish I had found it long ago. It has become a regular part of our routine. And best of all, it&#x27;s affordable!</li>
            <li> The body oil leaks into the package everywhere with other ordered items since the cap of the bottle is open. Only half bottle left plus all the mess! Why don&#x27;t Amazon use proper protection for the bottle and seal up properly? As for the oil, it has a rich smell and feels good on skin.</li>
            <li> this is very nice &amp; feels great &amp; can heal body deeper than skin level so I will buy more</li>
            <li> May dry a little more quickly then desired, but otherwise a great oil. What make it nice is that it doesn&#x27;t leave oil patches that need to be wiped off. Works very well.</li>
            <li> Think it&#x27;s a great product. My daughter who is an Esthetician recommend  it. Yes, I would tell others to use this or dry skin</li>
            <li> It smells great and works wonderful for massages with my boyfriend. I just wish it had a pump on it. It doesn&#x27;t leave the skin greasy and smells soooo good!</li>
            <li> Love it, fast absorbing, nice easy smell. I&#x27;ll purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is a great oil for sensitive skin. I bought this oil to do oil cleanses for removing my makeup at night. Also, I use this as a face moisturizer. In the morning, I use like two drops with my sunscreen and at night, I use just the oil. Since switching to the oil cleansing method my skin has went from severely oily and irritated to smooth normal and soft.  The smell of the product is a mixture between maple/brown sugar/vanilla/sugar cookie.&lt;br /&gt;It smells something like that, couldn&#x27;t really narrow it down. In my opinion the consistency is light. Oh and it absorbs wonderfully.</li>
            <li> This body oil is PERFECT for giving a massage, or just putting on dry skin after a shower.  It&#x27;s very lightly scented so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it conflicting with your cologne or perfume.  It&#x27;s also light enough that if you give a massage, the person doesn&#x27;t feel like they have to take a shower to wash off all the thick oil on their body.  Will definitely be ordering more this when I run out.</li>
            <li> Amazing smell and makes the skin sooooo soft! Buy this product! :-)</li>
            <li> Works great for massages.  Why girlfriend and I usually use baby oil. This works better for us.  Nice scent also.</li>
            <li> Alba Botanica Kukui Nut Organic Body Oil, 8.5-Ounce  I Love the feel of this on my skin rub it on faster and harder:)</li>
            <li> Smells so good and is very moisturizing.  It&#x27;s on my Subscribe and Save list!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing and feels great. LOVE it. It&#x27;s a little sweet but not too vanilla-ish. Aaah!</li>
            <li> I chose this product because it doesn&#x27;t contain the chemical byproducts that baby oil does. It is a similar texture to baby oil, but with thicker consistency and not as greasy. The smell is great. And it works well to moisturize</li>
            <li> I love all of Alba&#x27;s products. They just smell nice and feel nice, plus they aren&#x27;t horribly expensive. I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> This might actually be a great product, I don&#x27;t know because I can&#x27;t get past the smell.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Its a little thicker than I thought it would be but it does get absorbed pretty fast...not greasy at all. Love the slight scent of coconut.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t read close enough. This is a blend.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  Smoothes without leaving too much oil.  Seems to calm down skin problems. I really like this.  Used it even on areas where psoriasis has been an issue -- no problems.</li>
            <li> Like the light fragrance.  Easy to travel with size.  Seems to work well on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have gone through several of these bottles, this stuff works great, smell great. I would recommend! Good for your skin as well!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and this stuff smells like candy! I bought another one so i can have one at home and one in my bags, with me at all times.</li>
            <li> This oil has kukui oil as one of the ingredients ... it is NOT pure kukui oil.&lt;br /&gt;The product description says &amp;#34;Kukui Nut Organic Body Oil&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Read the ingredients before buying.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and exactly what I wanted - Thanks!</li>
            <li> I like using body oils verses lotions and body creams because my skin is always super dry, even in the summer time and I get ashy very quickly (I&#x27;m black). After my shower, I like to apply the body oil while I&#x27;m still wet and I find that it works the best for me with long lasting moisture. I used to use coconut oil which worked great but my boyfriend doesn&#x27;t like the smell of coconut. So I tried this, he likes the smell (smells like waffles to him) but applying it how I usually do leaves me ashy by midday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best way to use this is after you&#x27;ve dried off which is such a hassle for me. Not a fan of applying body oils out of the shower, they are harder to maneuver around your skin and can also get messy fast. Decent product but I won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> a really nice smell. I really love it! and the price is more then good!!! very good product!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll buy more!&lt;br /&gt;the best oil I have ever tried!&lt;br /&gt;can anybody tell me the difference between this one and the one with written ORGANIC BODY OIL...???</li>
            <li> I bought this with the idea that I would use it for massages. But I&#x27;ve started using it when my skin gets really dry. It smells great, though the smell doesn&#x27;t last a long time. It absorbs really fast without feeling greasy (unless you put waay too much on. whoops). It works great for massages and as a moisturizer. Ill definitely buy more when mine runs out.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite moisturizer… it makes my skin very soft and it smells divinely natural.  It feels very luxurious.  I especially like to use it after a bath or shower… yummy!&lt;br /&gt;It also makes a nice gift as part of a pampering set.</li>
            <li> So the bottle is correct but the description led me to believe differently.  Use in the shower?  Then the floor of the shower is slippery.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my husband&#x27;s coarse curly hair, for scalp massage and dry skin.  Works well and my husband doesn&#x27;t think it smells too feminine, sweet but nutty (kind of like my husband- ha!).  I&#x27;d consider it a &amp;#34;dry oil&amp;#34;-- meaning it doesn&#x27;t stay oily and absorbs fast on skin &amp; hair.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite body oils</li>
            <li> Like the product but it arrived unsealed and leaking oil everywhere!</li>
            <li> This is really an excellent moisturizer, it smells fantastic, it is easily absorbed and I know it has no damaging chemical products and was not tested on animals. And for the price it&#x27;s a real bargain that  you can not beat</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful . Great product.</li>
            <li> Very nice!  Has a nice, very natural smell that&#x27;s not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> OMG!!! Love it so much the smell alone is divine. I use this whenever I go out and i want to smell good around ppl. .</li>
            <li> I use this as part of my daily routine. It has a light scent that doesn&#x27;t linger and the oil absorbs well so you aren&#x27;t left feeling oily.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  It sinks in fast and really helps my dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Sooooooooo, I can&#x27;t afford Hawaii.  Yet.  However, I can smell like Hawaii.  This oil has a lovely, light fragrance.  It feels wonderful on the skin, as well.  I tend to shy away from lotions and creams with long words I can&#x27;t pronounce or need a some sort of degree in science to know what is in the bottle.  While I still may not get the pronunciation of Alba Botanica&#x27;s Kukiu Nut Oil perfect... I am comforted in the knowledge it is the only word on the bottle to be concerned about.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and keeps my skin from feeling dry during the cold winter months.  I have sensitive skin and have had no issues with this oil.</li>
            <li> This is a great product but the reason it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars is I feel I must use more than usual to spread on my skin. The bottle won&#x27;t last long. I wonder if this comes in bigger sizes. I have very, very dry skin that is eczema prone &amp; responds well to natural products. This product does a wonderful job moisturizing my skin and maintaining that moisture, plus I love the smell.</li>
            <li> This oil smells great and moisturizes my skin really well.  It&#x27;s not the best but it&#x27;s good stuff.  My skin is extremely dry in the Winter so I&#x27;m always on the hunt for a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This product is selling for $5.59 on other sites. I come to realize Aamazon is over charging for most of their stuff. Be sure to google your product of interest before making your purchase. Let&#x27;s put an end to this highway robbery. I will make sure I pursue this further and have a prominent media source do a live coverage exposing amazon. They are not as convenient as they portray them self to be. Spoke to a James. W at Amazon to express my concern, he told me I was free to buy from the competitor instead. I have been doing just that. I now use amazon to read customer&#x27;s feedback on the effectiveness of the product and make a decision. I have been using amazon for over a decade and make several purchases a month. I will only use them now if the price is right, after searching for the best possible deal.</li>
            <li> This body oil has a lovely tropical smell and is awesome for layering under your normal lotions. I put this on in the shower and it absorbs nicely, leaving my skin nice and soft. A little goes a long way and this is great for those dry months, especially in winter, when your body just needs a little something extra. I only wish it was a little thicker so I didn&#x27;t have to wear lotion at all, but overall, a great product from a trustworthy company!</li>
            <li> This oil saves my skin in the winter.  It smells amazing, and manages to be lightweight and super moisturizing at the same time.  One bottle lasts FOREVER.</li>
            <li> I have tried every kind of body oil. This is the best! I can use it everywhere on my skin, face, it&#x27;s a really safe,organic oil.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it for everyone -babies to elders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use a biological oil that kept increasing in price every year. This product has twice the volume for half the cost of the other oil I was using and really liked, but when I found this I switched for good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s advertised as kukui nut oil but it&#x27;s definitely not the only oil in it. The main ingredient is sunflower oil. It woul be nice to have a full ingredient list so you&#x27;re more informed. But it does make your skin softer.</li>
            <li> I have not purchased this but I gave it one star because I don&#x27;t even see kukui nut oil on the ingredient list!</li>
            <li> Smells yummy and wonderful after a shower or bath to lock in moisture.</li>
            <li> I use this religiously for everything. I have truly seen a difference in my skin tone, complexion, and radiance. I use it in the morning and before bed each night. My skin looks so healthy and I truly have that Lupita glow now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*tip* Great as makeover remover (apply to face and massage into makeup. Rinse face with hands or wash rag)</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift, to be utilized as a massage oil. I suppose that I assumed that the oil itself would not be easily and quickly absorbed by the skin. If it were, I might have described the product as a body lotion or something of that sort. A fair amount, then, has to be used for this purpose.</li>
            <li> I got this oil because I am pregnant and wanted to soothe my itchy growing skin around by belly and breasts. I was very pleased with how good it smells. It leaves my skin feeling soft even in the winter.</li>
            <li> It has a really pleasant &amp;#34;nutty&amp;#34; fragrance that I just love, but it&#x27;s very heavy and doesn&#x27;t glide on as well as most other body oils I&#x27;ve used in the past. If I put it on in the morning, it&#x27;ll cake up by mid-day and start to flake off my skin - super annoying and unattractive. I&#x27;ll probably use it here and there (for the smell) until the bottle is empty, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Use it on skin, hair and even put it into lipstick tubes to keep lipsticks moist &amp; even textured</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a much lighter weight massage oil.&lt;br /&gt;This was nice smelling, but a little thick.&lt;br /&gt;Probably good for moisturizing dry skin.</li>
            <li> STRONG SMELLING!!!  Not a bad smell, but it&#x27;s strong.  The lube is great, glide is great, and there is no residue left over.  Nice.  Why not include a few massage tips on the bottle or enclosure, dare to offer more value?</li>
            <li> Misleading ingredients. Didn&#x27;t help or do anything for skin.</li>
            <li> Anyone posting that this does not contain kukui nut oil, as advertised, is an idiot. The Kukui nut is a local name for the nut of the plant Aleurites moluccanus, oil from which being I believe the 3rd ingredient listed in the product. Such reviews should be removed</li>
            <li> By far the best massage oil I have used! My wife and I regularly use it to massage each other and it does not have any funky odor, it smells nice and it is very light to the skin. I regularly use it to moisturize my arms which is always dry and flaky and it does a very good job which lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li> good stuff.....if you one island boy or girl who moved to the continental US and now have dry and cracked (sometimes bleeding) skin, then you need some of this.  Especially in the winter time; Auwe!  the hands get so cracked and painful.  I smooth on some of this kukui nut oil and it feels so much betta.  Eh!  no forget da okole we often taken for granted, a little dab will do ya to prevent dry and chafing skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of nice oils, gels and creams. This one is pretty mediocre. There&#x27;s no pleasant smell (almost no smell at all, really) and it doesn&#x27;t spread very easily so I find myself using a LOT of it. It is a dry oil so there&#x27;s no greasy shine or excess oil sitting on top of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, i won&#x27;t buy it again and probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to a friend. I really prefer the Johnson &amp; Johnson&#x27;s cocoa butter gel oil and notice a difference even 24 hours after using it so this Alba body oil was a disappointment when the next morning my elbows felt as dry as ever. Even plain coconut oil works better than this stuff on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> A great product and the shipping was fast can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
            <li> Before getting out of the shower to dry off, simply put a few drops in your hand (at a time) to moisturize your body. It makes your skin soft all day, without being oily. Lasts a long time, Love it, can&#x27;t live without it. Seller shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Good for massage or for moisturizing skin.  Smells good too.  I think the price here is probably best because I&#x27;ve had friends say they&#x27;ve paid more for it</li>
            <li> bodies oil or massage oil ? Doesn&#x27;t mind .Is nice oil.not oilly at all .I used it for massage .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always concerned about the massage oil at the &amp;#34;Less Expensive&amp;#34; massage places I go so I bring my own oil.  This is very nice and has a nice soft sent to it as well.  The massage gal also says how nice it is.</li>
            <li> Just grabbed my second bottle of this stuff, it is great for all types of uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave my girlfriend a massage with it during valentines day and it works like a wonder, best of all, the ingredients in it are very healthy for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the smell of it, it has a very subtle nutty/flower smell that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm you, and it glides on skin with just the right amount of friction.</li>
            <li> Light, Fresh, No Residue, Quickly absorbed! Will BE making future purchases!</li>
            <li> It absorbs very well into your skin and doesn&#x27;t have a bad odor either. Great for massages, tanning or dry winters.</li>
            <li> This oil smell very pleasant! I use it after a shower and it disappears very nicely into my skin! It almost reminds me of Hawaii or light beach fragrance!</li>
            <li> This oil smells fantastic and does a great job of combatting the dry skin we fight in the winter.  It also smells divine! My boyfriend loves the way my skin smells and how soft it is when I use this.  It also creates a nice, subtle sheen when it&#x27;s soaked in - leaving my skin healthy and moisturized without being oily or greasy (when soaked in.)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!! So much better than using cheap lotion and feeds your skin the way you want it to.</li>
            <li> Product works really well-super moisturizing, smells nice.</li>
            <li> The oil has a pleasant feel and smell. It absorbs quite well into the skin, and makes an excellent moisturizer or massage oil. Highly recommended. The packaging is straightforward and the product lasts.</li>
            <li> does not absorb that quickly for me...argan oil works better..</li>
            <li> if you want 100% kukui nut oil, don&#x27;t bye this one.  Its not even listed as an ingredient! Don&#x27;t be fooled.</li>
            <li> Nice feel to the oil.  Nice scent and fragrane.  Nice quality and great price.  Would buy again and recommend to other buyers.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Once again this precut smells I didn&#x27;t use! What to send it back! More words necessary couldn&#x27;t find any other words! I&#x27;m sure others like it but not myself!</li>
            <li> Love it!! It smells good and my body feels soft.</li>
