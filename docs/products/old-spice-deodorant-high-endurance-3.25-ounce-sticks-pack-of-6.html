            <li>The product came in excellent condition at the other side of the Atlantic, it was as described and the Amazon team did their best for a secure, frustration free transaction.</li>
            <li>Is this the failing of corporate America in supplying the people with the best products?</li>
            <li>The smell is great, it stays the whole day (even more), doesn&#x27;t leave marks on clothes.  </li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t think it was mine because I was confident that I was thoroughly covered with this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have been using this deodorant for close to 15 years and love it.</li>
            <li>I love buying this in bulk because I don&#x27;t like to shop at all.  </li>
            <li>(there are so many that I want to try).</li>
            <li>Amazon.com is the place to get it; you get a lot more for your money, compared to drug stores.</li>
            <li>too many for the stocking :)</li>
            <li>Okay... I am now living in Finland.</li>
            <li>It easily lasts 24 hours and everyone around me loves the way it smells.several of my friends have started using it after smelling it and the ladies seem to love it so definitively a must use.</li>
            <li>She then felt compelled to tell as many people as she could that I smelled good, and soon a flock of females had surrounded me, and were very enthralled with my aroma.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re in limbo about which deodorant to buy, or if you&#x27;re just starting out like me, I can vouch for the good folks at Old Spice, this stuff is superb.</li>
            <li>As in, \\&quot;throughout the house\\&quot; strong, as in \\&quot;I</li>
            <li>hope I can get used to this before bed\\&quot; strong.  </li>
            <li>have tryed other deodorants this one is a keeper,helps me stay freshen up and not shy on waving bye or around others great product, great price,</li>
            <li>But other wise I think it may be a good product.</li>
            <li>The deodorant itself seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>The smell was outstanding, one of the most enjoyable of the whole Old Spice line-up (Denali also has an amazing smell).</li>
            <li>hoestly i didnt weaste my money and buy the item, i bought huge quantity and upto</li>
            <li>Thank you for making this product available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>no doubt about it free shipping on prime.</li>
            <li>6 sticks of my favorite deodorant I&#x27;ve used since high school for less than 40e ^_^ 6 month supply or more AWESOME!!!</li>
            <li>The scent is not unpleasant, it&#x27;s just ... strong.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to have to look elsewhere for something more effective or start testing out that emergency Irish Spring supply I carry around with me.</li>
            <li>(i get the fresh scent) and incredibly cheap compared to department stores.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad smell but its definately like a not-so-strong-cologne.  </li>
            <li>No sweat problem, but there is a mild odor issue after about 6 hours.</li>
            <li>Back to using what we know works...and at such a great price on Amazon!</li>
            <li>But the Old Spice high endurance deodorants have made me so much more confident, as corny as that sounds.  </li>
            <li>&quot;  I think I&#x27;ve got a pretty good sense of humor, but that is just strange to me.  </li>
            <li>I really sweet around those hot temperatures.</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure the strength of the scent is a notch or two higher than one could reasonably expect, so I am hitting it a star.</li>
            <li>(speed stick -fresh</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a fan of Old Spice products ever since I was a teenager many years ago.</li>
            <li>The High Endurance is better than the original, since it doesn&#x27;t evaporate so quickly - high alcohol content.</li>
            <li>, I would&#x27;ve used it right after class, but thankfully it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>The smell is very strong and it doesn&#x27;t really last all day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Pedro from Laredo,Tx and boy how hot it gets here really hot!</li>
            <li>The scent is clean and doesn&#x27;t smell like something you would find in a high school locker room.  </li>
            <li>and i like it very much.</li>
            <li>This is what&#x27;s written on the container:  \\&quot;Contains odor-fighting &#x27;atomic robots&#x27; that &#x27;shoot lasers&#x27; at your &#x27;stench monsters&#x27; and replace them with fresh, clean, masculine &#x27;scent elves.</li>
            <li>Will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>The fresh is my favorite scent because it is mild, clean and not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used this was 7 years ago but since then it&#x27;s been my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I like the fact that this is a blue top so it doesn&#x27;t leave marks on clothing.</li>
            <li>(Pack of 6) has a pleasant, long lasting scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, keeps you fresh and dry all day.</li>
            <li>The whole reason I loved Old Spice was due to its quality</li>
            <li>It works well for him, keeping him dry and smelling good all day even though he works outside for a living.  </li>
            <li>The high endurance line is much better than the plain original.</li>
            <li>I checked the container carefully to make sure that it wasn&#x27;t some sort of \\&quot;gag\\&quot; product.  </li>
            <li>This was my first deodorant, without the antiperspirant, and I quickly realized that it was just not enough.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I had such a reaction to a deodorant (I have tried many different brands before).</li>
            <li>This Old Spice High Endurance Fresh Scent Deodorant 3.25-Ounces</li>
            <li>Nearly every time, I&#x27;d develop an itchy rash, but I&#x27;d usually let it go because the benefit of smelling good outweighed the nuisance of the itch.</li>
            <li>It seems to be a decent - if not industrial - deodorant, though.  </li>
            <li>Or am I just getting older and stinkier?</li>
            <li>Other than the strength of the scent, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and does not leave clumps like other types of deodorant.  </li>
            <li>so I can justify buying new ones</li>
            <li>My son used Old Spice High Endurance and after a week his arm pits broke out with blisters and burns.</li>
            <li>Tracking it was pretty simple and there was not a lot of delay.</li>
            <li>The ways in which my life have changed since I began using Old Spice High Endurance Long Lasting Stick Deodorant, Fresh, 3.25-Ounce</li>
            <li>This was clearly an error on my part.    </li>
            <li>I like Old Spice</li>
            <li>My husband has been using Old Spice deodorant for 10+ years now.  </li>
            <li>This deodorant is what i was looking for as i use it twice in a day and it definately  does worth the money i spent.</li>
            <li>I work as an actor, and in my professional opinion, the Old Spice commercials are hilarious, so of course I was forced to buy some.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this brand/type a long time more than likely because I was saturated with Old Spice propaganda at a young age.  </li>
            <li>Feels so fresh and long lasting deodorant.</li>
            <li>I typically like a deodarant with little to no smell, this deodarant does give off a pretty strong smell.  </li>
            <li>I am from the US and I am a big guy and ever since sports in high school I&#x27;ve needed some decent long lasting deodorant.</li>
            <li>So I smelled my armpits a little, and both arms were filled with body odor-even though I not only took a morning shower that morning, but painted my armpits with this stuff on several coats.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this stuff worked great and actually kept me real dry under the pits (and I sweat alot).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always like Old spice , so getting 6 of them for such a price</li>
            <li>This solid gel deodorant leaves no unsightly stains on your clothing, and offers several different fragrances to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Or is it the current economic crisis that has forced them to cut back on quality ingredients and putting a new improved formula sticker on the front to cover up the miss deeds.</li>

            <li> This solid gel deodorant leaves no unsightly stains on your clothing, and offers several different fragrances to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Or is it the current economic crisis that has forced them to cut back on quality ingredients and putting a new improved formula sticker on the front to cover up the miss deeds.</li>
            <li> I carry an Irish Spring deodorant with me for similar situations like this, and had it been a long day</li>
            <li> Apparently not...  </li>
            <li> so only half the size, and b) the local cost there is about twice that of the larger product in the US.   </li>
            <li> I used this for a long time and have now stopped.  </li>
            <li> one comes in a distant second...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t rate it due to we were never able to see how it really worked.</li>
            <li> The only deodorant they have here are tiny little roll sticks or super expensive designer deodorant (40-60e x1) which are also tiny.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand an anti-perspirant, and it&#x27;s gotten harder and harder to find a simple deodorant with a non-objectionable scent.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, yesterday, I went all out in covering my armpits with this stuff thoroughly, multiple times up and down</li>
            <li> I recently bought some other brand for him to try, but he broke out so bad from it that he wasn&#x27;t able to wear deodorant for a week.  </li>
            <li> I bought this six pack months ago (and I still have like four and a half sticks of this product left).</li>
            <li> One day backstage, I was in my heavy costume, and a passing female stopped and asked \\&quot;What&#x27;s that smell?\\</li>
            <li> I never will forget the guy from New Jersey in my unit that got so desperate that he chewed the old sticks for the alcohol - Talk about a budding alcoholic.    </li>
            <li> Seriously though I have been using Old Spice for like 14 years.</li>
            <li> So here is the thing, I have a hard time finding deodorant that works well for me; apparently i ooze masculinity to the levels of the hulk.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I bought the pack because I&#x27;d purchased this product several times before in the past.</li>
            <li> We had to eventually take him to the doctor due to the extreme pain.</li>
            <li> Be careful!</li>
            <li> Other deodorants and antiperspirants would get odd smelling and cause irritation under my arms.  </li>
            <li> its lasted about 50% less.</li>
            <li> My armpits would begin to feel wet towards the middle of the day, which turned out to be uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I went to class for a few hours</li>
            <li> I would have considered trying it out longer but a few days after beginning to use it, I noticed development of a rash under my arm pits where I was applying the deodorant.</li>

            <li> I used this for a long time and have now stopped.  I am trying (quite unsuccessfully) to find a replacement.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this stuff worked great and actually kept me real dry under the pits (and I sweat alot).  I loved it.  BUT...I couldn&#x27;t figure out why all my white undershirts were getting these horrible blue colored stains...than I realized, it was this stuff.  So go figure, the only antiperpirant/deodorant that actually worked for me is also the only one that ruined my undershirts.  The consumer can never win...EVER!!!</li>
            <li> Great price. The smell is very strong and it doesn&#x27;t really last all day. I would give it about 5-6 hours. No sweat problem, but there is a mild odor issue after about 6 hours. Not the best i have used, after these are done i will use another.</li>
            <li> Just love this product - been using it ever since I grew hair on my chest!  Thank you for making this product available on Amazon.  The end user is situated in South Africa where they can get the product, but a) it is a much smaller package (35gm &#x3D; about 1.5 oz) - so only half the size, and b) the local cost there is about twice that of the larger product in the US.   My simple maths tells that&#x27;s works out at about a QUARTER of their price.  Looks the South African importers / distributors are ripping off their public!   Shame on them!    And three cheers for Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is what&#x27;s written on the container:  \\&quot;Contains odor-fighting &#x27;atomic robots&#x27; that &#x27;shoot lasers&#x27; at your &#x27;stench monsters&#x27; and replace them with fresh, clean, masculine &#x27;scent elves.&#x27;\\&quot;  I think I&#x27;ve got a pretty good sense of humor, but that is just strange to me.  I checked the container carefully to make sure that it wasn&#x27;t some sort of \\&quot;gag\\&quot; product.  Apparently not...  The deodorant itself seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Pedro from Laredo,Tx and boy how hot it gets here really hot! I really sweet around those hot temperatures. have tryed other deodorants this one is a keeper,helps me stay freshen up and not shy on waving bye or around others great product, great price,great quality no doubt about it free shipping on prime.</li>
            <li> The scent.  As in, \\&quot;throughout the house\\&quot; strong, as in \\&quot;I hope I can get used to this before bed\\&quot; strong.  Everyone walking through the room keeps asking me what I&#x27;m wearing.  The scent is not unpleasant, it&#x27;s just ... strong.    Circumstances forced me to buy this blind, and I chose \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; because I thought it might be as close to unscented as I could get.  This was clearly an error on my part.    Very strong.    It seems to be a decent - if not industrial - deodorant, though.  The mistake is mine, not theirs.  I am pretty sure the strength of the scent is a notch or two higher than one could reasonably expect, so I am hitting it a star. Other than the strength of the scent, it&#x27;s fine. If you need a linebacker for your deodorant, you might want to try this.    Note:  Not for anyone needing to sneak for a living.</li>
            <li> The High Endurance is better than the original, since it doesn&#x27;t evaporate so quickly - high alcohol content. I never will forget the guy from New Jersey in my unit that got so desperate that he chewed the old sticks for the alcohol - Talk about a budding alcoholic.    This is a deodorant. Antiperspirants can&#x27;t be good for you, and we&#x27;ll probably find that they are carcinigens (sp).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand/type a long time more than likely because I was saturated with Old Spice propaganda at a young age.  The high endurance line is much better than the plain original. I find that it works for me.</li>
            <li> Seriously though I have been using Old Spice for like 14 years. As soon as they changed their formula to last 25% longer its lasted about 50% less. What they did I do not know but I do know they should fix it. I might have to switch companies. The whole reason I loved Old Spice was due to its quality but now I just am drifting twards another.   Does anyone know what happened? Is this the failing of corporate America in supplying the people with the best products? Are they starting to make consumables like washers and driers now, made to break shortly after use. Or is it the current economic crisis that has forced them to cut back on quality ingredients and putting a new improved formula sticker on the front to cover up the miss deeds. Or am I just getting older and stinkier?</li>
            <li> This is by far the best deodorant I&#x27;ve used.  The smell is great, it stays the whole day (even more), doesn&#x27;t leave marks on clothes.  It can&#x27;t be found in Israel so I ask friends to bring it from the States. It&#x27;s that good!</li>
            <li> I read \\&quot;james126&#x27;s\\&quot; review and his experienced paralleled mine perfectly. I bought this six pack months ago (and I still have like four and a half sticks of this product left). Anyway, I bought the pack because I&#x27;d purchased this product several times before in the past. Nearly every time, I&#x27;d develop an itchy rash, but I&#x27;d usually let it go because the benefit of smelling good outweighed the nuisance of the itch. Anyway, yesterday, I went all out in covering my armpits with this stuff thoroughly, multiple times up and down and all around under each arm. I went to class for a few hours and I smelled body odor, I didn&#x27;t think it was mine because I was confident that I was thoroughly covered with this stuff. So I smelled my armpits a little, and both arms were filled with body odor-even though I not only took a morning shower that morning, but painted my armpits with this stuff on several coats. I went home and smelled my armpits and the body odor was non-existent, it pissed me off. I like Old Spice, I prefer them to Axe, but this product has proven to me that it can&#x27;t be dependable, especially in critical circumstances/situations/gatherings. What an embarrassment, I was a little angry. I carry an Irish Spring deodorant with me for similar situations like this, and had it been a long day, I would&#x27;ve used it right after class, but thankfully it wasn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m going to have to look elsewhere for something more effective or start testing out that emergency Irish Spring supply I carry around with me.</li>
            <li> I work as an actor, and in my professional opinion, the Old Spice commercials are hilarious, so of course I was forced to buy some. One day backstage, I was in my heavy costume, and a passing female stopped and asked \\&quot;What&#x27;s that smell?\\&quot; THinking of the sweat on my body, I replied: \\&quot;Man smell probably\\&quot; where she replied: \\&quot;No, it smells good\\&quot; then proceeded to start smelling me. She then felt compelled to tell as many people as she could that I smelled good, and soon a flock of females had surrounded me, and were very enthralled with my aroma. The stuff works, seriously.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using Old Spice deodorant for 10+ years now.  It works well for him, keeping him dry and smelling good all day even though he works outside for a living.  I recently bought some other brand for him to try, but he broke out so bad from it that he wasn&#x27;t able to wear deodorant for a week.  Back to using what we know works...and at such a great price on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have been using this deodorant for close to 15 years and love it.It easily lasts 24 hours and everyone around me loves the way it smells.several of my friends have started using it after smelling it and the ladies seem to love it so definitively a must use.</li>
            <li> My son used Old Spice High Endurance and after a week his arm pits broke out with blisters and burns. We had to eventually take him to the doctor due to the extreme pain. To heal he had to use A&amp;D ointment to heal. I can&#x27;t rate it due to we were never able to see how it really worked. But other wise I think it may be a good product.</li>
            <li> I love buying this in bulk because I don&#x27;t like to shop at all.  Buying 6 at a time keeps my husband in deodorant for a year!</li>
            <li> Feels so fresh and long lasting deodorant. Smells good and i like it very much. Will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> Yes this product gives off a scent, but in a good way.  I can&#x27;t stand an anti-perspirant, and it&#x27;s gotten harder and harder to find a simple deodorant with a non-objectionable scent.  This product works as advertised, as a long-lasting deodorant, and to me the smell is very pleasant.  Excellent value here with the multi-pack as well.</li>
            <li> always good, plus great value at amazon, enjoy, enjoy, enjoy. always good, plus great value at amazon, enjoy, enjoy, enjoy. always good, plus great value at amazon, enjoy, enjoy, enjoy</li>
            <li> EVERYONE knows the quality of these products, simply exlentes ... work even in the hottest day and not a drop of sweat on his T-shirt / shirt or whatever you wear ... recommended ....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never used deodorant because of an event that happened with my step dad when I was eight. I won&#x27;t get into that here. But one of my therapists thought that it was time for me to go ahead and give deodorant a try, so I bought this one. The ways in which my life have changed since I began using Old Spice High Endurance Long Lasting Stick Deodorant, Fresh, 3.25-Ounce Stick are ineffable. All I can say is that I have discovered the world of underarm hygiene and it is good. Now I cannot imagine starting my day without slathering this stuff under my pits. Sometimes I think I get carried away with it, but I don&#x27;t care. I&#x27;m making up for lost time. I do wish, however, that I did not buy the six pack. I may give some away so I can justify buying new ones (there are so many that I want to try). If you&#x27;re in limbo about which deodorant to buy, or if you&#x27;re just starting out like me, I can vouch for the good folks at Old Spice, this stuff is superb.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is the only one that actually works for me.  Other deodorants and antiperspirants would get odd smelling and cause irritation under my arms.  But the Old Spice high endurance deodorants have made me so much more confident, as corny as that sounds.  I don&#x27;t think it is meant to, but it stops my underarms from sweating a lot too. The fresh is my favorite scent because it is mild, clean and not overwhelming.  The mountain rush smells good too! Amazon.com is the place to get it; you get a lot more for your money, compared to drug stores.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend found this deal and I got it for him. He loves the product. Tracking it was pretty simple and there was not a lot of delay. Over all, it was a good purchase</li>
            <li> great product great price</li>
            <li> The smell was outstanding, one of the most enjoyable of the whole Old Spice line-up (Denali also has an amazing smell). This was my first deodorant, without the antiperspirant, and I quickly realized that it was just not enough. My armpits would begin to feel wet towards the middle of the day, which turned out to be uncomfortable. I would have considered trying it out longer but a few days after beginning to use it, I noticed development of a rash under my arm pits where I was applying the deodorant. This was the first time I had such a reaction to a deodorant (I have tried many different brands before).</li>
            <li> My husband burned his pits with this stuff. Took off a couple of layers of skin. He needed antibiotics and couldn&#x27;t wear any deodorant for a couple of weeks. Be careful!</li>
            <li> Excellent product with the best service that reflects the reliability of Amazon. The product came in excellent condition at the other side of the Atlantic, it was as described and the Amazon team did their best for a secure, frustration free transaction. This deodorant is what i was looking for as i use it twice in a day and it definately  does worth the money i spent. Hope to find it again when i will return for buying  some sticks when mine are out.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this was 7 years ago but since then it&#x27;s been my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;I happened to look for it one day online and there you have it!!! Excellent price Too!!</li>
            <li> had to find something to replace  the all time champion (speed stick -fresh (deodorant) (why they discontinued the most amazing deodorant in the world.. i have no idea.. silly fools!)&lt;br /&gt;this one comes in a distant second...</li>
            <li> I typically like a deodarant with little to no smell, this deodarant does give off a pretty strong smell.  It&#x27;s not a bad smell but its definately like a not-so-strong-cologne.  Anyway it works as intended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Old Spice products ever since I was a teenager many years ago. This Old Spice High Endurance Fresh Scent Deodorant 3.25-Ounces (Pack of 6) has a pleasant, long lasting scent. It&#x27;s easy to apply, keeps you fresh and dry all day. This solid gel deodorant leaves no unsightly stains on your clothing, and offers several different fragrances to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please rate this review if you found it helpful.</li>
            <li> My deo is that your sitting here reading reviews, this product smells great (i get the fresh scent) and incredibly cheap compared to department stores. My advice? stock up!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always like Old spice , so getting 6 of them for such a price was a steal. Great buy. Dont miss it!</li>
            <li> I apply this in the morning going to work and when I arrive 12 hours later it&#x27;s still working!  Has a good scent and stick lasts about 2 months or more.  Goes on smooth and does not leave clumps like other types of deodorant.  Not overpowering and does not stain my clothes.</li>
            <li> hoestly i didnt weaste my money and buy the item, i bought huge quantity and upto now i use it and i will buy it again</li>
            <li> So here is the thing, I have a hard time finding deodorant that works well for me; apparently i ooze masculinity to the levels of the hulk.  Basically I get about 3-6 hours of protection from this stuff.  The scent is clean and doesn&#x27;t smell like something you would find in a high school locker room.  I like the fact that this is a blue top so it doesn&#x27;t leave marks on clothing.</li>
            <li> These are $4 per stick at the store...for $17 I got 6 sticks!  Instead of a stocking stuffer for my hubby...I had to just wrap them though...too many for the stocking :)</li>
            <li> Okay... I am now living in Finland. The only deodorant they have here are tiny little roll sticks or super expensive designer deodorant (40-60e x1) which are also tiny. I am from the US and I am a big guy and ever since sports in high school I&#x27;ve needed some decent long lasting deodorant. 6 sticks of my favorite deodorant I&#x27;ve used since high school for less than 40e ^_^ 6 month supply or more AWESOME!!!</li>
