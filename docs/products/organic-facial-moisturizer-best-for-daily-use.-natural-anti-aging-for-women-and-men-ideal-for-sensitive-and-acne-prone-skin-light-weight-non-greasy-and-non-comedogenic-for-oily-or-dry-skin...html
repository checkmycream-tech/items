            <li>Because of that, the scent I would say is not so great.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer works great.</li>
            <li>Does a great job moisturizing my skin.  </li>
            <li>can use it under my makeup as a moisturizer which works great.</li>
            <li>There is no scent and did not cause any burning or stinging or anything which is a great plus since my skin is sometimes &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; to these types of products.</li>
            <li>I have also found that this works great under my mineral makeup as a primer.</li>
            <li>The bottle is very nice.</li>
            <li>Very nice product; absorbs well; doesn&#x27;t break me out</li>

            <li>The will keep in contact to make sure you are happy!</li>
            <li>So I am very happy that this moisturizer works in keeping the fine lines at bay and</li>
            <li>This is the best, most effective moisturizer of ALL I have used.  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly, there is no odor</li>
            <li>-Comedogenic\\&quot; and supposed to be good for all types because it&#x27;s non-greasy.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>I use it after serum and before primer, and it I&#x27;ve had really good luck with using it.</li>
            <li>I also love the way the product is dispensed, a dainty amount instead of globs that I have to wipe off on something.</li>
            <li>It’s super pleasant to use, the ingredients are great and it does a great job hydrating your skin.</li>
            <li>It is nice to think of the stuff going on my face being good for my skin, and not some mystery chemical that I cannot even pronounce.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this moisturizer!</li>
            <li>It is definitely refreshing!  </li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I just ordered 2 more bottles!</li>
            <li>All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>This is a nice medium thickness moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It absorbs nicely into my skin, face, hands, and everywhere else.</li>
            <li>This 1.7oz product which says to apply &amp;#34;Liberally&amp;#34; seems kind like a scam.</li>
            <li>However this review reflects my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>would have given it a 5 star if it had some kind of soothing scent to it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>When you apply it to your face it is so lightweight and feels so nice when it is on.</li>
            <li>This is a nice medium thickness moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It absorbs nicely into my skin, face, hands, and everywhere else.</li>
            <li>All reviews are written with 100% honesty from my own perspective.</li>
            <li>I adore the way it has a nice weight to it.</li>
            <li>I will be giving someone a really nice gift this year when I purchase another</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m thrilled because the consistency of the product is on the dryer side</li>
            <li>The best moisturizer I have ever tried, gentle, not greasy, absorbs well, cleared my acne.</li>
            <li>I have used Arbonne for many years and thought a change would be good for my face and pocketbook.</li>
            <li>and I love the fact that it gives me the right amount of moisture – it is not too greasy on my face and is just perfect!</li>
            <li>It is a lightweight cream that is very smooth and feels nice when it is applied.  </li>
            <li>So basically, I just want to add that Violet Online, LLC has excellent customer service and despite not being able to use this particular product</li>
            <li>Really an amazing product, 5 star for sure.</li>
            <li>I love this organic moisturizer from NaturaliDerm, as I can read and understand what kind of products have gone into it.</li>
            <li>Goes on great, is effective and makes my skin really feel nice afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, what I like even more is it reduces</li>
            <li>She has been using it for 2 weeks on a daily basis before she goes to bed and is impressed with the results.</li>
            <li>Her skin is softer and she says it feels healthier and more elastic.</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>If you like a more generous quantity, you&#x27;ll need more than one pump.  </li>
            <li>There is a pump at the bottom which pushes the product up as you dispense more</li>
            <li>One more thing that I have to say is that this moisturizer does not have any UV protection in it,</li>
            <li>so make sure you apply sunscreen before you put on the moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and it had a better UV protection.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is more neutral and fragrance-free.</li>
            <li>I love that it has aloe, witch hazel , shea butter, cocoa butter and D-panthenol.</li>
            <li>I love that it is a Michigan product</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores either but helps my makeup look even better on me.</li>
            <li>For more info, check out my blog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I love the way that the bottle looks on my dresser.</li>
            <li>The pump is solid, the lid fits on perfect.</li>
            <li>favorite part, however is the way it is so concentrated.</li>
            <li>You’ll absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s organic, my face stays moist and the itching stopped and on top of that it doesn&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li>so I will give you more feedback in another week or so.</li>

            <li>love this product, goes on smooth, skin feels better immediately.</li>
            <li>I was happy to see that the consistency is thick and creamy like most great moisturizers.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this moisturizer, it is fabulous.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*I received this item complimentary in return for my 100% honest review, all words are mine</li>
            <li>I really like this product a good deal.</li>
            <li>received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li>Overall, it is a great moisturizer - dense but light and leaves skin feeling nice and smooth- not greasy.</li>
            <li>The shea butter in it is wonderful and extremely moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Average moisturizer at best.</li>
            <li>I would not suggest using this more than once a day if you have oily skin, because it is super moisturizing</li>
            <li>This is organic, which is a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li>feel the face is silky smooth</li>
            <li>Light, moisturizing.</li>
            <li>This one just does not feel comfortable on my skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using the product for about 2 weeks now and overall it seems great.  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;I received free or discounted product in exchange for providing an unbiased review.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This facial moisturizer is also great for any skin type.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do like the moisturizer; it is light and my makeup glides over it.  </li>
            <li>I can actually pronounce them and they are great for the skin:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aloe</li>
            <li>It has all natural and organic ingredients so it is good for your skin</li>
            <li>I love how it feels and that is is absorbed quickly before my head hits the pillow.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of it on my skin because it just glides on and really absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li>The latter is true; the consistency of the product is very nice, non-greasy, and absorbs well into the skin.</li>
            <li>After using this for a week, I have noticed a significant improvement in the smoothness of my skin.</li>
            <li>I was (and kind of still am) in love with this moisturizer because it initially made my skin feel buttery smooth.</li>
            <li>I love the abundance of skin healing and skin soothing natural (mostly organic) ingredients in this light, skin plumping moisturizer.</li>
            <li>While I did receive the product to review, I will only be completely honest in my reviews!</li>
            <li>moisturizer works great, unlike other moisturizers is not greasy, and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>You must keep a clean fact and apply twice a day to keep your skin hydrated.</li>
            <li>Recommend product to everyone that wants a great natural moisturiser!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this would work for super dry skin, but it&#x27;s great on my combination skin</li>
            <li>The smell is kind of off-putting at first but dissappears within a minute or two, so I wouldn&#x27;t really consider that a con.</li>
            <li>Both hubby and I were able to us it which was very convenient not needing two separate face lotions on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li>It is indeed non-greasy and makes my skin feel smooth, not dirty.</li>
            <li>and I loved that it was an organic facial moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>A good product doesn&#x27;t need a big fuzz.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a good moisturizer for years and this is definitely the one, I have been using it for about 3 weeks now</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what I think when I smell it, which is not bad at all.</li>
            <li>No really bad ingredients in there either.</li>
            <li>I was hoping it would be more soft and smooth</li>
            <li>It absorbs in the skin really quickly</li>
            <li>The moisturizer is super hydrating</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth at first</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Though the product was not good for me, I am impressed with the customer service of the company.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a good organic Moisturizer for a long time.</li>
            <li>and she offered me a full refund right away</li>
            <li>/&gt;a person who is bothered by big pores for so many years!</li>
            <li>love that it is organic and natural.</li>
            <li>I recieved a complimentary bottle of this lotion through Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this is natural and organic.</li>
            <li>images of the packaging and listed ingredients are 100% spot on, and it&#x27;s definitely a nice product, but it simply did not work for what I needed.</li>
            <li>I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free.  </li>
            <li>I also love the natural products included and the way it makes my skin feel afterwards.</li>
            <li>The inclusion of rosemary is great (an underutilized oil, in my opinion) since it&#x27;s a natural antimicrobial which is not only fab for your skin, but works as nature&#x27;s preservative as well.</li>
            <li>I would also love to see this product containing a natural SPF ingredient for protection.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is lovely so far.</li>
            <li>I also love how there isn&#x27;t a huge fragrance especially since I apply it right before I go to sleep.</li>
            <li>had some breakouts before first trying this product, and after 1 week of continuous use, most of those breakouts started to clear away!  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;re other products I love more.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it is good.</li>
            <li>You would think it is an easy thing to find, but it took me multiple attempts with various vendors, until I finally found this product, which is just perfect for me.</li>
            <li>It is just the right thickness and absorbance to work well under makeup.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can visibly see in the video my skin changing right before your eyes.</li>
            <li>So it seems to be useful and gentle across all skin types and all ages!  </li>
            <li>After using it a few more times I started to like it better.</li>
            <li>I am too scared to go to “face doctors” and have fine lines fixed by injecting chemicals here and there.</li>
            <li>I massage 1-2 pumps on to my face after the toner, it absorbs very&lt;br /&gt;well, leaves the skin soft and smooth</li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>At first I did not like this at all.</li>
            <li>Sorry not that impressed with this product.</li>
            <li>First off this is not scent-less.</li>
            <li>I was given the opportunity to try NaturaliDerm Organic Facial Moisturizer and have been pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I love this all organic facial moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t normally check review comments, I want to throw this in here: once I posted the review, I was contacted by the company who sells the product and offered a full refund since it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>It definitely feels more taut.</li>
            <li>I like this product because it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin as SO MANY facial lotions do.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly enough and I was able to apply make up soon after applying this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend it!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>and I fell in love instantly!</li>
            <li>first time I applied this moisturizer I immediately felt a cooling sensation on my face.  </li>
            <li>i really enjoy it so far no issues rubs into skin well</li>
            <li>Than the 3rd day I woke up to smoother skin and its getting even better every day.</li>
            <li>The good thing is that the scent isn&#x27;t overpowering and after a few minutes it isn&#x27;t noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the pump applicator, it makes it easy to get as much or as little as you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>smooth, it&#x27;s moisturizing, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate at all.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s one of those rare products that actually does what is should do.</li>
            <li>I received a free product to facilitate this review but no other compensation.</li>
            <li>Okay first let me say, the box is umm well less than exciting to me.</li>
            <li>I have never ever tried an organic moisturizer before, every single kind that I had used had parabens or other kind of chemicals in it, but that was never a problem, because I do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>looked up cocoa butter’s comedogenic rating and sure enough, it’s a level 4 (out of 5), which means that there’s a fairly high chance that it will clog your pores.</li>
            <li>I can tell that my face is much smoother than it was a week ago when I started using it.</li>
            <li>Really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and absorbs fast.</li>
            <li>It doesnt end up greasy and I just have to stop rubbing it so much.</li>
            <li>It was very soothing and didn&#x27;t irritate her skin either.  </li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s what I really wanted it for.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really even pinpoint what the scent is, but I just don&#x27;t care for it much.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast as well.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s light enough that this will be my go to moisturizer in the summer when my face always feels like it&#x27;s going to slide off!</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>I was also pleased by the natural ingredients that are in this facial lotion.</li>
            <li>This is a nice lightweight moisturizer that isn&#x27;t too heavy but isn&#x27;t runny either.</li>
            <li>No scary random chemicals - all healthy ingredients for my skin.... love that.</li>
            <li>you have normal skin, then go for it!</li>
            <li>love this product and it will easily become a regular part of my everyday</li>
            <li>Simple and clean.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have seen a cardboard box that was completely covered with a protective plastic shrink sleeve.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer is a crisp combination of organic and natural ingredients that soothe my skin.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have seen a cardboard box that was completely covered with a protective plastic shrink sleeve.</li>
            <li>For me scent gets a major priority when buying any cosmetic products right after the issues that it would address.&lt;br /&gt;Apart from the scent it does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>It is oil free and made for both dry skin and oily skin.</li>
            <li>sunscreen built in and goes on very smooth with...very little amount required compared with this product.</li>
            <li>so you always see exactly how much product you have left.    </li>
            <li>I have normal skin and this moisturizer does not bother my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a tad on the thick side, but for me and my dry skin it’s great.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough positive about this product!  </li>
            <li>You hardly need more than a pea sized amount to fully cover your whole face and neck.</li>
            <li>I have super dry skin.</li>
            <li>I wanted the product with only natural ingredients and no artificial cosmetic trash.</li>
            <li>It does not irritate my very sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li>These are some amazing ingredients that offer various benefits such as anti-oxidants, anti-inflammatory properties, anti-aging, and even provides minimal UV protection.</li>
            <li>That is the ultimate in tamper evident packaging - there is no way to get into that bottle without tearing the plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It made my make up glide on so much smoother and no dry patches!</li>
            <li>I only need one pump for my entire face; which is great because, there is only a small amount in the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive skin due to past chemotherapy and hoped this would be ok since it is advertised as safe for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>You can also clearly see the remaining product in the bottle because it is clear.</li>
            <li>also like the way that the bottle is well and clearly labeled.</li>
            <li>It is not harsh on my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It is odorless and leaves my wife&#x27;s skin feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>I have let my 14 year old daughter use this cream as well</li>
            <li>It is complete non reactive with my skin.</li>
            <li>I apply it after Thayer&#x27;s witch hazel and my skin has improved markedly in 1 week.    </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin NOT acne prone or oily or anything and not peeling or cracking</li>
            <li>I appreciate an all natural product</li>
            <li>My biggest problem with this product is it dries my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer comes in a professional looking box, inside the box there is a pump style tube which I would say makes it easier and non-messy to use the moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It is paraben-free and contains natural vitamins.</li>
            <li>It is odorless and leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the smell of the product but, thankfully it only lasts until the product dries and the skin absorbs it; then I can&#x27;t smell it anymore.  </li>
            <li>There is no irritation when I use it and it leaves my skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I instantly feel rejuvenated, smoother and very moisturized.</li>
            <li>I am always looking for natural moisturizers for my skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin does feel soft after use of this product.</li>
            <li>The NaturaliDerm Organic Facial Moisturizer is not only natural, but it is made with organic ingredients that are very beneficial for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but once it starts to dry I gently pat it instead of rubbing.</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin, absolutely give it a try; but if you&#x27;re like me with problems areas</li>
            <li>After applying this product, my skin feel fresh, hydrated and with minimal pores the next day.</li>
            <li>I actually tried to use quite a bit more and it was easier to apply on the face but still made my skin feel tight and dry.</li>
            <li>Not only is my skin sensitive, but it’s also acne-prone!</li>
            <li>It blends into my skin very smoothly, and it does not leave any sticky residues behind.</li>
            <li>After researching various natural products I decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li>Even though it is a thick consistency, it goes on light and airy.</li>
            <li>After opening the box however, I was pleasantly surprised with a bottle that is stylish and looks expensive.</li>
            <li>It took around a minute to fully absorb in my skin during that time it did feel a little sticky but as soon as it absorbed completely, my skin felt smooth and tight and no more stickiness.</li>
            <li>I have been using other products to clear and improve my skin with fine lines so after a few weeks of using these products It is making my face somewhat dry.</li>
            <li>the moisturizer is light and a small application goes a long way...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!</li>
            <li>My skin feels so much softer and so less oily using this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>So I bought this product because I have combination skin (oily T-Zone from adult onset acne but dry everywhere</li>
            <li>This becomes an extra step for me, generally I buy moisturizer that have SPF factors in it so that I can skip applying sunscreen when I am going out for a short span of time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> can use it under my makeup as a moisturizer which works great.</li>
            <li> There is no scent and did not cause any burning or stinging or anything which is a great plus since my skin is sometimes &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; to these types of products.</li>

            <li> This is the best, most effective moisturizer of ALL I have used.  </li>
            <li> Surprisingly, there is no odor</li>
            <li> -Comedogenic\\&quot; and supposed to be good for all types because it&#x27;s non-greasy.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I use it after serum and before primer, and it I&#x27;ve had really good luck with using it.</li>
            <li> I also love the way the product is dispensed, a dainty amount instead of globs that I have to wipe off on something.</li>
            <li> It’s super pleasant to use, the ingredients are great and it does a great job hydrating your skin.</li>
            <li> It is nice to think of the stuff going on my face being good for my skin, and not some mystery chemical that I cannot even pronounce.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this moisturizer!</li>
            <li> It is definitely refreshing!  </li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I just ordered 2 more bottles!</li>
            <li> All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> This is a nice medium thickness moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It absorbs nicely into my skin, face, hands, and everywhere else.</li>
            <li> This 1.7oz product which says to apply &amp;#34;Liberally&amp;#34; seems kind like a scam.</li>
            <li> However this review reflects my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> would have given it a 5 star if it had some kind of soothing scent to it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> When you apply it to your face it is so lightweight and feels so nice when it is on.</li>
            <li> This is a nice medium thickness moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It absorbs nicely into my skin, face, hands, and everywhere else.</li>
            <li> All reviews are written with 100% honesty from my own perspective.</li>
            <li> I adore the way it has a nice weight to it.</li>
            <li> I will be giving someone a really nice gift this year when I purchase another</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m thrilled because the consistency of the product is on the dryer side</li>
            <li> The best moisturizer I have ever tried, gentle, not greasy, absorbs well, cleared my acne.</li>
            <li> I have used Arbonne for many years and thought a change would be good for my face and pocketbook.</li>
            <li> and I love the fact that it gives me the right amount of moisture – it is not too greasy on my face and is just perfect!</li>
            <li> It is a lightweight cream that is very smooth and feels nice when it is applied.  </li>
            <li> So basically, I just want to add that Violet Online, LLC has excellent customer service and despite not being able to use this particular product</li>
            <li> Really an amazing product, 5 star for sure.</li>
            <li> I love this organic moisturizer from NaturaliDerm, as I can read and understand what kind of products have gone into it.</li>
            <li> Goes on great, is effective and makes my skin really feel nice afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , what I like even more is it reduces</li>
            <li> She has been using it for 2 weeks on a daily basis before she goes to bed and is impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> Her skin is softer and she says it feels healthier and more elastic.</li>
            <li> ok.</li>
            <li> If you like a more generous quantity, you&#x27;ll need more than one pump.  </li>
            <li> There is a pump at the bottom which pushes the product up as you dispense more</li>
            <li> One more thing that I have to say is that this moisturizer does not have any UV protection in it,</li>
            <li> so make sure you apply sunscreen before you put on the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and it had a better UV protection.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is more neutral and fragrance-free.</li>
            <li> I love that it has aloe, witch hazel , shea butter, cocoa butter and D-panthenol.</li>
            <li> I love that it is a Michigan product</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores either but helps my makeup look even better on me.</li>
            <li> For more info, check out my blog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I love the way that the bottle looks on my dresser.</li>
            <li> The pump is solid, the lid fits on perfect.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s organic, my face stays moist and the itching stopped and on top of that it doesn&#x27;t smell.</li>

            <li> The shea butter in it is wonderful and extremely moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Average moisturizer at best.</li>
            <li> I would not suggest using this more than once a day if you have oily skin, because it is super moisturizing</li>

            <li> feel the face is silky smooth</li>
            <li> Light, moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This one just does not feel comfortable on my skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for about 2 weeks now and overall it seems great.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I received free or discounted product in exchange for providing an unbiased review.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This facial moisturizer is also great for any skin type.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do like the moisturizer; it is light and my makeup glides over it.  </li>
            <li> I can actually pronounce them and they are great for the skin:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aloe</li>
            <li> It has all natural and organic ingredients so it is good for your skin</li>
            <li> I love how it feels and that is is absorbed quickly before my head hits the pillow.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of it on my skin because it just glides on and really absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li> The latter is true; the consistency of the product is very nice, non-greasy, and absorbs well into the skin.</li>

            <li> Recommend product to everyone that wants a great natural moisturiser!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this would work for super dry skin, but it&#x27;s great on my combination skin</li>
            <li> The smell is kind of off-putting at first but dissappears within a minute or two, so I wouldn&#x27;t really consider that a con.</li>
            <li> Both hubby and I were able to us it which was very convenient not needing two separate face lotions on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li> It is indeed non-greasy and makes my skin feel smooth, not dirty.</li>
            <li> and I loved that it was an organic facial moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> A good product doesn&#x27;t need a big fuzz.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good moisturizer for years and this is definitely the one, I have been using it for about 3 weeks now</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what I think when I smell it, which is not bad at all.</li>
            <li> No really bad ingredients in there either.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would be more soft and smooth</li>
            <li> It absorbs in the skin really quickly</li>
            <li> The moisturizer is super hydrating</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth at first</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Though the product was not good for me, I am impressed with the customer service of the company.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good organic Moisturizer for a long time.</li>
            <li> and she offered me a full refund right away</li>
            <li> /&gt;a person who is bothered by big pores for so many years!</li>
            <li> love that it is organic and natural.</li>
            <li> I recieved a complimentary bottle of this lotion through Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this is natural and organic.</li>
            <li> images of the packaging and listed ingredients are 100% spot on, and it&#x27;s definitely a nice product, but it simply did not work for what I needed.</li>
            <li> I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free.  </li>
            <li> I also love the natural products included and the way it makes my skin feel afterwards.</li>
            <li> The inclusion of rosemary is great (an underutilized oil, in my opinion) since it&#x27;s a natural antimicrobial which is not only fab for your skin, but works as nature&#x27;s preservative as well.</li>
            <li> I would also love to see this product containing a natural SPF ingredient for protection.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is lovely so far.</li>
            <li> I also love how there isn&#x27;t a huge fragrance especially since I apply it right before I go to sleep.</li>
            <li> had some breakouts before first trying this product, and after 1 week of continuous use, most of those breakouts started to clear away!  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;re other products I love more.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it is good.</li>
            <li> You would think it is an easy thing to find, but it took me multiple attempts with various vendors, until I finally found this product, which is just perfect for me.</li>
            <li> It is just the right thickness and absorbance to work well under makeup.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can visibly see in the video my skin changing right before your eyes.</li>
            <li> So it seems to be useful and gentle across all skin types and all ages!  </li>
            <li> After using it a few more times I started to like it better.</li>
            <li> I am too scared to go to “face doctors” and have fine lines fixed by injecting chemicals here and there.</li>
            <li> I massage 1-2 pumps on to my face after the toner, it absorbs very&lt;br /&gt;well, leaves the skin soft and smooth</li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> At first I did not like this at all.</li>
            <li> Sorry not that impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> First off this is not scent-less.</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to try NaturaliDerm Organic Facial Moisturizer and have been pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I love this all organic facial moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t normally check review comments, I want to throw this in here: once I posted the review, I was contacted by the company who sells the product and offered a full refund since it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> It definitely feels more taut.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin as SO MANY facial lotions do.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly enough and I was able to apply make up soon after applying this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> and I fell in love instantly!</li>
            <li> first time I applied this moisturizer I immediately felt a cooling sensation on my face.  </li>
            <li> i really enjoy it so far no issues rubs into skin well</li>
            <li> Than the 3rd day I woke up to smoother skin and its getting even better every day.</li>
            <li> The good thing is that the scent isn&#x27;t overpowering and after a few minutes it isn&#x27;t noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the pump applicator, it makes it easy to get as much or as little as you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> smooth, it&#x27;s moisturizing, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate at all.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s one of those rare products that actually does what is should do.</li>
            <li> I received a free product to facilitate this review but no other compensation.</li>
            <li> Okay first let me say, the box is umm well less than exciting to me.</li>
            <li> I have never ever tried an organic moisturizer before, every single kind that I had used had parabens or other kind of chemicals in it, but that was never a problem, because I do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> looked up cocoa butter’s comedogenic rating and sure enough, it’s a level 4 (out of 5), which means that there’s a fairly high chance that it will clog your pores.</li>
            <li> I can tell that my face is much smoother than it was a week ago when I started using it.</li>
            <li> Really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and absorbs fast.</li>
            <li> It doesnt end up greasy and I just have to stop rubbing it so much.</li>
            <li> It was very soothing and didn&#x27;t irritate her skin either.  </li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s what I really wanted it for.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really even pinpoint what the scent is, but I just don&#x27;t care for it much.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast as well.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s light enough that this will be my go to moisturizer in the summer when my face always feels like it&#x27;s going to slide off!</li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> I was also pleased by the natural ingredients that are in this facial lotion.</li>
            <li> This is a nice lightweight moisturizer that isn&#x27;t too heavy but isn&#x27;t runny either.</li>
            <li> No scary random chemicals - all healthy ingredients for my skin.... love that.</li>
            <li> you have normal skin, then go for it!</li>
            <li> love this product and it will easily become a regular part of my everyday</li>
            <li> Simple and clean.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have seen a cardboard box that was completely covered with a protective plastic shrink sleeve.  </li>
            <li> This moisturizer is a crisp combination of organic and natural ingredients that soothe my skin.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have seen a cardboard box that was completely covered with a protective plastic shrink sleeve.</li>
            <li> For me scent gets a major priority when buying any cosmetic products right after the issues that it would address.&lt;br /&gt;Apart from the scent it does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> It is oil free and made for both dry skin and oily skin.</li>
            <li> sunscreen built in and goes on very smooth with...very little amount required compared with this product.</li>
            <li> so you always see exactly how much product you have left.    </li>
            <li> I have normal skin and this moisturizer does not bother my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a tad on the thick side, but for me and my dry skin it’s great.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough positive about this product!  </li>
            <li> You hardly need more than a pea sized amount to fully cover your whole face and neck.</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin.</li>
            <li> I wanted the product with only natural ingredients and no artificial cosmetic trash.</li>
            <li> It does not irritate my very sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li> These are some amazing ingredients that offer various benefits such as anti-oxidants, anti-inflammatory properties, anti-aging, and even provides minimal UV protection.</li>
            <li> That is the ultimate in tamper evident packaging - there is no way to get into that bottle without tearing the plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It made my make up glide on so much smoother and no dry patches!</li>
            <li> I only need one pump for my entire face; which is great because, there is only a small amount in the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin due to past chemotherapy and hoped this would be ok since it is advertised as safe for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> You can also clearly see the remaining product in the bottle because it is clear.</li>
            <li> also like the way that the bottle is well and clearly labeled.</li>
            <li> It is not harsh on my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It is odorless and leaves my wife&#x27;s skin feeling soft.  </li>
            <li> I have let my 14 year old daughter use this cream as well</li>
            <li> It is complete non reactive with my skin.</li>
            <li> I apply it after Thayer&#x27;s witch hazel and my skin has improved markedly in 1 week.    </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin NOT acne prone or oily or anything and not peeling or cracking</li>
            <li> I appreciate an all natural product</li>
            <li> My biggest problem with this product is it dries my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer comes in a professional looking box, inside the box there is a pump style tube which I would say makes it easier and non-messy to use the moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It is paraben-free and contains natural vitamins.</li>
            <li> It is odorless and leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the smell of the product but, thankfully it only lasts until the product dries and the skin absorbs it; then I can&#x27;t smell it anymore.  </li>
            <li> There is no irritation when I use it and it leaves my skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I instantly feel rejuvenated, smoother and very moisturized.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for natural moisturizers for my skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin does feel soft after use of this product.</li>
            <li> The NaturaliDerm Organic Facial Moisturizer is not only natural, but it is made with organic ingredients that are very beneficial for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but once it starts to dry I gently pat it instead of rubbing.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, absolutely give it a try; but if you&#x27;re like me with problems areas</li>
            <li> After applying this product, my skin feel fresh, hydrated and with minimal pores the next day.</li>
            <li> I actually tried to use quite a bit more and it was easier to apply on the face but still made my skin feel tight and dry.</li>
            <li> Not only is my skin sensitive, but it’s also acne-prone!</li>
            <li> It blends into my skin very smoothly, and it does not leave any sticky residues behind.</li>
            <li> After researching various natural products I decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> Even though it is a thick consistency, it goes on light and airy.</li>
            <li> After opening the box however, I was pleasantly surprised with a bottle that is stylish and looks expensive.</li>
            <li> It took around a minute to fully absorb in my skin during that time it did feel a little sticky but as soon as it absorbed completely, my skin felt smooth and tight and no more stickiness.</li>
            <li> I have been using other products to clear and improve my skin with fine lines so after a few weeks of using these products It is making my face somewhat dry.</li>
            <li> the moisturizer is light and a small application goes a long way...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!</li>
            <li> My skin feels so much softer and so less oily using this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> So I bought this product because I have combination skin (oily T-Zone from adult onset acne but dry everywhere</li>
            <li> This becomes an extra step for me, generally I buy moisturizer that have SPF factors in it so that I can skip applying sunscreen when I am going out for a short span of time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> She says her face feels so soft and has not caused any break outs, which is no something she has with other</li>
            <li> Besides the main ingredients, this lotion features cucumber, rosemary and green tea extracts.</li>
            <li> Love that this product contains only good ingredients, none of the bad stuff like parabens &amp; artificial chemicals.</li>
            <li> This organic facial moisturizer is what I&#x27;ve been searching for a long time.</li>
            <li> I would probably dry up like the Sahara desert and flake away, especially in the winter weather.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer left my face feeling SO dry.</li>
            <li> After using Naturaliderm&#x27;s  moisurizer for only a few days, I noticed a marked improvement in hydration.</li>
            <li> and then my face felt sticky and still dry.</li>
            <li> My skin used to get dry all of the time</li>
            <li> After washing my face I patted it dry and applied a liberal amount of the moisturizer on my face.</li>
            <li> It seems to keep the dry skin at bay</li>
            <li> I was sent this for review, and I think it is an OPTIMAL choice for dry skin.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, and the key with this moisturizer is to massage it into the skin so that it fully absorbs into the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different products and have been using Jack Black during the day but wanted something for the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Jack Black Double Duty Face Moisturizer at 3.3oz or the Aveeno Ageless (yeah</li>
            <li> Again I reference Jack Black Double Duty which has &amp;#34;real&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and</li>
            <li> The quantity is also a little low for the amount of product that you receive.</li>
            <li> so you only need a little.</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit to moisturize your face.</li>
            <li> I have such a hard time finding products that are well suited for my skin, especially when it comes to moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have combination skin so finding the right lotions is usually a difficult task.</li>
            <li> However, after 5-6 days of use, my skin started to break out in small red bumps along the bridge of my nose and around my mouth.</li>
            <li> This is due to the Aloe ingredient.  </li>
            <li> - I also don&#x27;t feel like my skin is extremely moisturized - but it works well.</li>
            <li> so I have to be very careful of the creams I use on my face.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and had hard time to find something that will not be harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been applying the facial moisturizer for a few weeks now, my skin feels supple, firm and thoroughly hydrated...</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way!</li>
            <li> I love the aloe base and the consistency - and the fact that this basically disappears into my skin as soon as it is rubbed in.</li>
            <li> Dark spots are even less.</li>
            <li> I live in Michigan, and have been looking for ages for a moisturizer that will prevent my skin from going dry and itchy when the cold season starts, but on the other hand doesn&#x27;t leave me smelling like a herb garden.</li>
            <li> For reference, I use three pumps of Jack Black for face, neck, and ears.</li>
            <li> It also lasted all day, unlike the lotion I had been using previously.</li>
            <li> t’s not greasy and my skin was never a greasy mess by the end of the day either - so it helped to keep my oil production at bay.</li>
            <li> I like that the cap fits tightly with the bottle.</li>
            <li> let&#x27;s get down to the nitty-gritty!</li>
            <li> and as I was rubbing it into my face it dried up and was not smooth.</li>
            <li> If  you are only applying a thin layer to your face,one pump will do.</li>
            <li> I purchased during the recent sale approximately $17.</li>
            <li> May be all these natural ingredients in the moisturizer are the reason for it weird scent, which I did not like.</li>
            <li> but it is non-greasy and not at all heavy.</li>
            <li> The makeup doesn&#x27;t peel off or have trouble on her skin.</li>
            <li> The scent does go away within a few minutes after it has been applied.</li>
            <li> After I stopped using the product for a few days, those bumps started to disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the smell.</li>
            <li> I do not think it is a bad product for the general population, just for people with sensitive skin or at least me.</li>
            <li> Also there is no strong scent that you have to deal with.</li>
            <li> The pump delivers a small ribbon of moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and it was getting tiresome to reapply lotion on my face, but this product actually kept my skin hydrated throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I am not sure about the wrinkle reduction, since wrinkles form as part of being dehydrated, which I often am.</li>
            <li> The pump delivers a small ribbon of moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if my skin feels moistened after I&#x27;m done with this lotion.</li>
            <li> This product is all natural and contains no parabens, artificial fragrance or colors.</li>
            <li> if I had known earlier, I would have passed on to someone else to try, but unfortunately, I had already sent out the package.  </li>
            <li> It does not feel moisturizing in the least bit.</li>
            <li> It made me feel I was being pampered and was free of nasty chemicals.</li>
            <li> It  is thick moisturizer</li>
            <li> It is not a particularly pleasant smell and I would prefer as close to a no scent as in Cetaphil Moisturizer scent versus this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you apply thin layer to face and neck, you&#x27;ll need two pumps.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t at all irritating or loaded with perfume.  </li>
            <li> However, it made my breakouts worse</li>
            <li> Used it for 2 days-morning and night-and was concerned the wrinkles on my face seemed even worse.</li>
            <li> However, it does leave a faint smell</li>
            <li> I will stick with this; its not going into my graveyard for moisturizers that failed.</li>
            <li> I like that the moisturizer doesn’t contain parabens, artificial fragrance, and/or artificial color.</li>
            <li> i tried very expensive products and it was just a wast of money.</li>
            <li> but it is not overbearing or bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used an organic face moisturizer before, but I am definitely disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a moisturizer that could minimize my pore size while keeping&lt;br /&gt;my skin moist, heard from my friend about this organic one. It works great&lt;br /&gt;on me! I massage 1-2 pumps on to my face after the toner, it absorbs very&lt;br /&gt;well, leaves the skin soft and smooth, what I like even more is it reduces&lt;br /&gt;my pore size and keeps my skin moist all night. When I wake up in the morning, I&lt;br /&gt;could feel the face is silky smooth, you never know what a feeling it is for&lt;br /&gt;a person who is bothered by big pores for so many years! And it does not&lt;br /&gt;cause breakouts for me! Really an amazing product, 5 star for sure.</li>
            <li> I have been applying the facial moisturizer for a few weeks now, my skin feels supple, firm and thoroughly hydrated...the moisturizer is light and a small application goes a long way...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!</li>
            <li> love this product, goes on smooth, skin feels better immediately.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, very moisturizing and not greasy at all, smells very clean, almost like an almond scent.</li>
            <li> Wee loved it! It’s super pleasant to use, the ingredients are great and it does a great job hydrating your skin. Both hubby and I were able to us it which was very convenient not needing two separate face lotions on the bathroom counter. Overall, it is a great moisturizer - dense but light and leaves skin feeling nice and smooth- not greasy. I received a free product to facilitate this review but no other compensation. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I love this organic moisturizer from NaturaliDerm, as I can read and understand what kind of products have gone into it. It is not harsh on my sensitive skin and I love the fact that it gives me the right amount of moisture – it is not too greasy on my face and is just perfect! I am too scared to go to “face doctors” and have fine lines fixed by injecting chemicals here and there. So I am very happy that this moisturizer works in keeping the fine lines at bay and my face well moisturized!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> I bought this face moisturizing cream for my wife. She has been using it for 2 weeks on a daily basis before she goes to bed and is impressed with the results. Her skin is softer and she says it feels healthier and more elastic. She&#x27;s also found that it rejuvenates her face and helps with dryness.  In summary, wife has been impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> My mother just started using this and say she loves the way it tightens her skin around her eyes and lips. She put it on before going to work and said she already started feeling like she was looking younger.</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin. It is not even funny… If I did not use lotion or moisturizer I would probably dry up like the Sahara desert and flake away, especially in the winter weather. That’s probably an over exaggeration… But you get the idea.&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I received this organic facial moisturizer from NaturaliDerm to try and review. I like this stuff! It is a tad on the thick side, but for me and my dry skin it’s great. I would not suggest using this more than once a day if you have oily skin, because it is super moisturizing… If you don’t need it, don’t overdo this moisturizer! It has all natural and organic ingredients so it is good for your skin and you don’t have to worry about what you are putting on your face. This moisturizer also includes green tea extract that really wakes up your skin in the mornings. It feels great!&lt;br /&gt;NaturaliDerm is a great company with good product and perfect customer service. The will keep in contact to make sure you are happy!</li>
            <li> This is a nice medium thickness moisturizer. It absorbs nicely into my skin, face, hands, and everywhere else. It is odorless and leaves my wife&#x27;s skin feeling soft.  She loves this stuff.  The bottle is very nice. The pump delivers a small ribbon of moisturizer. This is the first time I have seen a cardboard box that was completely covered with a protective plastic shrink sleeve.  Definitely not disappointed with this stuff!  I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best moisturizing cream that I have used in a long time.  It is a lightweight cream that is very smooth and feels nice when it is applied.  I have allergies and asthma so I have to be very careful of the creams I use on my face.  This cream has no scent which is great for my family.  I can tell that my face is much smoother than it was a week ago when I started using it. I have let my 14 year old daughter use this cream as well and she loves it.  She says her face feels so soft and has not caused any break outs, which is no something she has with other creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it is organic and natural.</li>
            <li> Really like this stuff. Great moisturizer! Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and absorbs fast. Like the way it makes my skin feel. Would&lt;br /&gt;definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> At first I did not like this at all. It felt like it was going to be greasy and as I was rubbing it into my face it dried up and was not smooth. After using it a few more times I started to like it better. I just was expecting it to be different. It doesnt end up greasy and I just have to stop rubbing it so much. It goes on smooth at first but once it starts to dry I gently pat it instead of rubbing. I was hoping it would be more soft and smooth but it does the job ok.</li>
            <li> Light, moisturizing. It does not irritate my very sensitive skin at all. I have oily skin and it does not make it greasier. This product does not cause any type of sensation on my skin once I apply it. It is complete non reactive with my skin. I can not say I have ever experienced this before. I apply it after Thayer&#x27;s witch hazel and my skin has improved markedly in 1 week.    I use 1 to 2 pumps. If  you are only applying a thin layer to your face,one pump will do. If you apply thin layer to face and neck, you&#x27;ll need two pumps. If you like a more generous quantity, you&#x27;ll need more than one pump.  You can also clearly see the remaining product in the bottle because it is clear. There is a pump at the bottom which pushes the product up as you dispense more so you always see exactly how much product you have left.    This is the best, most effective moisturizer of ALL I have used.  And the price can&#x27;t be beat!! I have no reason to try another moisturizer after using this one.</li>
            <li> Sorry not that impressed with this product. I purchased during the recent sale approximately $17. I have sensitive skin NOT acne prone or oily or anything and not peeling or cracking but I do need moisturizer. I&#x27;ve tried different products and have been using Jack Black during the day but wanted something for the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. First off this is not scent-less. I appreciate an all natural product but it smells like a plant. In the sense that if you cut a plant stem open and then rubbed that on your face. My wife can smell it on me as well. It is not a particularly pleasant smell and I would prefer as close to a no scent as in Cetaphil Moisturizer scent versus this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The quantity is also a little low for the amount of product that you receive. See: Jack Black Double Duty Face Moisturizer at 3.3oz or the Aveeno Ageless (yeah parabens).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. My biggest problem with this product is it dries my sensitive skin. It does not feel moisturizing in the least bit. I probably would not have written a review if this was not a problem. Again I reference Jack Black Double Duty which has &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; sunscreen built in and goes on very smooth with...very little amount required compared with this product. This 1.7oz product which says to apply &amp;#34;Liberally&amp;#34; seems kind like a scam. Do I need to use 10% of the bottle every night? I actually tried to use quite a bit more and it was easier to apply on the face but still made my skin feel tight and dry. Three pumps of this felt like the consistency of dirt on my face. For reference, I use three pumps of Jack Black for face, neck, and ears. Aveeno Daily Moisturizer with sunscreen I had applied 2 pumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t be used as a sunscreen so it&#x27;s strictly for nighttime? I bought this product because it did not have sunscreen so that I could put something on at night in place of Aveeno night cream. This one just does not feel comfortable on my skin and I don&#x27;t like feeling like a plant when I go to bed.ed.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough positive about this product!  As a middle-aged woman, the moisturizer was wonderful on my winter-dried skin.  It wasn&#x27;t at all irritating or loaded with perfume.  My preteen daughter who is starting to breakout, used this moisturizer and it didn&#x27;t clog her pores or irritate her skin -- one of the only ones she has tried that didn&#x27;t.  Finally, I gave it to my mother who is undergoing chemo and has fragile skin.  It was very soothing and didn&#x27;t irritate her skin either.  So it seems to be useful and gentle across all skin types and all ages!  A great product.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer left my face feeling SO dry. It absorbs in the skin really quickly and then my face felt sticky and still dry. I&#x27;ve never used an organic face moisturizer before, but I am definitely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I recieved a complimentary bottle of this lotion through Tomoson.com. However this review reflects my honest opinion. I was very pleased with the facial moisturizer. I have very dry skin and this lotion moisturized without leaving my face feeling greasy. It also lasted all day, unlike the lotion I had been using previously. I was also pleased by the natural ingredients that are in this facial lotion. I feel good about using it on my skin and have been very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful! Tried it for testing purposes from this wonderful family run-business, who I may add has had great communication with me over my satisfaction of this product. My skin used to get dry all of the time and it was getting tiresome to reapply lotion on my face, but this product actually kept my skin hydrated throughout the day. It&#x27;s also lightweight and non-greasy with no Parabens so that&#x27;s an added pro. The smell is kind of off-putting at first but dissappears within a minute or two, so I wouldn&#x27;t really consider that a con. You must keep a clean fact and apply twice a day to keep your skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is a crisp combination of organic and natural ingredients that soothe my skin. I love the aloe base and the consistency - and the fact that this basically disappears into my skin as soon as it is rubbed in. Besides the main ingredients, this lotion features cucumber, rosemary and green tea extracts. Surprisingly, there is no odor whatever to this lotion, a wonderful way to go to bed, with no lingering scent  around my nose. I am not sure about the wrinkle reduction, since wrinkles form as part of being dehydrated, which I often am. But I will definitely keep this on my nightstand this winter. I love how it feels and that is is absorbed quickly before my head hits the pillow.</li>
            <li> I have never ever tried an organic moisturizer before, every single kind that I had used had parabens or other kind of chemicals in it, but that was never a problem, because I do not have sensitive skin. The NaturaliDerm Moisturizer being Organic caught my eye and I was eager to try it out. So when I got the chance to review the product after testing it, I never gave it a second thought.&lt;br /&gt;I received the product within 2 days after ordering it from Amazon with Prime membership. The moisturizer comes in a professional looking box, inside the box there is a pump style tube which I would say makes it easier and non-messy to use the moisturizer.  The key ingredients of the moisturizer are Aloe leaf juice, Shea butter, Witch Hazel extract and Cocoa Butter. May be all these natural ingredients in the moisturizer are the reason for it weird scent, which I did not like. For me scent gets a major priority when buying any cosmetic products right after the issues that it would address.&lt;br /&gt;Apart from the scent it does what it is supposed to do. The moisturizer is super hydrating but it is non-greasy and not at all heavy. After washing my face I patted it dry and applied a liberal amount of the moisturizer on my face. It took around a minute to fully absorb in my skin during that time it did feel a little sticky but as soon as it absorbed completely, my skin felt smooth and tight and no more stickiness. One more thing that I have to say is that this moisturizer does not have any UV protection in it, so make sure you apply sunscreen before you put on the moisturizer. This becomes an extra step for me, generally I buy moisturizer that have SPF factors in it so that I can skip applying sunscreen when I am going out for a short span of time.&lt;br /&gt;I would have given it a 5 star if it had some kind of soothing scent to it and it had a better UV protection.&lt;br /&gt;***I received the product to test and give my unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;****It did not come with the plush toys in the picture.</li>
            <li> Very nice product; absorbs well; doesn&#x27;t break me out (I am 59); not greasy; would probably purchase again.</li>
            <li> I do a lot of traveling, and every where I go seems to be in a different season and this has been wreaking havoc on my skin. I have combination skin so finding the right lotions is usually a difficult task. I was given the opportunity to try NaturaliDerm Organic Facial Moisturizer and have been pleased with the results. The lotion has a medium thickness that absorbs quickly and has a light pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.&lt;br /&gt;Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this is natural and organic. After using this for a week, I have noticed a significant improvement in the smoothness of my skin. It  is thick moisturizer so you only need a little. When you apply it to your face it is so lightweight and feels so nice when it is on. I have been using other products to clear and improve my skin with fine lines so after a few weeks of using these products It is making my face somewhat dry. Organic Facial Moisturizer once applied takes that feeling of dryness away. I do have oily skin and this does not at all make my face feel oily.It is oil free and made for both dry skin and oily skin. I never use moisturizer because it always made my face oily. I do suffer from acne prone skin so this is a perfect product for me. It is paraben-free and contains natural vitamins. It also contains- Aloe leaf juice, Shea butter, Witch Hazel extract and Cocoa Butter. My skin feels so much softer and so less oily using this moisturizer. Very Happy !!!</li>
            <li> I love this all organic facial moisturizer.  It has a wonderful scent and goes on like silk.  You hardly need more than a pea sized amount to fully cover your whole face and neck.</li>
            <li> So I bought this product because I have combination skin (oily T-Zone from adult onset acne but dry everywhere else)--the selling point was that is \\&quot;Non-Comedogenic\\&quot; and supposed to be good for all types because it&#x27;s non-greasy. The latter is true; the consistency of the product is very nice, non-greasy, and absorbs well into the skin. However, it made my breakouts worse so it&#x27;s definitely not meant for \\&quot;sensitive/acne-prone\\&quot; skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The images of the packaging and listed ingredients are 100% spot on, and it&#x27;s definitely a nice product, but it simply did not work for what I needed. If you have dry skin, absolutely give it a try; but if you&#x27;re like me with problems areas then I recommend keep looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Edit**&lt;br /&gt;In case you don&#x27;t normally check review comments, I want to throw this in here: once I posted the review, I was contacted by the company who sells the product and offered a full refund since it didn&#x27;t work for me. So basically, I just want to add that Violet Online, LLC has excellent customer service and despite not being able to use this particular product, I will definitely purchase from them again!</li>
            <li> This organic facial moisturizer is what I&#x27;ve been searching for a long time. I wanted the product with only natural ingredients and no artificial cosmetic trash. Because of that, the scent I would say is not so great. It is more neutral and fragrance-free. After applying this product, my skin feel fresh, hydrated and with minimal pores the next day. I love that it has aloe, witch hazel , shea butter, cocoa butter and D-panthenol. I think I will buy it for my Christmas basket for my sister and mom</li>
            <li> Awesome moisturizer.will forever use this product it&#x27;s so amazing.will recommend it to family and friends.</li>
            <li> This is a nice medium thickness moisturizer. It absorbs nicely into my skin, face, hands, and everywhere else. It is odorless and leaves my skin feeling soft. I like applying this after a hyaluronic acid lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife has found that she can apply make up after using this. The makeup doesn&#x27;t peel off or have trouble on her skin. It is just the right thickness and absorbance to work well under makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is very nice. The pump delivers a small ribbon of moisturizer. This is the first time I have seen a cardboard box that was completely covered with a protective plastic shrink sleeve. That is the ultimate in tamper evident packaging - there is no way to get into that bottle without tearing the plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a review sample.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if my skin feels moistened after I&#x27;m done with this lotion. It definitely feels more taut. I use it every day, twice a day. I&#x27;m hoping &amp;#34;taut&amp;#34; translates to firmer and fewer wrinkles over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not fruit and flowers. It&#x27;s labeled organic. Can that be a scent? That&#x27;s what I think when I smell it, which is not bad at all. It&#x27;s just a scent that means business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This product was provided for review by NaturaliDerm.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this moisturizer! This moisturizer works great. It is organic without all that yucky stuff in it. You only need a little bit to moisturize your face. It is non greasy also. I give this product a five star review.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. It is indeed non-greasy and makes my skin feel smooth, not dirty. No really bad ingredients in there either.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for about 2 weeks now and overall it seems great.  Does a great job moisturizing my skin.  Doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.  I only need one pump for my entire face; which is great because, there is only a small amount in the bottle.  I really don&#x27;t like the smell of the product but, thankfully it only lasts until the product dries and the skin absorbs it; then I can&#x27;t smell it anymore.  I love that it is a Michigan product and I wish this company the best.</li>
            <li> This is very nice, not greasy. I can feel it working, even under my makeup.</li>
            <li> I received this for a review and I loved that it was an organic facial moisturizer.  It made me feel I was being pampered and was free of nasty chemicals.</li>
            <li> I like that the moisturizer doesn’t contain parabens, artificial fragrance, and/or artificial color. The moisturizer is also organic and lightweight. However, it does leave a faint smell but it is not overbearing or bad. The scent does go away within a few minutes after it has been applied. It comes in a pump bottle which allows me to have control over the amount that I want. I like that the cap fits tightly with the bottle. This helps me prevent any spillage when I travel with it. It blends into my skin very smoothly, and it does not leave any sticky residues behind. I have normal skin and this moisturizer does not bother my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FTC: I was sent this moisturizer for review through Tomoson. All reviews are written with 100% honesty from my own perspective. #NaturaliDerm</li>
            <li> I like this product because it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin as SO MANY facial lotions do.  It seems to keep the dry skin at bay and that&#x27;s what I really wanted it for.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> This is a nice lightweight moisturizer that isn&#x27;t too heavy but isn&#x27;t runny either. I love the feel of it on my skin because it just glides on and really absorbs very quickly. There is no irritation when I use it and it leaves my skin soft and supple. Also there is no strong scent that you have to deal with. I like that it doesn&#x27;t interfere or clash with my perfume that I like to wear.&lt;br /&gt;I can use it under my makeup as a moisturizer which works great. It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores either but helps my makeup look even better on me. I&#x27;m really happy with the results! &amp;#34;I received free or discounted product in exchange for providing an unbiased review.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Okay first let me say, the box is umm well less than exciting to me. For some reason, it just doesn&#x27;t intrigue me. After opening the box however, I was pleasantly surprised with a bottle that is stylish and looks expensive. I love the pump applicator, it makes it easy to get as much or as little as you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the smell. I can&#x27;t really even pinpoint what the scent is, but I just don&#x27;t care for it much. The good thing is that the scent isn&#x27;t overpowering and after a few minutes it isn&#x27;t noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now let&#x27;s get down to the nitty-gritty! Moisturizer is a must for me! I was happy to see that the consistency is thick and creamy like most great moisturizers. Even though it is a thick consistency, it goes on light and airy. It absorbs quickly enough and I was able to apply make up soon after applying this moisturizer. It has made my face feel silky and hydrated even after applying make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key ingredients include Aloe, Witch Hazel, Shea Butter, Cocoa Butter, and D-Panthenol. This product is all natural and contains no parabens, artificial fragrance or colors. These are some amazing ingredients that offer various benefits such as anti-oxidants, anti-inflammatory properties, anti-aging, and even provides minimal UV protection. This facial moisturizer is also great for any skin type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and it will easily become a regular part of my everyday routine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for reading! I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free.  Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this moisturizer, it is fabulous. It does the job well and works amazing on combo skin! I HIGHLY recommend it!! I also love the natural products included and the way it makes my skin feel afterwards. I instantly feel rejuvenated, smoother and very moisturized. It made my make up glide on so much smoother and no dry patches! There is no scent and did not cause any burning or stinging or anything which is a great plus since my skin is sometimes &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; to these types of products. I also love how there isn&#x27;t a huge fragrance especially since I apply it right before I go to sleep. The directions state to apply the moisturizer twice a day (I assume morning and night) but if I am not wearing make up that day or applying something where my skin shouldn&#x27;t be irritated at all then once a day works great! I highly recommend this product!! For more info, check out my blog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this item complimentary in return for my 100% honest review, all words are mine*</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is organic, lightweight, and non-irritating for my skin. I use it after serum and before primer, and it I&#x27;ve had really good luck with using it. Looking at the ingredients, I was really excited! No scary random chemicals - all healthy ingredients for my skin.... love that. I was sent this for review, and I think it is an OPTIMAL choice for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried this product at a friend&#x27;s, and loved it from the first moment.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s smooth, it&#x27;s moisturizing, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate at all.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s one of those rare products that actually does what is should do. And above all it is organic, and that is a big, if not the biggest, plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW I like the packaging as well. Simple and clean. A good product doesn&#x27;t need a big fuzz.</li>
            <li> I really like this product a good deal. Except for one part. The smell. It smells like yams. Other than that, it is good. Goes on great, is effective and makes my skin really feel nice afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging for this is simply beautiful. I love the way that the bottle looks on my dresser. I adore the way it has a nice weight to it. The pump is solid, the lid fits on perfect. I also love the way the product is dispensed, a dainty amount instead of globs that I have to wipe off on something. This is organic, which is a huge plus for me. It is nice to think of the stuff going on my face being good for my skin, and not some mystery chemical that I cannot even pronounce.&lt;br /&gt;I also like the way that the bottle is well and clearly labeled. I will be giving someone a really nice gift this year when I purchase another bottle.&lt;br /&gt;My favorite part, however is the way it is so concentrated. A little goes a very long way! Dollar saver!</li>
            <li> This product is WONDERFUL!!! I was looking for a good organic Moisturizer for a long time. i tried very expensive products and it was just a wast of money. I have sensitive skin and had hard time to find something that will not be harsh on my skin. I finally found it!!&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer works great, unlike other moisturizers is not greasy, and easy to apply. It leaves my skin refreshed and radiant for the longest time. Why wasting your money on anything else???</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Love the product! Shipping was fast as well. Recommend product to everyone that wants a great natural moisturiser!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I had been using a pricey department store brand for the last 3 months and noticed no improvement in my skin.  After using Naturaliderm&#x27;s  moisurizer for only a few days, I noticed a marked improvement in hydration.</li>
            <li> When it comes to skin care, I have issues. Not only is my skin sensitive, but it’s also acne-prone! I have such a hard time finding products that are well suited for my skin, especially when it comes to moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this Organic Facial Moisturizer by NaturaliDerm was no exception. It started out working wonderfully on my skin and I fell in love instantly! However, after 5-6 days of use, my skin started to break out in small red bumps along the bridge of my nose and around my mouth. That’s when I knew the product wouldn&#x27;t work out for me, and I almost cried! After I stopped using the product for a few days, those bumps started to disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked up cocoa butter’s comedogenic rating and sure enough, it’s a level 4 (out of 5), which means that there’s a fairly high chance that it will clog your pores. So, there you have it. I was (and kind of still am) in love with this moisturizer because it initially made my skin feel buttery smooth. t’s not greasy and my skin was never a greasy mess by the end of the day either - so it helped to keep my oil production at bay. The shea butter in it is wonderful and extremely moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have normal skin, then go for it! You’ll absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. All opinions are 100% mine.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:a6a3abed89515b65bc2b083c34713323]] I love the abundance of skin healing and skin soothing natural (mostly organic) ingredients in this light, skin plumping moisturizer. The inclusion of rosemary is great (an underutilized oil, in my opinion) since it&#x27;s a natural antimicrobial which is not only fab for your skin, but works as nature&#x27;s preservative as well. You can visibly see in the video my skin changing right before your eyes. I don&#x27;t know if this would work for super dry skin, but it&#x27;s great on my combination skin and it&#x27;s light enough that this will be my go to moisturizer in the summer when my face always feels like it&#x27;s going to slide off! While I did receive the product to review, I will only be completely honest in my reviews! I&#x27;ve got integrity, yo!</li>
            <li> I live in Michigan, and have been looking for ages for a moisturizer that will prevent my skin from going dry and itchy when the cold season starts, but on the other hand doesn&#x27;t leave me smelling like a herb garden. You would think it is an easy thing to find, but it took me multiple attempts with various vendors, until I finally found this product, which is just perfect for me. It&#x27;s organic, my face stays moist and the itching stopped and on top of that it doesn&#x27;t smell. 5 stars in my book.</li>
            <li> I do like the moisturizer; it is light and my makeup glides over it.  I am using it only about one week so I will give you more feedback in another week or so.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for natural moisturizers for my skin.  The NaturaliDerm Organic Facial Moisturizer is not only natural, but it is made with organic ingredients that are very beneficial for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I applied this moisturizer I immediately felt a cooling sensation on my face.  This is due to the Aloe ingredient.  It is definitely refreshing!  The NaturaliDerm Organic Facial Moisturizer also contains Shea Butter, which does not seems greasy when applied!  A little bit goes a long way, and the key with this moisturizer is to massage it into the skin so that it fully absorbs into the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had some breakouts before first trying this product, and after 1 week of continuous use, most of those breakouts started to clear away!  I also have noticed that this product does not clog my pores, and it also makes my makeup glide on easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the ingredients in this bottle. I can actually pronounce them and they are great for the skin:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aloe barbadensis - Hydrates and restores skin moisture&lt;br /&gt;Witch Hazel - Tightening pore size&lt;br /&gt;Shea Butter - Seals moisture, protects skin from damage&lt;br /&gt;Cocoa Butter - Seals moisture, protects skin from internal and environmental damage&lt;br /&gt;D-Panthenol - Skin conditioner and moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the NaturaliDerm Organic Facial Moisturizer contains Witch Hazel which is supposed to help tighten pore size, I have not seen any results with a reduction or tightening of my pores.  I would also love to see this product containing a natural SPF ingredient for protection.</li>
            <li> i really enjoy it so far no issues rubs into skin well non greasy an sticky feeling</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer for my neck/chest area. It&#x27;s not greasy at all and I feel like it works. I wouldn&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m thrilled because the consistency of the product is on the dryer side and you want to use more of it - I also don&#x27;t feel like my skin is extremely moisturized - but it works well. My skin does feel soft after use of this product. I wouldn&#x27;t repurchased, however. There&#x27;re other products I love more.</li>
            <li> Great customer service! This moisturizer is lovely so far. Wonderful ingredients and feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li> Love that this product contains only good ingredients, none of the bad stuff like parabens &amp; artificial chemicals. Used it for 2 days-morning and night-and was concerned the wrinkles on my face seemed even worse. Than the 3rd day I woke up to smoother skin and its getting even better every day. Dark spots are even less. I will stick with this; its not going into my graveyard for moisturizers that failed.</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin due to past chemotherapy and hoped this would be ok since it is advertised as safe for sensitive skin.  However, it did not work.  Not only did it not moisturize, but it also caused burning and irritation.  I am returning and the search continues.      UPDATE:  After posting my review, I was contacted by Erica and she offered me a full refund right away, she even said I could keep the product, if I had known earlier, I would have passed on to someone else to try, but unfortunately, I had already sent out the package.  I do not think it is a bad product for the general population, just for people with sensitive skin or at least me. Though the product was not good for me, I am impressed with the customer service of the company.</li>
            <li> The best moisturizer I have ever tried, gentle, not greasy, absorbs well, cleared my acne.I have been looking for a good moisturizer for years and this is definitely the one, I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Average moisturizer at best. Not hydrating enough especially in colder months.</li>
            <li> I have used Arbonne for many years and thought a change would be good for my face and pocketbook. After researching various natural products I decided to give this a try. I absolutely love it. My acne prone face is clearing up, looking firmer and younger! I have also found that this works great under my mineral makeup as a primer. I just ordered 2 more bottles!</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t like the smell. Wish I could return it but I already used it. Yuck!</li>
