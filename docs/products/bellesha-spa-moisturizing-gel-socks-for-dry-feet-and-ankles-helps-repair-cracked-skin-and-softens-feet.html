            <li>and they&#x27;re as good as the best spa gel socks I&#x27;ve tried...and</li>
            <li>Great.  </li>
            <li>I was very happy to receive this product for an honest review.</li>
            <li>You can buy a pricey one...and if you do, anything with Macadamia nut oil is supposed to be great for feet.</li>
            <li>But once I had showered off the foot cream and walked around a while, I noticed that my feet looked great.  </li>
            <li>and I was happy.  </li>
            <li>my sister loves them and feels they work great.</li>
            <li>They are quite comfortable to wear and the results are the best I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li>Good product that does what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li>These are below ankle socks for optimum comfort.</li>
            <li>After a while, it just feels good.</li>
            <li>The socks fit me perfectly.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t feel good on feet -- slipped around a lot.  </li>
            <li>very useful and size is perfect for me</li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>thats okay!</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t overwhelming, just not as pleasant as I would have liked.  </li>
            <li>but they are a great, cheap</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re kind of chilled, and like sticking your foot into...</li>
            <li>These socks are perfect for me, they feel so comfy and they make me feel very relaxed.</li>
            <li>The way to do things is to get your feet nice and moist.  </li>
            <li>They also smell nice - probably the moisturizer in the gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>She has the most persistent and acute case of cracked heels</li>
            <li>This is a more effective treatment than just putting a cream on my feet without the gel socks.  </li>
            <li>Probably the best I can do is imagine a sock that has gel insoles completely covering the inside.</li>
            <li>and I found these socks very comfortable.</li>
            <li>i purchased these as a &amp;#34;lark&amp;#34; very cheaply... didn&#x27;t know what to think</li>
            <li>certainly are much more attractive than orthopedic socks, but take note that if you have psoriasis or eczema, you should run the idea by your physician.</li>
            <li>I really love the gel socks.</li>
            <li>These are excellent, the only thing I have found that keeps my feet from cracking.</li>
            <li>How many times can u use these if u wash them the lavender comes out</li>
            <li>Then use your favorite foot moisturizer (or just these) and put them on for an hour to work on your feet.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re very happy with these things and would give them six stars if it were possible.</li>
            <li>I just put my favorite foot butter on and put these socks on and every morning I wake up</li>
            <li>I really love these socks.</li>
            <li>You are safe walking around as the bottom has a design on it to keep you from sliding along the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>Really worked on my feet and the calming effect was great.  </li>
            <li>The longer you have them on, the more they start to \\&quot;cling\\&quot; to your feet.</li>
            <li>These socks are so comfortable and moisturizing!</li>
            <li>I use my favorite foot cream and then put these on for 30 min</li>
            <li>Anything that makes feet feel good is worth having, and this does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but they do a fantastic job at softening up your feet!  </li>
            <li>I was intrigued by the description of these socks, and hoped they would help my feet absorb more moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t washed these socks yet, but I&#x27;m sure hand washing and air drying</li>
            <li>Like okay,</li>
            <li>More coughing and phlegm.  </li>
            <li>that is kind of cool</li>
            <li>Another good point, you can machine wash these to keep them fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>However, after wearing them a bit, they became more comfortable, she started to like the feel, and she says they did make a noticeable difference with her</li>
            <li>They have a very mild scent, somewhere in the range of baby powder.</li>
            <li>These gel socks feel funky just to touch, but they really made my feet feel wonderful and soft.</li>
            <li>This is a great way to make your feet look better for the summer months and get rid of those gross calluses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When everything smelled fine this time EXCEPT for the INSIDE of this - the gel -</li>
            <li>Using these at night after covering in cream my feet wakeup refreshed and pain free.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I don&#x27;t like the feeling much...</li>
            <li>and they fit just right.&lt;br</li>
            <li>they line the sock with smells wonderful, but after a few washings it accumulates &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; on the inside--attracts it like a magnet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:mo1K01EAU5WMKNH]]The BelleSha Spa Moisturizing sock are lined with a silicone polymer gel that is ultra-moisturizing and comfortable.</li>
            <li>They really are an effective way to soften up your feet for a heel-to-toe treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I realize these need to fit snugly</li>
            <li>.  Fit my foot well&lt;</li>
            <li>Comfortable</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t fit my wife.  </li>
            <li>My feet barely fit into the socks.  </li>
            <li>: Free</li>
            <li>and they JUST fit my feet.</li>
            <li>but they are incredibly comfortable.</li>
            <li>I buy cheap and work my way up.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be surprised at how good your feet look and feel when you wake up.</li>
            <li>:) They&#x27;re styled like anklet socks, so the cuff area sits right below my ankle.</li>
            <li>They work great, good quality, and super thick.  </li>
            <li>lining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been moisturizing my heels right after a hot bath while the feet are still warm.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;She applied her favorite foot cream after a hot shower and then put the gel socks on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Optimally, size-wise these would be best for the small to medium foot up to 8.5 size shoe.</li>
            <li>and my feet feel nice and soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The lining in the socks is wonderful but the socks fit very small.</li>
            <li>The gel socks are a special critter and work quite well, but the spa-like treatment is not for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>well, a sock full of gel.</li>
            <li>It was cool to the touch to start with, and then as they form fitted to my feet, my feet began to sweat.  </li>
            <li>Next use a really good penetrating moisturizer.</li>
            <li>After two overnight uses, I&#x27;m so thrilled with how soft my feet are, I&#x27;m tempted to sidle up to folks at the supermarket and say \\&quot;feel my feet.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>applied my foot cream and gently eased these socks on over the top, and slept with them on three nights</li>
            <li>I can really tell that the socks are helping my lotion do a better job.  </li>
            <li>For ten bucks, I&#x27;m getting a little bit of luxury and a lot of comfort, my feel are silky soft, and the socks fee soooo good when they&#x27;re on...and they deserve five stars.fit me perfectly.</li>
            <li>These BelleSha Spa socks feel great and really do help with both moisturizing dry skin and providing relief to aching muscles and joints.  </li>
            <li>they work beautifully and cost very little.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary sample in order to test these for my review.</li>
            <li>All weirdness aside, it does make your feet soft and more moisturized.</li>
            <li>If your heels have a tendency to crack these socks are worth a try.  </li>
            <li>Even if you don&#x27;t have a problem but enjoy soft and smooth heel</li>
            <li>They are fun to wear because they feel squishy as you walk and</li>
            <li>/&gt;I received a complimentary pair of BelleSha Spa Moisturizing Gel Socks for testing and review purposes.</li>
            <li>and sometimes they get too hot, but the cool feeling inside helps temper that.  </li>
            <li>I had been struggling with finding a good pair of moisturizing socks cause my feet really need some night treatment, otherwise they would get all dry.</li>
            <li>them will keep them nice for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a really effective treatment for dry and cracked feet.</li>
            <li>fill my tub with a hot bubble bath, including bath salts, and soak.</li>
            <li>When my wife first tried the BelleSha Spa Moisturizing Gel Socks, she said they felt funny, and were so squishy.</li>
            <li>I actually use these along with O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s for Healthy Feet Foot Cream</li>
            <li>definately notice a difference the next morning after you wear them to bed :)</li>
            <li>The gel lotion smells OK and is reminiscent of Baby Lotion.  </li>
            <li>I really recommend them!</li>
            <li>The skin looked moist and healthy, especially the cuticles.  </li>
            <li>So I went to bed the first night and was smelling this chemical on my bedding</li>
            <li>just thought I&#x27;d share this as I wait for the dryer to stop on the first load</li>
            <li>you have dry feet, these are recommended to take care of them, moisturize them, and make them feel better.</li>
            <li>know they are supposed to be machine washable, but we&#x27;ve been hand washing the gel socks and allowing them to air dry, just to be safe.</li>
            <li>The important thing with moisture is to find one that sinks in quickly, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and shows results on your skin.</li>
            <li>I just opted for the machine after the second use and they came out fine.</li>
            <li>And I can&#x27;t really afford a spa pedicure very often.</li>
            <li>I really wanted these to work</li>
            <li>for now, she really likes them.</li>
            <li>I have been hand washing them with gentle soap and air drying.</li>
            <li>I really believe they do.</li>
            <li>As I march through my fifties I often come home from work with very aching feet.  </li>
            <li>So I did not stretch them too much when I put them on.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just felt that if I can&#x27;t really leave it at someone not knowing what&#x27;s in this and using it because the smell doesn&#x27;t hit you unless you put your face up to it.  </li>
            <li>Ipaid twice as much for mine in podiotrist office</li>
            <li>I stretched them a little and they were better, but I would have liked a little more room in them.</li>
            <li>I think just plain cotton sox would be more useful.</li>
            <li>When you put on lotion and pull the socks on, the initial feeling is one of cool massage.</li>
            <li>My wife will suffer mainly because of her</li>
            <li>These were thick enough to be effective, the socks themselves well made, the fabric soft and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>These were thick enough to be effective, the socks themselves well made, the fabric soft and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to describe the experience, but when I walk in these, my feet kind of slosh.</li>
            <li>For ten bucks, I&#x27;m getting a little bit of luxury and a lot of comfort, my feel are silky soft, and the socks fee soooo good when they&#x27;re on...and they deserve five stars.</li>
            <li>I wear a size eight wide in shoes, and these feel comfortable to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you do want a real spa-like treatment to get your feet soft, you can put some of your favorite moisturizing cream on, slip on the BellaSha Moisturizing Socks, leave them on for a few hours (or overnight).</li>
            <li>My feet are very blister prone, and I was surprised that these worked as well as they have in helping keeping my feet hydrated.  </li>
            <li>so I had only been suffering for maybe so long, fell asleep somehow and then woke up to my God giving me a heads up that the bedding isn&#x27;t going to get better</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are a little hot but the results are totally worth it!</li>
            <li>I had one heel that had a pretty significant crack and by the next day, it was closed up.</li>
            <li>They may feel a little strange when you first put them on as you squish around in them, but believe me you&#x27;ll soon love how they feel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because of the gel, these do feel hot to me, so I usually only wear them for the hour.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and very definitely exact same idea.</li>
            <li>I had to use up my last detergent and vinegar and washed it twice because it wasn&#x27;t until I washed the first time around that</li>
            <li>My feet are so soft!</li>
            <li>OK, so they are pink, as long as I wear them around the house who will know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not light at all and did not disperse easily.  </li>
            <li>an amazing feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;out of all my very cheap, stupid, impulse purchases</li>
            <li>My feet are much softer and actually look healthier.</li>
            <li>and my feet feel baby soft.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t go to a spa and haven&#x27;t worn these babies, the first steps are squishy and strange.</li>
            <li>you thought maybe something just needed to be aired out.  </li>
            <li>and there it is again, when I thought it had aired out.  </li>
            <li>Decided not to subject myself to that and turned off the fan, closed the door and just let the air condish make me feel better after airing my room for a bit after wrapping that laundry back in a large trash bag as per my usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re cold and clammy when you first put them on, but they do warm up with your body</li>
            <li>sure how long they will last (as other mentioned)</li>
            <li>My feet did feel very soft afterwards though.&lt;br /&gt;After about the third day my feet were noticeably softer even before putting on the gel socks.  </li>
            <li>it had gotten on all my bedding and other items in the laundry when I washed it the first time.  </li>
            <li>I had to majorly sneeze out the substance</li>
            <li>The packaging didn&#x27;t have much as way for instructions or care, and we don&#x27;t know how long they will last, or are supposed to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No slipping,</li>
            <li>I wear a women&#x27;s 8 shoe, and I could barely get these on.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend these for the dry skin of feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;They don&#x27;t come up far enough on the back of the heel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only a little hot, but</li>
            <li>I felt like my feet were a little wrinkly when I got up in the morning, much like your fingertips get when you swim in a pool for a while.  </li>
            <li>first, the sensation is a little strange.  </li>

            <li> The longer you have them on, the more they start to \\&quot;cling\\&quot; to your feet.</li>
            <li> These socks are so comfortable and moisturizing!</li>
            <li> I use my favorite foot cream and then put these on for 30 min</li>
            <li> Anything that makes feet feel good is worth having, and this does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but they do a fantastic job at softening up your feet!  </li>
            <li> I was intrigued by the description of these socks, and hoped they would help my feet absorb more moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t washed these socks yet, but I&#x27;m sure hand washing and air drying</li>
            <li> Like okay,</li>
            <li> More coughing and phlegm.  </li>
            <li> that is kind of cool</li>
            <li> Another good point, you can machine wash these to keep them fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> However, after wearing them a bit, they became more comfortable, she started to like the feel, and she says they did make a noticeable difference with her</li>
            <li> They have a very mild scent, somewhere in the range of baby powder.</li>
            <li> These gel socks feel funky just to touch, but they really made my feet feel wonderful and soft.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to make your feet look better for the summer months and get rid of those gross calluses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When everything smelled fine this time EXCEPT for the INSIDE of this - the gel -</li>
            <li> Using these at night after covering in cream my feet wakeup refreshed and pain free.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I don&#x27;t like the feeling much...</li>
            <li> and they fit just right.&lt;br</li>
            <li> they line the sock with smells wonderful, but after a few washings it accumulates &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; on the inside--attracts it like a magnet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1K01EAU5WMKNH]]The BelleSha Spa Moisturizing sock are lined with a silicone polymer gel that is ultra-moisturizing and comfortable.</li>
            <li> They really are an effective way to soften up your feet for a heel-to-toe treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I realize these need to fit snugly</li>
            <li> .  Fit my foot well&lt;</li>
            <li> Comfortable</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t fit my wife.  </li>
            <li> My feet barely fit into the socks.  </li>
            <li> : Free</li>
            <li> and they JUST fit my feet.</li>
            <li> but they are incredibly comfortable.</li>
            <li> I buy cheap and work my way up.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be surprised at how good your feet look and feel when you wake up.</li>
            <li> :) They&#x27;re styled like anklet socks, so the cuff area sits right below my ankle.</li>
            <li> They work great, good quality, and super thick.  </li>
            <li> lining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been moisturizing my heels right after a hot bath while the feet are still warm.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;She applied her favorite foot cream after a hot shower and then put the gel socks on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Optimally, size-wise these would be best for the small to medium foot up to 8.5 size shoe.</li>
            <li> and my feet feel nice and soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The lining in the socks is wonderful but the socks fit very small.</li>
            <li> The gel socks are a special critter and work quite well, but the spa-like treatment is not for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> well, a sock full of gel.</li>
            <li> It was cool to the touch to start with, and then as they form fitted to my feet, my feet began to sweat.  </li>
            <li> Next use a really good penetrating moisturizer.</li>
            <li> After two overnight uses, I&#x27;m so thrilled with how soft my feet are, I&#x27;m tempted to sidle up to folks at the supermarket and say \\&quot;feel my feet.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> applied my foot cream and gently eased these socks on over the top, and slept with them on three nights</li>
            <li> I can really tell that the socks are helping my lotion do a better job.  </li>
            <li> For ten bucks, I&#x27;m getting a little bit of luxury and a lot of comfort, my feel are silky soft, and the socks fee soooo good when they&#x27;re on...and they deserve five stars.fit me perfectly.</li>
            <li> These BelleSha Spa socks feel great and really do help with both moisturizing dry skin and providing relief to aching muscles and joints.  </li>
            <li> they work beautifully and cost very little.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary sample in order to test these for my review.</li>
            <li> All weirdness aside, it does make your feet soft and more moisturized.</li>
            <li> If your heels have a tendency to crack these socks are worth a try.  </li>
            <li> Even if you don&#x27;t have a problem but enjoy soft and smooth heel</li>
            <li> They are fun to wear because they feel squishy as you walk and</li>
            <li> /&gt;I received a complimentary pair of BelleSha Spa Moisturizing Gel Socks for testing and review purposes.</li>
            <li> and sometimes they get too hot, but the cool feeling inside helps temper that.  </li>
            <li> I had been struggling with finding a good pair of moisturizing socks cause my feet really need some night treatment, otherwise they would get all dry.</li>
            <li> them will keep them nice for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a really effective treatment for dry and cracked feet.</li>
            <li> fill my tub with a hot bubble bath, including bath salts, and soak.</li>
            <li> When my wife first tried the BelleSha Spa Moisturizing Gel Socks, she said they felt funny, and were so squishy.</li>
            <li> I actually use these along with O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s for Healthy Feet Foot Cream</li>
            <li> definately notice a difference the next morning after you wear them to bed :)</li>
            <li> The gel lotion smells OK and is reminiscent of Baby Lotion.  </li>
            <li> I really recommend them!</li>
            <li> The skin looked moist and healthy, especially the cuticles.  </li>
            <li> So I went to bed the first night and was smelling this chemical on my bedding</li>
            <li> just thought I&#x27;d share this as I wait for the dryer to stop on the first load</li>
            <li> you have dry feet, these are recommended to take care of them, moisturize them, and make them feel better.</li>
            <li> know they are supposed to be machine washable, but we&#x27;ve been hand washing the gel socks and allowing them to air dry, just to be safe.</li>
            <li> The important thing with moisture is to find one that sinks in quickly, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and shows results on your skin.</li>
            <li> I just opted for the machine after the second use and they came out fine.</li>
            <li> And I can&#x27;t really afford a spa pedicure very often.</li>
            <li> I really wanted these to work</li>
            <li> for now, she really likes them.</li>
            <li> I have been hand washing them with gentle soap and air drying.</li>
            <li> I really believe they do.</li>
            <li> As I march through my fifties I often come home from work with very aching feet.  </li>
            <li> So I did not stretch them too much when I put them on.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just felt that if I can&#x27;t really leave it at someone not knowing what&#x27;s in this and using it because the smell doesn&#x27;t hit you unless you put your face up to it.  </li>
            <li> Ipaid twice as much for mine in podiotrist office</li>
            <li> I stretched them a little and they were better, but I would have liked a little more room in them.</li>
            <li> I think just plain cotton sox would be more useful.</li>
            <li> When you put on lotion and pull the socks on, the initial feeling is one of cool massage.</li>
            <li> My wife will suffer mainly because of her</li>
            <li> These were thick enough to be effective, the socks themselves well made, the fabric soft and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> These were thick enough to be effective, the socks themselves well made, the fabric soft and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe the experience, but when I walk in these, my feet kind of slosh.</li>
            <li> For ten bucks, I&#x27;m getting a little bit of luxury and a lot of comfort, my feel are silky soft, and the socks fee soooo good when they&#x27;re on...and they deserve five stars.</li>
            <li> I wear a size eight wide in shoes, and these feel comfortable to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you do want a real spa-like treatment to get your feet soft, you can put some of your favorite moisturizing cream on, slip on the BellaSha Moisturizing Socks, leave them on for a few hours (or overnight).</li>
            <li> My feet are very blister prone, and I was surprised that these worked as well as they have in helping keeping my feet hydrated.  </li>
            <li> so I had only been suffering for maybe so long, fell asleep somehow and then woke up to my God giving me a heads up that the bedding isn&#x27;t going to get better</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are a little hot but the results are totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I had one heel that had a pretty significant crack and by the next day, it was closed up.</li>
            <li> They may feel a little strange when you first put them on as you squish around in them, but believe me you&#x27;ll soon love how they feel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because of the gel, these do feel hot to me, so I usually only wear them for the hour.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and very definitely exact same idea.</li>
            <li> I had to use up my last detergent and vinegar and washed it twice because it wasn&#x27;t until I washed the first time around that</li>
            <li> My feet are so soft!</li>
            <li> OK, so they are pink, as long as I wear them around the house who will know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not light at all and did not disperse easily.  </li>
            <li> an amazing feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;out of all my very cheap, stupid, impulse purchases</li>
            <li> My feet are much softer and actually look healthier.</li>
            <li> and my feet feel baby soft.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t go to a spa and haven&#x27;t worn these babies, the first steps are squishy and strange.</li>
            <li> you thought maybe something just needed to be aired out.  </li>
            <li> and there it is again, when I thought it had aired out.  </li>
            <li> Decided not to subject myself to that and turned off the fan, closed the door and just let the air condish make me feel better after airing my room for a bit after wrapping that laundry back in a large trash bag as per my usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re cold and clammy when you first put them on, but they do warm up with your body</li>
            <li> sure how long they will last (as other mentioned)</li>
            <li> My feet did feel very soft afterwards though.&lt;br /&gt;After about the third day my feet were noticeably softer even before putting on the gel socks.  </li>
            <li> it had gotten on all my bedding and other items in the laundry when I washed it the first time.  </li>
            <li> I had to majorly sneeze out the substance</li>
            <li> The packaging didn&#x27;t have much as way for instructions or care, and we don&#x27;t know how long they will last, or are supposed to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No slipping,</li>
            <li> I wear a women&#x27;s 8 shoe, and I could barely get these on.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend these for the dry skin of feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;They don&#x27;t come up far enough on the back of the heel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only a little hot, but</li>
            <li> I felt like my feet were a little wrinkly when I got up in the morning, much like your fingertips get when you swim in a pool for a while.  </li>
            <li> first, the sensation is a little strange.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the old home remedy - vaseline and cotton socks -- with less than stellar results, so I was anxious to give these get</li>
            <li> They fit well nicely not too tight and not</li>
            <li> I slather lotion on my feet, slip into these for an hour and my feet feel softer for a bit but by the next day, there is no difference, my feet are as dry as ever!</li>
            <li> BelleSha Spa Gel Socks are a decent option if you want to work on getting your feet less dry and rough from years of neglect.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t stir myself up to take a shower being that I have been sleeping in this strange chemical that gives you the symptoms of formaldehyde in a Keratin Salon with no vent as I said.  </li>
            <li> Mind you, it does feel rather squishy and creepy to walk in them, but if you have to there are cute little feet that make the socks non-skid.</li>
            <li> The sides of my feet, my heels, and that little spot under the big toe and middle toe from wearing flip flops all responded well to these socks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It felt very strange.  </li>
            <li> The idea behind the gel socks is to provide the entire foot intense moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> As such, be VERY careful going up and down stairs... your footing will not be as solid as you</li>
            <li> wow, moisturizing socks are unbelievable..</li>
            <li> Soak away all the stress in your body, let the hot water relax you and your tired feet.  </li>
            <li> At the same time I always felt not very comfortable wearing any socks when I went to bed, it was bothering me, I felt like my feet are not breathing</li>
            <li> They truly have started to moisturize my feet which I needed because of very dry skin</li>
            <li> and then finally with a little coughing up phlegm</li>
            <li> These socks are very thick, too thick for me to wear them to bed and for my feet to be comfortable all night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The soles of my feet are rough and they are taking longer to soften, but even there I can tell a difference.  </li>
            <li> but when you do your chest stops feeling so weighed down and stuffed with some strange odorous chemical gas</li>
            <li> My feet are a mess when it comes to dry and rough skin areas.</li>
            <li> She thought they felt weird at first.</li>
            <li> For 20 years I&#x27;ve had trouble with my feet being too dry, and my heels sometimes crack and bleed unless I keep them slathered in creams.  </li>
            <li> socks are pink, which mean I&#x27;ll never be wearing them out in public.</li>
            <li> Just one whiff and you are out for the count for days barely breathing, coughing a lot of mucus up that has yellow color like you&#x27;re sick or clear</li>
            <li> The little feet design at the bottom will hopefully keep the wearer from slipping.  </li>
            <li> mo16T1YHVC32O7J]]These socks feel a little weird at first</li>
            <li> If you have really bad heels, cracked and calcified,it may take a week, but you should see a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long they&#x27;ll last...but for $10, I&#x27;ll want at a lot of use out of them.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t slip down when worn and because of the gel lining and don&#x27;t slip around on the foot.</li>
            <li> But somehow I fell asleep and about an hour and a half</li>
            <li> took a little getting used to.  </li>
            <li> Scrub them well to get the blood circulating and to exfoliate a little bit.  </li>
            <li> The silicone lining in the socks takes a little getting used to -</li>
            <li> this is one of the few products that i will continue to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it is a heavy chemical.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, the size of these socks is a little small for me.  </li>
            <li> I put a heavy cream on my feet before bed, and usually use plain cotton socks to keep the cream off of the bed sheets.  </li>
            <li> Here in Texas we&#x27;re suffering a drought, and drought makes a dry skin condition even worse.  </li>
            <li> have a small foot (I wear size 6.5 to 7 shoes)</li>
            <li> /&gt;OK, so not many Con&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I agree with the person who said they do run on the small side.  </li>
            <li> At that point, you&#x27;re not sure whether they&#x27;re clammy or still just mosturizing.</li>
            <li> Be warned, however, these socks run small.</li>
            <li> I wear a size 7 or 7 1/2 shoe, and usually take an 8 slipper for comfort.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I was expecting, but I can&#x27;t sleep in these socks.</li>
            <li> Like I said, I finally realized on night 2 that something was wrong after going to bed and feeling like, still?</li>
            <li> The inside is made of a gel-like substance that&#x27;s a bit hard to describe.</li>
            <li> at least mine do),</li>
            <li> I used cold water in the washer and a low dryer temp.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the sock did not fit her</li>
            <li> They do take a little getting use to, and I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li> I am EXHAUSTED and recovering from something else ongoing</li>
            <li> My wife tells me I&#x27;m very mean to my feet.</li>
            <li> These feel SO WEIRD.</li>
            <li> They are really uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> So a weird chemical came off of it and ruined all my laundry.  </li>
            <li> Miserable night while awake and at 3am - I go to bed past midnight usually</li>
            <li> Your skin might soak this in whether from compromised items or from wearing this and your body heat working with it on your vulnerable soles.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really love the gel socks. It takes a minute to get used to them and then I forget they are even on. Great product!!!! Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Too slippery. Only put on AFTER you are in bed because otherwise, you&#x27;ll literally slip out of them.</li>
            <li> very useful and size is perfect for me</li>
            <li> Came even faster then anticipated! These are excellent, the only thing I have found that keeps my feet from cracking. I take a chemo called Xeloda that has side effects that cause feet and hands to crack and hurt. Using these at night after covering in cream my feet wakeup refreshed and pain free.</li>
            <li> How many times can u use these if u wash them the lavender comes out</li>
            <li> I am on my feet a lot in my job and sometimes they need a bit of attention, especially during the sandal season. And I can&#x27;t really afford a spa pedicure very often. These fill in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fill my tub with a hot bubble bath, including bath salts, and soak. You can just use one of the foot baths if you aren&#x27;t into a bubble bath. Then use your favorite foot moisturizer (or just these) and put them on for an hour to work on your feet. You don&#x27;t even have to leave a tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are washable, I am washing mine by hand. They have a very mild scent, somewhere in the range of baby powder. I wear a size eight wide in shoes, and these feel comfortable to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the gel, these do feel hot to me, so I usually only wear them for the hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary sample in order to test these for my review. The only problem I discovered was that when leaving my gel products in the bathroom inside out, my granddaughter stuck all of them up on the wall.</li>
            <li> Here in Texas we&#x27;re suffering a drought, and drought makes a dry skin condition even worse.  I&#x27;ve tried the old home remedy - vaseline and cotton socks -- with less than stellar results, so I was anxious to give these get socks a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how do they do?  Great.  Moisturize feet after your bath or shower, and slip into a pair of these gel socks.  They are quite comfortable to wear and the results are the best I&#x27;ve ever had.  I highly recommend these for the dry skin of feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIVE STARS!</li>
            <li> I slather lotion on my feet, slip into these for an hour and my feet feel softer for a bit but by the next day, there is no difference, my feet are as dry as ever! I really wanted these to work but they don&#x27;t :(</li>
            <li> These feel SO WEIRD. They&#x27;re kind of chilled, and like sticking your foot into... well, a sock full of gel. It&#x27;s hard to describe the experience, but when I walk in these, my feet kind of slosh. To be honest, I don&#x27;t like the feeling much... it makes me feel gross, even though there&#x27;s nothing actually gross happening. Maybe it just reminds me of camp, when they&#x27;d stick your hand into a bag of spaghetti and tell you it was a brain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the thing is that it works. All weirdness aside, it does make your feet soft and more moisturized. You have to wash these a lot because your feet will sweat in them (at least mine do), but it&#x27;s a really effective treatment for dry and cracked feet. So I take off one star for the icky-squicky feeling I get from them, but give four stars for the effectiveness. As for size, I&#x27;m a size 7 and they fit just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this for review.</li>
            <li> When my wife first tried the BelleSha Spa Moisturizing Gel Socks, she said they felt funny, and were so squishy. However, after wearing them a bit, they became more comfortable, she started to like the feel, and she says they did make a noticeable difference with her feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for now, she really likes them. The packaging didn&#x27;t have much as way for instructions or care, and we don&#x27;t know how long they will last, or are supposed to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry feet, these are recommended to take care of them, moisturize them, and make them feel better. Good product that does what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> When I was offered these to review, I jumped at the chance because I&#x27;m always on the lookout for foot care products for my wife. She has the most persistent and acute case of cracked heels I&#x27;ve ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She applied her favorite foot cream after a hot shower and then put the gel socks on. She thought they felt weird at first. She likened it to walking on jello. But after a few nights of sleeping with these things on, the cracks in her feet have really healed up. They aren&#x27;t a hundred percent yet, but her feet are probably in the best shape I&#x27;ve seen them in our nine year of  marriage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know they are supposed to be machine washable, but we&#x27;ve been hand washing the gel socks and allowing them to air dry, just to be safe. We&#x27;re very happy with these things and would give them six stars if it were possible.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1LFHJYWTW8PPA]]I get cracks in my heels if I don&#x27;t moisturize them, and those cracks can be quite painful and difficult to heal.  The idea behind the gel socks is to provide the entire foot intense moisturizing.  The inside surface of each sock is covered with a silicone skin (see attached video) and it keeps a moisturizer from evaporating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a small foot (I wear size 6.5 to 7 shoes) and I found these socks very comfortable. They fit well nicely not too tight and not loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning instructions say machine wash or hand wash. I have been hand washing them with gentle soap and air drying. I think hand washing will prolong the life of the silicone lining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been moisturizing my heels right after a hot bath while the feet are still warm.  This is a more effective treatment than just putting a cream on my feet without the gel socks.  If your heels have a tendency to crack these socks are worth a try.  Even if you don&#x27;t have a problem but enjoy soft and smooth heel these socks give you the \\&quot;spa\\&quot; treatment at home.  Product provided by BellaSha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
            <li> I had been struggling with finding a good pair of moisturizing socks cause my feet really need some night treatment, otherwise they would get all dry. At the same time I always felt not very comfortable wearing any socks when I went to bed, it was bothering me, I felt like my feet are not breathing and I always wanted to take them off. These socks are perfect for me, they feel so comfy and they make me feel very relaxed. I just put my favorite foot butter on and put these socks on and every morning I wake up and my feet feel nice and soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I bought these for myself and my husband, he wears a size 10.  They work great, good quality, and super thick.  I actually use these along with O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s for Healthy Feet Foot Cream and it&#x27;s awesome.  I had one heel that had a pretty significant crack and by the next day, it was closed up.</li>
            <li> The lining in the socks is wonderful but the socks fit very small. Wish they came in sizes rather than the &amp;#34;one size fits all&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> These socks are very thick, too thick for me to wear them to bed and for my feet to be comfortable all night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t come up far enough on the back of the heel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel moisturizer they line the sock with smells wonderful, but after a few washings it accumulates &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; on the inside--attracts it like a magnet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a sample product from BelleSha.</li>
            <li> I really love these socks. They are light weight but pack a punch when it comes to moisturizing your tired feet.  They may feel a little strange when you first put them on as you squish around in them, but believe me you&#x27;ll soon love how they feel. You are safe walking around as the bottom has a design on it to keep you from sliding along the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now do they work?  I really believe they do. They are like a wonderful massages to your feet. To me they are soothing and relaxing and I am seeing a difference. My feet are much softer and actually look healthier. They do take a little getting use to, and I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the smell. It isn&#x27;t overwhelming, just not as pleasant as I would have liked.  Another good point, you can machine wash these to keep them fresh and clean. I like them and will continue to use them.  I was very happy to receive this product for an honest review.</li>
            <li> definately notice a difference the next morning after you wear them to bed :)</li>
            <li> Love them! I sleep with them on every night and have never had softer feet.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1K01EAU5WMKNH]]The BelleSha Spa Moisturizing sock are lined with a silicone polymer gel that is ultra-moisturizing and comfortable. Mind you, it does feel rather squishy and creepy to walk in them, but if you have to there are cute little feet that make the socks non-skid. These are, however, gel socks and not meant to be footies you walk around in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Optimally, size-wise these would be best for the small to medium foot up to 8.5 size shoe. These are below ankle socks for optimum comfort. They don&#x27;t slip down when worn and because of the gel lining and don&#x27;t slip around on the foot. The BelleSha moisturizing sock is a heel-to-toe moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They certainly are much more attractive than orthopedic socks, but take note that if you have psoriasis or eczema, you should run the idea by your physician. They do make my feet feel softer, but sweaty feeling after a while. The gel socks are a special critter and work quite well, but the spa-like treatment is not for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do want a real spa-like treatment to get your feet soft, you can put some of your favorite moisturizing cream on, slip on the BellaSha Moisturizing Socks, leave them on for a few hours (or overnight). They really are an effective way to soften up your feet for a heel-to-toe treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review</li>
            <li> As I march through my fifties I often come home from work with very aching feet.  These BelleSha Spa socks feel great and really do help with both moisturizing dry skin and providing relief to aching muscles and joints.  The little feet design at the bottom will hopefully keep the wearer from slipping.  The gel lotion smells OK and is reminiscent of Baby Lotion.  I realize these need to fit snugly but I wear a size nine and while I can use these socks if my feet were any bigger I would have difficulty.  I received this item in exchange for an unbiased review.</li>
            <li> OK, so they are pink, as long as I wear them around the house who will know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Fit my foot well&lt;br /&gt;2.  Comfortable&lt;br /&gt;3.  They truly have started to moisturize my feet which I needed because of very dry skin&lt;br /&gt;4.  They are fun to wear because they feel squishy as you walk and that is kind of cool&lt;br /&gt;5.  They grip the floor well because of the pattern on the bottom.  No slipping, no sliding&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;1.  They didn&#x27;t fit my wife.  She broke her ankle very badly (compound fracture) two years ago.  But her ankle and foot swell terribly.  Unfortunately the sock did not fit her well so she is not wearing them.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Did I say &amp;#34;Pink&amp;#34;!  Why not &amp;#34;Blue&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Purple&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, so not many Con&#x27;s.  My wife will suffer mainly because of her injury.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give the socks a five star rating.</li>
            <li> I do like the color and the grips on the bottom of the BelleSha Spa Moisturizing Gel Socks.  I agree with the person who said they do run on the small side.  My feet barely fit into the socks.  I was concerned about stretching them and having them possibly tear.  So I did not stretch them too much when I put them on.&lt;br /&gt;The feel of the gel against my feet took a little getting used to.  It was cool to the touch to start with, and then as they form fitted to my feet, my feet began to sweat.  I would wear them from an hour to two at a time.  Walking in them felt like I was walking on a baggie of gel.  It felt very strange.  My feet did feel very soft afterwards though.&lt;br /&gt;After about the third day my feet were noticeably softer even before putting on the gel socks.  The soles of my feet are rough and they are taking longer to soften, but even there I can tell a difference.  4 stars from me!</li>
            <li> Really worked on my feet and the calming effect was great.  Only a little hot, but thats okay!</li>
            <li> My feet are a mess when it comes to dry and rough skin areas. My wife tells me I&#x27;m very mean to my feet. The chance to try out a pair of BelleSha Spa Moisturizing Gel Socks came up, and I thought \\&quot;what do I have to lose?\\&quot; So when they arrived, I slapped some lotion on my feet and then slipped these on. It&#x27;s a unique/strange feeling in a number of ways, but they do work...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My socks are pink, which mean I&#x27;ll never be wearing them out in public. :) They&#x27;re styled like anklet socks, so the cuff area sits right below my ankle. The inside is made of a gel-like substance that&#x27;s a bit hard to describe. Probably the best I can do is imagine a sock that has gel insoles completely covering the inside. When you put on lotion and pull the socks on, the initial feeling is one of cool massage. The longer you have them on, the more they start to \\&quot;cling\\&quot; to your feet. At that point, you&#x27;re not sure whether they&#x27;re clammy or still just mosturizing. If you walk around in them, you feel like you never quite have a solid foot placement on the ground. Your foot is floating around on the gel, and even just standing still you could move your feet on the floor a half-inch or so based on the gel moving. As such, be VERY careful going up and down stairs... your footing will not be as solid as you expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BelleSha Spa Gel Socks are a decent option if you want to work on getting your feet less dry and rough from years of neglect. It may take a bit of time to get used to the feeling, but it does do the work it was designed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:&lt;br /&gt;Obtained From: Manufacturer&lt;br /&gt;Payment: Free</li>
            <li> It did not work as advertised.  I even tried adding extra moisture.  I would not reccomend</li>
            <li> These socks are so comfortable and moisturizing! I use my favorite foot cream and then put these on for 30 min and my feet feel baby soft. Be warned, however, these socks run small. I wear an 8-81/2 and they JUST fit my feet. If you wear a 9 or above I wouldn&#x27;t  order these.</li>
            <li> wow, moisturizing socks are unbelievable.. i purchased these as a &amp;#34;lark&amp;#34; very cheaply... didn&#x27;t know what to think but they are incredibly comfortable. an amazing feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;out of all my very cheap, stupid, impulse purchases this is one of the few products that i will continue to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not sure how long they will last (as other mentioned) but they are a great, cheap product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;full disclosure: not sure these are the exact socks but i think maybe. and very definitely exact same idea.</li>
            <li> I thought they would moisturize my feet but they feel clammy and my feet feel like they are sweating after wearing them for a while.  I think just plain cotton sox would be more useful.</li>
            <li> I slathered moisturizer on my feet, put these on, then stuck my feet under a heating pad. Oh heaven. These gel socks feel funky just to touch, but they really made my feet feel wonderful and soft. The sides of my feet, my heels, and that little spot under the big toe and middle toe from wearing flip flops all responded well to these socks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for review</li>
            <li> Walking on gel is better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, the sensation is a little strange.  If you don&#x27;t go to a spa and haven&#x27;t worn these babies, the first steps are squishy and strange. After a while, it just feels good. The way to do things is to get your feet nice and moist.  Start with a bath, if you can.  Soak away all the stress in your body, let the hot water relax you and your tired feet.  Scrub them well to get the blood circulating and to exfoliate a little bit.  Next use a really good penetrating moisturizer. You can buy a pricey one...and if you do, anything with Macadamia nut oil is supposed to be great for feet. Or you can go with one of the Vaseline Intensive Care lotions...they work beautifully and cost very little.  The important thing with moisture is to find one that sinks in quickly, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and shows results on your skin. I buy cheap and work my way up.  After you moisturize your tootsies, slip on the gel socks.  It&#x27;s like walking on a cloud.  In a perfect world, we&#x27;d have nationalized pedicures and footrubs. Anything that makes feet feel good is worth having, and this does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wear the socks overnight and you&#x27;ll be surprised at how good your feet look and feel when you wake up. If you have really bad heels, cracked and calcified,it may take a week, but you should see a huge difference. After two overnight uses, I&#x27;m so thrilled with how soft my feet are, I&#x27;m tempted to sidle up to folks at the supermarket and say \\&quot;feel my feet.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The socks are washable, by hand or machine. I just opted for the machine after the second use and they came out fine. I&#x27;m not sure how long they&#x27;ll last...but for $10, I&#x27;ll want at a lot of use out of them.  If they fall apart, I&#x27;ll report back.  There were no accompanying instructions on care, by the way. I used cold water in the washer and a low dryer temp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caveats:  The size is a moderate &#x27;medium.&#x27;  I wear a size 7 or 7 1/2 shoe, and usually take an 8 slipper for comfort.  The socks fit me perfectly. Roomy but snug so there&#x27;s no bagging or dragging.  If your foot is much bigger, I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;d work. I see no information for larger sizes either.  Also, I was offered these for review.  I have had mixed results with gel socks, and was not included to be generous. These were thick enough to be effective, the socks themselves well made, the fabric soft and comfortable.  I had no problems with these socks and they&#x27;re as good as the best spa gel socks I&#x27;ve tried...and the price is acceptable compared to spa product.  I am going to buy myself a couple of pairs of BelleSha Spa Moisturizing Gel Socks. For ten bucks, I&#x27;m getting a little bit of luxury and a lot of comfort, my feel are silky soft, and the socks fee soooo good when they&#x27;re on...and they deserve five stars.fit me perfectly.

            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo16T1YHVC32O7J]]These socks feel a little weird at first but they do a fantastic job at softening up your feet!  I play ice hockey so my feet get abused and look terrible.  This is a great way to make your feet look better for the summer months and get rid of those gross calluses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are a little hot but the results are totally worth it! I really recommend them!</li>
            <li> For 20 years I&#x27;ve had trouble with my feet being too dry, and my heels sometimes crack and bleed unless I keep them slathered in creams.  I put a heavy cream on my feet before bed, and usually use plain cotton socks to keep the cream off of the bed sheets.  I was intrigued by the description of these socks, and hoped they would help my feet absorb more moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the size of these socks is a little small for me.  I wear a women&#x27;s 8 shoe, and I could barely get these on.  I stretched them a little and they were better, but I would have liked a little more room in them. I liked the non-skid bottoms, since it&#x27;s dangerous to get up to go to the bathroom at night with slippery feet in gel socks.  The silicone lining in the socks takes a little getting used to - they&#x27;re cold and clammy when you first put them on, but they do warm up with your body heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied my foot cream and gently eased these socks on over the top, and slept with them on three nights so I could write this review.  I felt like my feet were a little wrinkly when I got up in the morning, much like your fingertips get when you swim in a pool for a while.  But once I had showered off the foot cream and walked around a while, I noticed that my feet looked great.  The skin looked moist and healthy, especially the cuticles.  The second night I used a ped-egg type thing to sand my heels, and again applied lotion and then the gel socks.  I can really tell that the socks are helping my lotion do a better job.  They also smell nice - probably the moisturizer in the gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t washed these socks yet, but I&#x27;m sure hand washing and air drying them will keep them nice for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary pair of BelleSha Spa Moisturizing Gel Socks for testing and review purposes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I was expecting, but I can&#x27;t sleep in these socks. They are really uncomfortable. It feels almost gooey on the inside, so I find myself waking up in the night whenever I wear these. I would just recommend putting vitamin E oil on your feet before bed.</li>
            <li> 5 stars for prompt customer service and delivery.  However I had to give 0 stars for the product itself.  I bought this as a treat and machine washed it as soon as it was delivered.  On the description it says to hand or machine wash.  I didn&#x27;t see any care instructions.  So a weird chemical came off of it and ruined all my laundry.  Meaning it was like formaldehyde in a Keratin Treatment done in a salon for days (3) before I realized my God was trying to tell me something and I needed to redo my bedding and so on.  I had to use up my last detergent and vinegar and washed it twice because it wasn&#x27;t until I washed the first time around that I realized smelling everything that THIS is what that knock you out cloying chemical smell was coming from.  it had gotten on all my bedding and other items in the laundry when I washed it the first time.  I thought it was something else and threw that away.  When everything smelled fine this time EXCEPT for the INSIDE of this - the gel - I said Oooooooh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I had to tie it in a plastic bag to save myself.  Just one whiff and you are out for the count for days barely breathing, coughing a lot of mucus up that has yellow color like you&#x27;re sick or clear but when you do your chest stops feeling so weighed down and stuffed with some strange odorous chemical gas and it is a heavy chemical.  Not light at all and did not disperse easily.  Airing out a room with fans or sleeping in a room with the door open and the air condish on doesn&#x27;t do anything but for a while.  Then later the smell is back and you&#x27;re thinking your crazy bc you thought maybe something just needed to be aired out.  So I went to bed the first night and was smelling this chemical on my bedding but I thought it was just my sheet and I could air it out.  I thought, oh! the rug it washed with must be the backing it&#x27;ll air out.  I had to majorly sneeze out the substance and then finally with a little coughing up phlegm as well it seemed to go away and I was happy.  Like okay, whatever that was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day I smelled it again in some of the laundry so I tried to air that out as well but didn&#x27;t work.  Decided not to subject myself to that and turned off the fan, closed the door and just let the air condish make me feel better after airing my room for a bit after wrapping that laundry back in a large trash bag as per my usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I go to bed and there it is again, when I thought it had aired out.  Miserable night while awake and at 3am - I go to bed past midnight usually so I had only been suffering for maybe so long, fell asleep somehow and then woke up to my God giving me a heads up that the bedding isn&#x27;t going to get better have to wash it again at 3am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I resolve to try to get back to sleep bc I am EXHAUSTED and recovering from something else ongoing so I can&#x27;t stir myself up to take a shower being that I have been sleeping in this strange chemical that gives you the symptoms of formaldehyde in a Keratin Salon with no vent as I said.  I tell myself I can keep it away from my face but it disturbed me to be sleeping in something my body heat is heating up for hours.  So anyways.  Like I said, I finally realized on night 2 that something was wrong after going to bed and feeling like, still? there&#x27;s something? something still here in my bedding, my sheet, is it in anything else?  But somehow I fell asleep and about an hour and a half later I woke up and had to head the warning that my bedding is dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So just thought I&#x27;d share this as I wait for the dryer to stop on the first load - I had only washed part of my bedding and wasn&#x27;t trying to wash the fleece blanket I use on and off at night, nor pillows etc... but now I had to wash everything.  Everything had heated into this bc I had a plastic cover for my mattress which heats you up big time and you need a lot of padding between it and you that you don&#x27;t wash every time.  Oh well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, now I have to return it but I can&#x27;t be bothered.  More coughing and phlegm.  I just felt that if I can&#x27;t really leave it at someone not knowing what&#x27;s in this and using it because the smell doesn&#x27;t hit you unless you put your face up to it.  So you may not know this is what that smell is coming from.  That means your laundry might get compromised.  Your skin might soak this in whether from compromised items or from wearing this and your body heat working with it on your vulnerable soles.  FYI</li>
            <li> Definitely makes my feet softer and help keep my callouses at bay with regular use.  My feet are very blister prone, and I was surprised that these worked as well as they have in helping keeping my feet hydrated.  I wear them at night and sometimes they get too hot, but the cool feeling inside helps temper that.  I wish they came with wash instructions.</li>
            <li> my sister loves them and feels they work great.Ipaid twice as much for mine in podiotrist office</li>
            <li> weird feeling but you get used to it.  I have noticed a difference in my feet after wearing them.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t feel good on feet -- slipped around a lot.  I returned them</li>
            <li> Love these! My feet are so soft!</li>
