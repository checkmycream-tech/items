            <li>: I have received a free or greatly discounted product for the purpose of this review.</li>
            <li>For centuries Rose Canina seeds have been used by native tribes for its revitalizing benefits to the skin.</li>
            <li>Made in the USA, FDA approved, GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) stamped and PARABEN free!</li>
            <li>The serum was provided in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>If you do this (and make sure the moisturizer has sunscreen built in), then I have no doubt that your face will look as good as it</li>
            <li>All thoughts and opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>What I can say right from the get go is this is a GREAT PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly and doesn&#x27;t add alot of product to your face.</li>
            <li>Kind of a warm tingly sensation that dissipates quickly.  </li>

            <li>I love this this Vitamin C serum</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t sting, wasn&#x27;t oily, and left my skin feeling great!</li>

            <li>I also liked how it is MADE IN THE USA, and that is a huge selling for me.  </li>
            <li>I just love everything about this product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad a</li>
            <li>* SAFE FOR ALL SKIN TYPE:</li>
            <li>Potent *</li>
            <li>No nasty scent or smell</li>
            <li>I love that Nutra contains hyaluronic acid and Vitamin E, both of which are known to be beneficial for the skin.  </li>
            <li>I thought this product looked interesting, so I ordered it when I got the chance.</li>
            <li>product reminds me more of an oil than anything else, although it is not oily after application.</li>
            <li>you want to feel better about your skin care</li>
            <li>and she said this was one of the better serums that she has tried that did not have retinol in it.  </li>
            <li>Vitamin C helps our bodies in so many ways.  </li>
            <li>For the most part...</li>
            <li>I love the feel of them...</li>
            <li>and I do notice that my skin is more even in tone and color.  </li>
            <li>but I do know that I just truly love the way this one feels...</li>
            <li>it feels lovely on...and...</li>
            <li>My favorite feature though is the fact it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy or oily.</li>
            <li>I love the thickness.</li>
            <li>I love how well it works.</li>
            <li>I love that the bottle is amber colored which helps the Vitamin C retain</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually quite impressive in terms of living up to the claim that it imparts a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; to your skin.</li>
            <li>The truth is that I don&#x27;t know about any of these promises because I can&#x27;t prove that these actions are happening, but I do know that skin glows and looks better after using this serum.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a week now and feel like I am able to provide a preliminary review of it&#x27;s effectiveness.  </li>
            <li>I did a lot of research to figure out what would be best for me, long term.</li>
            <li>My skin tone is becoming more even, and others are noticing my radiant glow.</li>
            <li>The fine lines have a more diminished look and my skin tone is more even.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen a reduction in the fine lines on my face and the return of a glowing, healthy look.</li>
            <li>The Nutra Essence Organic is a great product, no harsh and all organic.</li>
            <li>I love the light feel of it</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love how smooth my skin looks in the mornings.</li>
            <li>too much and good skin</li>
            <li>and it goes on really easy.</li>
            <li>The pump is easy to use and keeps me from spilling it everywhere.</li>
            <li>and when you are done make sure you moisturize right after!  </li>
            <li>Now I notice fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to getting rid of the fine lines around my eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li>My face and neck started immediately to look and feel moisturized, firmer, brighter and the fine lines around my eyes seemed to be reduced</li>
            <li>This serum absorbs quickly which I love.</li>
            <li>i see huge improvement for my face.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s definitely made a difference in my skin being more bright and even toned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;So if you are a more mature women, like myself, who needs to ramp up the skin a bit to regain some of that more youthful, hydrated healthy look, this serum worked quite well for me.  </li>
            <li>So if you are a more mature women, like myself, who needs to ramp up the skin a bit to regain some of that more youthful, hydrated healthy look, this serum worked quite well for me.  </li>
            <li>My esthetician said this is a great product to use after a peel, especially since it&#x27;s organic.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the product and will continue to use as part of my skin care regimen.</li>
            <li>I was sent this product free of charge in exchange for my review.  </li>
            <li>I have to say my skin has never felt so smooth and wrinkle free.  </li>
            <li>Our purest concentration of Vitamin C can help with the production collagen and is an essential anti-oxidant for a youthful and attractive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclaimer: I received a free review sample for evaluation purposes.</li>
            <li>this one does have Witch Hazel as a primary ingredient.  </li>
            <li>Vitamin C 20%,&amp;  Hyaluonic Acid provided moisture, firmness and plumps up your skin,&amp; Rosa Canina Extract to stimulates production of collagen and  &amp; Pomegranate extract to fight free radicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So for those who are particularly sensitive to astringents, this may be a good</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and easily and does not have a strong smell (though it does have a mild one).</li>
            <li>Ideal for skins that are revealing dark spots, fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As long as you follow directions you will have a great looking skin without that oily residue.</li>
            <li>and I got excited.</li>
            <li>The product went on cleanly and didn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue of any kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>lovely little bottle came from the manufacturer for my totally honest thoughts!</li>
            <li>/&gt;No serum is going to give you a facelift in a bottle, but to improve the face you&#x27;ve earned with age and time, this serum will help your skin look as good as it possibly can.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this one in particular is light and actually feels great on my skin.  </li>
            <li>have received this product for free or at a reduced cost for my own personal opinion on the product.  </li>
            <li>It does have a mild citrusy scent that dissipates quickly and doesn&#x27;t stick around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to see a better dispensing system like a simple dropper, for more control.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Since this is a 20% concentration of Vit C along with Hyaluronic Acid, it can and does have a mild temporary effect of a noticeable &amp;#34;sensation&amp;#34; when I put it on.  </li>
            <li>my wife, not knowing that I was using such a product, commented that I seemed to be loooking a bit better!</li>
            <li>Not only does my skin look smoother, my pores seem to have vanished, and my completion is amazing.  </li>
            <li>feet and smile lines start showing.</li>
            <li>My opinions and reviews are 100% my own and come from actual use of the product.</li>
            <li>but worth mentioning.</li>
            <li>I was able to use it directly below my eyes anyway.</li>
            <li>I received this as a complimentary review supplement.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is a nice serum that helps your skin look younger by reducing lines and feel softer by hydrating your skin.  </li>
            <li>This Vitamin C Serum is powerful without drying my face or making my face peel and it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just not crazy about the pump dispenser.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In terms of comparing this serum to others, I&#x27;ve found several that are quite effective.</li>
            <li>apply this to my freshly washed face before applying my moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Remarkable enought o be comfortable recommending a try of this product to those who would like to be able to look in the mirror and see a somewhat less age-lined face looking back at them!</li>
            <li>, it soaked in right away.  </li>
            <li>And two, the pump on this squirts out a very large amount of the serum and there is no way to control it.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and leaves a smooth, soft feeling to my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see if my freckles lighten more and look forward to having some amazing skin again without the dermatologist price tag behind it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it comes in a easy to use bottle with a pump on it so no messy droppers to use</li>
            <li>But within seconds it had absorbed completely into my skin, and felt as smooth as silk.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels very soft and it was comfortable to sleep at night</li>
            <li>To really know that would require several bottles and lots of time, but in my opinion, and considering that my skin looked a bit better around the eyes after a partial bottle, I think it will do some good.</li>
            <li>the little wrinkles truly faded a good amount.  </li>
            <li>Our potent blend can help shed off wrinkles, dark spots , fine lines and dullness.</li>
            <li>It smells great and is not to thick.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve used moisturizers and creams periodically through the years, with mixed results of working okay to dryness, but</li>
            <li>this is the first time I&#x27;ve used a vitamin C skin care serum.</li>
            <li>Now I do recommend that you read directions, the first night I did not</li>
            <li>Over the past year I have tried many different vitamin C serums and out of them all Nutra Essence serum is probably the most potent.</li>
            <li>The first time I pressed on the pump</li>
            <li>You can &#x27;feel&#x27; it when you first start using this serum that&#x27;s because of the 20% concentration of Vitamin C combined with Hyaluronic Acid.</li>
            <li>Once I got the amount of serum to use under control, it went on easily, was absorbed and dried quickly with no unpleasant smell or sticky residue.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving the serum itself 4 stars and would have given it 5 but the bottle &amp; pump issues do need some improvement as many people may not get past that to actually use the product to see how good I think it is.</li>
            <li>My opinions are my own and I was not paid or compensated in any other ways.  </li>
            <li>~ey&amp;#34;, it used to be dull, but I find if I use this serum 2 times per day, my skin becomes more supple and has a better glow to it.  </li>
            <li>The serum is not harsh on my skin like others I have used and to know I can apply this everyday with ease is great.</li>
            <li>Less is MORE!</li>
            <li>This one has been easy enough on my skin while still helping with all of the wrinkles..</li>
            <li>This one by Nutra Essence Organics is really no different, except in one way that pops this up as a strong consideration:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Nutra Essence left my skin tight and very soft, a great first sign! .</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this as it has shown slight results in the time I have been using it so can only get better with more time and use looking forward to all the lines being gone.</li>
            <li>I put the product in a dispenser bottle with a dropper and it worked out much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks, Liz</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than that, I really like this serum.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t expect much and would never expect a miracle.</li>
            <li>Maybe in their future manufacturing they will add scent to the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received a free or discounted product in exchange for providing an unbiased review.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s because you are using too much, so</li>
            <li>These serums really do work both in reducing the appearance of wrinkles and making skin look healthier and brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This serum works pretty well and helps reduce dry spots and smooth the skin.</li>
            <li>After reading some of the other reviews, I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect and wanting to give it a fair chance, have been using it 2X daily (am and pm) since receiving it and just finished the bottle yesterday......</li>
            <li>The 20% potency is very effective on aging skin, and shows results after only a few uses.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so strong, it&#x27;s actually not recommended to put it on the sensitive around-the-eye area (it says so on the bottle) -</li>
            <li>I am a life long herbal supplement taker with strong interests both in the medicinal traditions and modern pharmacological aspects of Earth&#x27;s Natural Bounties.</li>
            <li>A couple previous seemed to give more immediate effects than others (they were also 30 to 40 dollars a pop), yet in my book, it is all about the long-term epidermis treatment.</li>
            <li>Soaked in quickly and did not make my skin extra oily.  </li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t burn which was my main concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>didn’t think there was a particularly noticeable scent.  </li>
            <li>I finished the serum yesterday and highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend this serum for that reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>HIGH POTENCY HYALURANIC ACID:</li>
            <li>It does not mean that I am endorsing this skin product.</li>
            <li>After use i can see the fine lines on my face start to fade a little I have not been using this long but love the results so far.  </li>
            <li>It smells very pleasant,too (natural smell with a hint of citrus).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, this Vitamin C serum comes in a glass bottle with a pump action top reducing the risk of using too much or worse, knocking it off the bathroom sink as you are trying to apply it to your face and thus spilling everywhere making more mess for you to clean up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have personally used a few Vitamin C serums (hey, older dudes, it&#x27;s okay to want to get rid of those under-eye saggies!), and they all worked well enough once you are willing to put in time.</li>
            <li>This product is safe for all skin types and conditions including dry or irritated skin, wrinkles, fine lines, dull complexion, acne, and eczema, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t that the new 57 anyway?  </li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of Vitamin C serums and I have tried several different kinds.  </li>
            <li>It cleanses, removes dried up skin, and moisturizes, leaving my skin feeling soft and looking healthy.</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t need much to do your entire face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a good base under makeup during the day and love the way my skin always have a very soft feel.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I can notice a slight difference in fine lines every time I use it.</li>
            <li>So be aware that it can happen, especially if you are not used to a Vit C/Hyaluronic Acid</li>
            <li>So be aware that it can happen, especially if you are not used to a Vit C/Hyaluronic Acid product.  </li>
            <li>This made my skin look years younger on the first application.  </li>
            <li>I can see that the fine lines around my eyes are smoothing out, and I would say they are somewhat less noticeable since my skin is tighter.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Within a week of using it, you will see your fine lines become less visible.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past week and let me tell you, its by far one of my favorite things I&#x27;ve tried this year.  </li>
            <li>I felt a difference within minutes , feels a little tighter and silk smooth</li>
            <li>am not as young as I once was so this product really received a big hello</li>
            <li>use this serum on my face for a smooth and firm feel to my skin.  </li>
            <li>I was happily surprised with this product.</li>
            <li>I have issues with some products clogging my pores and causing adult acne etc, this didn&#x27;t do that.  </li>
            <li>Let me start off with - I&#x27;m 65 yrs old</li>
            <li>The pump also initially dispensed way too much serum</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t bother/irritate my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t bother/irritate my sensitive skin  -----------------------</li>
            <li>I completely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I tried anyway, and it did sting a tiny bit, but otherwise it just made the skin there feel very tight.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and personally i think it looks much healthier than before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin work up to this by&lt;br</li>
            <li>So if you have sensitive skin you may want to skip a day in between applications.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>This product really does help make you look younger, This removes lines and wrinkles you may have on your face.</li>
            <li>With my busy schedule sitting at home with the pomegranate face mask on is just luxury.</li>
            <li>I am greatly surprised and pleased to report that after a few weeks of regular use, may of my wrinkles seem so somehow have gone into &#x27;remission.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it does have quite a relatively long lasting residue, so the skin absorption isn&#x27;t as quick as others.  </li>
            <li>and I was looking older than I actually was.</li>
            <li>You will usually see results on your skin the very first day, but we suggest you give the product at least 30 days to see the most optimal results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As it is important that you, the buyer, make an informed choice as to whether this is the skin product for you here&#x27;s the complete list of ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Water, Vitamin C Complex (Water, Glycerin, Rosa canina Extract, Purica Grantum Extract, Tetrahexyl Ascorbate, Ascorbyl Glucoside, Ascorbic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Propylene Glycol, PEG-16</li>
            <li>The consistency is thicker than other Vit C / Hyaluronic Acid combos I&#x27;ve tried before, and the dispenser is a type of a pump that dispenses way too much and can be wasteful!  </li>
            <li>First the downside - Like other reviewers stated, the bottle had leaked and serum was caked around the pump and lid when I opened the package.  </li>
            <li>and I had to work with it a few days until I learned how to dispense a much smaller amount, which worked much better and didn&#x27;t waste so much.  </li>
            <li>Thus, I began using this Serum with a certain skepticism and not much hope of any tangible results.</li>
            <li>Hope this helped someone.comfort thing, especially if you have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>my forhead lines barely show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The All Natural Hyaluronic Acid will pull the moisturizer deeply into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;4.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pure and has tons of other things in it</li>
            <li>I am only 26, but I have noticed that my dry skin has been letting fine lines and wrinkles creep up on me for a little while now.</li>
            <li>however, I have developed some minor skin irritation around the outer corners of my mouth area.  </li>
            <li>First, the serum feels very sticky on my skin after application and it stays sticky for about 5-7 minutes, so it&#x27;s not ideal for morning application (unless you have plenty of time to let it completely absorb).</li>
            <li>Apply a small amount with fingertips to freshly cleansed and toned face, and neck.</li>
            <li>Not overly so, since I&#x27;ve been using a smaller concentration of a different Vit C/Hyaluronic Acid serum prior to this product being tested, but if you are not used to it, it can be a bit of a comfort thing, especially if you have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell, slightly citrus  </li>
            <li>And it soaks into your skin pretty fast and does not leave a greasy or oily feeling behind.</li>
            <li>It really does what it claims to do - brightens your skin, makes it glow-y, tight and younger looking.</li>
            <li>I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I&#x27;m offering up to you to read, my 100% opinion and review - whether it be good or bad.</li>

            <li> : I have received a free or greatly discounted product for the purpose of this review.</li>

            <li> Made in the USA, FDA approved, GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) stamped and PARABEN free!</li>
            <li> The serum was provided in exchange for an honest review.</li>

            <li> All thoughts and opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> What I can say right from the get go is this is a GREAT PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li> It goes on very smoothly and doesn&#x27;t add alot of product to your face.</li>
            <li> Kind of a warm tingly sensation that dissipates quickly.  </li>

            <li> I just love everything about this product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad a</li>
            <li> * SAFE FOR ALL SKIN TYPE:</li>
            <li> Potent *</li>
            <li> No nasty scent or smell</li>
            <li> I love that Nutra contains hyaluronic acid and Vitamin E, both of which are known to be beneficial for the skin.  </li>
            <li> I thought this product looked interesting, so I ordered it when I got the chance.</li>
            <li> product reminds me more of an oil than anything else, although it is not oily after application.</li>
            <li> you want to feel better about your skin care</li>
            <li> and she said this was one of the better serums that she has tried that did not have retinol in it.  </li>
            <li> Vitamin C helps our bodies in so many ways.  </li>
            <li> For the most part...</li>
            <li> I love the feel of them...</li>
            <li> and I do notice that my skin is more even in tone and color.  </li>
            <li> but I do know that I just truly love the way this one feels...</li>
            <li> it feels lovely on...and...</li>
            <li> My favorite feature though is the fact it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy or oily.</li>
            <li> I love the thickness.</li>
            <li> I love how well it works.</li>
            <li> I love that the bottle is amber colored which helps the Vitamin C retain</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually quite impressive in terms of living up to the claim that it imparts a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; to your skin.</li>
            <li> The truth is that I don&#x27;t know about any of these promises because I can&#x27;t prove that these actions are happening, but I do know that skin glows and looks better after using this serum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week now and feel like I am able to provide a preliminary review of it&#x27;s effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> I did a lot of research to figure out what would be best for me, long term.</li>
            <li> My skin tone is becoming more even, and others are noticing my radiant glow.</li>
            <li> The fine lines have a more diminished look and my skin tone is more even.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a reduction in the fine lines on my face and the return of a glowing, healthy look.</li>
            <li> The Nutra Essence Organic is a great product, no harsh and all organic.</li>
            <li> I love the light feel of it</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love how smooth my skin looks in the mornings.</li>
            <li> too much and good skin</li>
            <li> and it goes on really easy.</li>
            <li> The pump is easy to use and keeps me from spilling it everywhere.</li>
            <li> and when you are done make sure you moisturize right after!  </li>
            <li> Now I notice fine lines.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to getting rid of the fine lines around my eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li> My face and neck started immediately to look and feel moisturized, firmer, brighter and the fine lines around my eyes seemed to be reduced</li>
            <li> This serum absorbs quickly which I love.</li>
            <li> i see huge improvement for my face.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s definitely made a difference in my skin being more bright and even toned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;So if you are a more mature women, like myself, who needs to ramp up the skin a bit to regain some of that more youthful, hydrated healthy look, this serum worked quite well for me.  </li>
            <li> So if you are a more mature women, like myself, who needs to ramp up the skin a bit to regain some of that more youthful, hydrated healthy look, this serum worked quite well for me.  </li>
            <li> My esthetician said this is a great product to use after a peel, especially since it&#x27;s organic.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy the product and will continue to use as part of my skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> I was sent this product free of charge in exchange for my review.  </li>
            <li> I have to say my skin has never felt so smooth and wrinkle free.  </li>
            <li> Our purest concentration of Vitamin C can help with the production collagen and is an essential anti-oxidant for a youthful and attractive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclaimer: I received a free review sample for evaluation purposes.</li>
            <li> this one does have Witch Hazel as a primary ingredient.  </li>
            <li> Vitamin C 20%,&amp;  Hyaluonic Acid provided moisture, firmness and plumps up your skin,&amp; Rosa Canina Extract to stimulates production of collagen and  &amp; Pomegranate extract to fight free radicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So for those who are particularly sensitive to astringents, this may be a good</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and easily and does not have a strong smell (though it does have a mild one).</li>
            <li> Ideal for skins that are revealing dark spots, fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As long as you follow directions you will have a great looking skin without that oily residue.</li>
            <li> and I got excited.</li>
            <li> The product went on cleanly and didn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue of any kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> lovely little bottle came from the manufacturer for my totally honest thoughts!</li>
            <li> /&gt;No serum is going to give you a facelift in a bottle, but to improve the face you&#x27;ve earned with age and time, this serum will help your skin look as good as it possibly can.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this one in particular is light and actually feels great on my skin.  </li>
            <li> have received this product for free or at a reduced cost for my own personal opinion on the product.  </li>
            <li> It does have a mild citrusy scent that dissipates quickly and doesn&#x27;t stick around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to see a better dispensing system like a simple dropper, for more control.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since this is a 20% concentration of Vit C along with Hyaluronic Acid, it can and does have a mild temporary effect of a noticeable &amp;#34;sensation&amp;#34; when I put it on.  </li>
            <li> my wife, not knowing that I was using such a product, commented that I seemed to be loooking a bit better!</li>
            <li> Not only does my skin look smoother, my pores seem to have vanished, and my completion is amazing.  </li>
            <li> feet and smile lines start showing.</li>
            <li> My opinions and reviews are 100% my own and come from actual use of the product.</li>
            <li> but worth mentioning.</li>
            <li> I was able to use it directly below my eyes anyway.</li>
            <li> I received this as a complimentary review supplement.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this is a nice serum that helps your skin look younger by reducing lines and feel softer by hydrating your skin.  </li>
            <li> This Vitamin C Serum is powerful without drying my face or making my face peel and it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not crazy about the pump dispenser.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In terms of comparing this serum to others, I&#x27;ve found several that are quite effective.</li>
            <li> apply this to my freshly washed face before applying my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Remarkable enought o be comfortable recommending a try of this product to those who would like to be able to look in the mirror and see a somewhat less age-lined face looking back at them!</li>
            <li> , it soaked in right away.  </li>
            <li> And two, the pump on this squirts out a very large amount of the serum and there is no way to control it.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and leaves a smooth, soft feeling to my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see if my freckles lighten more and look forward to having some amazing skin again without the dermatologist price tag behind it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it comes in a easy to use bottle with a pump on it so no messy droppers to use</li>
            <li> But within seconds it had absorbed completely into my skin, and felt as smooth as silk.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels very soft and it was comfortable to sleep at night</li>
            <li> To really know that would require several bottles and lots of time, but in my opinion, and considering that my skin looked a bit better around the eyes after a partial bottle, I think it will do some good.</li>
            <li> the little wrinkles truly faded a good amount.  </li>
            <li> Our potent blend can help shed off wrinkles, dark spots , fine lines and dullness.</li>
            <li> It smells great and is not to thick.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used moisturizers and creams periodically through the years, with mixed results of working okay to dryness, but</li>
            <li> this is the first time I&#x27;ve used a vitamin C skin care serum.</li>
            <li> Now I do recommend that you read directions, the first night I did not</li>
            <li> Over the past year I have tried many different vitamin C serums and out of them all Nutra Essence serum is probably the most potent.</li>
            <li> The first time I pressed on the pump</li>
            <li> You can &#x27;feel&#x27; it when you first start using this serum that&#x27;s because of the 20% concentration of Vitamin C combined with Hyaluronic Acid.</li>
            <li> Once I got the amount of serum to use under control, it went on easily, was absorbed and dried quickly with no unpleasant smell or sticky residue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving the serum itself 4 stars and would have given it 5 but the bottle &amp; pump issues do need some improvement as many people may not get past that to actually use the product to see how good I think it is.</li>
            <li> My opinions are my own and I was not paid or compensated in any other ways.  </li>
            <li> ~ey&amp;#34;, it used to be dull, but I find if I use this serum 2 times per day, my skin becomes more supple and has a better glow to it.  </li>
            <li> The serum is not harsh on my skin like others I have used and to know I can apply this everyday with ease is great.</li>
            <li> Less is MORE!</li>
            <li> This one has been easy enough on my skin while still helping with all of the wrinkles..</li>
            <li> This one by Nutra Essence Organics is really no different, except in one way that pops this up as a strong consideration:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Nutra Essence left my skin tight and very soft, a great first sign! .</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this as it has shown slight results in the time I have been using it so can only get better with more time and use looking forward to all the lines being gone.</li>
            <li> I put the product in a dispenser bottle with a dropper and it worked out much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks, Liz</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than that, I really like this serum.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t expect much and would never expect a miracle.</li>
            <li> Maybe in their future manufacturing they will add scent to the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received a free or discounted product in exchange for providing an unbiased review.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s because you are using too much, so</li>
            <li> These serums really do work both in reducing the appearance of wrinkles and making skin look healthier and brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This serum works pretty well and helps reduce dry spots and smooth the skin.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the other reviews, I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect and wanting to give it a fair chance, have been using it 2X daily (am and pm) since receiving it and just finished the bottle yesterday......</li>
            <li> The 20% potency is very effective on aging skin, and shows results after only a few uses.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so strong, it&#x27;s actually not recommended to put it on the sensitive around-the-eye area (it says so on the bottle) -</li>
            <li> I am a life long herbal supplement taker with strong interests both in the medicinal traditions and modern pharmacological aspects of Earth&#x27;s Natural Bounties.</li>
            <li> A couple previous seemed to give more immediate effects than others (they were also 30 to 40 dollars a pop), yet in my book, it is all about the long-term epidermis treatment.</li>
            <li> Soaked in quickly and did not make my skin extra oily.  </li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t burn which was my main concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> didn’t think there was a particularly noticeable scent.  </li>
            <li> I finished the serum yesterday and highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> and I highly recommend this serum for that reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> HIGH POTENCY HYALURANIC ACID:</li>
            <li> It does not mean that I am endorsing this skin product.</li>
            <li> After use i can see the fine lines on my face start to fade a little I have not been using this long but love the results so far.  </li>
            <li> It smells very pleasant,too (natural smell with a hint of citrus).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , this Vitamin C serum comes in a glass bottle with a pump action top reducing the risk of using too much or worse, knocking it off the bathroom sink as you are trying to apply it to your face and thus spilling everywhere making more mess for you to clean up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have personally used a few Vitamin C serums (hey, older dudes, it&#x27;s okay to want to get rid of those under-eye saggies!), and they all worked well enough once you are willing to put in time.</li>
            <li> This product is safe for all skin types and conditions including dry or irritated skin, wrinkles, fine lines, dull complexion, acne, and eczema, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t that the new 57 anyway?  </li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Vitamin C serums and I have tried several different kinds.  </li>
            <li> It cleanses, removes dried up skin, and moisturizes, leaving my skin feeling soft and looking healthy.</li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t need much to do your entire face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a good base under makeup during the day and love the way my skin always have a very soft feel.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I can notice a slight difference in fine lines every time I use it.</li>
            <li> So be aware that it can happen, especially if you are not used to a Vit C/Hyaluronic Acid</li>
            <li> So be aware that it can happen, especially if you are not used to a Vit C/Hyaluronic Acid product.  </li>
            <li> This made my skin look years younger on the first application.  </li>
            <li> I can see that the fine lines around my eyes are smoothing out, and I would say they are somewhat less noticeable since my skin is tighter.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> Within a week of using it, you will see your fine lines become less visible.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past week and let me tell you, its by far one of my favorite things I&#x27;ve tried this year.  </li>
            <li> I felt a difference within minutes , feels a little tighter and silk smooth</li>
            <li> am not as young as I once was so this product really received a big hello</li>
            <li> use this serum on my face for a smooth and firm feel to my skin.  </li>
            <li> I was happily surprised with this product.</li>
            <li> I have issues with some products clogging my pores and causing adult acne etc, this didn&#x27;t do that.  </li>
            <li> Let me start off with - I&#x27;m 65 yrs old</li>
            <li> The pump also initially dispensed way too much serum</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t bother/irritate my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t bother/irritate my sensitive skin  -----------------------</li>
            <li> I completely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I tried anyway, and it did sting a tiny bit, but otherwise it just made the skin there feel very tight.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and personally i think it looks much healthier than before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin work up to this by&lt;br</li>
            <li> So if you have sensitive skin you may want to skip a day in between applications.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> This product really does help make you look younger, This removes lines and wrinkles you may have on your face.</li>
            <li> With my busy schedule sitting at home with the pomegranate face mask on is just luxury.</li>
            <li> I am greatly surprised and pleased to report that after a few weeks of regular use, may of my wrinkles seem so somehow have gone into &#x27;remission.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it does have quite a relatively long lasting residue, so the skin absorption isn&#x27;t as quick as others.  </li>
            <li> and I was looking older than I actually was.</li>
            <li> You will usually see results on your skin the very first day, but we suggest you give the product at least 30 days to see the most optimal results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As it is important that you, the buyer, make an informed choice as to whether this is the skin product for you here&#x27;s the complete list of ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Water, Vitamin C Complex (Water, Glycerin, Rosa canina Extract, Purica Grantum Extract, Tetrahexyl Ascorbate, Ascorbyl Glucoside, Ascorbic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Propylene Glycol, PEG-16</li>
            <li> The consistency is thicker than other Vit C / Hyaluronic Acid combos I&#x27;ve tried before, and the dispenser is a type of a pump that dispenses way too much and can be wasteful!  </li>
            <li> First the downside - Like other reviewers stated, the bottle had leaked and serum was caked around the pump and lid when I opened the package.  </li>
            <li> and I had to work with it a few days until I learned how to dispense a much smaller amount, which worked much better and didn&#x27;t waste so much.  </li>
            <li> Thus, I began using this Serum with a certain skepticism and not much hope of any tangible results.</li>
            <li> Hope this helped someone.comfort thing, especially if you have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> my forhead lines barely show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The All Natural Hyaluronic Acid will pull the moisturizer deeply into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;4.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pure and has tons of other things in it</li>
            <li> I am only 26, but I have noticed that my dry skin has been letting fine lines and wrinkles creep up on me for a little while now.</li>
            <li> however, I have developed some minor skin irritation around the outer corners of my mouth area.  </li>
            <li> First, the serum feels very sticky on my skin after application and it stays sticky for about 5-7 minutes, so it&#x27;s not ideal for morning application (unless you have plenty of time to let it completely absorb).</li>
            <li> Apply a small amount with fingertips to freshly cleansed and toned face, and neck.</li>
            <li> Not overly so, since I&#x27;ve been using a smaller concentration of a different Vit C/Hyaluronic Acid serum prior to this product being tested, but if you are not used to it, it can be a bit of a comfort thing, especially if you have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell, slightly citrus  </li>
            <li> And it soaks into your skin pretty fast and does not leave a greasy or oily feeling behind.</li>
            <li> It really does what it claims to do - brightens your skin, makes it glow-y, tight and younger looking.</li>
            <li> I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I&#x27;m offering up to you to read, my 100% opinion and review - whether it be good or bad.</li>
            <li> - I suppose that is what the makers count on to keep selling the morduct to return customers - but the darned stuff, applied twice a day as directed, has definitely improved my appearance - and while I may not be or look &#x27;younger&#x27;, my face is clearly less wrinkles, the crow&#x27;s feet are considerably reduced and</li>
            <li> amount looks small, but really I used only the tiniest amount, and it has lasted a LONG time.  </li>

            <li> It also took away the dry flakiness of parts of my skin that had that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am amazed at the response after a single application.</li>
            <li> Leaves a bit of a tacky feel if applying too much, and it can clog some pores if applied to thick!  </li>
            <li> Let me warn you that if you use with a micro-derm wash or something similar it does sting a little bit afterwards from the Vitamin C.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had combo skin, an oily &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; zone and dry flaky other areas to my face/neck.  </li>
            <li> I am just not ready for all of that.</li>
            <li> had a few blemishes this winter that left purple spots on my face, I was hoping this might help with fading them somehow</li>
            <li> I have always been a bit suspicious about any product or procedure that claims to slow down the effect of natural aging.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so use it sparingly.  </li>
            <li> You may want to begin using this once per day or every other day, working up to twice per day.</li>
            <li> I used to have a lot of wrinkles on my forehead and other spots on my face</li>
            <li> There is a pump dispenser, but you only need to use it sparingly since it covers well with a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have an issue with Witch Hazel (in fact, I use it as a part of a personally made aftershave), yet I noticed a few reviews who felt the serum dried out their skin.  </li>
            <li> - sorry I didn&#x27;t take a before and after picture to really compare.  </li>
            <li> I didnt want to use one of the products that I would have to use forever due to how tight it made my skin.</li>
            <li> I used to be very skeptical about face serums and especially about topical application of vitamins (especially any vitamin that you could put in your body via food or drink).</li>
            <li> I have found that Vitamin C Skin care serums work well for my skin, especially in the summer and can be applied to a newly cleaned face as a base for makeup or even mixed with makeup.</li>
            <li> It has evened out my wrinkles so they are less visible.</li>
            <li> Texture and tone are improved, age spots lightened, and wrinkles a little less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> : I received this item for little or no cost in exchange for an unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It felt a little sticky.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little orange, but the color doesn&#x27;t transfer to your face.</li>
            <li> I use this in the morning and it makes my skin feel hydrated and firm.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve had a few weeks to try this serum out, and here is what I&#x27;ve discovered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> THIN IS KEY HERE!</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few weeks of using I notice improvement to my eyes in all areas, under, sides and my forehead.</li>
            <li> Everyday</li>
            <li> but you be the judge as there is probably very little of it in this 1.6 fl.</li>
            <li> I could immediately feel that the \\&quot;serum\\&quot; was doing something - it felt almost as it there was a small amount of tightening going on.</li>
            <li> comes in a small bottle with an eye dropper dispensing cap.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure about differences in serums like this</li>
            <li> It turns out that I was wrong about the effect such serums have on your face.</li>
            <li> Nutra Essence sent me a bottle to try their product for review with the understanding that my review might be negative or positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Take it slow and build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seriously guys...</li>
            <li> and they burned and were actually painful enough that I discontinued using them.</li>
            <li> is a very thick serum</li>
            <li> Your skin feels tighter and you get this yellowish glow that is almost like a bit of a fake tan.</li>
            <li> Dont go looking at expensive stores.</li>
            <li> and use a thin layer!!</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t be afraid to buy it!</li>
            <li> I just hate the dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am in denial that I am now at that age where crows feet and smile lines start showing. I am just not ready for all of that. I did a lot of research to figure out what would be best for me, long term. I didnt want to use one of the products that I would have to use forever due to how tight it made my skin. I am not into the cosmetic surgery look. This one has been easy enough on my skin while still helping with all of the wrinkles.. it takes over a week to see results, though</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t use serums because of the greasy feeling, but This stuff worked really for me! I am only 26, but I have noticed that my dry skin has been letting fine lines and wrinkles creep up on me for a little while now. I use this in the morning and it makes my skin feel hydrated and firm. I can notice a slight difference in fine lines every time I use it.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this vitamin c serum is great it comes in a easy to use bottle with a pump on it so no messy droppers to use and it goes on really easy. And it soaks into your skin pretty fast and does not leave a greasy or oily feeling behind. After use i can see the fine lines on my face start to fade a little I have not been using this long but love the results so far.  It has good stuff for your face in it so that is also a plus I will continue to use this as it has shown slight results in the time I have been using it so can only get better with more time and use looking forward to all the lines being gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past week and let me tell you, its by far one of my favorite things I&#x27;ve tried this year.  Not only does my skin look smoother, my pores seem to have vanished, and my completion is amazing.  I have a face of freckles and very fair skin, and this stuff is liquid gold!  Let me warn you that if you use with a micro-derm wash or something similar it does sting a little bit afterwards from the Vitamin C.  I&#x27;m excited to see if my freckles lighten more and look forward to having some amazing skin again without the dermatologist price tag behind it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product for free or at a reduced cost for my own personal opinion on the product.  My opinions and reviews are 100% my own and come from actual use of the product.</li>
            <li> I know I am a guy, but, guy&#x27;s like nice, healthy looking and feeling skin too! I love this this Vitamin C serum … it makes my skin feel renewed. I am amazed at the response after a single application. It cleanses, removes dried up skin, and moisturizes, leaving my skin feeling soft and looking healthy.</li>
            <li> Sample received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this serum on my face for a smooth and firm feel to my skin.  I scrub my face daily using a spa-style scrub and then I moisturize using an oil like this.  I&#x27;m in my fifties and I don;t have any wrinkles and I attribute this to not being in the sun too much and good skin care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil is a step towards proper skin care.</li>
            <li> As a woman in my fifties, I&#x27;ve tried just about everything to maintain youthful looking skin. When I was asked to review Nutra Essence Organics Vitamin C Skin Care Serum, I have to say that I hesitated. I&#x27;ve tried Vit C serum before and they burned and were actually painful enough that I discontinued using them. I was happily surprised with this product. It didn&#x27;t sting, wasn&#x27;t oily, and left my skin feeling great! I&#x27;ve seen a reduction in the fine lines on my face and the return of a glowing, healthy look. I will continue to use this serum!</li>
            <li> Great product!!! I had done some research and wanted to try this out. It smells great and is not to thick. It goes on very smoothly and doesn&#x27;t add alot of product to your face. It&#x27;s great to use under your makeup.</li>
            <li> Upfront: I received this item for little or no cost in exchange for an unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 48 and have lost about 50 pounds.  I never had a problem with wrinkles, until I lost the weight.  Now I notice fine lines.  I&#x27;ve always had combo skin, an oily &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; zone and dry flaky other areas to my face/neck.  So I&#x27;ve had a few weeks to try this serum out, and here is what I&#x27;ve discovered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks more &amp;#34;glow~ey&amp;#34;, it used to be dull, but I find if I use this serum 2 times per day, my skin becomes more supple and has a better glow to it.  My husband even said my skin looked good.  The fine lines have a more diminished look and my skin tone is more even.  It does have a mild citrusy scent that dissipates quickly and doesn&#x27;t stick around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This didn&#x27;t leave my skin oily feeling, it soaked in right away.  I have issues with some products clogging my pores and causing adult acne etc, this didn&#x27;t do that.  Soaked in quickly and did not make my skin extra oily.  It also took away the dry flakiness of parts of my skin that had that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***WHAT I DON&#x27;T LIKE?  Leaves a bit of a tacky feel if applying too much, and it can clog some pores if applied to thick!  PUTTING IT ON THIN IS KEY HERE! The consistency is thicker than other Vit C / Hyaluronic Acid combos I&#x27;ve tried before, and the dispenser is a type of a pump that dispenses way too much and can be wasteful!  I&#x27;d like to see a better dispensing system like a simple dropper, for more control.  I did reduce a star based upon this alone, as it can be an issue. I put the product in a dispenser bottle with a dropper and it worked out much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this is a 20% concentration of Vit C along with Hyaluronic Acid, it can and does have a mild temporary effect of a noticeable &amp;#34;sensation&amp;#34; when I put it on.  Not overly so, since I&#x27;ve been using a smaller concentration of a different Vit C/Hyaluronic Acid serum prior to this product being tested, but if you are not used to it, it can be a bit of a comfort thing, especially if you have sensitive skin.  Kind of a warm tingly sensation that dissipates quickly.  So be aware that it can happen, especially if you are not used to a Vit C/Hyaluronic Acid product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The amount looks small, but really I used only the tiniest amount, and it has lasted a LONG time.  I can get 2 - 3 months out of a bottle depending on how I use it.  I also liked how it is MADE IN THE USA, and that is a huge selling for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you are a more mature women, like myself, who needs to ramp up the skin a bit to regain some of that more youthful, hydrated healthy look, this serum worked quite well for me.  Hope this helped someone.comfort thing, especially if you have sensitive skin.  Kind of a warm tingly sensation that dissipates quickly.

            <li> The Nutra Essence Organic is a great product, no harsh and all organic. As long as you follow directions you will have a great looking skin without that oily residue. I felt a difference within minutes , feels a little tighter and silk smooth</li>
            <li> I just love everything about this product. I&#x27;ve used it for the last two weeks and I&#x27;m noticing a difference in my face and neck.  My skin tone is becoming more even, and others are noticing my radiant glow. My esthetician said this is a great product to use after a peel, especially since it&#x27;s organic.  I&#x27;m looking forward to getting rid of the fine lines around my eyes and mouth. I am not expecting overnight results, especially since the lines didn&#x27;t appear overnight. I enjoy the product and will continue to use as part of my skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> Let me start off with - I&#x27;m 65 yrs old and I&#x27;ve used moisturizers and creams periodically through the years, with mixed results of working okay to dryness, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve used a vitamin C skin care serum. After reading some of the other reviews, I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect and wanting to give it a fair chance, have been using it 2X daily (am and pm) since receiving it and just finished the bottle yesterday......so here&#x27;s my review -  First the downside - Like other reviewers stated, the bottle had leaked and serum was caked around the pump and lid when I opened the package.  The pump also initially dispensed way too much serum and I had to work with it a few days until I learned how to dispense a much smaller amount, which worked much better and didn&#x27;t waste so much.  Now the good things - Once I got the amount of serum to use under control, it went on easily, was absorbed and dried quickly with no unpleasant smell or sticky residue. My skin feels very soft and it was comfortable to sleep at night (haven&#x27;t noticed any sticky residue once it dries).  It&#x27;s also a good base under makeup during the day and love the way my skin always have a very soft feel.  My face and neck started immediately to look and feel moisturized, firmer, brighter and the fine lines around my eyes seemed to be reduced - sorry I didn&#x27;t take a before and after picture to really compare.  I finished the serum yesterday and highly recommend it.  I&#x27;m giving the serum itself 4 stars and would have given it 5 but the bottle &amp; pump issues do need some improvement as many people may not get past that to actually use the product to see how good I think it is.</li>
            <li> I was sent this product free of charge in exchange for my review.  I have to say my skin has never felt so smooth and wrinkle free.  I didn&#x27;t like the way this went on initially.  It felt a little sticky.  But within seconds it had absorbed completely into my skin, and felt as smooth as silk.  I don&#x27;t wear makeup and am a senior citizen.  This made my skin look years younger on the first application.  I&#x27;m only on my second day.  So I will be updating this review as time goes on.  What I can say right from the get go is this is a GREAT PRODUCT.  So here&#x27;s my update.  The product continues to please....however, I have developed some minor skin irritation around the outer corners of my mouth area.  So I have discontinued using it in that area.  Might just be me and my skin.....but worth mentioning.</li>

            <li> Made in the USA, FDA approved, GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) stamped and PARABEN free! No nasty scent or smell, this Vitamin C serum comes in a glass bottle with a pump action top reducing the risk of using too much or worse, knocking it off the bathroom sink as you are trying to apply it to your face and thus spilling everywhere making more mess for you to clean up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is recommended that you use this twice daily but if you have never used this before I recommend starting off with once a day just to see how your skin reacts. Take it slow and build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what else is in this product? As it is important that you, the buyer, make an informed choice as to whether this is the skin product for you here&#x27;s the complete list of ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Water, Vitamin C Complex (Water, Glycerin, Rosa canina Extract, Purica Grantum Extract, Tetrahexyl Ascorbate, Ascorbyl Glucoside, Ascorbic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Propylene Glycol, PEG-16 Macadamia Glycerides, Octyldodecanol, Ethyhexyl Palmitate, Zea Mays (corn) Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Cholecalcifero, Retinyl Palmitate, Pyridoxine HCI, Phytonadione, Silica, Sodium Propoxyhydroxypropyl Thiosulfate Silica, Acylates/CI0-30 Alkyl Acylate Crosspolymer, Triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, Hexylene Glycol).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally am not fond of propylene glycol and hexylene glycol but you be the judge as there is probably very little of it in this 1.6 fl. oz. bottle! As a reviewer I am just informing you about this product. It does not mean that I am endorsing this skin product. The serum was provided in exchange for an honest review. Thanks, Liz</li>
            <li> The Nutra Essence left my skin tight and very soft, a great first sign! . I can see that the fine lines around my eyes are smoothing out, and I would say they are somewhat less noticeable since my skin is tighter. I love that Nutra contains hyaluronic acid and Vitamin E, both of which are known to be beneficial for the skin.  Now I do recommend that you read directions, the first night I did not and my face was read as a tomato, but then reading the directions and following it made a world of difference.  You may want to begin using this once per day or every other day, working up to twice per day. and use a thin layer!! and when you are done make sure you moisturize right after!  Everyday I use this i see huge improvement for my face.  I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I&#x27;m offering up to you to read, my 100% opinion and review - whether it be good or bad. My opinions are my own and I was not paid or compensated in any other ways.  I completely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent Vitamin C Serum!! It&#x27;s made of the highest quality ingredients and the pump spray works great!!  This will help you get younger looking skin sooner than you might think!  It also helps with scars and burns.. I used this on a burn one time that was about to scar.. This Vitamin C Serum took the burn away! Made it feel better! and after a few weeks of use, no scaring!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this! GREAT STUFF</li>
            <li> I thought this product looked interesting, so I ordered it when I got the chance. I find it to be a very interesting product, that appears to work well when used as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FULL DISCLOSURE: I received a coupon that paid for the product, except for the sales taxes involved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product reminds me more of an oil than anything else, although it is not oily after application. The directions say to use it everywhere on the face except for the \\&quot;delicate\\&quot; areas around the eyes. I was able to use it directly below my eyes anyway. I could immediately feel that the \\&quot;serum\\&quot; was doing something - it felt almost as it there was a small amount of tightening going on. The product went on cleanly and didn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue of any kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How well does it work? To really know that would require several bottles and lots of time, but in my opinion, and considering that my skin looked a bit better around the eyes after a partial bottle, I think it will do some good. The product is recommended as part of a regimen - wash thoroughly, use this product, and follow up with a moisturizer. I would recommend Oil of Olay for this last part. If you do this (and make sure the moisturizer has sunscreen built in), then I have no doubt that your face will look as good as it possibly can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: It feels good, doesn&#x27;t hurt going on, and seems to do some good. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Over the past year I have tried many different vitamin C serums and out of them all Nutra Essence serum is probably the most potent. You can feel and see the effect on your skin immediately after application. Your skin feels tighter and you get this yellowish glow that is almost like a bit of a fake tan. It&#x27;s so strong, it&#x27;s actually not recommended to put it on the sensitive around-the-eye area (it says so on the bottle) - I tried anyway, and it did sting a tiny bit, but otherwise it just made the skin there feel very tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a well formulated and very effective serum. There are 2 reasons why I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5. First, the serum feels very sticky on my skin after application and it stays sticky for about 5-7 minutes, so it&#x27;s not ideal for morning application (unless you have plenty of time to let it completely absorb). And two, the pump on this squirts out a very large amount of the serum and there is no way to control it. The first time I pressed on the pump I got the serum sprayed all over my hand and dripping onto my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I really like this serum. I use it at nighttime, after properly cleansing my skin, and before applying moisturizer. It really does what it claims to do - brightens your skin, makes it glow-y, tight and younger looking. It smells very pleasant,too (natural smell with a hint of citrus).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received a free review sample for evaluation purposes. All thoughts and opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I have personally used a few Vitamin C serums (hey, older dudes, it&#x27;s okay to want to get rid of those under-eye saggies!), and they all worked well enough once you are willing to put in time. A couple previous seemed to give more immediate effects than others (they were also 30 to 40 dollars a pop), yet in my book, it is all about the long-term epidermis treatment. This one by Nutra Essence Organics is really no different, except in one way that pops this up as a strong consideration:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No Witch Hazel - another Vitamin C serum I have been using concurrently with this one does have Witch Hazel as a primary ingredient.  I don&#x27;t have an issue with Witch Hazel (in fact, I use it as a part of a personally made aftershave), yet I noticed a few reviews who felt the serum dried out their skin.  I would wager it was the Witch Hazel.  So for those who are particularly sensitive to astringents, this may be a good consideration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it does have quite a relatively long lasting residue, so the skin absorption isn&#x27;t as quick as others.  And I do on occasion get &amp;#34;spritz sputter&amp;#34; across my palm.  Heh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has both the FDA and GMP stamps, as well as the MADE IN THE USE seal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- I received this as a complimentary review supplement.  I am a life long herbal supplement taker with strong interests both in the medicinal traditions and modern pharmacological aspects of Earth&#x27;s Natural Bounties.</li>
            <li> I have always been a bit suspicious about any product or procedure that claims to slow down the effect of natural aging. Thus, I began using this Serum with a certain skepticism and not much hope of any tangible results. I am greatly surprised and pleased to report that after a few weeks of regular use, may of my wrinkles seem so somehow have gone into &#x27;remission.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if I would continue to look this way if I stopped using the product - I suppose that is what the makers count on to keep selling the morduct to return customers - but the darned stuff, applied twice a day as directed, has definitely improved my appearance - and while I may not be or look &#x27;younger&#x27;, my face is clearly less wrinkles, the crow&#x27;s feet are considerably reduced and my forhead lines barely show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even my wife, not knowing that I was using such a product, commented that I seemed to be loooking a bit better! After 48 years of marriage, I take that as quite a compliment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t expect much and would never expect a miracle. However, the results are rather remarkable. Remarkable enought o be comfortable recommending a try of this product to those who would like to be able to look in the mirror and see a somewhat less age-lined face looking back at them!</li>
            <li> I received a sample and fell in love.&lt;br /&gt;I am not as young as I once was so this product really received a big hello when I got it.&lt;br /&gt;After using for a week I am very happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels great and personally i think it looks much healthier than before.&lt;br /&gt;If you want to feel better about your skin care this product is a great addition.</li>
            <li> My wife has tried out all sorts of different products like this Vitamin C serum and she said this was one of the better serums that she has tried that did not have retinol in it.  She said she could feel a difference in the softness of her skin and the little wrinkles truly faded a good amount.  She had no problem with breakouts or and burning or irritation when using this serum.  It simply did the job it was supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a nice serum that helps your skin look younger by reducing lines and feel softer by hydrating your skin.  Recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> Every thing you need to fight off the effects of aging on your skin, this product helps you keep the glow of youth and all ingredients are in just one bottle! WOW! Vitamin C 20%,&amp;  Hyaluonic Acid provided moisture, firmness and plumps up your skin,&amp; Rosa Canina Extract to stimulates production of collagen and  &amp; Pomegranate extract to fight free radicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Apply twice a day once in the morning and once at night. If you have sensitive skin work up to this by&lt;br /&gt;  Starting just once every other day, then move up to once per day, working up to twice per day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Apply a small amount with fingertips to freshly cleansed and toned face, and neck. Allow time to absorb prior to moisturizer application.&lt;br /&gt;2. Use a good moisturizer immediately afterward.&lt;br /&gt;3. The All Natural Hyaluronic Acid will pull the moisturizer deeply into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;4.  You will usually see results on your skin the very first day, but we suggest you give the product at least 30 days to see the most optimal results.&lt;br /&gt;5. This product is safe for all skin types and conditions including dry or irritated skin, wrinkles, fine lines, dull complexion, acne, and eczema, etc.&lt;br /&gt;6.  Will not clog pores, does not contain parabens or alcohol.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C helps our bodies in so many ways.  Now we are finding it in serums to help reduce facial signs of aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes in a small bottle with an eye dropper dispensing cap.  A little goes a long way so use it sparingly.  Rub it in thoroughly.  Within a week of using it, you will see your fine lines become less visible.  Use it longer and you will see a glow to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn’t think there was a particularly noticeable scent.  I had hoped there would be as I thought it would add to the product.  Maybe in their future manufacturing they will add scent to the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received a free or discounted product in exchange for providing an unbiased review.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Since being introduced to Vitamin C Serum, I&#x27;ve been amazed at how my skin has responded.  Texture and tone are improved, age spots lightened, and wrinkles a little less noticeable.  This serum is one of the best, if not the best, I&#x27;ve tried.  The 20% potency is very effective on aging skin, and shows results after only a few uses.  It&#x27;s not a miracle, but it will improve your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No serum is going to give you a facelift in a bottle, but to improve the face you&#x27;ve earned with age and time, this serum will help your skin look as good as it possibly can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product received for review.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Vitamin C serums and I have tried several different kinds.  For the most part...I love the feel of them...this one in particular is light and actually feels great on my skin.  The manufacturer says that you can use moisturizer over this but I never do...I love the light feel of it and I do notice that my skin is more even in tone and color.  I focus on eyes and laughing lines and I do see a difference.  I am not sure about differences in serums like this but I do know that I just truly love the way this one feels...my husband has a tendency to use everything I use and he loves it, too.  It&#x27;s pure and has tons of other things in it and I will say again...it feels lovely on...and...anything that lessens wrinkles is a winner with me!&lt;br /&gt;My lovely little bottle came from the manufacturer for my totally honest thoughts!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 57. I don&#x27;t want to look 57. I want to look 40? Isn&#x27;t that the new 57 anyway?  This Vitamin C Serum is powerful without drying my face or making my face peel and it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. This serum absorbs quickly which I love. My favorite feature though is the fact it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy or oily. I use this at night before bed and I absolutely love how smooth my skin looks in the mornings. My skin has a glow to it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had no reactions to this serum. No flaky skin, no redness.  You can &#x27;feel&#x27; it when you first start using this serum that&#x27;s because of the 20% concentration of Vitamin C combined with Hyaluronic Acid. So if you have sensitive skin you may want to skip a day in between applications.&lt;br /&gt;This is a very thick serum but it spreads like water. Word of advice. Less is MORE! You really don&#x27;t need much to do your entire face. If your face feels sticky or tacky it&#x27;s because you are using too much, so next application use LESS!!&lt;br /&gt;The reason for only 4 stars is the dispenser. I&#x27;m just not crazy about the pump dispenser. I wish this had an eye dropper. Because you can&#x27;t control how much product comes out of the pump I feel like I waste a lot of the product.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is awesome!! I love the thickness. I love how well it works. I love that the bottle is amber colored which helps the Vitamin C retain it&#x27;s potency. I just hate the dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I have received a free or greatly discounted product for the purpose of this review. The opinions are 100% mine. I have not been influenced in any way. I did not receive cash payment to write this review. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally</li>
            <li> This product really does help make you look younger, This removes lines and wrinkles you may have on your face. I used to have a lot of wrinkles on my forehead and other spots on my face and I was looking older than I actually was. I started applying this product to my face It helped remove the lines and wrinkles that I had. I now look a lot younger and a lot of my friends notice the difference and think I look younger as well. I am very happy with this product and with myself now!</li>
            <li> I have found that Vitamin C Skin care serums work well for my skin, especially in the summer and can be applied to a newly cleaned face as a base for makeup or even mixed with makeup. This serum works pretty well and helps reduce dry spots and smooth the skin. It works well with acne prone skin and oily skin too. Recommended.&lt;br /&gt;[Free Sample received for review]</li>
            <li> Nice and feels great. I used to make DIY Vitamin C serum using ascorbic acid. This is much better! No side effects observed. Sample was provided for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I used to be very skeptical about face serums and especially about topical application of vitamins (especially any vitamin that you could put in your body via food or drink). It turns out that I was wrong about the effect such serums have on your face. It&#x27;s actually quite impressive in terms of living up to the claim that it imparts a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; to your skin. These serums really do work both in reducing the appearance of wrinkles and making skin look healthier and brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of comparing this serum to others, I&#x27;ve found several that are quite effective. This one has the benefit of not &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; or tingling as compared to others. It goes on smoothly and easily and does not have a strong smell (though it does have a mild one). It&#x27;s a little orange, but the color doesn&#x27;t transfer to your face. There is a pump dispenser, but you only need to use it sparingly since it covers well with a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read a lot about how these serums help build collagen in the skin, reduce age spots and blemishes, and the antioxidants in them promote healthier, younger-looking skin. The truth is that I don&#x27;t know about any of these promises because I can&#x27;t prove that these actions are happening, but I do know that skin glows and looks better after using this serum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week now and feel like I am able to provide a preliminary review of it&#x27;s effectiveness.  Nutra Essence sent me a bottle to try their product for review with the understanding that my review might be negative or positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply this to my freshly washed face before applying my moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell, slightly citrus  if anything.  It dries quickly and leaves a smooth, soft feeling to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a few blemishes this winter that left purple spots on my face, I was hoping this might help with fading them somehow and it&#x27;s definitely made a difference in my skin being more bright and even toned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best compliment was when I was standing in a room with a skylight and my husband said &amp;#34;your skin looks like porcelain, what have you been doing to it?&amp;#34; That&#x27;s when I knew this product was making a difference.  I have no reservations in recommending this to anyone looking for clrarer, brighter skin.</li>
            <li> Since I purchased this product i have been using and it is Amazing!!!! My skin is glowing. I think i found what i have been looking for, for a long time. What a great product for a great price. Dont go looking at expensive stores. Its HERE !!!</li>
            <li> My mother always made homemade face mask and used Pomegranate juice for one of her mask. After seeing my wrinkles she gave me her recipe. With my busy schedule sitting at home with the pomegranate face mask on is just luxury. Then I found this serum made with pomegranate and I got excited. After using this serum my cheeks looks and feel more plump, the wrinkles are not as noticeable and my mom is impressed that I had to get her own bottle. The serum is not harsh on my skin like others I have used and to know I can apply this everyday with ease is great. The pump is easy to use and keeps me from spilling it everywhere.</li>
