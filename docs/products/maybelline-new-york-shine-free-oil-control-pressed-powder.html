            <li>Very nice and Happy using it</li>
            <li>and it is a good product.</li>
            <li>Good quality and stays on all day.</li>
            <li>Two stars instead of one because this compact has a good mirror.</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>The product works great to control oil, and I have a kind of oily face.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT !</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love this powder!</li>
            <li>Girlfriend liked it.  </li>
            <li>I liked the packagjng of this product.</li>
            <li>Which was nice because I&#x27;m Jamaican/Mexican with a medium brown complection that looks nothing like the color of the product in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves a nice matte finish.</li>
            <li>The powder does reduce shine, but it doesn&#x27;t go on very smoothly - feels kind of chalky.</li>
            <li>this soft cameo matched my complexion perfectly.</li>
            <li>Bare Skin Perfecting Makeup &amp; they work perfectly together.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says it will for a great price!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Coverage is practically non-existent and the applicator included in the compact is very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>The color is nice, its easy to apply and helps the make stay in place for hours.</li>
            <li>Is my favorite pressed powder.</li>
            <li>Just wish it came with a better quality puff.</li>
            <li>Came timely and love having the option to buy in bulk</li>
            <li>I will say that I am using L&#x27;Oreal Paris Magic Nude Liquid Powder</li>
            <li>There is no color at all, but I&#x27;m satisfied because I bought it for oil control anyway.</li>
            <li>I know most powders do, but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products (including high-end products) and I just can&#x27;t keep spending $30 per make up compact 2x a month</li>
            <li>I used to use MAC, but I&#x27;ve switched to Loreal and found it works much better.</li>
            <li>I would not be able to wear a bb cream or foundation without it because my skin gets oily.</li>
            <li>I do not re-apply as the day goes on, maybe I should, but overall this is an excellent product for the price.</li>
            <li>I love this powder</li>
            <li>My favorite powder for shiny faces.</li>
            <li>and I feel takes more of my makeup off than what I&#x27;m trying to put on.</li>
            <li>My favorite powder for the face.  </li>
            <li>I also love how it just blends in with my skin.</li>
            <li>I put on my moisturiser and foundation, then put this on top</li>
            <li>It made me look like I have no skin imperfections  , but it&#x27;s shin coverage could be better , I would turn shiny within 3 or 4 hours</li>
            <li>This powder is pretty good.</li>
            <li>I went on a 4 hour road trip and got my fair share of HOT Caribbean sun.</li>
            <li>This is a great color match for my aging skin and never fills in my new agelines.</li>
            <li>have incredibly oily skin, this product has not eliminated, but has done wonders for keeping the gross oily spots at bay, for the most part anyway.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Now In days guys have to look the best they can Inorder to get any attention or make it , so I try to look my best everyday but not make it obvious</li>
            <li>have a flawless look when I use other powders, but not this one.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s an easy fix because I just use my blush brush to apply it for touch ups.</li>
            <li>This is a nice light powder and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to make sure their face doesn&#x27;t look shiny.</li>
            <li>But other than that , it gives you a flawless shine free face for a couple hours.</li>
            <li>It matches my skin tone perfectly and it blends in well with my bb cream and helps me stay oil free all day with little or no reapplication.</li>
            <li>like product but ordered too light of rme</li>
            <li>great ! received order in just a few days.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the color of the product as well, it looks very natural.</li>
            <li>bought this for the quick on the go type use but the scent was so strong it over powered everything.</li>
            <li>Great packaging, good product and hard to find these days!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe there is any miracle powder in the market that can control or absorb my facial oil for the whole day, so I&#x27;m really happy with this product which comes with very friendly pricing as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it so much.</li>
            <li>Good everyday finishing powder at a reasonable price with a good range of colors.  </li>
            <li>I would highly reccomend to anyone who has shine problems :)</li>
            <li>Other than that I love this stuff!!</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend for someone who is looking for something that is JUST as good as high end powders!</li>
            <li>Success.</li>
            <li>this is worth trying.</li>
            <li>and I must say that it gave me the most natural looking finish i&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li>&amp; it takes the shine right out.</li>
            <li>The only downside is the powder puff it comes with falls apart VERY easily.</li>
            <li>It provides only very light coverage,  </li>
            <li>I just recommend tossing the puff &amp; buying a better quality one that can be washed over &amp; over or simply by using a powder/blush brush.</li>
            <li>This powder really does what it says, controls shine!</li>
            <li>, if Maybelline would only stop testing on animals, I&#x27;d purchase more of their products.</li>
            <li>Light coverage and controls the shine of a busy day well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only ok.</li>
            <li>slim compact is perfect to tuck in a small purse for later touch-ups whether you&#x27;re at work or out for the night.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really, really oily skin and use this powder in combination with the Maybelline clear smooth gel foundation.</li>
            <li>It is long lasting, gives a great soft texture to my skin and the color matches pretty well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s, have mildly acne prone, combination skin.</li>
            <li>I replaced it with the powder puff that came with my loose powder and it works much better.</li>
            <li>The powder is very light and there is absolutely no pigment showing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use much of either.</li>
            <li>This is a very inexpensive powder that does the job.</li>
            <li>This works really well.</li>
            <li>I put it over my foundation and it covers up any shine really well.</li>
            <li>This combination works really well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll sometimes order the Maybelline product in multiples, and it&#x27;s cheap enough that I can buy one to leave in my desk at work and have one for my purse.</li>
            <li>with any oil absorbing powder; blot, don&#x27;t blend!!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I really like this powder.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>The compact is very easy to apply and lasts for a few hours.</li>
            <li>Readily available in multiple stores when you need a new one.  </li>
            <li>Despite this, my face did not get oily, which is very very new for me.</li>
            <li>This was paid for as a new product and it would cost too much to return it, so I&#x27;m pitching it and will not buy it again.</li>
            <li>I believe the quality of the puff has been improved, as I was able to wash the puff gently once and it dried well without disintegrating.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it though for the LOW PRICE!</li>
            <li>There was powder on the &#x27;new&#x27; puff.</li>
            <li>Looks very natural.</li>
            <li>I usually use the MAC Blot Powder, but I like the convenience of being able to pick up a product at the grocery store and knowing that it will still work well.</li>
            <li>Really have full coverage on the face and eliminates excessive brightness</li>
            <li>I bought this as an add-on item and when I opened the box I noticed the clear covering was not attached to the cardboard backing.</li>
            <li>Not works completely in my oily skin.</li>
            <li>I use it over a liquid foundation for complete coverage.</li>
            <li>I bought my last compact just 3 weeks ago &amp; its completely falling apart!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to apply this product, and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out; however, I have noticed that in the last 1-2 years, the manufacturer must have changed the makeup puff/sponge that they put in this compact, because it usually falls apart before I use up the makeup in the compact.</li>
            <li>This provides a matte finish even on my oil slick face, for at least 4 hours and doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out, which is kind of a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to continually re-apply, which I usually find myself doing with other shine free powders I&#x27;ve tried.</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as well as the MAC Blot Powder, therefore it doesn&#x27;t last as long, but I just don&#x27;t have time to run to the mall every time I need it.</li>
            <li> only con and the one reason it isn&#x27;t 5 stars is that i still have shine, but not nearly to the degree that it was before.</li>

            <li> so far this is the powder I usually buy along with cover girl, depending which is on sale and it is a good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this forever and ever and it never lets me down.  It provides only very light coverage,  but it&#x27;s non drying and even I can get away with moisturizer and my Maybelline and nothing else if I&#x27;m in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll cry and cry and cry if they ever stop making this!</li>
            <li> like product but ordered too light of rme</li>
            <li> Powder delicate skin. ... Really have full coverage on the face and eliminates excessive brightness</li>
            <li> Wish I could find this product in Canada easier.  Is my favorite pressed powder.</li>
            <li> Helps with my oily nose but needs to be applied often. It&#x27;s also a little lighter than my skin since I have an olive skin tone.</li>
            <li> This powder does a great job for oily skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT ! It sets my foundation great.. &amp; is even great without foundation &amp; still has great coverage! I also use it for touch ups.. A LOT! It lasts quite awhile &amp; doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or cakey at all. I definitely recommend for someone who is looking for something that is JUST as good as high end powders! The only downside is the powder puff it comes with falls apart VERY easily. I bought my last compact just 3 weeks ago &amp; its completely falling apart! But it&#x27;s an easy fix because I just use my blush brush to apply it for touch ups. Just wish it came with a better quality puff. It&#x27;s worth it though for the LOW PRICE! I just recommend tossing the puff &amp; buying a better quality one that can be washed over &amp; over or simply by using a powder/blush brush. Other than that I love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> Great packaging, good product and hard to find these days! Came timely and love having the option to buy in bulk so I have a back up in my pantry. This is a great color match for my aging skin and never fills in my new agelines. Good quality and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> I bought this as an add-on item and when I opened the box I noticed the clear covering was not attached to the cardboard backing. I took it out and discovered this product had been used and then repackaged. There was powder on the &#x27;new&#x27; puff. This was paid for as a new product and it would cost too much to return it, so I&#x27;m pitching it and will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to pressed powder, always reliable.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend liked it.  Success.</li>
            <li> Received a open and used compact.  Gross.</li>
            <li> The color is nice, its easy to apply and helps the make stay in place for hours.</li>
            <li> My wife received this item minus any powder</li>
            <li> This powder really does what it says, controls shine! I have relatively shiny skin, especially in my T-zone, so I have to dab it on there &amp; it takes the shine right out. I don&#x27;t have to continually re-apply, which I usually find myself doing with other shine free powders I&#x27;ve tried. My typical coloring is nude beige &amp; this soft cameo matched my complexion perfectly. I will say that I am using L&#x27;Oreal Paris Magic Nude Liquid Powder Bare Skin Perfecting Makeup &amp; they work perfectly together. I don&#x27;t have to use much of either.</li>
            <li> There is no color at all, but I&#x27;m satisfied because I bought it for oil control anyway. The powder is very light and there is absolutely no pigment showing. Don&#x27;t expect it to brighten your skin tone, It&#x27;s just literally oil control. Looks very natural.</li>
            <li> Not a great product but, considering it costs about 1/5th of my usual pressed powder (which also is not great) this is worth trying.</li>
            <li> This make up transfers. I know most powders do, but when I say transfer, I don&#x27;t just mean you got some make up on your pillow, boyfriend/husbands shirt, your hands, etc. I mean it won&#x27;t be on your face anymore. It will be on (insert previously listed item before here.)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using make up for 10 years. I&#x27;m by no means a stranger to make up. I&#x27;ve tried many products (including high-end products) and I just can&#x27;t keep spending $30 per make up compact 2x a month (I work and go to school and so I use this powder throughout the day as well.) I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s, have mildly acne prone, combination skin. Below is my makeup routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Wash face&lt;br /&gt;-Apply Toner (wait 5 min or so to dry)&lt;br /&gt;-Apply Moisturizer (wait 5 min or so to dry)&lt;br /&gt;-Apply Primer&lt;br /&gt;-Apply Foundation&lt;br /&gt;-Apply pressed powder with makeup puff. (NOT BRUSH)&lt;br /&gt;-Apply blush/bronzer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a flawless look when I use other powders, but not this one. I used to use MAC, but I&#x27;ve switched to Loreal and found it works much better. Two stars instead of one because this compact has a good mirror.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with makeup and I absolutely love this powder! It matches my skin tone perfectly and it blends in well with my bb cream and helps me stay oil free all day with little or no reapplication. I would not be able to wear a bb cream or foundation without it because my skin gets oily.</li>
            <li> This is a very inexpensive powder that does the job. My only complaint is that it sort of cakes to my glasses and I have to keep an eye on it throughout the day and wipe my glasses off. I do not re-apply as the day goes on, maybe I should, but overall this is an excellent product for the price.</li>
            <li> I love this powder it is great. It does what it said its supposed to do. It does take away shine. Product is as described. I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> My favorite powder for shiny faces.</li>
            <li> Product was sent on time and as expected.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> bought this for the quick on the go type use but the scent was so strong it over powered everything. i couldn&#x27;t stand &amp; had to wash off.</li>
            <li> I love it so much. I use it everyday, at work, at parties... Good quality.</li>
            <li> great ! received order in just a few days.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a replacement for my loose powder that has begun to make my drier winter skin look overly cakey. This works really well. It is long lasting, gives a great soft texture to my skin and the color matches pretty well. My only complaint is the quality of the pad given to apply. It scratchy and I feel takes more of my makeup off than what I&#x27;m trying to put on. I replaced it with the powder puff that came with my loose powder and it works much better.</li>
            <li> Very nice and Happy using it</li>
            <li> Great powder for the shine!</li>
            <li> This provides a matte finish even on my oil slick face, for at least 4 hours and doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out, which is kind of a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;Now, if Maybelline would only stop testing on animals, I&#x27;d purchase more of their products.</li>
            <li> Good everyday finishing powder at a reasonable price with a good range of colors.  Readily available in multiple stores when you need a new one.  Light coverage and controls the shine of a busy day well.</li>
            <li> The color was as advertised. It blended perfectly with my skin color. I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long time (years). I like the color, it&#x27;s easy to apply this product, and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out; however, I have noticed that in the last 1-2 years, the manufacturer must have changed the makeup puff/sponge that they put in this compact, because it usually falls apart before I use up the makeup in the compact.</li>
            <li> This powder is pretty good. I put it over my foundation and it covers up any shine really well. I don&#x27;t have oily skin so I can&#x27;t comment on how well it does in that regard. This is a nice light powder and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to make sure their face doesn&#x27;t look shiny.</li>
            <li> I liked the packagjng of this product. The compact is very easy to apply and lasts for a few hours.</li>
            <li> Meh. It&#x27;s only ok. The powder does reduce shine, but it doesn&#x27;t go on very smoothly - feels kind of chalky. Coverage is practically non-existent and the applicator included in the compact is very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> My favorite powder for the face.  Keeps the shine away all day.  Soft Cameo is my color, which is really not much color at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really, really oily skin and use this powder in combination with the Maybelline clear smooth gel foundation. This combination works really well. It takes around 4 hours before I had to blot my face with an oil blotter, which is a feat considering how oily my skin is. I don&#x27;t believe there is any miracle powder in the market that can control or absorb my facial oil for the whole day, so I&#x27;m really happy with this product which comes with very friendly pricing as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have to touch up at all throughout the day, as long as I blot every now and then when I get shiny. There is no significant scent and it does not agitate my skin which can be prone to acne. I believe the quality of the puff has been improved, as I was able to wash the puff gently once and it dried well without disintegrating. Best powder ever and I hope it never gets discontinued!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I hope can be improved is the external packaging which is not air-(or dust-) tight prior to opening. The powder covers + mirrors can be rather dusty or dirty when I first take them out from the delivery box.</li>
            <li> Great product! Great delivery.</li>
            <li> I usually use the MAC Blot Powder, but I like the convenience of being able to pick up a product at the grocery store and knowing that it will still work well. It doesn&#x27;t work as well as the MAC Blot Powder, therefore it doesn&#x27;t last as long, but I just don&#x27;t have time to run to the mall every time I need it. I&#x27;ll sometimes order the Maybelline product in multiples, and it&#x27;s cheap enough that I can buy one to leave in my desk at work and have one for my purse.</li>
            <li> GOES ON MATTE which i hadn&#x27;t even considered until after it had shipped and was already in transit. Which was nice because I&#x27;m Jamaican/Mexican with a medium brown complection that looks nothing like the color of the product in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have incredibly oily skin, this product has not eliminated, but has done wonders for keeping the gross oily spots at bay, for the most part anyway.&lt;br /&gt;The only con and the one reason it isn&#x27;t 5 stars is that i still have shine, but not nearly to the degree that it was before. this has done wonders for my self esteem. I would highly reccomend to anyone who has shine problems :)</li>
            <li> Leaves a nice matte finish.</li>
            <li> Not works completely in my oily skin.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it will for a great price!&lt;br /&gt;As with any oil absorbing powder; blot, don&#x27;t blend!!&lt;br /&gt;The slim compact is perfect to tuck in a small purse for later touch-ups whether you&#x27;re at work or out for the night.&lt;br /&gt;I also use a bit on my hair to absorb some of the oil at my roots!</li>
            <li> I really like this powder. I went on a 4 hour road trip and got my fair share of HOT Caribbean sun. Despite this, my face did not get oily, which is very very new for me. I also love how it just blends in with my skin. I put on my moisturiser and foundation, then put this on top and I must say that it gave me the most natural looking finish i&#x27;ve ever seen. I initially bought this as an on the go backup to my laura mercier loose powder, and it has exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Now In days guys have to look the best they can Inorder to get any attention or make it , so I try to look my best everyday but not make it obvious cause I&#x27;m a sporty guy. So I wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t be noticeable but make a difference in my appearance. Well this powder did just that. It made me look like I have no skin imperfections  , but it&#x27;s shin coverage could be better , I would turn shiny within 3 or 4 hours and I would have to reapply ASAP. But other than that , it gives you a flawless shine free face for a couple hours. My routine is simple , face wash, tone , moisturizer, and powder.</li>
            <li> I am just now buying my second one of these. The product works great to control oil, and I have a kind of oily face. I am very pleased with the color of the product as well, it looks very natural. I use it over a liquid foundation for complete coverage. I highly recommend this product! c:</li>
