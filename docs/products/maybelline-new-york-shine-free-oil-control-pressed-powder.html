            <li> It is just crazy that for me this not expensive Maybelline powder is so much better than  expensive brands like Lancome, Dior, etc.</li>
            <li> once I got a little tanner.</li>
            <li> Maybelline is one of the few brands that she can wear, so when we saw this powder, we tried it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already tried to purchase their newer items and am having a hard time finding one that matches this color.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad</li>
            <li> When mine runs out, I&#x27;ll be really sad!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>

            <li> OILY SKIN POWDER USERS UNITE!  My daughter has oily and sensitive skin, which precludes her from most beauty products as it will either make her skin shinier, or make it break out.  Maybelline is one of the few brands that she can wear, so when we saw this powder, we tried it.  She loves it.  Great price and great value!  It goes on beautifully and lasts all day.  She says she&#x27;ll never use another powder!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice powder, it just doesn&#x27;t quite do the job for my oiliness!</li>
            <li> It´s just i like. It´s very soft and matte...</li>
            <li> Excellent, I&#x27;m very happy with this.</li>
            <li> Excelente producto...</li>
            <li> The applicator is not great, but the powder is quite light and works well to control shine.</li>
            <li> I think it very nice i was looking for something that would be oil free. It was better than I thought it would be, considering the price I got it. It actually started to clear up my skin!:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad Maybelline doesn&#x27;t make this product anymore. I&#x27;ve already tried to purchase their newer items and am having a hard time finding one that matches this color.  When mine runs out, I&#x27;ll be really sad!</li>
            <li> I did think this would be a tad darker that it actually turned out to be but it&#x27;s not too bad. My favorite shade is the golden and I use that one way more, but I had gotten this one at the beginning of spring because we&#x27;re usually whiter before summertime right so I was going to use this and then switch to the golden once I got a little tanner. But I would probably use this in the winter instead since it&#x27;s on the lighter side rather than being a solid beige. It looks more beige in the compact but when you put it on, you can definitely see that it&#x27;s a lot lighter than what you thought. I would probably describe it as in between beige and cameo. This shade deceives you. Beware.</li>
            <li> Thank You great Product and came fast and was as listed!  I would recommend this product to anyone, very glad i purchased.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin but this product is really good on my skin. That is why I always buy this product.</li>
            <li> I was unable to find this powder ion the stores and was  so thrilled to find and buy this powder.  The shipping was very fast, as well.</li>
            <li> It is just crazy that for me this not expensive Maybelline powder is so much better than  expensive brands like Lancome, Dior, etc. So I guess I found what I was looking for and price is more than good :)</li>
            <li> Same as describe. Fast ship.</li>
            <li> Amazing leaves a beautiful finish</li>
            <li> It first sign I had doubts because I&#x27;m a latin girl and always buy sands colors, but when I used it I noticed this was definitely the perfect color for me</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face powder so far. It looks good on my skin.i love it...I will purchase it again.</li>
