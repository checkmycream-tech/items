            <li>Love the smell, love it!</li>
            <li>I showed her my new sun screen and she loved it!</li>
            <li>just love the product, it absorbes on your skin without a sticky feeling.</li>
            <li>If you like that shimmery look you will love this product.</li>
            <li>I was looking for SHIMMER, found this more than under whelming....</li>
            <li>Just ok in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I love the shimmer, the fragrance and the protection.</li>
            <li>Smells and looks fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love this lotion</li>
            <li>Otherwise it protects well from sunburn and leaves a cute sheen of gold shimmer on your skin.  </li>
            <li>I really love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I still love this product.</li>
            <li>works better me than spf15-</li>
            <li>I like the shimmer effect :)</li>
            <li>The sunscreen feels great and my whole family used it at the beach.</li>
            <li>I burn with that- but not so strong as spf 30 or more.  </li>
            <li>MAKES YOU LOOK GREAT WITH THE SHIMMER AND KEEPS YOUR SKIN SO SOFT.</li>
            <li>Thanks subscribe and save!!!</li>
            <li>Australian used to make an excellent product going to searh right now and see if it&#x27;s still available;-)</li>
            <li>moisturizing cream with protection against the sun, a fine vanilla scent, golden shimmerny effect.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much that I had to order it online to find it.  </li>
            <li>Its really good but beware from using white bathing suits, this sunscreen might stain them.  </li>
            <li>It seems to wash out pretty easily.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect sunscreen because it gives your skin a subtle glow.</li>
            <li>Probably any more the cosmetics isn&#x27;t necessary to me in the summer, I will bring this magic cream</li>
            <li>Very reasonable price!</li>
            <li>if SPF 8 ..... Live the shimmer effect on the skin , love the mica in this product</li>
            <li>And it protects your skin as it should, even in the hot Aruba sun!</li>
            <li>The lotion shimmers and sparkles just enough to give your skintone a nice bronzy glow.</li>
            <li>This stuff works well, smells nice and the shimmer is pretty, but it has permanently stained a white cover up and bathing suit.</li>
            <li>Next time though I will buy their tanning oil because it hydrates my skin better.</li>
            <li>I really like the type of shimmer that this sunscreen has.  </li>
            <li>I looked in 4 different retailers for this particular kind and could only find it here.</li>
            <li>Nice small.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff and its hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li>You can really see the shimmer when the sun hits your body but at the same time it&#x27;s not too shiny.</li>
            <li>Soft smell, no transfer, blurs skin imperfections.</li>
            <li>this is really shimmerly so careful around your cloths, but it does make your skin glisten even w/o a tan.</li>

            <li> This stuff works well, smells nice and the shimmer is pretty, but it has permanently stained a white cover up and bathing suit. Even bleach won&#x27;t touch the orange stains it has left behind.</li>
            <li> No shimmer what so ever....The one thing this product did do was turn my bathing suit orange.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> It smells like a tropical island.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I order this product all the way from America (to Denmark, Scandinavia). I can&#x27;t get the shimmer version anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just love the product, it absorbes on your skin without a sticky feeling. But mind you, it may leave white marks on your clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sun cover is great and leaves an even tan.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and its hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect sunscreen because it gives your skin a subtle glow. If they made a lotion with this shimmer, I would wear it every day!</li>
            <li> The lotion shimmers and sparkles just enough to give your skintone a nice bronzy glow. Stays on well in water and with sweating. Did not seem to clog pores like some sun tan lotions.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much that I had to order it online to find it.  I couldn&#x27;t find it at any local store and got tired of driving around looking for it.  It is great sunblock but also makes your skin look so beautiful and shimmery.  If you like that shimmery look you will love this product.</li>

            <li> Absolutely amazing! Makes my pale skin glisten in the sun! I will only be buying this tanning lotion! Also, NO SUNBURN for once while on the beach for a week!!!! Smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I love the shimmer, the fragrance and the protection. You can really see the shimmer when the sun hits your body but at the same time it&#x27;s not too shiny. I even used once when we went out at night and wanted to give my skin a shiny healthy look! Love the smell, love it!</li>

            <li> Great product! Smells and looks fantastic! Not oily at all, feels like a sunblock. Next time though I will buy their tanning oil because it hydrates my skin better.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion BUT I&#x27;m only giving it three stars because it doesn&#x27;t stay put! It rubs onto swimsuit and leaves embarrassing streaks on the black lounger chairs at the pool. Otherwise it protects well from sunburn and leaves a cute sheen of gold shimmer on your skin.  I will continue to use only on my face and legs but not my back or arms that come into contact with the chair!</li>
            <li> I really love this sunscreen. It has shimmer and a pleasant coconut smell. Its really good but beware from using white bathing suits, this sunscreen might stain them.  I still love this product.</li>
            <li> works better me than spf15- I burn with that- but not so strong as spf 30 or more.  I like the shimmer effect :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a year and then couldnt find it anywhere except through Amazon. This product is effective against being burnt and also makes your skin look great with micro gold sparkles in it.</li>
            <li> MAKES YOU LOOK GREAT WITH THE SHIMMER AND KEEPS YOUR SKIN SO SOFT.</li>
            <li> When boating this summer a freind asked why I was sparkley. I showed her my new sun screen and she loved it! It gives the protection I need and also a little shimmer. I looked in 4 different retailers for this particular kind and could only find it here. I gave it to my friend as a gift and she loved it. On \\&quot;boat weekend\\&quot; all the girls were asking to use it.</li>
            <li> This is great to enhance the effect of self tanner and provide sun protection too! Soft smell, no transfer, blurs skin imperfections. Very reasonable price! Thanks subscribe and save!!!</li>
            <li> My favorite sun screen!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my trip to Aruba to give a little shimmer to my tan...loved it!  And it protects your skin as it should, even in the hot Aruba sun!</li>
            <li> I really like the type of shimmer that this sunscreen has.  It leaves a gold sheen on my skin that I love and even use it when I&#x27;m going out at night!  The sunscreen feels great and my whole family used it at the beach.</li>
            <li> The SPF level is just enough where I can get some color without getting burnt.  The shimmer looks fabulous!!!</li>
            <li> As I did a comment before , i purchased 2 of this and 3 if SPF 8 ..... Live the shimmer effect on the skin , love the mica in this product</li>
            <li> Nice small.  Goes on nice and protects.  I like shiny things so don&#x27;t mind the shimmer.  My husband told me that I looked like Edward Cullen from THE TWILIGHT series when I stepped into the sunlight.</li>
            <li> Great shimmer in this lotion, and good SPF protection as well!</li>
            <li> I develop hives from the newer sunscreens. This particular brand and type is perfectly acceptable for me. It seems to hold up well after swimming too. The only draw back is it is glittery so you do have a copper glow to you and, if you don&#x27;t rub it in, it will get on your clothing. It seems to wash out pretty easily.</li>
