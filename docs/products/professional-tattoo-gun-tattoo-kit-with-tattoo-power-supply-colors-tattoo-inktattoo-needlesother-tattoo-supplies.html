            <li>kit!&lt;br /&gt;I would also recommend buying some higher quality ink with this kit (for example the iron sakura 20 color pack) as the ink included isn&#x27;t great, its not terrible, it just isnt the best, it might work for you but you will spend longer trying to get the color into your tattoo.</li>

            <li>that happens with most grips after a while.</li>
            <li>they aren&#x27;t supposed to be used more than once w.o autoclaving them.</li>

            <li>ok soo i accedently used the ink on m fiance and from what ive read its for practice use</li>
            <li>i had to order more ink.</li>
            <li>... check out pirate face tattoos they have top quality equipment and</li>
            <li>remember stay safe and keep it reapin</li>
            <li>I choose this rating because price is right and quality is good..</li>
            <li>Everything else works great, but I&#x27;m dissatisfied that I have to order a new box after 3 days of purchase!</li>
            <li>Pretty happy with the free 2day Amazon Prime shipping.</li>
            <li>, this is a great price for a whole kit, I love this product and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND it!!!</li>
            <li>Ink was great but the needle&#x27;s weren&#x27;t marked on size and DVD was crappy.</li>
            <li>Great price and was shipped super fast.</li>
            <li>Also it has the right speeds and the tattoo he gave me for our daughter looks absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>Great to know you can contact the supplier and get such a fast response, loving they are resolving this issue for us since we were looking foward to these!</li>
            <li>Was impressed at the variety of inks and other products that came with it.</li>
            <li>Breaks too easy.</li>
            <li>He really enjoy doing art with this set thank u.</li>
            <li>The machines run smoothly and are comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>Pretty happy with my product so far.</li>
            <li>only neg.the guns are a lil to colorful,would have liked a more solid set,but over all great deal.</li>
            <li>then that it was cool</li>
            <li>thanks for the great and low cost kit!</li>
            <li>The kit came quickly and everything was in there.</li>
            <li>Complete with every thing u need to get started power supply broke and had to order another one but other than that its awesome.</li>
            <li>Guns shake too much, needles break too easy.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>so this was everything she needed and for the money it was well worth it.</li>
            <li>as far as inks u would b better off kuro sumi tattoo ink ... or</li>
            <li>well worth it in the end ...</li>
            <li>also the collet screws on the gun break very easily and the black ink was very crappy but the colors seem to stay better, must be very gentle with this set as everything breaks easily</li>
            <li>The foot pedal is made of very flimsy plastic and the ink fades quickly as well as the power box over heats every 5 - 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>thanks alot!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>The only thing that could make this deal any better was to put a case with it.</li>
            <li>so i couldnt set them up as a whole machine in itself.</li>
            <li>Additionally,  the power cord doesn&#x27;t seem to fit the power supply properly (snug)  </li>
            <li>no one has really got the something.</li>
            <li>then it had said like a whole month.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>really fast nad doesn stick in the skin at all.</li>
            <li>Thanks people now I&#x27;ve tat all over my arms</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>the gramits where way off in size i wont even try to force a needle head over it due to i know better.</li>
            <li>Ink is not good for skin, did not have all tips as advertised, guns are good tho.</li>
            <li>the  ink is very cheap n not cool</li>
            <li>decent guns</li>
            <li>most the packaging on my grips and barrel tubes where broke open multiple inks where pre-opened.</li>
            <li>Had to dismantle two of the guns and use both to make one decent one.</li>
            <li>this would work for you but don&#x27;t expect a professional set!!</li>
            <li>Got this for my husband a few months ago and haven&#x27;t been able to use it.</li>
            <li>The entire set is rather cheaply made, from the power supply to the guns, the foot peddle was not working properly one of the wires that connect to the contacts was poorly soldered and had to be fixed before being used,, in the photo the ink bottles appear larger the they actually are, there seem to be some duplicates of some colors, I have used it twice since my purchase, and the work looks good, but no matter what set you use the work will only be as good as the person tattooing,&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>the only good thing about this kit is that ther are extra parts for my other guns ad equipment if they need</li>
            <li>Gun is a little on the heavy side, but runs great.</li>
            <li>so i had to order some new ink</li>
            <li>so far ....got kit mainly for framesso</li>
            <li>first off, none of the needles were marked with the sizes, second, three guns which means each gun is supposed to do outling, shading, etc, so which is which?</li>
            <li>At first our ink was open and the guns where not what we ordered but the got back to us within hours of messaging them and were very helpful.</li>
            <li>BUT it comes with all this stuff, but no green soap.</li>
            <li>the package came early and it came from china</li>
            <li>some are really light and the green ink is sticky and didnt heal well</li>
            <li>I mean do not ever use this cheap skate all he wants to do</li>
            <li>The third fun was usable after some minor adjustments.&lt;br /&gt;Peddle</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only negative points are the practice skin is nothing more than a rubber mouse mat that has no value as fake skin and the DVD is just images of flash tattoos (which still comes in handy) but don&#x27;t get me wrong, this is a tiny downside to a great</li>
            <li>I want my money back or new ink and needles that are not recalled.</li>
            <li>that I had to actualy repair with a soldering gun and set of new screws, no grips for the guns, and I got two of the same gun, not three as promised, or I was lead to beleive.</li>
            <li>ink has been re-called by the FDA i want my money back or some new ink that the FDA is not re-calling.</li>
            <li>they dry to fast ...</li>
            <li>The whole kit came with everything I needed, also the machines parts are not cheap looking and they are durable, not heavy for you wrist at all.</li>
            <li>Be aware if you get really ill, really really quickly, Want my money back of course.</li>

            <li> /&gt;The only negative points are the practice skin is nothing more than a rubber mouse mat that has no value as fake skin and the DVD is just images of flash tattoos (which still comes in handy) but don&#x27;t get me wrong, this is a tiny downside to a great</li>

            <li> it is watered down.</li>
            <li> The only issue was that one of the ink bottles had a small cut in it and some of the ink leaked out!</li>
            <li> yes they are a little pricey but</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t begun to try it out yet because of the additional items missing from this kit.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Complete with every thing u need to get started power supply broke and had to order another one but other than that its awesome.</li>
            <li> I am only giving this a 3 because 2 out of 3 tattoo machines had manufacture error so i couldnt set them up as a whole machine in itself. And the ink is good... Doesnt like to stick when used though. And the difference in ink consistancy isnt the best. The small bottles are thick, while the big bottle of black is really thin and watery. Over all its ok</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loves it. The selection of ink is awesome!!!! you can order guns separately if you are unsure of the three it comes with. He hasn&#x27;t complained and said they work well.</li>
            <li> came faster than expected,less than 3 days,and i paid reg posting.everything nicely wrapped ,brand new..very happy,amazed at the amount of stuff i got.a win win.the only neg.the guns are a lil to colorful,would have liked a more solid set,but over all great deal.</li>
            <li> decent guns im a first timer and im happy with it . thanks alot!</li>
            <li> Gun is a little on the heavy side, but runs great. The ink is horrible!!! I suggest getting different ink.</li>
            <li> I would like my money back</li>
            <li> this was a gift to my son he said it is a great asset to his job</li>
            <li> all equipment is excellent but i got some  crapy ink in the package it was out of date  so i had to order some new ink</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive 4 items that were supposed to be included not to mention no literature about the product whatsoever,  such as care and maintenence,  how to use properly,  list of features and accessories,  etc... . I haven&#x27;t begun to try it out yet because of the additional items missing from this kit.  Additionally,  the power cord doesn&#x27;t seem to fit the power supply properly (snug)  as if it&#x27;s the wrong cord... It does power on but I&#x27;m skeptical about whether it&#x27;s the right one at all.</li>
            <li> Despite the lack of labeling this was a great buy! Everything came in it. Great price and was shipped super fast. BUT it comes with all this stuff, but no green soap. I would have totally given 5 stars if it came with green soap and it would have been labeled better.</li>
            <li> Must have been good it was stolen two weeks after I got it!</li>
            <li> inks crap foot pedal crap..machines i rebuilt with new coils..power supply ok so far ....got kit mainly for framesso i could rebuild</li>
            <li> as i read the reviews i see no one has really got the something. mine came with no flash it was a dvd of how to tattoo. most the packaging on my grips and barrel tubes where broke open multiple inks where pre-opened. the ink i received is not in tended for human use. it really looked like someone just grabed at random and throw it in the box. the guns and power supply are great though. the gramits where way off in size i wont even try to force a needle head over it due to i know better.</li>
            <li> He really enjoy doing art with this set thank u.</li>
            <li> It works amazing I&#x27;m happy with what I got no case with it but didn&#x27;t say there was supposed to be one :)</li>
            <li> Order different ink. The starter ink isn&#x27;t very good</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas present for my husband. The foot pedal is made of very flimsy plastic and the ink fades quickly as well as the power box over heats every 5 - 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> first off, none of the needles were marked with the sizes, second, three guns which means each gun is supposed to do outling, shading, etc, so which is which? third, the dvd was crappy as hell, no proper instructions on what to set the voltage for each gun, so overall i had to figure everything out myself</li>
            <li> This product comes with all of the basic things you would need to start tattooing. The guns work great, the DVD tells you how top set up the machines. The DVD quality kind of sucked because of the angle. It would have been better and gotten 5 stars from me if the DVD showed close UPS.</li>
            <li> The voltage machine doesn&#x27;t work at all... It turned on once and never came back on... freaking worthless!!! Ink was great but the needle&#x27;s weren&#x27;t marked on size and DVD was crappy. Don&#x27;t buy this kit</li>
            <li> this order was missing several items vs the picture and was poorly packaged.two of the guns do not work but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> i have chosen 5 stars because they desevere it. i had gotten my product with poor handling but the delivry was way faster then it had said like a whole month. The seller got back to me and we worked it out i saw a couple reviews saying the kit didnt match what the pic had shown yes the comes with everything you see and you cant beat that price. I think this is a great deal no where you go can you beat that price it&#x27;s worth it have a nice day everyone be safe.</li>
            <li> At first our ink was open and the guns where not what we ordered but the got back to us within hours of messaging them and were very helpful. Great to know you can contact the supplier and get such a fast response, loving they are resolving this issue for us since we were looking foward to these!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get it yet to tell u what I think about it but I will let u know thanks</li>
            <li> But the problem is? the shipment was Two weeks late from the due date....I choose this rating because price is right and quality is good..</li>
            <li> The only issue was that one of the ink bottles had a small cut in it and some of the ink leaked out! It was easy clean up and all the machines work, ink is good quality, and the tattoos are turning out beautiful!</li>
            <li> I got my kit and my foot pedal or power supply machine does not work can someone please contact me so I cn exchange items</li>
            <li> Any claim of high quality on any part of this set is false. Also, expect to receive 20 inks not 54. Can&#x27;t beat the price, however price does reflect quality.  One star for false advertising.</li>
            <li> The kit came in on time and was great for a starter kit. I would advise buying ink though the ink with this kit sucks it is watered down. But over all its a great kit</li>
            <li> receive all the items. but the actual machine stop working after a few weeks. woudl recommend it. too bad the time is already passed</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband a few months ago and haven&#x27;t been able to use it. But now we find out that there&#x27;s a recall on the ink and needles. I want my money back or new ink and needles that are not recalled.</li>
            <li> Pretty happy with the free 2day Amazon Prime shipping. Pretty happy with my product so far. Thank you.</li>
            <li> It could have been a lot better.</li>
            <li> everything came that was listed however after about 2 months of use the pedal wires came loose so I have to replace the peddle and the grips strip very easily. also the collet screws on the gun break very easily and the black ink was very crappy but the colors seem to stay better, must be very gentle with this set as everything breaks easily</li>
            <li> such a waste of money had all sorts of pieces missing pieces that didn&#x27;t work such a crap purchase don&#x27;t waste your money if you do you&#x27;ll put crap work out  there and get a bad reputation.</li>
            <li> It is a great starter kit, just the only down fall was thier was no instructions on how to use it. The shipping of the kit was faster than the dates given to me.</li>
            <li> Every thing that was supposed to be in it was. excellent starter kit. don&#x27;t know why people complain about grips stripping. that happens with most grips after a while. they aren&#x27;t supposed to be used more than once w.o autoclaving them. and anyway  disposable is the way to go. thanks for the great and low cost kit!</li>
            <li> power cord didnt work two of the guns were messed up n the  ink is very cheap n not cool</li>
            <li> My boyfriend does tattoos and this kit was perfect I got it as a valentines day present for him and was delivered on that day. Also it has the right speeds and the tattoo he gave me for our daughter looks absolutely amazing. Plus the work he put on one of our friends was just perfect. If your looking for a good kit this is the one to get. Very happy with the quality.</li>
            <li> I would only rate this product a 3 out of 5 beacuse the ink isnt good. It fades really fast nad doesn stick in the skin at all.</li>
            <li> I love all of the colors I&#x27;ve received and it works nice on skin. The whole kit came with everything I needed, also the machines parts are not cheap looking and they are durable, not heavy for you wrist at all. Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize there was a recall on the ink until I used it. Thankfully by a friend on myself and not anyone else. Bacteria in the ink and needles, got a blood infection. Be aware if you get really ill, really really quickly, Want my money back of course.</li>
            <li> The entire set is rather cheaply made, from the power supply to the guns, the foot peddle was not working properly one of the wires that connect to the contacts was poorly soldered and had to be fixed before being used,, in the photo the ink bottles appear larger the they actually are, there seem to be some duplicates of some colors, I have used it twice since my purchase, and the work looks good, but no matter what set you use the work will only be as good as the person tattooing,&lt;br /&gt;But the price wasn&#x27;t bad and if your looking for a cheap set to get started on tattooing  this would work for you but don&#x27;t expect a professional set!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t all the colors they said but I got alot</li>
            <li> I gave it this rating because I think that I got way more for my money than I ever thought I would. My daughter does tattoos and was in desperate need of a new kit so this was everything she needed and for the money it was well worth it. I would tell anyone to order from this company because you get alot of BANG for your BUCK!!!! Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> All parts and everything was there and packaged great!</li>
            <li> Awesome I like it! Thanks people now I&#x27;ve tat all over my arms it&#x27;s awesome and really exiting have it</li>
            <li> I bought it 3 days ago. Power supply box quit working. Do not buy this product. Crappy quality video guide( distant picture). Everything else works great, but I&#x27;m dissatisfied that I have to order a new box after 3 days of purchase! 2 stars.</li>
            <li> Well the kit that was advertised wasa not the kit that I got, it had half the inks about 15 to 20 inks, a low qaulity supplie machine, that I had to actualy repair with a soldering gun and set of new screws, no grips for the guns, and I got two of the same gun, not three as promised, or I was lead to beleive. For a novice inker thats in a penny pinch budget the only good thing about this kit is that ther are extra parts for my other guns ad equipment if they need repair.&lt;br /&gt;Do not andf I mean do not ever use this cheap skate all he wants to do is screws over the inkers.</li>
            <li> I have been using this kit for a few months now and have had no problems at all, everything you need to get started is here! The machines run smoothly and are comfortable to hold. All the supplies are plentiful and good quality!&lt;br /&gt;The only negative points are the practice skin is nothing more than a rubber mouse mat that has no value as fake skin and the DVD is just images of flash tattoos (which still comes in handy) but don&#x27;t get me wrong, this is a tiny downside to a great kit!&lt;br /&gt;I would also recommend buying some higher quality ink with this kit (for example the iron sakura 20 color pack) as the ink included isn&#x27;t great, its not terrible, it just isnt the best, it might work for you but you will spend longer trying to get the color into your tattoo. All in all even with the negatives I mentioned, this is a great price for a whole kit, I love this product and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND it!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice set.  thank you</li>
            <li> Got this for my son and he has worked it and now uses it in his business and said thasnks for all</li>
            <li> ink has been re-called by the FDA i want my money back or some new ink that the FDA is not re-calling.</li>
            <li> The kit came quickly and everything was in there. Was impressed at the variety of inks and other products that came with it.</li>
            <li> Works good now but came with no set up instructions ! Had to go to a tattoo shop and the artest gave me instructions from a kit that a woman left at his shop !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very happy with this. Breaks too easy. Guns shake too much, needles break too easy. Not what I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> power supply didn&#x27;t work and the replacement power supply didn&#x27;t work either. so yeah other then that it was cool</li>
            <li> ok soo i accedently used the ink on m fiance and from what ive read its for practice use only so im worried i dont know how to email so im hoping i can get a response somehow. other then my stupidity i love the machine it came with everything i needed and runs great. thanks an please respond i hope the ink wont hurt him</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Great shipping time frame.</li>
            <li> Ink is not good for skin, did not have all tips as advertised, guns are good tho.</li>
            <li> for a starter kit its wonderful! the package came early and it came from china i was very pleased!!! the ink in it was all there some of the colors looked duplicate or didnt match the name. some are really light and the green ink is sticky and didnt heal well i had to order more ink. but this is good for beginners</li>
            <li> Had to dismantle two of the guns and use both to make one decent one. The third fun was usable after some minor adjustments.&lt;br /&gt;Peddle sucks, replaced it immediately. Ink quality leaves slot to be desired.</li>
            <li> For what you pay and what you get is a great deal. The only thing that could make this deal any better was to put a case with it. Other then that the cd that came with it is something they could keep dose not work and the web site on the disc is no longer open. The guns are grate and the inks are great shades so if your looking to get started tattooing this is a great starter kit.</li>
            <li> this kit is garbage yes it comes with everything u need to get started but the inks are trash ... they dry to fast ... skin does not take to them i have been tattooing for 4 years now started my own shop and trust me this kit is garbage from the equipment to the ink ... check out pirate face tattoos they have top quality equipment and as far as inks u would b better off kuro sumi tattoo ink ... or even starbrite tattoo inks ... yes they are a little pricey but well worth it in the end ... remember stay safe and keep it reapin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;brooklyn and raven at : reapers touch tattoos ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;facebook us at Brooklyn Raven</li>
