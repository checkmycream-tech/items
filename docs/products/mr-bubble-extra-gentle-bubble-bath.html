            <li>Great!</li>
            <li>Makes a great bubble bath!</li>
            <li>Best bang for the buck</li>
            <li>A two-pack with each bottle being 36 oz. is great.  </li>
            <li>Caveat - your mileage may vary, skin sensitivity/allergies vary greatly from person-to-person.  </li>
            <li>Works great, just like I remember.</li>
            <li>These are great..</li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>Would like to see more bubbles but was a good value.</li>
            <li>My kids love this stuff and I love that no one gets a sore bottom!</li>
            <li>and he has sensitive skin EXCELLENT</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>She is ok with this one.    </li>
            <li>What more could you want?</li>
            <li>good bubbles no weird smell or skin irritation</li>
            <li>Came quick and my son loves the bubbles in the bath!</li>
            <li>and this is nice and gentle on her skin.</li>
            <li>A cap full is all you need to enjoy loads of bubbles.</li>
            <li>A nice warm bath with toys and fun, with a parent, is enough, truly.</li>
            <li>Pretty cheap for a 2 pack!</li>
            <li>Lots of suds for soaking clean without a slippery feel.</li>
            <li>Fun to use at bath time for the grandkids.</li>
            <li>One of my sons has eczema and I always purchase things for sensitive skin and this seemed to be good so far.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this, it probably works quite well for most people with sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Gentle on toddlers skin, fun bubbles.</li>
            <li>After the first time we tried to explain it away</li>
            <li>Still has that bubble gum scent, and I like that it is gentle on child&#x27;s skin!</li>
            <li>This sure brings back the memories.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even know they made it any more until my teenage daughter asked for it for Christmas!  </li>
            <li>These bubbles are great, last a long time in the tub!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very bubbly.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Gentle with no smell.</li>
            <li>#34;extra gentle&amp;#34; though I used it a couple days a week and ended up with a really GNARLY uti from this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy the original sent next time, which is also tearless.</li>
            <li>Bubbles barely form; we had better results from standard shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Mr. Bubble Extra Gentle is a super dud.  </li>
            <li>Kids love the bubbles and have purchased few times at a reasonable price point but now has doubled in price.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like classic Bubble Bath, which I guess is a given because it is hypo-allergenic kind, but it has a smell, just not a pleasant one.</li>
            <li>My grand daughter has had hive-like skin reactions (as in red, puffed up and itchy skin patches) from other soaps and bubble bath products.  </li>
            <li>Reminds me of being young, myself!</li>
            <li>If the child is reaction free, try half the recommended amount and build up.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t thinking, didn&#x27;t realize the appeal of (bubblegum) bubble bath to me is the fragrance, and even the color, which this product, of course, lacks completely.</li>
            <li>The bubble bath was for my 11 year old daughter who has sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>they do not have sensitive skin or any skin conditions.  </li>
            <li>I had to get this because the regular wasn&#x27;t available for some reason and its kind of disappointing to me.</li>
            <li>Bubbles - my 3 year old loves them.  </li>
            <li>Was not sure to purchase given other reviews - glad i did.  </li>
            <li>Give a little test first - add one drop of Mister Bubbles to a quart of water and shake it up.  </li>

            <li> If your child is an extreme sensitive, you may have to give up on the idea of bubble baths.  </li>
            <li> A tiny bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> These bottles do not cause allergic reactions in my kids, produces lots of bubbles, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> So with that said I&#x27;d be careful.</li>
            <li> This product does not work as well as the pink Mr. Bubble</li>

            <li> Dont waste your money on other products.  </li>
            <li> I almost pour half of bottle to the tub.but still no bubble ,do not buy it.</li>
            <li> Wife raved about it - not her usual pattern.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to find inexpensive kids&#x27; bubble bath that does not contain artificial fragrance or dyes.</li>
            <li> It says &amp;#34;no tears,&amp;#34; but it still hurts eyes. :(</li>
            <li> Very disappointing and would have given ZERO stars if I could.</li>
            <li> My twin boys got horrible rashes from this product.  </li>

            <li> Great! A tiny bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Delivered as advertised.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very bubbly.  A cap full is all you need to enjoy loads of bubbles.</li>

            <li> The bubble bath was for my 11 year old daughter who has sensitive skin.  No allergic reaction.  A two-pack with each bottle being 36 oz. is great.  I wish there was a scent to the bubble bath but that&#x27;s ok. I would order again because we have the bubbles and no rash of any sort.</li>
            <li> Fun to use at bath time for the grandkids. Lots of suds for soaking clean without a slippery feel.</li>
            <li> Does the trick though it is not as bubbly as other products we&#x27;ve tried (e.g. Johnson&#x27;s).</li>
            <li> Came quick and my son loves the bubbles in the bath!</li>
            <li> My grandson is having a ball.  We had Mr. Bubbles growing up and he has sensitive skin EXCELLENT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy the original sent next time, which is also tearless. I use this as a suds booster for my other scented bath products.</li>
            <li> Gentle on toddlers skin, fun bubbles. My grand daughter has had hive-like skin reactions (as in red, puffed up and itchy skin patches) from other soaps and bubble bath products.  She is ok with this one.    Caveat - your mileage may vary, skin sensitivity/allergies vary greatly from person-to-person.  Give a little test first - add one drop of Mister Bubbles to a quart of water and shake it up.  Place a drop of the water soap solution inside the elbow crook, wait 20 minutes.  If there is a reaction, don&#x27;t use.  If the child is reaction free, try half the recommended amount and build up.  If your child is an extreme sensitive, you may have to give up on the idea of bubble baths.  A nice warm bath with toys and fun, with a parent, is enough, truly.</li>
            <li> Pretty cheap for a 2 pack! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> These bubbles are great, last a long time in the tub!</li>
            <li> Gentle with no smell. Personal scents can be added for a customized bubble bath</li>
            <li> My twin boys got horrible rashes from this product.  they do not have sensitive skin or any skin conditions.  After the first time we tried to explain it away but when it happened again, it was definitely this  product.  Very disappointing and would have given ZERO stars if I could.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like classic Bubble Bath, which I guess is a given because it is hypo-allergenic kind, but it has a smell, just not a pleasant one. I had to get this because the regular wasn&#x27;t available for some reason and its kind of disappointing to me. The smell is 90% of why I buy this.</li>
            <li> It says &amp;#34;no tears,&amp;#34; but it still hurts eyes. :(</li>
            <li> I love these! Reminds me of being young, myself! Still has that bubble gum scent, and I like that it is gentle on child&#x27;s skin! Great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to find inexpensive kids&#x27; bubble bath that does not contain artificial fragrance or dyes. These bottles do not cause allergic reactions in my kids, produces lots of bubbles, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This sure brings back the memories.  I didn&#x27;t even know they made it any more until my teenage daughter asked for it for Christmas!  I was in 7th grade the last time I saw this.  I would take a Mr. Bubble bubble bath and then ride my dinosaur to school in 6 inches of snow.</li>
            <li> Makes a great bubble bath!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this, it probably works quite well for most people with sensitive skin but it still makes me break out and itch. I can&#x27;t seem to find anything to use that won&#x27;t cause the same effects.</li>
            <li> Works great, just like I remember.</li>
            <li> These make tons of bubbles.  Was not sure to purchase given other reviews - glad i did.  Wife raved about it - not her usual pattern.  Mr.  Bubbles is still the king.  if you are looking for hypoallergenic or organic product this is not it.  If you dont need some exoctic frangrance and your kids just want BUBBLES!  Dont waste your money on other products.  Best bang for the buck</li>
            <li> Bubbles - my 3 year old loves them.  What more could you want?</li>
            <li> Bought this bubble bath because of it&#x27;s price and it being &amp;#34;extra gentle&amp;#34; though I used it a couple days a week and ended up with a really GNARLY uti from this stuff. Found out it&#x27;s the same bubble bath that used to give me uti&#x27;s as a kid. So with that said I&#x27;d be careful.</li>
            <li> child as skin allergies and this bubble bath never bothered her</li>
            <li> Mr. Bubble Extra Gentle is a super dud.  Bubbles barely form; we had better results from standard shampoo.  This product does not work as well as the pink Mr. Bubble</li>
            <li> Kids love the bubbles and have purchased few times at a reasonable price point but now has doubled in price. One of my sons has eczema and I always purchase things for sensitive skin and this seemed to be good so far. Would purchase again if it weren&#x27;t for price gouging!</li>
            <li> Had to refuse due to leakage. It had poured out all over the ctn. and UPS had to put in a separate&lt;br /&gt;box -- and it soaked thru that as well!</li>
            <li> Good value. My daughter loves her bubbles in her tub and this is nice and gentle on her skin.</li>
            <li> Would like to see more bubbles but was a good value.</li>
            <li> These are great.. good bubbles no weird smell or skin irritation</li>
