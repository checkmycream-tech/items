            <li>Combination of moisturizer, tint and sunblock is great.  </li>
            <li>Great for makeup, skin care, and spf protection.</li>
            <li>Feels great, but does not cover skin blemishes as well as I would want.  </li>
            <li>and I was so happy that Amazon started carrying this product in a twin pack.  </li>

            <li>Works great and you can&#x27;t see it.</li>
            <li>blends well with my skin tone and has great spf.</li>
            <li>A good sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I bought this at Costco and since I&#x27;m on the fairer side, I was reassured since the model they used is fair skinned.</li>
            <li>a good product that adds a touch of color to brighten skin.  </li>
            <li>Hides a good amount of my sun damage as well.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is really good.</li>
            <li>Loved the item.</li>
            <li>This one does work on my fair skin, but I also use a bit of concealer under my eyes as well.</li>
            <li>and I loved it.</li>
            <li>Still have to use a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Does a good job of coverage and blends in well.  </li>
            <li>All-in-all though, for the price, it is a good product.</li>
            <li>Much better than make up and good for your skin!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s feels great and aside from the shade, makes my skin feel and look lovely.</li>
            <li>The scent is a  very  refreshing orange.</li>
            <li>You rarely find a BB cream or any foundation with SPF 40, and it would have been perfect.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>

            <li>I love this product!  </li>

            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love this foundation!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product, including there spf in the product.</li>
            <li>Provides both light coverage and great sunscreen.</li>
            <li>and it is amazing.</li>
            <li>and that I have a good backup :)</li>
            <li>I did notice some really nice results before I stop using it because of the chalky appearance.</li>
            <li>It even has a nice smell.</li>
            <li>This is quick, looks great and in one process I am all set for the day.</li>
            <li>I currently use l&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s bb cream in the fair shade which is perfect for me but does not have a built in sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Plus the Costco price was excellent, and the bottle was a good size that would last a while.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and is a good sunscreen too.</li>
            <li>have tried a ton of drugstore BB Creams, and this one has the best coverage by far.</li>
            <li>All I was looking for in a BB cream is good coverage to even out my skin tone,cover up my imperfections, lightweight, sunscreen and most importantly, something that would blend with my skin and nit sit on top of it.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smooth and mixes well with my complexion which is light/medium.</li>
            <li>Nice easy coverage for my medium skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I love this cream.  </li>

            <li>it&#x27;s the same, best quality, and consistency.</li>
            <li>Works like magic.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This cream is great and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money for me!!</li>
            <li>I am a satisfied customer and glad to see that this product is available through amazon.</li>
            <li>It is light and gives great corrective coverage, and the bestt part is the high SPF.  </li>
            <li>Provides light coverage and sunscreen which is all I need for most days.  </li>
            <li>Very nice and natural looking on my skin.</li>
            <li>It makes it easy to travel because one tube of this takes the place of sunscreen, moisturizer, skin treatment all in one.  </li>
            <li>I first bought this product because of all the advertising but now that I tried it I really liked it.</li>
            <li>Works well to even skin tone but goes on lightly and easily.</li>
            <li>Arrived really quickly!</li>
            <li>so luckily I found it here !  </li>
            <li>So light, but covers and blends.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s creamy, feels smooth when applying, use under foundation or by itself.  </li>
            <li>Color was too light...</li>
            <li>Back home, I&#x27;m now using nothing but Hydroxatone with great results, having eliminated toner, moisturizer, sunscreen, and foundation.  </li>
            <li>I could never use cheap drugstore brands.</li>
            <li>and it feels smooth and is thicker like the Garnier cream.  </li>
            <li>Awesome everyday cream.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know it was light when I bought it.</li>
            <li>The sunscreen goes on smoothly over the Hydroxatone and my skin still looks radiant.</li>
            <li>&#x27;Like the product, so I&#x27;ll try the light shade.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t make my skin pores feel clogged</li>
            <li>I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>Light coverage that seems to reduce pores.</li>
            <li>Sunscreen SPF 40, moisturizer, and light makeup.....</li>
            <li>I bought this product for a sailing vacation in the Carribbean - needed to minimize packing, but needed to look good while protecting my skin (I&#x27;m fair, with green eyes) from sun, wind and salt.  </li>
            <li>2 years ago it had a rich color tone and a glow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands of BB creams and none of them were as good as this one !</li>
            <li>Although this product is not fragrance free, the scent is light and fresh.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re fair skinned the Light is YELLOW.  </li>
            <li>My face looks amazing, fresh and exactly the way it looked like when I first applied the BB cream!</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight and goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li>This is my go-to makeup for every day and for special occasions</li>
            <li>This product is great for aging skin as it does not sink in to the fine lines and wrinkles, so it seems to make them less noticeable.</li>
            <li>It lasts all day  and gives my skin a nice, natural glow.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t a true believer until coworkers started noticing the difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance after about two weeks of use.  </li>
            <li>I have Rosatia which has spread to my whole face, this cream soothes my skin and makes it look better with time.</li>
            <li>and I really wanted to love it.</li>
            <li>My face looks just as good or better than after my previous routine...</li>
            <li>Great alone or under powder or with other makeup.</li>
            <li>Great for a person active in sports.</li>
            <li>Product delivered quickly.  </li>
            <li>More normal during winter time and oiler during summer time.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t take much for each application.  </li>
            <li>It blends beautifully, fairly quickly and it sets right away.</li>
            <li>Great for everyday use.</li>
            <li>It blended very well to my coloring and left a nice smooth feel on my skin.  </li>
            <li>This is worth the money,  and  I will keep on using this product.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using this, several people have really looked at my face and commented on how good I look, fresh and tanned.</li>
            <li>very satisfied with order,received the order when expected.shade was very nice.more than I expected.would reccomend to other ladies.very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It makes applying makeup easy since only one product is ended for a smooth complexion.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin, and this color is too dark for me.  </li>
            <li>and I used good quality makeup previously.  </li>
            <li>I was hopeful I would like it as i really need a bb cream with sunscreen as too many products on my sensitive skin tend to block my pores.</li>
            <li>I have light to medium skin and the resultant color on my skin is very natural and even-toned.  </li>
            <li>While not expecting miracles, I am 56 YO after all, I very much like the result.  </li>
            <li>when you first put it on is looks chalky.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin look more even, covers the red in my skin well.</li>
            <li>I bought this at Costco in a 2-pack because this is where I first came across it.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to go!</li>
            <li>Firstly, let me give an overview of my complexion.</li>
            <li>My Tzone is the first to fet oily after a while.</li>
            <li>I first purchased this at Costco.  </li>
            <li>I love the coverage and the lasting wear of this product.</li>
            <li>I bought my first  2 packages at costco.</li>
            <li>hope it is not fake.</li>
            <li>What I love about this product is its ability to allow me to work outside in the sun, or in a tropical place &amp; not worry about my face being burned.</li>
            <li>When I first started to use BB creme approx.</li>
            <li>First tried this when they carried it at Costco.  </li>
            <li>I first bought this at Sam&#x27;s Club but no longer had it,</li>
            <li>Lightweight and good for everyday use.</li>
            <li>It goes on my skin smoothly, I do use another moisturizer, but no other tint or foundation.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t believe at first that there were no other choices for color, but quickly realized that it was all-encompassing and it stays on all day....</li>
            <li>Liked it so much that I hunted it down after I could not find it at Costco again.  </li>
            <li>Have to use a cover up for certain spots.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s hard to find a BB cream that has good SPF.</li>
            <li>Have used the universal shade and the light shade.  </li>
            <li>I just wish they made this in jumbo size so I could apply to my whole body.</li>
            <li>The Hydroxatone has replace all the face makeup products I was using and does it very well.  </li>
            <li>This has made my morning routine so much quicker and easier.  </li>
            <li>I really like the texture and feel of the product</li>
            <li>but it leaves a very chalky appearance on olive and darker complexions.  </li>
            <li>Immediate and fast attention.thanks.</li>
            <li>I really like the SPF 40.  </li>
            <li>I really needed, so</li>
            <li>It really evens out my skin</li>
            <li>It really conceals my skin&#x27;s blemishes, and makes it glow and feel much smoother.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it because it gives skin a very even tone.</li>
            <li>It also blends really well into my skin.</li>
            <li>This really works for me....</li>
            <li>I started using BB cream in my late 40s because I have fairly good skin and never use makeup.  </li>
            <li>I buy these in quantity as they are consistently the same, and price is better in packages.rven though I thought colors were different, on skin</li>
            <li>This cream is hard to find in the &amp;#34;universal&amp;#34; shade and to get two bottles for this low price was just great.</li>
            <li>the maybelline stay matte bb cream and some high end ones, the smashbox bb cream,</li>
            <li>I do like the fragrance, the high spf</li>
            <li>The moment I put the BB cream on top, the universal shade seemed toooo dark, but after I started to blend, it seemed to work with my skin tone and give it just the right amount of warmth.</li>
            <li>I noticed a change for the better within a few days.  </li>
            <li>My face normally cant tolerate oily products.</li>
            <li>Only drawback is there is only one color available</li>
            <li>my eyes are very sensitive to make up</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t comment too much on any corrective action yet because of the short time I&#x27;ve had it.</li>
            <li>looks different compared with the original picture, the lid of the bottle is blue, not silver.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am 72 and have had terrible skin most of my life, so a compliment really makes me feel great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a year worth the money and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>This face makeup is so clear and spreads so very well, that I have gained confidence that I have at last found a makeup that I can use without embarrassing myself.</li>
            <li>Far from &amp;#34;universal&amp;#34; though.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin at this works well.</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;ve only had this product for about a week now, I really like it.</li>
            <li>It seems to be working, I put it on &amp; bronzer over that it looks natural.  </li>
            <li>Complete coverage.</li>
            <li>The product I received from you was not the same color, much lighter.</li>
            <li>The texture is on the thicker side, but I could even blended out IF ONLY the color was really &amp;#34;Universal.&amp;#34; But it looked orangey on my NC-15/20 skin</li>
            <li>My husband uses this on his sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have light colored and sensitive skin and heavy chalky foundation is not what I look for in a make up.</li>
            <li>I am 24 hrs old, light skin with first signs of fine lines under my eyes and mouth, heredetary dark circles and uneven skintone due to light blenish scarring in the past.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin , so i do need to use a moisturizer first before applying the BB cream.</li>
            <li>Definitely improves skin quality over time.&lt;br /&gt;However, it is LIGHT coverage and does not cover dark age spots or fade them (so far).</li>
            <li>It has a slight &amp;#34;sunscreen&amp;#34; smell to it when applying, but that quickly dissipates as soon as you blend the cream.  </li>
            <li>I primarily wear this product alone with the exception of one small area where I use a bit of concealer.</li>
            <li>The universal shade is darker than the medium, which I normally get.  </li>
            <li>This product goes on a little thick and creamy, but provides good coverage without the need to use moisturizer or foundation.  </li>
            <li>I did set it with a powder which I pretty much always do since I dont want my oily Tzone to come through a few hours later.</li>
            <li>It is definitely a \\&quot;Medium\\&quot; and a dark medium at that --- much too dark for my light skin.  </li>
            <li>This product not only concealed them, it removed my blemishes completely.  </li>
            <li>Also product lasts a long time with normal use.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d caution everyone that&#x27;s not a dark medium to not try to save a buck and just buy the proper shade.</li>
            <li>Although the directions say to apply it every two hours, I have never needed to do so but have used Aveeno (protect and hydrate broad spectrum) sunscreen over it when outside for an extended amount of time.</li>
            <li>I picked this up at Costco to try out and was very skeptical about the results, but decided to give it a fair try.</li>
            <li>I am 63 years old and have age-associated dry skin and some wrinkles (not a lot because I was never a sun worshipper).  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately the \\&quot;universal\\&quot; shade is too dark for my fair skin.  </li>

            <li> Combination of moisturizer, tint and sunblock is great.  </li>
            <li> Great for makeup, skin care, and spf protection.</li>
            <li> Feels great, but does not cover skin blemishes as well as I would want.  </li>

            <li> Works great and you can&#x27;t see it.</li>
            <li> blends well with my skin tone and has great spf.</li>
            <li> A good sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Costco and since I&#x27;m on the fairer side, I was reassured since the model they used is fair skinned.</li>
            <li> a good product that adds a touch of color to brighten skin.  </li>
            <li> Hides a good amount of my sun damage as well.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is really good.</li>
            <li> Loved the item.</li>
            <li> This one does work on my fair skin, but I also use a bit of concealer under my eyes as well.</li>
            <li> and I loved it.</li>
            <li> Still have to use a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Does a good job of coverage and blends in well.  </li>
            <li> All-in-all though, for the price, it is a good product.</li>
            <li> Much better than make up and good for your skin!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s feels great and aside from the shade, makes my skin feel and look lovely.</li>
            <li> The scent is a  very  refreshing orange.</li>
            <li> You rarely find a BB cream or any foundation with SPF 40, and it would have been perfect.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>

            <li> I love this product!  </li>

            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product, including there spf in the product.</li>
            <li> Provides both light coverage and great sunscreen.</li>
            <li> and it is amazing.</li>
            <li> and that I have a good backup :)</li>
            <li> I did notice some really nice results before I stop using it because of the chalky appearance.</li>
            <li> It even has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> This is quick, looks great and in one process I am all set for the day.</li>
            <li> I currently use l&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s bb cream in the fair shade which is perfect for me but does not have a built in sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Plus the Costco price was excellent, and the bottle was a good size that would last a while.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and is a good sunscreen too.</li>
            <li> have tried a ton of drugstore BB Creams, and this one has the best coverage by far.</li>
            <li> All I was looking for in a BB cream is good coverage to even out my skin tone,cover up my imperfections, lightweight, sunscreen and most importantly, something that would blend with my skin and nit sit on top of it.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smooth and mixes well with my complexion which is light/medium.</li>
            <li> Nice easy coverage for my medium skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I love this cream.  </li>

            <li> it&#x27;s the same, best quality, and consistency.</li>
            <li> Works like magic.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> This cream is great and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the money for me!!</li>
            <li> I am a satisfied customer and glad to see that this product is available through amazon.</li>
            <li> It is light and gives great corrective coverage, and the bestt part is the high SPF.  </li>
            <li> Provides light coverage and sunscreen which is all I need for most days.  </li>
            <li> Very nice and natural looking on my skin.</li>
            <li> It makes it easy to travel because one tube of this takes the place of sunscreen, moisturizer, skin treatment all in one.  </li>
            <li> I first bought this product because of all the advertising but now that I tried it I really liked it.</li>
            <li> Works well to even skin tone but goes on lightly and easily.</li>
            <li> Arrived really quickly!</li>
            <li> so luckily I found it here !  </li>
            <li> So light, but covers and blends.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s creamy, feels smooth when applying, use under foundation or by itself.  </li>
            <li> Color was too light...</li>
            <li> Back home, I&#x27;m now using nothing but Hydroxatone with great results, having eliminated toner, moisturizer, sunscreen, and foundation.  </li>
            <li> I could never use cheap drugstore brands.</li>
            <li> and it feels smooth and is thicker like the Garnier cream.  </li>
            <li> Awesome everyday cream.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know it was light when I bought it.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen goes on smoothly over the Hydroxatone and my skin still looks radiant.</li>
            <li> &#x27;Like the product, so I&#x27;ll try the light shade.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t make my skin pores feel clogged</li>
            <li> I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> Light coverage that seems to reduce pores.</li>
            <li> Sunscreen SPF 40, moisturizer, and light makeup.....</li>
            <li> I bought this product for a sailing vacation in the Carribbean - needed to minimize packing, but needed to look good while protecting my skin (I&#x27;m fair, with green eyes) from sun, wind and salt.  </li>
            <li> 2 years ago it had a rich color tone and a glow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands of BB creams and none of them were as good as this one !</li>
            <li> Although this product is not fragrance free, the scent is light and fresh.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re fair skinned the Light is YELLOW.  </li>
            <li> My face looks amazing, fresh and exactly the way it looked like when I first applied the BB cream!</li>
            <li> It is very lightweight and goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to makeup for every day and for special occasions</li>
            <li> This product is great for aging skin as it does not sink in to the fine lines and wrinkles, so it seems to make them less noticeable.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day  and gives my skin a nice, natural glow.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a true believer until coworkers started noticing the difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance after about two weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> I have Rosatia which has spread to my whole face, this cream soothes my skin and makes it look better with time.</li>
            <li> and I really wanted to love it.</li>
            <li> My face looks just as good or better than after my previous routine...</li>
            <li> Great alone or under powder or with other makeup.</li>
            <li> Great for a person active in sports.</li>
            <li> Product delivered quickly.  </li>
            <li> More normal during winter time and oiler during summer time.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t take much for each application.  </li>
            <li> It blends beautifully, fairly quickly and it sets right away.</li>
            <li> Great for everyday use.</li>
            <li> It blended very well to my coloring and left a nice smooth feel on my skin.  </li>
            <li> This is worth the money,  and  I will keep on using this product.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using this, several people have really looked at my face and commented on how good I look, fresh and tanned.</li>
            <li> very satisfied with order,received the order when expected.shade was very nice.more than I expected.would reccomend to other ladies.very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It makes applying makeup easy since only one product is ended for a smooth complexion.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin, and this color is too dark for me.  </li>
            <li> and I used good quality makeup previously.  </li>
            <li> I was hopeful I would like it as i really need a bb cream with sunscreen as too many products on my sensitive skin tend to block my pores.</li>
            <li> I have light to medium skin and the resultant color on my skin is very natural and even-toned.  </li>
            <li> While not expecting miracles, I am 56 YO after all, I very much like the result.  </li>
            <li> when you first put it on is looks chalky.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin look more even, covers the red in my skin well.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Costco in a 2-pack because this is where I first came across it.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ready to go!</li>
            <li> Firstly, let me give an overview of my complexion.</li>
            <li> My Tzone is the first to fet oily after a while.</li>
            <li> I first purchased this at Costco.  </li>
            <li> I love the coverage and the lasting wear of this product.</li>
            <li> I bought my first  2 packages at costco.</li>
            <li> hope it is not fake.</li>
            <li> What I love about this product is its ability to allow me to work outside in the sun, or in a tropical place &amp; not worry about my face being burned.</li>
            <li> When I first started to use BB creme approx.</li>
            <li> First tried this when they carried it at Costco.  </li>
            <li> I first bought this at Sam&#x27;s Club but no longer had it,</li>
            <li> Lightweight and good for everyday use.</li>
            <li> It goes on my skin smoothly, I do use another moisturizer, but no other tint or foundation.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe at first that there were no other choices for color, but quickly realized that it was all-encompassing and it stays on all day....</li>
            <li> Liked it so much that I hunted it down after I could not find it at Costco again.  </li>
            <li> Have to use a cover up for certain spots.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to find a BB cream that has good SPF.</li>
            <li> Have used the universal shade and the light shade.  </li>
            <li> I just wish they made this in jumbo size so I could apply to my whole body.</li>
            <li> The Hydroxatone has replace all the face makeup products I was using and does it very well.  </li>
            <li> This has made my morning routine so much quicker and easier.  </li>
            <li> I really like the texture and feel of the product</li>
            <li> but it leaves a very chalky appearance on olive and darker complexions.  </li>
            <li> Immediate and fast attention.thanks.</li>
            <li> I really like the SPF 40.  </li>
            <li> I really needed, so</li>
            <li> It really evens out my skin</li>
            <li> It really conceals my skin&#x27;s blemishes, and makes it glow and feel much smoother.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it because it gives skin a very even tone.</li>
            <li> It also blends really well into my skin.</li>
            <li> This really works for me....</li>
            <li> I started using BB cream in my late 40s because I have fairly good skin and never use makeup.  </li>
            <li> I buy these in quantity as they are consistently the same, and price is better in packages.rven though I thought colors were different, on skin</li>
            <li> This cream is hard to find in the &amp;#34;universal&amp;#34; shade and to get two bottles for this low price was just great.</li>
            <li> the maybelline stay matte bb cream and some high end ones, the smashbox bb cream,</li>
            <li> I do like the fragrance, the high spf</li>
            <li> The moment I put the BB cream on top, the universal shade seemed toooo dark, but after I started to blend, it seemed to work with my skin tone and give it just the right amount of warmth.</li>
            <li> I noticed a change for the better within a few days.  </li>
            <li> My face normally cant tolerate oily products.</li>
            <li> Only drawback is there is only one color available</li>
            <li> my eyes are very sensitive to make up</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t comment too much on any corrective action yet because of the short time I&#x27;ve had it.</li>
            <li> looks different compared with the original picture, the lid of the bottle is blue, not silver.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am 72 and have had terrible skin most of my life, so a compliment really makes me feel great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a year worth the money and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This face makeup is so clear and spreads so very well, that I have gained confidence that I have at last found a makeup that I can use without embarrassing myself.</li>
            <li> Far from &amp;#34;universal&amp;#34; though.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin at this works well.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve only had this product for about a week now, I really like it.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working, I put it on &amp; bronzer over that it looks natural.  </li>
            <li> Complete coverage.</li>
            <li> The product I received from you was not the same color, much lighter.</li>
            <li> The texture is on the thicker side, but I could even blended out IF ONLY the color was really &amp;#34;Universal.&amp;#34; But it looked orangey on my NC-15/20 skin</li>
            <li> My husband uses this on his sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have light colored and sensitive skin and heavy chalky foundation is not what I look for in a make up.</li>
            <li> I am 24 hrs old, light skin with first signs of fine lines under my eyes and mouth, heredetary dark circles and uneven skintone due to light blenish scarring in the past.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin , so i do need to use a moisturizer first before applying the BB cream.</li>
            <li> Definitely improves skin quality over time.&lt;br /&gt;However, it is LIGHT coverage and does not cover dark age spots or fade them (so far).</li>
            <li> It has a slight &amp;#34;sunscreen&amp;#34; smell to it when applying, but that quickly dissipates as soon as you blend the cream.  </li>
            <li> I primarily wear this product alone with the exception of one small area where I use a bit of concealer.</li>
            <li> The universal shade is darker than the medium, which I normally get.  </li>
            <li> This product goes on a little thick and creamy, but provides good coverage without the need to use moisturizer or foundation.  </li>
            <li> I did set it with a powder which I pretty much always do since I dont want my oily Tzone to come through a few hours later.</li>
            <li> It is definitely a \\&quot;Medium\\&quot; and a dark medium at that --- much too dark for my light skin.  </li>
            <li> This product not only concealed them, it removed my blemishes completely.  </li>
            <li> Also product lasts a long time with normal use.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d caution everyone that&#x27;s not a dark medium to not try to save a buck and just buy the proper shade.</li>
            <li> Although the directions say to apply it every two hours, I have never needed to do so but have used Aveeno (protect and hydrate broad spectrum) sunscreen over it when outside for an extended amount of time.</li>
            <li> I picked this up at Costco to try out and was very skeptical about the results, but decided to give it a fair try.</li>
            <li> I am 63 years old and have age-associated dry skin and some wrinkles (not a lot because I was never a sun worshipper).  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the \\&quot;universal\\&quot; shade is too dark for my fair skin.  </li>
            <li> It hides dark stuff and looks natural.</li>
            <li> Accidentally, I fell asleep in my couch that night and moved my way into my bed a few mins later, completely forgetting I had make up on!</li>
            <li> is that it completely outdid itself and its exactly what I was looking for, for the past few months.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Goes a long way.</li>
            <li> About two years ago,  I noticed some minor blemishes here and there that needed to be addressed.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I do not give 5 stars is, its a little bit darker than my actual skin tone.</li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and hated having to put sun screen on after I put on my makeup.</li>
            <li> Although wearable in the summer, I found the universal shade to be a little too dark.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Helps even skin tone, erase small lines and wrinkles &amp; overall improved skin texture!  </li>
            <li> I bought this the other day at costco as my aveeno bb cream had just run out.</li>
            <li> You know it works when other people notice .</li>
            <li> Will never buy any other product.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I have received compliments on my skin since I started using this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little darker and a little less sheer than what I was hoping for it to be.  </li>
            <li> You are able to wear it alone or as a base for your other make-up and blusher.</li>
            <li> However, it was two shades too dark for me.</li>
            <li> and it is slightly dark for my skin in the winter.</li>
            <li> Love the product, hate the shade.  </li>
            <li> But I can use it for the summer with a slight tan.  </li>
            <li> I previously reviewed this product.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the lighter shade I previously purchased.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise</li>
            <li> A little BB cream with a dusting of finishing powder</li>
            <li> I no longer wear foundation, just this product and a little powder on my nose.  </li>
            <li> You can also add a little make up to increase coverage.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time.  </li>
            <li> I use everyday under makeup.</li>
            <li> It feels heavy when I apply it, but doesn&#x27;t look heavy.  </li>
            <li> Since I have a long drive to work in the morning I get up very early, then had to go through the usual routine of showering, then putting on a face cream, a makeup base, cream makeup, powder.  </li>
            <li> I am red-green color blind and have never worn makeup because I cannot see shade differences to blend well enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought all sorts of makeup in the past but then couldn&#x27;t be bothered to use it.  </li>
            <li> I use this everyday!</li>
            <li> I am disappointed I had to spend that much on something I cannot use.</li>
            <li> ...which was a big disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I use the cream every morning and one tube lasts at least six months for me.</li>
            <li> Lately it seems to have lost some of it&#x27;s luster and coverage.</li>
            <li> It was not real attractive!  </li>
            <li> The box came opened, not good presentation.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> after 2 months using hydroxatone as a base under my foundation daily, my skin tone evened out, pore size reduced</li>
            <li> I am 53 and was using an expensive beige- toned foundation.  </li>
            <li> Was not impressed with results, think it&#x27;s all hype.</li>
            <li> I have ditched the expensive foundations and switched to this product.</li>
            <li> and I looked like I had a bad fake tan.</li>
            <li> It drove me crazy.  </li>
            <li> Too bad</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> Cannot even tell you are wearing a base makeup.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Product delivered quickly.  I have been using the Hydroxatone for about a year.  Have used the universal shade and the light shade.  Both work well on my light/med skin tone.  when you first put it on is looks chalky.  That will go away in about 3 min.  Makes my skin look more even, covers the red in my skin well.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.  I&#x27;ve been using it fir years.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  So light, but covers and blends.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Makes skin look great</li>
            <li> She gives this product an excellent rating.  It&#x27;s creamy, feels smooth when applying, use under foundation or by itself.  Helps even skin tone, erase small lines and wrinkles &amp; overall improved skin texture!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Great Product...Great Price...My wife is very happy...</li>
            <li> I have used the product before and this is not the same.  Wish I had known....  Color was too light...</li>
            <li> Love this bb cream.  Have quit using  foundation since discovering this.  Provides light coverage and sunscreen which is all I need for most days.  Skin is glowing after regular use.</li>
            <li> My favorite makeup !!!!</li>
            <li> This is my go-to makeup for every day and for special occasions and it is great!  I didn&#x27;t believe at first that there were no other choices for color, but quickly realized that it was all-encompassing and it stays on all day....I love it.  SBF</li>
            <li> I bought this product for a sailing vacation in the Carribbean - needed to minimize packing, but needed to look good while protecting my skin (I&#x27;m fair, with green eyes) from sun, wind and salt.  It exceeded my expectations.  Back home, I&#x27;m now using nothing but Hydroxatone with great results, having eliminated toner, moisturizer, sunscreen, and foundation.  I get more compliments on my skin than ever.  I&#x27;m 60+.  This is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I discovered Hydroxatone when costco had an instant coupon.  I bought it because it was on sale.  But now I am a regular purchaser. I love the way it feels on my skin.  I primarily wear this product alone with the exception of one small area where I use a bit of concealer. This product saves me both time and money.  I no longer use moisturizer or sunscreen.  Although this product is not fragrance free, the scent is light and fresh.  Hydroxatone works well at evening out my redish skin tone.  I have been receiving lots of complements since I started using this product.  I just wish they made this in jumbo size so I could apply to my whole body.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and hated having to put sun screen on after I put on my makeup. This is quick, looks great and in one process I am all set for the day.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Costco in a 2-pack because this is where I first came across it.  This cream is absolutely wonderful.  I am 63 years old and have age-associated dry skin and some wrinkles (not a lot because I was never a sun worshipper).  Since I have a long drive to work in the morning I get up very early, then had to go through the usual routine of showering, then putting on a face cream, a makeup base, cream makeup, powder.  The Hydroxatone has replace all the face makeup products I was using and does it very well.  This has made my morning routine so much quicker and easier.  My face looks just as good or better than after my previous routine...and I used good quality makeup previously.  I could never use cheap drugstore brands. I have light to medium skin and the resultant color on my skin is very natural and even-toned.  I am so glad I found this!</li>
            <li> Definitely improves skin quality over time.&lt;br /&gt;However, it is LIGHT coverage and does not cover dark age spots or fade them (so far). Nevertheless, skin texture and wrinkles do improve. Also product lasts a long time with normal use.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this BB cream for over a year and love it. It is light and gives great corrective coverage, and the bestt part is the high SPF.  A little BB cream with a dusting of finishing powder and I&#x27;m ready to go!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get this product at Costco anymore, so Amazon was the easiest way to get it.  This is an amazing product, including there spf in the product.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  The universal shade is darker than the medium, which I normally get.  A good sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Firstly, let me give an overview of my complexion. I am 24 hrs old, light skin with first signs of fine lines under my eyes and mouth, heredetary dark circles and uneven skintone due to light blenish scarring in the past. I have normal-oily skin. More normal during winter time and oiler during summer time. My Tzone is the first to fet oily after a while. I do not have acne or pimples, although I do get the ocassional pimples during that time of the month. All I was looking for in a BB cream is good coverage to even out my skin tone,cover up my imperfections, lightweight, sunscreen and most importantly, something that would blend with my skin and nit sit on top of it. I have tried a lot of drugstore BB creams, including the Loreal magic Bb cream, garnier bb cream for combo/oily skin, the maybelline stay matte bb cream and some high end ones, the smashbox bb cream, stila cc cream and so on... Obviously, none of those performed how I wanted them to, so here I am.&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, this bb cream does all of the above!!! I picked this up at Costco to try out and was very skeptical about the results, but decided to give it a fair try. I wore this after washing and moisturizing my face and underneath I wore the Lancome Vissionaire 1 minute blur. The moment I put the BB cream on top, the universal shade seemed toooo dark, but after I started to blend, it seemed to work with my skin tone and give it just the right amount of warmth. It blends beautifully, fairly quickly and it sets right away. It melts with your skin and feels and looks like you are not wearing any makeup whatsoever. It has the perfect coverage for what I was looking and it can be buildable. I did set it with a powder which I pretty much always do since I dont want my oily Tzone to come through a few hours later. Accidentally, I fell asleep in my couch that night and moved my way into my bed a few mins later, completely forgetting I had make up on! I wake up the next morning, go to brush my teeth, and what do you know!  My face looks amazing, fresh and exactly the way it looked like when I first applied the BB cream! What sorcery is this????&lt;br /&gt;All I can say about this is that it completely outdid itself and its exactly what I was looking for, for the past few months.&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy the package comes with 2 bb creams, so I dont have to repurchase anytime soon and that I have a good backup :)</li>
            <li> I really like the texture and feel of the product but it leaves a very chalky appearance on olive and darker complexions.  Even when used under foundation chalkiness does not go away.  I did notice some really nice results before I stop using it because of the chalky appearance.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re fair skinned the Light is YELLOW.  Don&#x27;t bother.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Don&#x27;t waste your time.  I rated this a 1 because I couldn&#x27;t select anything lower.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Costco and since I&#x27;m on the fairer side, I was reassured since the model they used is fair skinned. However, it was two shades too dark for me. It&#x27;s feels great and aside from the shade, makes my skin feel and look lovely. Far from &amp;#34;universal&amp;#34; though.</li>
            <li> Does what it promises. Love it, with or without makeup.</li>
            <li> Immediate and fast attention.thanks.</li>
            <li> I like  this product. Provides both light coverage and great sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little darker and a little less sheer than what I was hoping for it to be.  I have light colored and sensitive skin and heavy chalky foundation is not what I look for in a make up.</li>
            <li> love it. Great substitute for make up!</li>
            <li> I am red-green color blind and have never worn makeup because I cannot see shade differences to blend well enough. This face makeup is so clear and spreads so very well, that I have gained confidence that I have at last found a makeup that I can use without embarrassing myself.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I am 53 and was using an expensive beige- toned foundation.  I have been using this  for 6 weeks and it is amazing. It lasts all day  and gives my skin a nice, natural glow.  I don&#x27;t even  use blush anymore. I have dry skin , so i do need to use a moisturizer first before applying the BB cream. It feels great on my skin  and the color matches  perfectly. ( I use the one for all skin types) . I really like the SPF 40.  This is worth the money,  and  I will keep on using this product.</li>
            <li> I first purchased this at Costco.  I use it every day.  Combination of moisturizer, tint and sunblock is great.  It goes on my skin smoothly, I do use another moisturizer, but no other tint or foundation.</li>
            <li> Very nice and natural looking on my skin. I have sensitive skin at this works well. I will use this in the future.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin, and this color is too dark for me.  It seems more like a medium tone.  I will return to Costco.  Otherwise,if you have medium tone skin,it may work for you.  The scent is a  very  refreshing orange. and it feels smooth and is thicker like the Garnier cream.  I would keep if color worked for me.  Love the 40 SPF!</li>
            <li> a good product that adds a touch of color to brighten skin.  A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Great for makeup, skin care, and spf protection.</li>
            <li> This makeup will last all day and cover all flaws. Cannot even tell you are wearing a base makeup.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and good for everyday use. Gives your skin the moisturizer and sun protection you need all day</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve only had this product for about a week now, I really like it. It goes on very smooth and mixes well with my complexion which is light/medium. It even has a nice smell. I really can&#x27;t comment too much on any corrective action yet because of the short time I&#x27;ve had it.</li>
            <li> I love the coverage and the lasting wear of this product. Only drawback is there is only one color available and it is slightly dark for my skin in the winter.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working, I put it on &amp; bronzer over that it looks natural.  I&#x27;m pleased with the product, I like the SPF.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Great for &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; skin!</li>
            <li> Love it! Complete coverage. No make up look. Not greasy. Doesnt come off on clothes.  Awesome everyday cream. Love this stuff since my friend introduced me.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  It goes on smooth and is a good sunscreen too. I use everyday under makeup. Try you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> But I can use it for the summer with a slight tan.  Also this does not cover as well as the photo on the package.</li>
            <li> Feels great, but does not cover skin blemishes as well as I would want.  Have to use a cover up for certain spots.</li>
            <li> very satisfied with order,received the order when expected.shade was very nice.more than I expected.would reccomend to other ladies.very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love it. This is the 3rd time I have bought  this package. I bought my first  2 packages at costco. The product works as promised. The sun screen works well.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to get used to this BB Cream.  It feels heavy when I apply it, but doesn&#x27;t look heavy.  It is a sunscreen, a primer and a moisturizer.  I no longer wear foundation, just this product and a little powder on my nose.  The color is excellent for my fair to medium skin.</li>
            <li> I love that this is &amp;#34;everything in one&amp;#34;, moisturizer,sunscreen and tint that matches my skin tone. Hides a good amount of my sun damage as well.  I have been using for over a year.</li>
            <li> The box came opened, not good presentation.&lt;br /&gt;The box looks like somebody rejected,opened and sent back.&lt;br /&gt;But I really needed, so I keeping.&lt;br /&gt;It looks different compared with the original picture, the lid of the bottle is blue, not silver.&lt;br /&gt;I hope it is not fake.</li>
            <li> I found a double pack of this cream at Costco over a year ago.  I searched and searched and I was so happy that Amazon started carrying this product in a twin pack.  This cream is great and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I first bought this product because of all the advertising but now that I tried it I really liked it. I have tried better products but I had to pay 3 times of the price. For the money, this is the best you can buy.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer with color. You are able to wear it alone or as a base for your other make-up and blusher. I wear it daily. I love the results I have seen since beginning to wear it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know it was light when I bought it. And I bought two. I have tan skin. Too bad</li>
            <li> This stuff is really good. I like the coverage it gives me without looking like I&#x27;m wearing a plaster of makeup. And I love that it has a 40SPF.</li>
            <li> This is a awesome product.  It&#x27;s not oily and does not have an odor</li>
            <li> I have used this cream and really like it- a great combination of moisturizer, sun block and foundation.</li>
            <li> Loved the item. Have used it before and will order again.</li>
            <li> ...which was a big disappointment.  I bought this the other day at costco as my aveeno bb cream had just run out. I was hoping for better coverage.  I still need concealer for under my eyes and the freckles on my cheeks.  I do like the fragrance, the high spf and it doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out, so I&#x27;m still giving it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I break out when I use this but I think it&#x27;s the sun screen in the product that causes it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this bb cream. You can wear it alone or as a primer.  It really evens out my skin</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel or look like foundation. Yet it gives the appearance of a healthy, even toned skin. Doesn&#x27;t rub off on your clothes. Great for a person active in sports.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product...have tried a ton of drugstore BB Creams, and this one has the best coverage by far. It&#x27;s both streamlined my make-up routine and evened out my skin tone. (The SPF 40 is an added bonus!) All you need is a dime-sized amount for all-over coverage. I like to set it with a translucent matte powder like Dermablend or Rimmel&#x27;s Stay Matte, but if you prefer the dewy look, wear it by itself.</li>
            <li> I noticed a change for the better within a few days.  Blotchy color and irregularities in skin surface are gone.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I wasn&#x27;t a true believer until coworkers started noticing the difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance after about two weeks of use.  I&#x27;ve tried numerous, cheaper BB creams that have not worked as promised on my skin. This product goes on a little thick and creamy, but provides good coverage without the need to use moisturizer or foundation.  It really conceals my skin&#x27;s blemishes, and makes it glow and feel much smoother. It has a slight &amp;#34;sunscreen&amp;#34; smell to it when applying, but that quickly dissipates as soon as you blend the cream.  Although the directions say to apply it every two hours, I have never needed to do so but have used Aveeno (protect and hydrate broad spectrum) sunscreen over it when outside for an extended amount of time. The sunscreen goes on smoothly over the Hydroxatone and my skin still looks radiant. I use the cream every morning and one tube lasts at least six months for me. I would definitely recommend this product.  It is well worth the money for me!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I will continue to buy it! Arrived really quickly!</li>
            <li> Great Sunscreen. I bought this and love it! The only reason I do not give 5 stars is, its a little bit darker than my actual skin tone. I do think this brand actually carries different skin tones. This one does work on my fair skin, but I also use a bit of concealer under my eyes as well. What I love about this product is its ability to allow me to work outside in the sun, or in a tropical place &amp; not worry about my face being burned. Also this stuff is a wonderful concealer if I have a breakout. The moisturizer is very good. I would recommend it because it gives skin a very even tone. It hides dark stuff and looks natural. I am on my second bottle.</li>
            <li> Love the way this product feels on my skin.  It has reduced my brown spots, made my skin look smoother and younger!&lt;br /&gt;I can wear this without additional make up and look good!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is very lightweight and goes on very smoothly. Hydroxatone gives me just enough coverage, without the weight of feeling like you have make-up on. This product is great for aging skin as it does not sink in to the fine lines and wrinkles, so it seems to make them less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Excellent great coverage and makes skin look flawless just love it</li>
            <li> I previously reviewed this product.  I love it. and it arrived on time,</li>
            <li> As expected. Great product.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this item in February from another source and I loved it. The product I received from you was not the same color, much lighter. It did not match my skin color. I tried to return it, but by the time I needed to use it, my return time had passed.I am disappointed I had to spend that much on something I cannot use.</li>
            <li> I have Rosatia which has spread to my whole face, this cream soothes my skin and makes it look better with time. my eyes are very sensitive to make up but this cream does not seem to bother me. I have received many compliments about my completion since I have been using this product. I am 72 and have had terrible skin most of my life, so a compliment really makes me feel great.</li>
            <li> THE best BB cream out there and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Costco in a two pack for 39.99 after a $9.00 off instant coupon last week.  I was hopeful I would like it as i really need a bb cream with sunscreen as too many products on my sensitive skin tend to block my pores. I like the feel and fragrance of the product as well as the texture. Unfortunately the \\&quot;universal\\&quot; shade is too dark for my fair skin.  I currently use l&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s bb cream in the fair shade which is perfect for me but does not have a built in sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I bought this universal shade two-pack at Costco.  Love the product, hate the shade.  It is definitely a \\&quot;Medium\\&quot; and a dark medium at that --- much too dark for my light skin.  &#x27;Like the product, so I&#x27;ll try the light shade.  I&#x27;d caution everyone that&#x27;s not a dark medium to not try to save a buck and just buy the proper shade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a year worth the money and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> wish to have color choice.</li>
            <li> I never heard of &amp;#34;BB&amp;#34; creams before this week.  I was running low on my moisturizer and was perusing Costco&#x27;s selection and came across this product that claimed it did all these things.  What a concept!  I&#x27;ve bought all sorts of makeup in the past but then couldn&#x27;t be bothered to use it.  While not expecting miracles, I am 56 YO after all, I very much like the result.  It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t make my skin pores feel clogged and I think it evens my skin tone.</li>
            <li> in a lotion for beauty of your presenting face plus the health of your skin.  It has all the features a beautification product needs for skin care.  Easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t take much for each application.  I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  It makes it easy to travel because one tube of this takes the place of sunscreen, moisturizer, skin treatment all in one.  The color is perfect for my complexion and is a universal color which works for almost all skin colors.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! My third purchase!</li>
            <li> Much better than make up and good for your skin! Light coverage that seems to reduce pores. You can also add a little make up to increase coverage.</li>
            <li> Best product ever.Feels like you are not even wearing makeup. Does everything it claims to do. Goes a long way. Stays on all day. You know it works when other people notice . Will never buy any other product.</li>
            <li> Works well to even skin tone but goes on lightly and easily. Great alone or under powder or with other makeup.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using this, several people have really looked at my face and commented on how good I look, fresh and tanned.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation! I have been using this for a couple of years now. I have seen it at Costco but they don&#x27;t seem to be carrying it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to find a BB cream that has good SPF. This one had 40 spf. It also blends really well into my skin. For me it&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> Luv, luv, luv!!!  I started using BB cream in my late 40s because I have fairly good skin and never use makeup.  About two years ago,  I noticed some minor blemishes here and there that needed to be addressed.  This product not only concealed them, it removed my blemishes completely.  Now I&#x27;m hooked!  I hope Hydroxatone never discontinues this product.</li>
            <li> The product covers nicely and provides excellent sun protection.  It makes applying makeup easy since only one product is ended for a smooth complexion.</li>
            <li> When I first started to use BB creme approx. 2 years ago it had a rich color tone and a glow. Lately it seems to have lost some of it&#x27;s luster and coverage.</li>
            <li> My face normally cant tolerate oily products. This one I love.</li>
            <li> Although wearable in the summer, I found the universal shade to be a little too dark. I prefer the lighter shade I previously purchased.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it gives the all in one coverage.</li>
            <li> This cream is hard to find in the &amp;#34;universal&amp;#34; shade and to get two bottles for this low price was just great. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Bought this at Costco and I really wanted to love it. You rarely find a BB cream or any foundation with SPF 40, and it would have been perfect.Plus the Costco price was excellent, and the bottle was a good size that would last a while. The texture is on the thicker side, but I could even blended out IF ONLY the color was really &amp;#34;Universal.&amp;#34; But it looked orangey on my NC-15/20 skin and I looked like I had a bad fake tan. Too bad. If you are darker skinned (NC/W- 25 and up?), it may work for you.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s so creamy but yet lightweight. Great for everyday use. I love that it has sun screen in it. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer as well.</li>
            <li> I love this make up . Gives me coverage and protection from the sun. Still have to use a good moisturizer.  I bought this for a second time.  One tube lasted 1 yr.</li>
            <li> First tried this when they carried it at Costco.  Liked it so much that I hunted it down after I could not find it at Costco again.  Nice easy coverage for my medium skin tone.  I use if over my regular moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I get aloy of complements on how my face looks. I use it every day.thanks.i reccomend it</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Does a good job of coverage and blends in well.  I first bought this at Sam&#x27;s Club but no longer had it, so luckily I found it here !  I&#x27;ve tried other brands of BB creams and none of them were as good as this one !</li>
            <li> after 2 months using hydroxatone as a base under my foundation daily, my skin tone evened out, pore size reduced and i received comments about how great my skin looked</li>
            <li> Was not impressed with results, think it&#x27;s all hype.</li>
            <li> It blended very well to my coloring and left a nice smooth feel on my skin.  The only thing I did not like was that my T-zone got oily after a couple hours. It drove me crazy.  I had to keep blotting my forhead, nose area, and chin.  It was not real attractive!  All-in-all though, for the price, it is a good product.</li>
            <li> Great product! Sunscreen SPF 40, moisturizer, and light makeup.....all in one! I use this everyday!</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I have received compliments on my skin since I started using this product. Even though it has an orange color coming out of the tube, it blends beautifully without any make-up lines. I have been told that my skin looks healthy and like I have a bit of a tan. I have ditched the expensive foundations and switched to this product. I am 50+ with an oily skin - I do not need to apply moisturizer before using it. I am a satisfied customer and glad to see that this product is available through amazon.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this on his sensitive skin. Works great and you can&#x27;t see it.</li>
            <li> This really works for me....blends well with my skin tone and has great spf.</li>
            <li> I buy these in quantity as they are consistently the same, and price is better in packages.rven though I thought colors were different, on skin it&#x27;s the same, best quality, and consistency. Will continue.</li>
            <li> I found I was allergic to this product</li>
            <li> Works like magic.  Love it.</li>
