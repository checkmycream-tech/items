            <li>This product is great for fighting acne Us it on a regular basis for the best results ...</li>
            <li>no point did I honestly feel like it improved or healed my acne.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price is good for an acne product that will bring results, just make sure that your skin does will with benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li>This product appears to be controversially effective.</li>
            <li>prefer the Mario Badescu moisturizer over the Proactiv one but with summer coming the Proactiv one will be good since it is more lightweight.&lt;br</li>
            <li>kind of thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>EFFECTIVE.</li>
            <li>It is my own fault,</li>
            <li>Right now I&#x27;m using it once a day with very good results.</li>
            <li>This new formula is awesome.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and I am so extremely happy to be comfortable in my skin again.  </li>
            <li>Great value and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping great product good condition</li>
            <li>Not that impressed, didn&#x27;t clear up my skin</li>
            <li>it seems to me that a product designed by \\&quot;two doctors\\&quot; should have some hypoallergenic qualities to it better than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proceed at your own risk....</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t think that the product description says that it&#x27;s included), so I&#x27;m pretty happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I experienced this myself when I first started to use it.</li>
            <li>Do read the fine print!  </li>
            <li>it is easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li>this price here is most competitive.  </li>
            <li>I order these for my wife and teen and the 3pc kit works perfectly.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>It is priced better than the TV add.</li>
            <li>I tried already to many things and even the doctors....  </li>
            <li>She started using it twice a day as recommended and is now able to get away with once a day.  </li>
            <li>Now her face is notably clearer.  </li>
            <li>I am going to continue ordering from this seller and using Proactiv!! :)</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>My skin looks much better and must have for teenagers with acne issue.</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Okay, so, I just want to start this off by saying that if you started any skin care regime - it will work.</li>
            <li>You can get better skin care packages for a better price.</li>
            <li>I will be buying again for sure.</li>
            <li>Has to be used regularly for best results.  </li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>and then if I need more moisture I might use Vanishing Cream over a layer of skin food.  </li>
            <li>This controls my acne better than anything.  </li>
            <li>but for now I&#x27;m okay with having to use it.  </li>
            <li>Proactiv is ok.  </li>
            <li>Better to buy through Amazon, that way you&#x27;re in control of when product arrives.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Okay.  </li>
            <li>I started to break out more and more, and the smell bothered me.</li>
            <li>I then tried this marykay product and it was so much better</li>
            <li>They just gave me BS and kept trying to sell more of there product; in the end I just gave up.</li>
            <li>I know I gotta wait a bit more</li>
            <li>his product should not use it daily, but its great for balancing skin that takes abuse from sweaty workouts!</li>
            <li>Purchased for my son and he is pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>BUT..I&#x27;ve used this for 4 months and it did more breaking out my skin then fixing it.</li>
            <li>(they smell better, too).  </li>
            <li>They love it.</li>
            <li>This works much better for me.</li>
            <li>Paid more than if I would have just ordered it from the commercials.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Thankfully my makeup covers most of it up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m checking out the Proactiv scar treatment to see if that will help banish any hint of my cystic acne nightmare :)</li>
            <li>Bought this for my aunt, i noticed that her breakout is getting better.</li>
            <li>The Top Rated Acne Treatment Pill.</li>
            <li>I love the product.  </li>
            <li>Need I say More.</li>
            <li>&quot; Winner of The Voice, my lovely wife uses the product so what&#x27;s there not to like about it.</li>
            <li>I ordered this in hopes that the &amp;#34;New Formula&amp;#34; would work better than the &amp;#34;Old Formula&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I love that this product is offered on Amazon because dealing with ProActiv&#x27;s monthly plan is horrendous.</li>
            <li>Once you stop using, you break out more.</li>
            <li>Same great product!</li>
            <li>Great product at reasonable price.</li>
            <li>sure</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off ordering off the Proactiv website.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes they have better deals and a lot more</li>
            <li>So glad we did not order it from the website as we would have continued to recieve charges on our charge card.</li>
            <li>but bottle are more like sample sizes  . .</li>
            <li>nice product, fast shipping and good deal</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!!&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>just the fact that she is doing something about her acne makes her feel better than just waiting it out for it do magically disappear.</li>
            <li>For one, I greatly dislike how much this bleaches items.  </li>
            <li>but I found that I was using much more of one of the step bottles over others.  </li>
            <li>My skin is getting better now.</li>
            <li>and I am completely satisfied with the results I started noticing the difference within the 1st week I recommend.</li>
            <li>I was warned by many reviews but didn&#x27;t listen because I wanted the cheaper price.</li>
            <li>He breaks out more with it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have skin issues, but I still like using it since it makes your skin look great.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had acne for 3 years with no hope remaining :)</li>
            <li>the cleanser and lotion are ok</li>
            <li>My acne is much better since I stopped using cleansers.</li>
            <li>you for contacting Guthy|Renker through the Better Business Bureau.</li>
            <li>We received your inquiry and sincerely apologize for any miscommunication.</li>
            <li>When I myself was able to afford Proactiv I tried it</li>
            <li>more so now during my period.</li>
            <li>i love this stuff...</li>
            <li>Her skin has never looked more lovely.  </li>
            <li>I love the proactive system.</li>
            <li>If I find a great deal on whole 3pc kit, I will opt for the kit.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks better when I use this.</li>
            <li>For me, and many others, it causes cystic acne.  </li>
            <li>, my face started to look better.  </li>
            <li>it seems to me that a product designed by \\&quot;two doctors\\&quot; should have some hypoallergenic qualities to it better than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proceed</li>
            <li>This is like liquid gold but better because it removes acne.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>I am lost without this stuff and have gotten the auto ship on Proactiv&#x27;s website that&#x27;s how much I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It works identically to Proactiv (same results for me anyway) and the best part?  </li>
            <li>The stuff in it discolored so many shirts, could you imagine what it&#x27;s doing to your face?</li>
            <li>I would never recommend this to anyone, there is much better stuff out there.</li>
            <li>Trying to get a good description from him is not easy - LOL!  </li>
            <li>this product really works!!!!</li>
            <li>It is high quality product, and the price and quality ratio contained in the product is great.</li>
            <li>Face was very clean .We got what we wanted</li>
            <li>But my skin was pretty good</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize the advertisements for this product line are convincing, but honesty you&#x27;d be better off with juice beauty (makes your skin softer than you can imagine), or even just Purpose, which is available at the drug store and can be used as many times a day as you want.</li>
            <li>You must have a new boyfriend.&amp;#34; To I honestly replied, &amp;#34;no, I&#x27;ve been using Proactiv.&amp;#34; LoL cheese, I know, but true.</li>
            <li>I thought Pro Activ would clear it up great.  </li>
            <li>acne free claims to be better</li>
            <li>And, for the first time there is a cream moisturizer, which is my favorite product--smooth, creamy, and effective (does not cause breakouts).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy that I ordered this acne kit for my 15yr old daughter.</li>
            <li>got my delivery early which was a great I was getting it for a gift.</li>
            <li>The old had my face looking great again in two weeks.</li>
            <li>far 3 days been seeing great results</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just so happy that I did not waste my money and just get on</li>
            <li>: it&#x27;s very strong since it cleans out your pores and as a woman you cannot get pregnant for 1 year.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s excellent when battling acne problems and/or other skin issues.</li>
            <li>I have cabinets full of products!</li>
            <li>may work for very mild acne.</li>
            <li>and I saw results very quickly.  </li>
            <li>but mostly let me tell you nothing in the stores or proactive will clean you acne...</li>
            <li>I tried them, the combo of the acne fighting ingredients proved too strong for my skin.</li>
            <li>I guess this was just too strong for my skin.</li>
            <li>The Proactiv Solution 3pc has eliminated my acne and has tamed it down a great deal!</li>
            <li>my homework read all the fine print before ordering and did not see anywhere in the fine print you are signing up for auto delivery.</li>
            <li>however that I never read the fine print to realize that they auto-snip and auto-charge your card after you pay for the trial.  </li>
            <li>Proactive is my favorite face cleaner, its quick and works like a charm</li>
            <li>He is quick to ask for more when he is running out.</li>
            <li>Did the old formula have a pleasant smell?</li>
            <li>The Acne Prevention Place responded quickly and shipped the product at a better price than anyone else seems to - no complaints from me.  </li>
            <li>When I started using it, my face was one huge fine rash.</li>
            <li>really well makes my skin glow and nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife and she has gone through one round of it and is extremely impressed with the results.  </li>
            <li>nothing fabulous.  </li>
            <li>advanced blemish treatment contains 6% benzoyl peroxide and they charge $10.50 for 0.33 ounce.  </li>
            <li>If your skin does do well with benzoyl peroxide, though, I would reccomend this product because it does a fantastic job</li>
            <li>My daughter used this product several years ago and it worked great for quite a while but then seemed to stop working</li>
            <li>The day after I received the detailed invoice, I received another shaming letter in the mail from Proactiv Solutions saying that because I never contacted them regarding my account, they&#x27;ll never do business with me again and any request made for their product will be denied.  </li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s more than worth a try.</li>
            <li>B00LFT0CFI TreeActiv+ Tea Tree Oil Acne Solution for Advanced Acne Treatment &amp;#x2605;</li>
            <li>I had cheap parents who never would invest money in this product for me</li>
            <li>I have searched everywhere for a cheap way to battle acne, and this is it.</li>
            <li>and they gave me five thing free</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t ever be free of dealing with acne but with Proactiv, I won&#x27;t dread looking at myself in the mirror.</li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>This stuff worked pretty good for the first 2 months of using it, then it just stopped working</li>
            <li>A couple actually did more damage than they did good.</li>
            <li>Looks good so far and</li>
            <li>My current routine which keeps my skin looking good and mostly clear.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was delighted to see this and even more delighted to see that the ingredients are just about identical, except for one tiny (most likely insignificant) ingredient that the Target brand has that Proactiv does not.  </li>
            <li>These things are so easy to find if you just give it a google or even a search on amazon and most of the time, it&#x27;s pretty darn cheap</li>
            <li>This is a professional formula &amp; I saw great results right away.  </li>
            <li>and she feels satisfied she made the right choice.</li>
            <li>now i can buy it when i need it and its much cheeper than buying from the mall!!!</li>
            <li>we received your product and after using the product for a couple of days has been very satisfied &amp; happy about the condition of her facial skin and how smooth &amp; soft her skin is</li>
            <li>What a wonderful price for a product that usually costs an arm and a leg.  </li>
            <li>The plus is to rich and broke me out all over again.</li>
            <li>but this new one is amazing skin cleared within weeks.</li>
            <li>so it just gives me a really clean feeling.</li>
            <li>I think the plus side is helped by the fact that there is a 3 product \\&quot;system\\&quot; that works together to help acne - cleanser, toner, treatment - so that you are cleaning your face and then putting product on a clean face that treats the acne.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There are much better products available at a much lower cost.</li>
            <li>but surely I can see the positive result using this kit.</li>
            <li>The good part of Proactiv is that it was formulated to work together, so if you don&#x27;t have a reaction to the product when you first use it, you know you can safely use the entire system without adverse effects.  </li>
            <li>Nice stuff-working well for my 14-yr old!</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t have the skin of a 13 year old any more!</li>
            <li>this product is wonderful, I got it for my granddaughter and her face is amazingly clearer after only a week and a half</li>
            <li>I purchased a special one time offer of Proactiv for $29.95 online.</li>
            <li>Specially because it is at my door step when I &#x27;need&#x27; it and &#x27;want it.&#x27;</li>
            <li>If you are just here for the reviews before you decide to order the infomoercial special DON&#x27;T. All I feel like saying about Proactiv</li>
            <li>that right because they scammed 40 dollars from me .2 stars!</li>
            <li>will suggest that you find out what is triggering your flare-ups because no product will be 100% successful if your skin is sensitive to certain types of foods.  </li>
            <li>But True, Folks .</li>
            <li>My wife is also better but the result is not so fast as mine.  </li>
            <li>I used Proactiv throughout my teen years and it worked fairly well</li>
            <li>Using the monthly plan doesn&#x27;t really work for us, I like being able to go on Amazon and just order what we need.</li>
            <li>Then about 6 months ago I decided to give it a real shot and use it for more than just a couple uses.  </li>
            <li>It is full of chemicals, and after years of using chemical acne wash</li>
            <li>and I said to myself this couldn&#x27;t be true...</li>
            <li>It really clears my face up :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hoping this review will help others who are debating trying Proactiv: here I share my experience with the products and company.&lt;br /&gt;I have fair, oily skin and moderate acne, not cystic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried just using the cream with different face washes and it doesnt work as good.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s been good to my skin.</li>
            <li>, the milk thing isn&#x27;t true in everyone, so don&#x27;t take it to heart.  </li>
            <li>So obviously, for whatever reason, my skin dramatically reacts to the Proactive system and the acne clears up noticably quickly with minimalto no drying or peeling if you use a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>The area around my mouth has been flaky for weeks, so I&#x27;ve been using cocoa butter, which seems to help tremendously.</li>
            <li>I use Bee Yummy skin food (which helped tremendously with the dryness and peeling)</li>
            <li>If I use Proactive, the medicine somehow keeps the acne to a minimum and heals it up quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have switched and tried cheaper more accesible (local drugstores) answers to my acne and not found anything that works better.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery and didn&#x27;t have to sign up fir auto refills.  </li>
            <li>and the Shipper was quick.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping, but item sent was not what was listed.</li>
            <li>And to be honest I stopped using it and really didn&#x27;t even notice much of a difference.    </li>
            <li>I had used Proactiv as a teenager (when I *thought* I had acne), and I remembered how quickly I got results, so I tried it again about 6 months ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But after the initial couple of weeks to month of breaking out, my skin clears up and looks great-not perfect, as I will occasionally still get a zit or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On top of that if you have any issues, you do not have any customer service that is normally provided by proactiv.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d heard nothing but great success stories from other people who had used it, so</li>
            <li>I recommend engaging the BBB at the first sign of trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The new version is 10 times better.</li>
            <li>I have tried Proactiv many times and when the new formula came out</li>
            <li>This new formula of Proactiv made my face break out even more.</li>
            <li>, I like the new version better.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping,  got it exactly when I was supposed to,  authentic product,  just like the practive i remember,</li>
            <li>This has worked pretty good for my teenage son.</li>
            <li>I just received my first package from proactive!</li>
            <li>Proactive product works very well!!</li>
            <li>For me it took about 3 months for it to work effectively and now that it has I have WAY less breakouts and my skin look healthy.</li>
            <li>I then tried Acne Free Severe, and to my surprise it didn&#x27;t help that much.  </li>
            <li>The sizes are worth the money</li>
            <li>Far better than proactiv plus</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s worth spending the money on .</li>
            <li>it is so worth it...</li>
            <li>I will be giving this product to my cousin because she has success with benzoyl peroxide products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Product clears the skin, just like the infomercials suggest, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>The only problem we have ever run into is that it is so popular that sometimes it is unavailable</li>
            <li>The results my family got just weren&#x27;t worth the price or the frustration.</li>
            <li>People constantly comment on how nice my skin looks when I use Proactive.</li>
            <li>Def worth it</li>
            <li>I thought I was going to get 3 months worth of this product.  </li>
            <li>The price is worth it.</li>
            <li>I think the product is worth it</li>
            <li>Currently, I do not use soap or cleansers of any kind on any skin.</li>
            <li>I take a warm shower and gently dry off with a clean towel.</li>
            <li>well worth the price.</li>
            <li>100% worth it.</li>
            <li>Try altering your diet and see what theresults are, you may be more surprised than you&#x27;d think.</li>
            <li>at your own risk....was a personal reaction but....</li>
            <li>If you need Proactiv, and it really is a good product, buy it from one of the resellers here on Amazon, and not straight from the Proactiv website.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting a miracle product and thus didn&#x27;t deliver.it comes with a scrub,a toner,and a moisturizer.i may just need to let this stop.i am very overweight and have a lot of other things going on but at least I tried.the best thing would be to work on being happy.proactive is just as good as a $1 soap.dont</li>
            <li>It worked fine with my son , the secound time he used it , it already started the job and in one week his face was clean and clear , i would recomend it for everybody</li>
            <li>I originally used this product straight from Proactiv</li>
            <li>I used it right</li>
            <li>But for some reason Proactiv gets it right</li>
            <li>Would go with them again; received all the right products per description; still using the proactiv</li>
            <li>Just trust us to do the right thing\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I bought proactive for them and right away</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know if I just caught it right on time,</li>
            <li>You order it when you want it, and the price is right.</li>
            <li>Luv it, had no issue was delivered right on time.  </li>
            <li>After 3 days my forehead was much better,after 1 week my forehead was clean</li>
            <li>my skin felt comfortable and normal.</li>
            <li>not sure it worked as great as all the infomercials say it did.  </li>
            <li>I used this a long time ago when I was in college and liked it</li>
            <li>The product is actually for my girlfriend who was having some issues with her face and from the results am seeing on her face its doing a good job so far</li>
            <li>To help you complete your purchase, we&#x27;ve made it easy ....</li>
            <li>At night I splash a bit of warm water on my face and gently dry with a high-quality towel.</li>
            <li>were they will put you on a monthly contract unless you are very, very, very careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my wife loves it very much.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t go through this very fast.</li>
            <li>The first time it worked pretty well</li>
            <li>I like being able to purchase what I need instead of an entire kit at one time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real thing!</li>
            <li>I tried just about every product out there that you can buy in the drugstores (including all of the different 3 step systems that claim to be better than Proactiv) and nothing worked.  </li>
            <li>Proactiv worked within the first three days of use.</li>
            <li>The only thing I recommend is stay on top of using product thats</li>
            <li>It makes my skin clear, smooth, and toned.  </li>
            <li>first week the product brought everything up to the surface</li>
            <li>He totally bleached out two favorite shirts.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t take the word of someone who has JUST tried a skin care routine for the first time and picked Proactiv.</li>
            <li>They actually cause more blemishes.  </li>
            <li>switched to a basic skin care routine which is working better.</li>
            <li>the end they will fight you by telling you that you will have to pay the first three months,</li>
            <li>The first kit came as pictured, with instructions.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I like Proactiv Plus better; also, their customer service has improved quite a bit.  </li>
            <li>However, I do not use exactly as directed.</li>
            <li>She tried everything from counter top face cream, topical cream from doctor and homemade acv toner,raw honey etc...</li>
            <li>Also feels so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Our whole family has found success with it, not just the teenagers.</li>
            <li>Almost exactly what you get in the store.</li>
            <li>At first it cleared up my face.  </li>
            <li>First off, I didn&#x27;t order Proactiv through this seller, but from the company website.</li>
            <li>At first, it cleared up my skin within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>exactly what happened.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so the toner runs out first then</li>
            <li>This product absolutely without a doubt DOES NOT WORK!</li>
            <li>but I always went back to it since it&#x27;s helped my skin the most.</li>
            <li>It has given me a better complexion and with this three piece set it can last me over 2 months.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to buy proactiv at first.</li>
            <li>or when I notice my face is starting to break out(essentially to exfoliate), and the repairing lotion as more of a \\&quot;zit-zapper\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>This happens when starting most acne products, in my experience.</li>
            <li>She began using it and the results were almost immediate and very pleasing to her!</li>
            <li>Would pay twice as much for it!</li>
            <li>I have been exploring so many different ways to get rid of my acne and blemishes, and I keep seeing this stuff on TV</li>
            <li>Came with exactly the contents specified.</li>
            <li>Just like with exercising, where looking better starts in the kitchen, same thing here.  </li>
            <li>It may seem at first that this product works</li>
            <li>, as a nurse, I was most concerned about the \\&quot;side effects\\&quot; (i.e., the brown spots) and what happened to my daughter several months into the program.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Pretty sure people have a basic understanding of this product since it has been featured on the television and online.</li>
            <li>- This is the first time this has happened to me as I&#x27;ve been buying proactiv on Amazon for years...</li>
            <li>Just a fair warning before you waste any money.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive, it breaks out when the weather changes, I&#x27;m under stress, PMSing, or there&#x27;s a full moon (kidding...).</li>
            <li>Seriously, everyone else I know had great results, I just feel compelled to tell my experience.  </li>
            <li>I tried Oxy, Clearasil, Clean &amp; Clear, Murad, Proactiv, everything.  </li>
            <li>I love using products by Lush, or Clinique, or natural remedies like oil-cleansing and so on, but still the acne flared up everywhere on my face.  </li>
            <li>I then experimented wtih different lush regimes and while I liked these products, the acne kept coming, relentlessly.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and would have done better with the sensitive formula.</li>
            <li>I still used it because it works fine, but that&#x27;s kind of ridiculous.</li>
            <li>Other product leave my face feeling both sticky and dry; this is by far the best acne line I have ever tried!</li>
            <li>I have been buying this product for my mother which has a crazy acne break out once in a while, great way of controlling it with this product, just make sure you use it very often as a break out might happen after some days of no usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will be the first to tell you they didn&#x27;t all work very well for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it and using it, I still have pretty much every pimple I had to start.</li>
            <li>Then the toner is actually mainly glycolic acid which actually helps exfoliate your skin even more.</li>
            <li>it made my skin so dry and itchy, got more wrinkles from using it.</li>
            <li>you suffer from super sensitive skin, do NOT use this product.</li>
            <li>I do notice that after about a year of using it, it becomes less effective.</li>
            <li>but I have gotten lots of pimple at once in certain areas of my face.</li>
            <li>This company is pure evil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is not the NEW FORMULA!!  </li>
            <li>She felt burning on her face first use,and then developed what looked like red burns on her face,  most noticeable on her chin and forehead.</li>
            <li>the product is great and works well, the only thing is that on the STEP 1 bottle, the writing fell/washed off which was odd.</li>
            <li>I did have high hopes for this product since I was suffering from acne and willing to try anything</li>
            <li>but they run the same scam many other companies are running by allowing you to sign up easily online for their subscription product but making you call in to cancel it which &#x27;may or may not&#x27; go through their system since its all done over the phone</li>
            <li>It came in just a few days and it is the same great Proactiv product I have been using before.  </li>
            <li>am ordering it again, because the occasional use makes a huge difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance.  </li>
            <li>but after about 6 months of use I saw real progress and now 2 years later my face is as smooth a a babies butt.</li>
            <li>really matters is the percentage of Benzoyl Peroxide, I believe the FDA caps it at 15% for over the counter medication.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>It also was shipped very promptly.</li>
            <li>She was really insulted that I bought it for her though</li>
            <li>Really unethical.</li>
            <li>Then the lotion is really just a benzoyl peroxide moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and it is working really well.</li>
            <li>We stopped ordering it for a while and we saw how much difference it makes.</li>
            <li>really do think instead of helping my acne</li>
            <li>I gave it a five star rating because it really worked.  </li>
            <li>Proactive has worked really well for me</li>
            <li>All the acne and the damage started to heal up fast</li>
            <li>This product really works.  </li>
            <li>So besides costing me hundreds of dollars, this product didn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>but i ain&#x27;t see much change yet.</li>
            <li>it could VERY well just be my skin</li>
            <li>have very oily skin.</li>
            <li>and it REALLY helped with the dryness.</li>
            <li>It took about 2weeks to see it&#x27;s really working</li>
            <li>I took my son to a dermatologist and 3 months later he was acne free.</li>
            <li>Proactiv Solution works very well.  </li>
            <li>Better packaging is needed - a box rather that an envelope which is easily crushed.</li>
            <li>cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;Not real, the beads are nonexistent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does not seem like the real product to me...or has been stored for years in someone&#x27;s basement.</li>
            <li>The ads are very misleading</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>and I really have to say it&#x27;s because of Proactiv.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Using this, in combination with Aveeno&#x27;s calming wash and lotion works really well for</li>
            <li>Bf bought this and it really does work</li>
            <li>fast shipping and twice as much product for the price.</li>
            <li>This really does work.</li>
            <li>It is pricey, but not having damaged skin as an adult is well worth the cost now.</li>
            <li>have tried the following within the last 2 years but ended up going back to Proactiv because it just works best for me&lt;br /&gt;Dermologica, Acnefree, Mario Badescu (regular line and acne</li>
            <li>My skin is very clear.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was very thorough in describing all of my dealings with Guthy Renker to the BBB.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and breakout</li>
            <li>My boyfriend had success with Proactiv when he was young with his cystic acne, so I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>After some research on the Proactiv website I concluded that I had used too much of the product.</li>
            <li>My skin still has a breakout here and there but is much improved.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s gentle on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was much needed</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>, I broke out a whole lot.</li>
            <li>I really recommend.</li>
            <li>nothing else has worked but proactiv really does i recommend this to any one with any type of acne troubles</li>
            <li>costly but worth it, the results are always clearly seen.</li>
            <li>It has really worked.</li>
            <li>This system really works for my face, i really like the tones</li>
            <li>I have always struggled with acne and nothing has ever really worked.</li>
            <li>You can enjoy the weekends out at your favorite restaurants, or the occasional movie night with pizza, just don&#x27;t make it an every other day</li>
            <li>The 3 step worked right away for me, within a couple weeks my skin started getting clear and brighter.  </li>
            <li>While I was using it, I didn&#x27;t see any significant difference, but when I quit it, my acne came back much worse.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>( I thought it was going to be some type of micro, new and improved type, but it actually was the original, not the biggest deal to me though), thanks!</li>
            <li>The product worked OK for one of my daughters and didn&#x27;t work at all for the other one.  </li>
            <li>Delivery OK, shapes on the other hand the efficiency</li>
            <li>If you buy a sample of proactive you will commit yourself to endless charges to your credit card, this is the the most aggravating company on earth to do business with.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Proactiv just works for me, better than any other product I have tried.</li>
            <li>Its working much better than other brands he has tried.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited when i got this product, but when i went to go use it, my face started to burn, and it got really red, and itchy.</li>
            <li>I even tried all natural remedies which surprisingly worked, but only for so long.  </li>
            <li>and I was still getting these huge zits here and there, which was different from my normal breakouts.</li>
            <li>My face never felt truly CLEAN after using the wash, felt oily and gross.  </li>
            <li>I think I paid $1.29 for it, and in fact, it is a little more effective for me, than the much more expensive</li>
            <li>I would recommend this kit to most anyone except those with extremely sensitive or dry skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;delived fast, and I use but need to buy more in less time</li>
            <li>When I first started using it, I thought my skin was going to clear up.</li>
            <li>We had purchased directly through Proactive the first time.  </li>
            <li>In fact she bought another already so thumbs up to proactive for doing such a fine job so far.</li>
            <li>No gimmicks of having to pay every 30 days for a new shipment!</li>
            <li>After taking a break from it for a while, i came back and ordered it, first thing i noticed is that the smell is different now, and as i expected, it&#x27;s not as good as it was before.</li>
            <li>The old formula Proactiv was sent not the new formula, so now I have a SUPER over priced set of the old formula Proactiv.</li>
            <li>this particular page seems to have.  </li>
            <li>I do not recommend it as not only did it make my skin more red</li>
            <li>The BP is milder and does not bleach hair and fabric like the older formula.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to wash your hands thoroughly after applying it to your face and use only white towels, washcloths and pillowcases!  </li>
            <li>And I did get the older formula.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product and be sure to check for expiration dates, especially for Step 1.</li>
            <li>And the only reason I didn&#x27;t Is I&#x27;m handicap, so pretty much I feel I was screwed out of my money!</li>
            <li>The formula is kind of strong and at first, like I said it dried my skin and stung a little if I got it near my eyes.</li>
            <li>My daughter tried this product with high hopes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>My junior high age daughter loves this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to all people with acne symptoms.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive AND extremely oily skin, which is a combo that a lot of dermatologists don&#x27;t fully understand, and most medications WAY overdry my skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have extremely sensitive skin, but certain things make me break out.</li>
            <li>It is the actual Proactive product, not fake!</li>
            <li>My skin was starting to develop more fine lines at a quicker pace and it looked blotchy and dull.</li>
            <li>It is a little pricey, but this distributor has made it more affordable.</li>
            <li>it lasts me a little more than two months</li>
            <li>This product works really well in helping to clear up acne.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have a huge problem with acne (just occasional bumps here and there), but I was hoping to use this product to avoid any further pimples around my forehead and chin area.</li>
            <li>WORKS  ON MY ADULT NEPHEW VERY WELL..</li>
            <li>Works very well for clear skin.</li>
            <li>I think my skin is not sensitive at all since I&#x27;ve tried so many different things</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure he has to use it everyday or they will return</li>
            <li>It cleared my skin for the most part, but at that time I was also using the Green Tea Moisturizer and didn&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li>I and looked at this in vending machines at malls and it was normal size bottles</li>
            <li>To me Proactiv is worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>so it must be normal.</li>
            <li>After a few more months of using it I gave up and started using something else.</li>
            <li>I tried Mary Kay Time wise and it just made it worse.</li>
            <li>He is in high school and feels a low self esteem from his complexsion, but is headed in the right direction using Proactive Solution kit I bought for him.</li>
            <li>Antibiotics have worked really well in the past but recently have become less effective, plus I don&#x27;t like being on them since bacteria can become more resistant to it.</li>
            <li>I have tried using some of the generic versions and other products, in a similar fashion, but have not had good results.</li>
            <li>My forehead cleared right up, but I now have acne scars on my cheeks and several blemishes that just won&#x27;t go away.  </li>
            <li>My triggers were excess salt, too many refined carbs and later discovered I was allergic to dark chocolate and certain dairy</li>
            <li>Bought it at mall for my teenage son, and so far seems about as good as anything else he has used, no better,</li>
            <li>However; i got the package today and it has stated for 3 days that it was in california close to where I live</li>
            <li>I am now 24 and decided to give the Proactiv new formula a try.  </li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t gotten any new blemishes since I&#x27;ve started using it.  </li>
            <li>The nest time I saw him was New Years Eve</li>
            <li>Guess what today a new charge hit my bank, so I called them and asked that they cancel my subscription (which I did not agree to anyway)</li>
            <li>I have the new formula, which is Proactiv</li>
            <li>He looks &amp; feels like a new person.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;m in my 30s and still get breakouts, i wanted to try it again since there was apparently a new, gentler formula.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re thinking that you&#x27;re buying the new micro-cystal formula, but you&#x27;re not.  </li>
            <li>Proactive has changed their product to a new formula which was ineffective with my skin type.</li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t wait to see what the new package will deliver in reality.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After I moved, a package was forwarded by the Post Office to my new address.</li>
            <li>When a new zit comes up you put this product on it</li>
            <li>but I have to wonder if it isn&#x27;t \\&quot;skin cell confusion\\&quot; with the use of a new product.</li>
            <li>Description said NEW Formula.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>, my skin feels like new.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products and keep coming back to this, it really works and keeps my face clear, what&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li>The only complain I have is that it dries out your skin tremendously, but besides that it really got rid of my blackheads on my back.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard this works much better for people with very oily or at least non-sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I guess I need to be more careful in the future.</li>
            <li>I do have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It keeps her skin clear if she remembers to use it!  </li>
            <li>My skin doesn&#x27;t stay clear without it!</li>
            <li>Now I have a clear skin!</li>
            <li>I do not get paid for this review and usually I do not like to write,but it was so impressing that I wanted to share it.</li>
            <li>I also use the refining mask 3 times per week and it makes my skin extremely soft!</li>
            <li>I am 38 years old - I will never stop using it!</li>
            <li>Clean/new (just the solutions, no documentation, exactly as posted, expiry at end of next year).</li>
            <li>The ingredients were exactly the same!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very non-greasy formula, and seems to clear up breakouts extra fast.</li>
            <li>I think I am going to go to an all natural product!</li>
            <li>Her face remained swollen and red for about 3 days then continued to have red blotches for many days after that, including swollen, red eyelids that looked like she had not slept for days.</li>
            <li>ProActiv is an ok product and seems to work as well as the other acne prevention product we have tried, a 2% salicyclic acid topical treatment from Alba Botanica.  </li>
            <li>Ordered this at what seemed like a good price as the next round for my daughter when her current set rant out.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different things,so i decided to give pro active a try.</li>
            <li>They charge even more for products with a standard concentration of active ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She states that it works great, thank you, size was a little small compared to bottles seen at the mall</li>
            <li>not much else to say, but to keep on top of actually using it: but it works like no other!</li>
            <li>and I have tried many things in the past to make it clear up, but nothing has worked.  </li>
            <li>But this took three tries over the phone to complete, it took over one billing cycle to see the full amount returned.</li>
            <li>I still have more then half the bottle left</li>
            <li>The price is only relatively more expensive, but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>This system really did not do much for me other than stopping new acne from forming.</li>
            <li>Clear my face up</li>
            <li>My skin is completely clear.</li>
            <li>It has also cleared up any blemish marks and my skin is perfectly clear.</li>
            <li>, he uses it a couple times a week and his face stays clear.</li>
            <li>Will buy here again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to keep her face clear.</li>
            <li>and he was completely clear.  </li>
            <li>Accutane will clear your acne up 100% and you will not have an oily face</li>
            <li>Used as directed skin should clear and remain so.</li>
            <li>It took me about six months for my skin to get clear so,</li>
            <li>After 3 months of usage, his skin is completely clear.</li>
            <li>give it a week to turn around and another for them to clear up.</li>
            <li>It did take a month or so to 100% clear up -</li>
            <li>The Clearzine supplement prevents acne as well as working from the inside-out to quickly clear up skin.</li>
            <li>then my face stays clear.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve always wanted clear skin and not to have to put make-up on.</li>
            <li>Keeps it clear all the time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just that once you see how clear your skin can look, you just cringe when you skip the routine and see how your skin used to look.</li>
            <li>normal skin care routine wasn&#x27;t helping the these frequent break-outs (generally surface-level blemishes with some cystic).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 24 years old and my acne is just now starting to really subside.  </li>
            <li>When I got poractive  m y face was so clear like it take2weeks to create 123 poractive thing</li>
            <li>Word of advice, don&#x27;t get it near your eyes because the cleanser does sting.  </li>
            <li>I only really like the face wash.</li>
            <li>However, I stopped using it when I was in my early 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li>and I started to experience frequent breakouts.  </li>
            <li>but my skin has cleared up almost completely</li>
            <li>I used to purchase directly from the website but they always took almost two weeks to send my shipments.</li>
            <li>Blotting paper helps, but you can only do that so much in a day.  </li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s face has cleared up considerably after 3 weeks use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 16 year old grandson.  </li>
            <li>I am a 40 year old woman that never had acne growing up.  </li>
            <li>so I tried using natural products for a while just to see what would happen</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 14 year old son and he has used it as directed.  </li>
            <li>I would not recommend  ProActiv to people with sensitive skin and to discontinue if you feel burning or develop redness.</li>
            <li>So if you don&#x27;t want to lose a ton of money and you want a product that works, I would stay far away from this one.</li>
            <li>I have no idea if the product is expired, the old formula, etc.</li>
            <li>but when it is unavailable through it is also unavailable through directly.</li>
            <li>But I get it for my 18 year old son and my 20 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>really can&#x27;t tell if the company is unscrupulous or just grossly disorganized, but I would recommend buying something else.  </li>
            <li>I used this on my 10 year old who is involved in sports and has a forehead breakout problem .....</li>
            <li>Works well so far.</li>
            <li>After comparing the ingredients on my old bottle of Proactive and the &amp;#</li>
            <li>These will take almost a year to use up completely.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your time.</li>
            <li>I struggle with adult acne and I lived in a humid climate at the time.</li>
            <li>Your skin needs balance and Proactiv is far from that.</li>
            <li>I will NEVER waste money on their products again.</li>
            <li>Proactive works great for me, and when the kiosk at the local mall closed, I was forced to go online for it.</li>
            <li>My only real problem is that when my package arrived, the toner was leaking.</li>
            <li>She is washing her face and using it daily and is a much kinder gentler preteen.</li>
            <li>When I received my shipment, I found out it was not the &amp;#34;New Formula&amp;#34;, it was the old formula.</li>
            <li>I have been suffering from acne darn near all my life I am now 30</li>
            <li>For me this product works its not harsh on my face</li>
            <li>This company is a complete scam.</li>
            <li>I occasionally have acne breakout, but it is much milder acne because I use Proactiv.  </li>
            <li>Received the old one.</li>
            <li>My daughter is going through her teenage acne phase and we wanted to find something simple but powerful that will help clear her skin.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my 16 yr old.</li>
            <li>My 19 yr old refused to try it as she heard from friends</li>
            <li>As a person with hereditary acne I&#x27;ve tried damn near everything out there prescribed by dermatologists.</li>
            <li>and it destroyed the natural oil the skin has</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 31 years old</li>
            <li>This stuff works no matter how old you are.</li>
            <li>I recommend sticking with it for at least 2 months before you make a final judgment, that&#x27;s when my daughter started to notice nice results.  </li>
            <li>This shipped and, the only thing I can complain about is you do not get any of the free stuff that the regular site offers however; they put a very long shipment date</li>
            <li>My sister had amazing results, my daughter, not quite as dramatic.  </li>
            <li>But the odd thing about it is after a couple hours my skin is super oily.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my 13 yr old daughter who was experiencing major breakouts.  </li>
            <li>did try the new proactiv plus and went back to the old.</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t ready to give a long commitment</li>
            <li>had minor skin problems as a teenager, but I&#x27;ve really struggled with acne in my 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I thought maybe there was just an adjustment period, but I used the stuff for over two months and my face still isn&#x27;t back to normal.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read other reviews that said the earlier formula worked better, so that may be why my daughter didn&#x27;t have the same level of results, but there are also different types of acne, so some may take longer to treat.  </li>
            <li>It definitely clears out the patches of acne I used to get, but it does give me 2-3 large and very deep zits.  </li>
            <li>In total I paid nearly $100 for an order only a tablecloth spoon bigger than my first order that costed $29.95.</li>
            <li>To my astonishment I was charged $32.95 automatically the next month and sent an identical new supply.</li>
            <li>so I can get back to managing my acne though I am on the look for a new product.  </li>
            <li>I made sure to only search for and purchase proactiv&#x27;s &#x27;new formula&#x27; (as pictured), yet I received the old formula... Not exactly happy with my purchase</li>
            <li>Letting my face dry between each step really irritates my skin but doing me step immediately after another is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have moderate to severe acne, so it only works so much.  </li>
            <li>This product lives up to its reputation my teenage twins were starting to have a real problem with acne .</li>
            <li>Regular soap works just as well,and is much cheaper....or opt for the over the counter items such as Clearasil etc..</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much acne and only get it occasionally</li>
            <li>I cannot use this product twice daily or even daily, but I found a way that really works for me.  </li>
            <li>Our records indicate that on December 21, 2011, your third Proactiv® shipment, a 60-Day 4 piece supply, was sent for a total of $57.75, which remained unpaid.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this for my 14 year old son and within a week, we have seen that his face is starting to clear up.  </li>
            <li>Ever several days my face got super dry and red.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately for my daughter it wasn&#x27;t instant, but she did have good improvement over time.</li>
            <li>I ordered Proactiv and used the full three-step treatment twice a day for two days, and on the third day I awoke with red, very dry skin all over my face.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get swayed when you instantly break out, that happens at firt on your way to clear skin!</li>
            <li>I started using the Olay ProX and Aztec indian healing clay too and have seen a major improvement with my skin.</li>
            <li>Proactiv is actually a combination of these things and somehow it works much better than anything I have bought in the past.!  </li>
            <li>Proactiv is the only facial-cleaning product that completely clears-up my daughter&#x27;s acne, so she loves it!</li>
            <li>Any cleansing product will strip old skin and expose new, more vulnerable skin to the elements.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use a white towel and wear a white shirt, tank, or an old shirt due to them getting discolored due to some of the ingredients.</li>
            <li>I may also only apply step 3 directly onto blemishes and/or small problem areas, because I think leaving the benzol peroxide on my non-oily skin may be a significant contributor to the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but when I consistently use Proactive my skin looks less red, my pores are smaller and my skin is always clear!!!</li>
            <li>The ONLY thing that keeps my daughter&#x27;s skin clear.</li>
            <li>Proactiv is definitely not for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I will go back to buying it directly from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>When I sighed up for a one month supply they automatically sigh you up for three month supply, so I was surprised when I got another package from them a month later.</li>
            <li>I tried Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Acne Gel Cleanser but that only worked for 2 months.</li>
            <li>I initially tried this because I had given up on clearing my adult acne.</li>
            <li>And, I have discovered that purchasing this product on amazon.com is cheaper than buying directly from the manufacturer, plus it alleviates the manufacturer&#x27;s auto-renewal, or my having to call and cancel until such time as my daughter needs me to re-order this for her.</li>
            <li>I used to wear dermablend just to cover them up, now I barely feather on my makeup.</li>
            <li>All Natural Acne Spot Treatment &amp;#x2605; Blemishes Gone or Your Money Back!]]    </li>
            <li>I am waiting to see if they will actually take legitimate action to recover their fraudulent debt.</li>
            <li>Use Google: Guthy Renker scam, Proactiv scam, Bare Minerals scam.</li>
            <li>I am an 18 year old male.</li>
            <li>And not only is my acne completely gone</li>
            <li>In fact, for most I would say it is ineffective or makes things worse.</li>
            <li>it was the worse thing I could have put into my body, Accutane was taken off the market and linked to too many illnesses and permanent problems.</li>
            <li>found proactive to really help my acne, (95% gone), and the only side effect I had was really dry skin.</li>
            <li>And if you have trouble with irritation don&#x27;t give up right away.</li>
            <li>she was basically a hot mess with hormonal acne.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t use Proactive, my skin is naturally very oily and extremely prone to acne.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are other products out there that are less expensive with 2.5% benzoyl peroxide, but you can run into a problem with mixing products - the varied ingredients in the different products can cause more irritation and allergic reactions (learned through experience).  </li>
            <li>But, I didn&#x27;t feel too bad, becuase even though it was the old formula it was a good deal.</li>
            <li>When I only purchased three kits from them, their detailed invoice seems to have a lot of superfluous and purposefully confusing detail to it.  </li>
            <li>I am an African American and I bought this product to clear my pimples...</li>
            <li>The only things I&#x27;ve ever done that truly helped my skin clear up was eliminating milk from my diet, and starting to eat healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the everyday person I know eating healthy 100% of the time is financially impossible, but eating some or most of the time isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>it is the real product and is much better to order from amazon then from them directly since it is almost impossible to cancel your account</li>
            <li>think Proactiv the product deserves a three-star rating since it really is just an average product.  </li>
            <li>Buying via amazon is a great solution to the frustrating website and poor customer service that is received if u buy direct from the proactive website.</li>
            <li>In the last few weeks, however, I&#x27;ve been experiencing some mild to moderate break-outs on my upper back, neck, and at the corners of my mouth and in front of my ears on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cleanser is very watered down.</li>
            <li>Also, for the daughter it did work for to some degree, the results weren&#x27;t really any different than what she got from other products that we purchased for a fraction of the cost at the local grocery store.  </li>
            <li>Was the real thing, only down point is that its costing twice what you would pay if you ordered it off the tv</li>
            <li>So, free shipping, saving lots of money, and the expiration date is at least a year!</li>
            <li>understand that Proactiv typically works very well for people with oily skin, and I recognize now I should not have used the product even daily with my non-oily skin.</li>
            <li>think it is just as good as the newer products offered by Proactiv, plus, it is less expensive</li>
            <li>After dealing with adult acne that could only be a plague sent down by vindictive demi-gods, using various OTC treatments and prescription antibiotics, only to have the epic eruptions return, I tried the &amp;#34;As Seen of TV&amp;#34; ProActive.</li>

            <li> This product is great for fighting acne Us it on a regular basis for the best results ...</li>
            <li> no point did I honestly feel like it improved or healed my acne.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price is good for an acne product that will bring results, just make sure that your skin does will with benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li> This product appears to be controversially effective.</li>
            <li> prefer the Mario Badescu moisturizer over the Proactiv one but with summer coming the Proactiv one will be good since it is more lightweight.&lt;br</li>
            <li> kind of thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> EFFECTIVE.</li>
            <li> It is my own fault,</li>
            <li> Right now I&#x27;m using it once a day with very good results.</li>
            <li> This new formula is awesome.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and I am so extremely happy to be comfortable in my skin again.  </li>
            <li> Great value and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping great product good condition</li>
            <li> Not that impressed, didn&#x27;t clear up my skin</li>
            <li> it seems to me that a product designed by \\&quot;two doctors\\&quot; should have some hypoallergenic qualities to it better than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proceed at your own risk....</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t think that the product description says that it&#x27;s included), so I&#x27;m pretty happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I experienced this myself when I first started to use it.</li>
            <li> Do read the fine print!  </li>
            <li> it is easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li> this price here is most competitive.  </li>
            <li> I order these for my wife and teen and the 3pc kit works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> It is priced better than the TV add.</li>
            <li> I tried already to many things and even the doctors....  </li>
            <li> She started using it twice a day as recommended and is now able to get away with once a day.  </li>
            <li> Now her face is notably clearer.  </li>
            <li> I am going to continue ordering from this seller and using Proactiv!! :)</li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> My skin looks much better and must have for teenagers with acne issue.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Okay, so, I just want to start this off by saying that if you started any skin care regime - it will work.</li>
            <li> You can get better skin care packages for a better price.</li>
            <li> I will be buying again for sure.</li>
            <li> Has to be used regularly for best results.  </li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> and then if I need more moisture I might use Vanishing Cream over a layer of skin food.  </li>
            <li> This controls my acne better than anything.  </li>
            <li> but for now I&#x27;m okay with having to use it.  </li>
            <li> Proactiv is ok.  </li>
            <li> Better to buy through Amazon, that way you&#x27;re in control of when product arrives.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Okay.  </li>
            <li> I started to break out more and more, and the smell bothered me.</li>
            <li> I then tried this marykay product and it was so much better</li>
            <li> They just gave me BS and kept trying to sell more of there product; in the end I just gave up.</li>
            <li> I know I gotta wait a bit more</li>
            <li> his product should not use it daily, but its great for balancing skin that takes abuse from sweaty workouts!</li>
            <li> Purchased for my son and he is pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> BUT..I&#x27;ve used this for 4 months and it did more breaking out my skin then fixing it.</li>
            <li> (they smell better, too).  </li>
            <li> They love it.</li>
            <li> This works much better for me.</li>
            <li> Paid more than if I would have just ordered it from the commercials.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Thankfully my makeup covers most of it up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m checking out the Proactiv scar treatment to see if that will help banish any hint of my cystic acne nightmare :)</li>
            <li> Bought this for my aunt, i noticed that her breakout is getting better.</li>
            <li> The Top Rated Acne Treatment Pill.</li>
            <li> I love the product.  </li>
            <li> Need I say More.</li>
            <li> &quot; Winner of The Voice, my lovely wife uses the product so what&#x27;s there not to like about it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this in hopes that the &amp;#34;New Formula&amp;#34; would work better than the &amp;#34;Old Formula&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I love that this product is offered on Amazon because dealing with ProActiv&#x27;s monthly plan is horrendous.</li>
            <li> Once you stop using, you break out more.</li>
            <li> Same great product!</li>
            <li> Great product at reasonable price.</li>
            <li> sure</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off ordering off the Proactiv website.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes they have better deals and a lot more</li>
            <li> So glad we did not order it from the website as we would have continued to recieve charges on our charge card.</li>
            <li> but bottle are more like sample sizes  . .</li>
            <li> nice product, fast shipping and good deal</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> love this product.</li>
            <li> just the fact that she is doing something about her acne makes her feel better than just waiting it out for it do magically disappear.</li>
            <li> For one, I greatly dislike how much this bleaches items.  </li>
            <li> but I found that I was using much more of one of the step bottles over others.  </li>
            <li> My skin is getting better now.</li>
            <li> and I am completely satisfied with the results I started noticing the difference within the 1st week I recommend.</li>
            <li> I was warned by many reviews but didn&#x27;t listen because I wanted the cheaper price.</li>
            <li> He breaks out more with it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have skin issues, but I still like using it since it makes your skin look great.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had acne for 3 years with no hope remaining :)</li>
            <li> the cleanser and lotion are ok</li>
            <li> My acne is much better since I stopped using cleansers.</li>
            <li> you for contacting Guthy|Renker through the Better Business Bureau.</li>
            <li> We received your inquiry and sincerely apologize for any miscommunication.</li>
            <li> When I myself was able to afford Proactiv I tried it</li>
            <li> more so now during my period.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff...</li>
            <li> Her skin has never looked more lovely.  </li>
            <li> I love the proactive system.</li>
            <li> If I find a great deal on whole 3pc kit, I will opt for the kit.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks better when I use this.</li>
            <li> For me, and many others, it causes cystic acne.  </li>
            <li> , my face started to look better.  </li>
            <li> it seems to me that a product designed by \\&quot;two doctors\\&quot; should have some hypoallergenic qualities to it better than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proceed</li>
            <li> This is like liquid gold but better because it removes acne.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> I am lost without this stuff and have gotten the auto ship on Proactiv&#x27;s website that&#x27;s how much I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It works identically to Proactiv (same results for me anyway) and the best part?  </li>
            <li> The stuff in it discolored so many shirts, could you imagine what it&#x27;s doing to your face?</li>
            <li> I would never recommend this to anyone, there is much better stuff out there.</li>
            <li> Trying to get a good description from him is not easy - LOL!  </li>
            <li> this product really works!!!!</li>
            <li> It is high quality product, and the price and quality ratio contained in the product is great.</li>
            <li> Face was very clean .We got what we wanted</li>
            <li> But my skin was pretty good</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize the advertisements for this product line are convincing, but honesty you&#x27;d be better off with juice beauty (makes your skin softer than you can imagine), or even just Purpose, which is available at the drug store and can be used as many times a day as you want.</li>
            <li> You must have a new boyfriend.&amp;#34; To I honestly replied, &amp;#34;no, I&#x27;ve been using Proactiv.&amp;#34; LoL cheese, I know, but true.</li>
            <li> I thought Pro Activ would clear it up great.  </li>
            <li> acne free claims to be better</li>
            <li> And, for the first time there is a cream moisturizer, which is my favorite product--smooth, creamy, and effective (does not cause breakouts).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy that I ordered this acne kit for my 15yr old daughter.</li>
            <li> got my delivery early which was a great I was getting it for a gift.</li>
            <li> The old had my face looking great again in two weeks.</li>
            <li> far 3 days been seeing great results</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just so happy that I did not waste my money and just get on</li>
            <li> : it&#x27;s very strong since it cleans out your pores and as a woman you cannot get pregnant for 1 year.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s excellent when battling acne problems and/or other skin issues.</li>
            <li> I have cabinets full of products!</li>
            <li> may work for very mild acne.</li>
            <li> and I saw results very quickly.  </li>
            <li> but mostly let me tell you nothing in the stores or proactive will clean you acne...</li>
            <li> I tried them, the combo of the acne fighting ingredients proved too strong for my skin.</li>
            <li> I guess this was just too strong for my skin.</li>
            <li> The Proactiv Solution 3pc has eliminated my acne and has tamed it down a great deal!</li>
            <li> my homework read all the fine print before ordering and did not see anywhere in the fine print you are signing up for auto delivery.</li>
            <li> however that I never read the fine print to realize that they auto-snip and auto-charge your card after you pay for the trial.  </li>
            <li> Proactive is my favorite face cleaner, its quick and works like a charm</li>
            <li> He is quick to ask for more when he is running out.</li>
            <li> Did the old formula have a pleasant smell?</li>
            <li> The Acne Prevention Place responded quickly and shipped the product at a better price than anyone else seems to - no complaints from me.  </li>
            <li> When I started using it, my face was one huge fine rash.</li>
            <li> really well makes my skin glow and nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she has gone through one round of it and is extremely impressed with the results.  </li>
            <li> nothing fabulous.  </li>
            <li> advanced blemish treatment contains 6% benzoyl peroxide and they charge $10.50 for 0.33 ounce.  </li>
            <li> If your skin does do well with benzoyl peroxide, though, I would reccomend this product because it does a fantastic job</li>
            <li> My daughter used this product several years ago and it worked great for quite a while but then seemed to stop working</li>
            <li> The day after I received the detailed invoice, I received another shaming letter in the mail from Proactiv Solutions saying that because I never contacted them regarding my account, they&#x27;ll never do business with me again and any request made for their product will be denied.  </li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s more than worth a try.</li>
            <li> B00LFT0CFI TreeActiv+ Tea Tree Oil Acne Solution for Advanced Acne Treatment &amp;#x2605;</li>
            <li> I had cheap parents who never would invest money in this product for me</li>
            <li> I have searched everywhere for a cheap way to battle acne, and this is it.</li>
            <li> and they gave me five thing free</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t ever be free of dealing with acne but with Proactiv, I won&#x27;t dread looking at myself in the mirror.</li>
            <li> but so far so good.</li>
            <li> This stuff worked pretty good for the first 2 months of using it, then it just stopped working</li>
            <li> A couple actually did more damage than they did good.</li>
            <li> Looks good so far and</li>
            <li> My current routine which keeps my skin looking good and mostly clear.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was delighted to see this and even more delighted to see that the ingredients are just about identical, except for one tiny (most likely insignificant) ingredient that the Target brand has that Proactiv does not.  </li>
            <li> These things are so easy to find if you just give it a google or even a search on amazon and most of the time, it&#x27;s pretty darn cheap</li>
            <li> This is a professional formula &amp; I saw great results right away.  </li>
            <li> and she feels satisfied she made the right choice.</li>
            <li> now i can buy it when i need it and its much cheeper than buying from the mall!!!</li>
            <li> we received your product and after using the product for a couple of days has been very satisfied &amp; happy about the condition of her facial skin and how smooth &amp; soft her skin is</li>
            <li> What a wonderful price for a product that usually costs an arm and a leg.  </li>
            <li> The plus is to rich and broke me out all over again.</li>
            <li> but this new one is amazing skin cleared within weeks.</li>
            <li> so it just gives me a really clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I think the plus side is helped by the fact that there is a 3 product \\&quot;system\\&quot; that works together to help acne - cleanser, toner, treatment - so that you are cleaning your face and then putting product on a clean face that treats the acne.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There are much better products available at a much lower cost.</li>
            <li> but surely I can see the positive result using this kit.</li>
            <li> The good part of Proactiv is that it was formulated to work together, so if you don&#x27;t have a reaction to the product when you first use it, you know you can safely use the entire system without adverse effects.  </li>
            <li> Nice stuff-working well for my 14-yr old!</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t have the skin of a 13 year old any more!</li>
            <li> this product is wonderful, I got it for my granddaughter and her face is amazingly clearer after only a week and a half</li>
            <li> I purchased a special one time offer of Proactiv for $29.95 online.</li>
            <li> Specially because it is at my door step when I &#x27;need&#x27; it and &#x27;want it.&#x27;</li>
            <li> If you are just here for the reviews before you decide to order the infomoercial special DON&#x27;T. All I feel like saying about Proactiv</li>
            <li> that right because they scammed 40 dollars from me .2 stars!</li>
            <li> will suggest that you find out what is triggering your flare-ups because no product will be 100% successful if your skin is sensitive to certain types of foods.  </li>
            <li> But True, Folks .</li>
            <li> My wife is also better but the result is not so fast as mine.  </li>
            <li> I used Proactiv throughout my teen years and it worked fairly well</li>
            <li> Using the monthly plan doesn&#x27;t really work for us, I like being able to go on Amazon and just order what we need.</li>
            <li> Then about 6 months ago I decided to give it a real shot and use it for more than just a couple uses.  </li>
            <li> It is full of chemicals, and after years of using chemical acne wash</li>
            <li> and I said to myself this couldn&#x27;t be true...</li>
            <li> It really clears my face up :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hoping this review will help others who are debating trying Proactiv: here I share my experience with the products and company.&lt;br /&gt;I have fair, oily skin and moderate acne, not cystic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried just using the cream with different face washes and it doesnt work as good.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s been good to my skin.</li>
            <li> , the milk thing isn&#x27;t true in everyone, so don&#x27;t take it to heart.  </li>
            <li> So obviously, for whatever reason, my skin dramatically reacts to the Proactive system and the acne clears up noticably quickly with minimalto no drying or peeling if you use a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> The area around my mouth has been flaky for weeks, so I&#x27;ve been using cocoa butter, which seems to help tremendously.</li>
            <li> I use Bee Yummy skin food (which helped tremendously with the dryness and peeling)</li>
            <li> If I use Proactive, the medicine somehow keeps the acne to a minimum and heals it up quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have switched and tried cheaper more accesible (local drugstores) answers to my acne and not found anything that works better.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and didn&#x27;t have to sign up fir auto refills.  </li>
            <li> and the Shipper was quick.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, but item sent was not what was listed.</li>
            <li> And to be honest I stopped using it and really didn&#x27;t even notice much of a difference.    </li>
            <li> I had used Proactiv as a teenager (when I *thought* I had acne), and I remembered how quickly I got results, so I tried it again about 6 months ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But after the initial couple of weeks to month of breaking out, my skin clears up and looks great-not perfect, as I will occasionally still get a zit or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On top of that if you have any issues, you do not have any customer service that is normally provided by proactiv.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d heard nothing but great success stories from other people who had used it, so</li>
            <li> I recommend engaging the BBB at the first sign of trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The new version is 10 times better.</li>
            <li> I have tried Proactiv many times and when the new formula came out</li>
            <li> This new formula of Proactiv made my face break out even more.</li>
            <li> , I like the new version better.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping,  got it exactly when I was supposed to,  authentic product,  just like the practive i remember,</li>
            <li> This has worked pretty good for my teenage son.</li>
            <li> I just received my first package from proactive!</li>
            <li> Proactive product works very well!!</li>
            <li> For me it took about 3 months for it to work effectively and now that it has I have WAY less breakouts and my skin look healthy.</li>
            <li> I then tried Acne Free Severe, and to my surprise it didn&#x27;t help that much.  </li>
            <li> The sizes are worth the money</li>
            <li> Far better than proactiv plus</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s worth spending the money on .</li>
            <li> it is so worth it...</li>
            <li> I will be giving this product to my cousin because she has success with benzoyl peroxide products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Product clears the skin, just like the infomercials suggest, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> The only problem we have ever run into is that it is so popular that sometimes it is unavailable</li>
            <li> The results my family got just weren&#x27;t worth the price or the frustration.</li>
            <li> People constantly comment on how nice my skin looks when I use Proactive.</li>
            <li> Def worth it</li>
            <li> I thought I was going to get 3 months worth of this product.  </li>
            <li> The price is worth it.</li>
            <li> I think the product is worth it</li>
            <li> Currently, I do not use soap or cleansers of any kind on any skin.</li>
            <li> I take a warm shower and gently dry off with a clean towel.</li>
            <li> well worth the price.</li>
            <li> 100% worth it.</li>
            <li> Try altering your diet and see what theresults are, you may be more surprised than you&#x27;d think.</li>
            <li> at your own risk....was a personal reaction but....</li>
            <li> If you need Proactiv, and it really is a good product, buy it from one of the resellers here on Amazon, and not straight from the Proactiv website.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting a miracle product and thus didn&#x27;t deliver.it comes with a scrub,a toner,and a moisturizer.i may just need to let this stop.i am very overweight and have a lot of other things going on but at least I tried.the best thing would be to work on being happy.proactive is just as good as a $1 soap.dont</li>
            <li> It worked fine with my son , the secound time he used it , it already started the job and in one week his face was clean and clear , i would recomend it for everybody</li>
            <li> I originally used this product straight from Proactiv</li>
            <li> I used it right</li>
            <li> But for some reason Proactiv gets it right</li>
            <li> Would go with them again; received all the right products per description; still using the proactiv</li>
            <li> Just trust us to do the right thing\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I bought proactive for them and right away</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know if I just caught it right on time,</li>
            <li> You order it when you want it, and the price is right.</li>
            <li> Luv it, had no issue was delivered right on time.  </li>
            <li> After 3 days my forehead was much better,after 1 week my forehead was clean</li>
            <li> my skin felt comfortable and normal.</li>
            <li> not sure it worked as great as all the infomercials say it did.  </li>
            <li> I used this a long time ago when I was in college and liked it</li>
            <li> The product is actually for my girlfriend who was having some issues with her face and from the results am seeing on her face its doing a good job so far</li>
            <li> To help you complete your purchase, we&#x27;ve made it easy ....</li>
            <li> At night I splash a bit of warm water on my face and gently dry with a high-quality towel.</li>
            <li> were they will put you on a monthly contract unless you are very, very, very careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my wife loves it very much.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t go through this very fast.</li>
            <li> The first time it worked pretty well</li>
            <li> I like being able to purchase what I need instead of an entire kit at one time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real thing!</li>
            <li> I tried just about every product out there that you can buy in the drugstores (including all of the different 3 step systems that claim to be better than Proactiv) and nothing worked.  </li>
            <li> Proactiv worked within the first three days of use.</li>
            <li> The only thing I recommend is stay on top of using product thats</li>
            <li> It makes my skin clear, smooth, and toned.  </li>
            <li> first week the product brought everything up to the surface</li>
            <li> He totally bleached out two favorite shirts.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t take the word of someone who has JUST tried a skin care routine for the first time and picked Proactiv.</li>
            <li> They actually cause more blemishes.  </li>
            <li> switched to a basic skin care routine which is working better.</li>
            <li> the end they will fight you by telling you that you will have to pay the first three months,</li>
            <li> The first kit came as pictured, with instructions.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I like Proactiv Plus better; also, their customer service has improved quite a bit.  </li>
            <li> However, I do not use exactly as directed.</li>
            <li> She tried everything from counter top face cream, topical cream from doctor and homemade acv toner,raw honey etc...</li>
            <li> Also feels so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Our whole family has found success with it, not just the teenagers.</li>
            <li> Almost exactly what you get in the store.</li>
            <li> At first it cleared up my face.  </li>
            <li> First off, I didn&#x27;t order Proactiv through this seller, but from the company website.</li>
            <li> At first, it cleared up my skin within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> exactly what happened.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so the toner runs out first then</li>
            <li> This product absolutely without a doubt DOES NOT WORK!</li>
            <li> but I always went back to it since it&#x27;s helped my skin the most.</li>
            <li> It has given me a better complexion and with this three piece set it can last me over 2 months.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy proactiv at first.</li>
            <li> or when I notice my face is starting to break out(essentially to exfoliate), and the repairing lotion as more of a \\&quot;zit-zapper\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This happens when starting most acne products, in my experience.</li>
            <li> She began using it and the results were almost immediate and very pleasing to her!</li>
            <li> Would pay twice as much for it!</li>
            <li> I have been exploring so many different ways to get rid of my acne and blemishes, and I keep seeing this stuff on TV</li>
            <li> Came with exactly the contents specified.</li>
            <li> Just like with exercising, where looking better starts in the kitchen, same thing here.  </li>
            <li> It may seem at first that this product works</li>
            <li> , as a nurse, I was most concerned about the \\&quot;side effects\\&quot; (i.e., the brown spots) and what happened to my daughter several months into the program.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Pretty sure people have a basic understanding of this product since it has been featured on the television and online.</li>
            <li> - This is the first time this has happened to me as I&#x27;ve been buying proactiv on Amazon for years...</li>
            <li> Just a fair warning before you waste any money.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive, it breaks out when the weather changes, I&#x27;m under stress, PMSing, or there&#x27;s a full moon (kidding...).</li>
            <li> Seriously, everyone else I know had great results, I just feel compelled to tell my experience.  </li>
            <li> I tried Oxy, Clearasil, Clean &amp; Clear, Murad, Proactiv, everything.  </li>
            <li> I love using products by Lush, or Clinique, or natural remedies like oil-cleansing and so on, but still the acne flared up everywhere on my face.  </li>
            <li> I then experimented wtih different lush regimes and while I liked these products, the acne kept coming, relentlessly.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and would have done better with the sensitive formula.</li>
            <li> I still used it because it works fine, but that&#x27;s kind of ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Other product leave my face feeling both sticky and dry; this is by far the best acne line I have ever tried!</li>
            <li> I have been buying this product for my mother which has a crazy acne break out once in a while, great way of controlling it with this product, just make sure you use it very often as a break out might happen after some days of no usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will be the first to tell you they didn&#x27;t all work very well for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it and using it, I still have pretty much every pimple I had to start.</li>
            <li> Then the toner is actually mainly glycolic acid which actually helps exfoliate your skin even more.</li>
            <li> it made my skin so dry and itchy, got more wrinkles from using it.</li>
            <li> you suffer from super sensitive skin, do NOT use this product.</li>
            <li> I do notice that after about a year of using it, it becomes less effective.</li>
            <li> but I have gotten lots of pimple at once in certain areas of my face.</li>
            <li> This company is pure evil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is not the NEW FORMULA!!  </li>
            <li> She felt burning on her face first use,and then developed what looked like red burns on her face,  most noticeable on her chin and forehead.</li>
            <li> the product is great and works well, the only thing is that on the STEP 1 bottle, the writing fell/washed off which was odd.</li>
            <li> I did have high hopes for this product since I was suffering from acne and willing to try anything</li>
            <li> but they run the same scam many other companies are running by allowing you to sign up easily online for their subscription product but making you call in to cancel it which &#x27;may or may not&#x27; go through their system since its all done over the phone</li>
            <li> It came in just a few days and it is the same great Proactiv product I have been using before.  </li>
            <li> am ordering it again, because the occasional use makes a huge difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance.  </li>
            <li> but after about 6 months of use I saw real progress and now 2 years later my face is as smooth a a babies butt.</li>
            <li> really matters is the percentage of Benzoyl Peroxide, I believe the FDA caps it at 15% for over the counter medication.</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> It also was shipped very promptly.</li>
            <li> She was really insulted that I bought it for her though</li>
            <li> Really unethical.</li>
            <li> Then the lotion is really just a benzoyl peroxide moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and it is working really well.</li>
            <li> We stopped ordering it for a while and we saw how much difference it makes.</li>
            <li> really do think instead of helping my acne</li>
            <li> I gave it a five star rating because it really worked.  </li>
            <li> Proactive has worked really well for me</li>
            <li> All the acne and the damage started to heal up fast</li>
            <li> This product really works.  </li>
            <li> So besides costing me hundreds of dollars, this product didn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> but i ain&#x27;t see much change yet.</li>
            <li> it could VERY well just be my skin</li>
            <li> have very oily skin.</li>
            <li> and it REALLY helped with the dryness.</li>
            <li> It took about 2weeks to see it&#x27;s really working</li>
            <li> I took my son to a dermatologist and 3 months later he was acne free.</li>
            <li> Proactiv Solution works very well.  </li>
            <li> Better packaging is needed - a box rather that an envelope which is easily crushed.</li>
            <li> cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;Not real, the beads are nonexistent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not seem like the real product to me...or has been stored for years in someone&#x27;s basement.</li>
            <li> The ads are very misleading</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> and I really have to say it&#x27;s because of Proactiv.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Using this, in combination with Aveeno&#x27;s calming wash and lotion works really well for</li>
            <li> Bf bought this and it really does work</li>
            <li> fast shipping and twice as much product for the price.</li>
            <li> This really does work.</li>
            <li> It is pricey, but not having damaged skin as an adult is well worth the cost now.</li>
            <li> have tried the following within the last 2 years but ended up going back to Proactiv because it just works best for me&lt;br /&gt;Dermologica, Acnefree, Mario Badescu (regular line and acne</li>
            <li> My skin is very clear.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was very thorough in describing all of my dealings with Guthy Renker to the BBB.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and breakout</li>
            <li> My boyfriend had success with Proactiv when he was young with his cystic acne, so I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> After some research on the Proactiv website I concluded that I had used too much of the product.</li>
            <li> My skin still has a breakout here and there but is much improved.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s gentle on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was much needed</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> , I broke out a whole lot.</li>
            <li> I really recommend.</li>
            <li> nothing else has worked but proactiv really does i recommend this to any one with any type of acne troubles</li>
            <li> costly but worth it, the results are always clearly seen.</li>
            <li> It has really worked.</li>
            <li> This system really works for my face, i really like the tones</li>
            <li> I have always struggled with acne and nothing has ever really worked.</li>
            <li> You can enjoy the weekends out at your favorite restaurants, or the occasional movie night with pizza, just don&#x27;t make it an every other day</li>
            <li> The 3 step worked right away for me, within a couple weeks my skin started getting clear and brighter.  </li>
            <li> While I was using it, I didn&#x27;t see any significant difference, but when I quit it, my acne came back much worse.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> ( I thought it was going to be some type of micro, new and improved type, but it actually was the original, not the biggest deal to me though), thanks!</li>
            <li> The product worked OK for one of my daughters and didn&#x27;t work at all for the other one.  </li>
            <li> Delivery OK, shapes on the other hand the efficiency</li>
            <li> If you buy a sample of proactive you will commit yourself to endless charges to your credit card, this is the the most aggravating company on earth to do business with.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Proactiv just works for me, better than any other product I have tried.</li>
            <li> Its working much better than other brands he has tried.  </li>
            <li> I was really excited when i got this product, but when i went to go use it, my face started to burn, and it got really red, and itchy.</li>
            <li> I even tried all natural remedies which surprisingly worked, but only for so long.  </li>
            <li> and I was still getting these huge zits here and there, which was different from my normal breakouts.</li>
            <li> My face never felt truly CLEAN after using the wash, felt oily and gross.  </li>
            <li> I think I paid $1.29 for it, and in fact, it is a little more effective for me, than the much more expensive</li>
            <li> I would recommend this kit to most anyone except those with extremely sensitive or dry skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;delived fast, and I use but need to buy more in less time</li>
            <li> When I first started using it, I thought my skin was going to clear up.</li>
            <li> We had purchased directly through Proactive the first time.  </li>
            <li> In fact she bought another already so thumbs up to proactive for doing such a fine job so far.</li>
            <li> No gimmicks of having to pay every 30 days for a new shipment!</li>
            <li> After taking a break from it for a while, i came back and ordered it, first thing i noticed is that the smell is different now, and as i expected, it&#x27;s not as good as it was before.</li>
            <li> The old formula Proactiv was sent not the new formula, so now I have a SUPER over priced set of the old formula Proactiv.</li>
            <li> this particular page seems to have.  </li>
            <li> I do not recommend it as not only did it make my skin more red</li>
            <li> The BP is milder and does not bleach hair and fabric like the older formula.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to wash your hands thoroughly after applying it to your face and use only white towels, washcloths and pillowcases!  </li>
            <li> And I did get the older formula.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product and be sure to check for expiration dates, especially for Step 1.</li>
            <li> And the only reason I didn&#x27;t Is I&#x27;m handicap, so pretty much I feel I was screwed out of my money!</li>
            <li> The formula is kind of strong and at first, like I said it dried my skin and stung a little if I got it near my eyes.</li>
            <li> My daughter tried this product with high hopes.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My junior high age daughter loves this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to all people with acne symptoms.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive AND extremely oily skin, which is a combo that a lot of dermatologists don&#x27;t fully understand, and most medications WAY overdry my skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have extremely sensitive skin, but certain things make me break out.</li>
            <li> It is the actual Proactive product, not fake!</li>
            <li> My skin was starting to develop more fine lines at a quicker pace and it looked blotchy and dull.</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey, but this distributor has made it more affordable.</li>
            <li> it lasts me a little more than two months</li>
            <li> This product works really well in helping to clear up acne.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have a huge problem with acne (just occasional bumps here and there), but I was hoping to use this product to avoid any further pimples around my forehead and chin area.</li>
            <li> WORKS  ON MY ADULT NEPHEW VERY WELL..</li>
            <li> Works very well for clear skin.</li>
            <li> I think my skin is not sensitive at all since I&#x27;ve tried so many different things</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure he has to use it everyday or they will return</li>
            <li> It cleared my skin for the most part, but at that time I was also using the Green Tea Moisturizer and didn&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li> I and looked at this in vending machines at malls and it was normal size bottles</li>
            <li> To me Proactiv is worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> so it must be normal.</li>
            <li> After a few more months of using it I gave up and started using something else.</li>
            <li> I tried Mary Kay Time wise and it just made it worse.</li>
            <li> He is in high school and feels a low self esteem from his complexsion, but is headed in the right direction using Proactive Solution kit I bought for him.</li>
            <li> Antibiotics have worked really well in the past but recently have become less effective, plus I don&#x27;t like being on them since bacteria can become more resistant to it.</li>
            <li> I have tried using some of the generic versions and other products, in a similar fashion, but have not had good results.</li>
            <li> My forehead cleared right up, but I now have acne scars on my cheeks and several blemishes that just won&#x27;t go away.  </li>
            <li> My triggers were excess salt, too many refined carbs and later discovered I was allergic to dark chocolate and certain dairy</li>
            <li> Bought it at mall for my teenage son, and so far seems about as good as anything else he has used, no better,</li>
            <li> However; i got the package today and it has stated for 3 days that it was in california close to where I live</li>
            <li> I am now 24 and decided to give the Proactiv new formula a try.  </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t gotten any new blemishes since I&#x27;ve started using it.  </li>
            <li> The nest time I saw him was New Years Eve</li>
            <li> Guess what today a new charge hit my bank, so I called them and asked that they cancel my subscription (which I did not agree to anyway)</li>
            <li> I have the new formula, which is Proactiv</li>
            <li> He looks &amp; feels like a new person.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;m in my 30s and still get breakouts, i wanted to try it again since there was apparently a new, gentler formula.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re thinking that you&#x27;re buying the new micro-cystal formula, but you&#x27;re not.  </li>
            <li> Proactive has changed their product to a new formula which was ineffective with my skin type.</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t wait to see what the new package will deliver in reality.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After I moved, a package was forwarded by the Post Office to my new address.</li>
            <li> When a new zit comes up you put this product on it</li>
            <li> but I have to wonder if it isn&#x27;t \\&quot;skin cell confusion\\&quot; with the use of a new product.</li>
            <li> Description said NEW Formula.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> , my skin feels like new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products and keep coming back to this, it really works and keeps my face clear, what&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> The only complain I have is that it dries out your skin tremendously, but besides that it really got rid of my blackheads on my back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard this works much better for people with very oily or at least non-sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I guess I need to be more careful in the future.</li>
            <li> I do have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It keeps her skin clear if she remembers to use it!  </li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t stay clear without it!</li>
            <li> Now I have a clear skin!</li>
            <li> I do not get paid for this review and usually I do not like to write,but it was so impressing that I wanted to share it.</li>
            <li> I also use the refining mask 3 times per week and it makes my skin extremely soft!</li>
            <li> I am 38 years old - I will never stop using it!</li>
            <li> Clean/new (just the solutions, no documentation, exactly as posted, expiry at end of next year).</li>
            <li> The ingredients were exactly the same!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very non-greasy formula, and seems to clear up breakouts extra fast.</li>
            <li> I think I am going to go to an all natural product!</li>
            <li> Her face remained swollen and red for about 3 days then continued to have red blotches for many days after that, including swollen, red eyelids that looked like she had not slept for days.</li>
            <li> ProActiv is an ok product and seems to work as well as the other acne prevention product we have tried, a 2% salicyclic acid topical treatment from Alba Botanica.  </li>
            <li> Ordered this at what seemed like a good price as the next round for my daughter when her current set rant out.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many different things,so i decided to give pro active a try.</li>
            <li> They charge even more for products with a standard concentration of active ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She states that it works great, thank you, size was a little small compared to bottles seen at the mall</li>
            <li> not much else to say, but to keep on top of actually using it: but it works like no other!</li>
            <li> and I have tried many things in the past to make it clear up, but nothing has worked.  </li>
            <li> But this took three tries over the phone to complete, it took over one billing cycle to see the full amount returned.</li>
            <li> I still have more then half the bottle left</li>
            <li> The price is only relatively more expensive, but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> This system really did not do much for me other than stopping new acne from forming.</li>
            <li> Clear my face up</li>
            <li> My skin is completely clear.</li>
            <li> It has also cleared up any blemish marks and my skin is perfectly clear.</li>
            <li> , he uses it a couple times a week and his face stays clear.</li>
            <li> Will buy here again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to keep her face clear.</li>
            <li> and he was completely clear.  </li>
            <li> Accutane will clear your acne up 100% and you will not have an oily face</li>
            <li> Used as directed skin should clear and remain so.</li>
            <li> It took me about six months for my skin to get clear so,</li>
            <li> After 3 months of usage, his skin is completely clear.</li>
            <li> give it a week to turn around and another for them to clear up.</li>
            <li> It did take a month or so to 100% clear up -</li>
            <li> The Clearzine supplement prevents acne as well as working from the inside-out to quickly clear up skin.</li>
            <li> then my face stays clear.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve always wanted clear skin and not to have to put make-up on.</li>
            <li> Keeps it clear all the time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just that once you see how clear your skin can look, you just cringe when you skip the routine and see how your skin used to look.</li>
            <li> normal skin care routine wasn&#x27;t helping the these frequent break-outs (generally surface-level blemishes with some cystic).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 24 years old and my acne is just now starting to really subside.  </li>
            <li> When I got poractive  m y face was so clear like it take2weeks to create 123 poractive thing</li>
            <li> Word of advice, don&#x27;t get it near your eyes because the cleanser does sting.  </li>
            <li> I only really like the face wash.</li>
            <li> However, I stopped using it when I was in my early 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li> and I started to experience frequent breakouts.  </li>
            <li> but my skin has cleared up almost completely</li>
            <li> I used to purchase directly from the website but they always took almost two weeks to send my shipments.</li>
            <li> Blotting paper helps, but you can only do that so much in a day.  </li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s face has cleared up considerably after 3 weeks use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 16 year old grandson.  </li>
            <li> I am a 40 year old woman that never had acne growing up.  </li>
            <li> so I tried using natural products for a while just to see what would happen</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 14 year old son and he has used it as directed.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend  ProActiv to people with sensitive skin and to discontinue if you feel burning or develop redness.</li>
            <li> So if you don&#x27;t want to lose a ton of money and you want a product that works, I would stay far away from this one.</li>
            <li> I have no idea if the product is expired, the old formula, etc.</li>
            <li> but when it is unavailable through it is also unavailable through directly.</li>
            <li> But I get it for my 18 year old son and my 20 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> really can&#x27;t tell if the company is unscrupulous or just grossly disorganized, but I would recommend buying something else.  </li>
            <li> I used this on my 10 year old who is involved in sports and has a forehead breakout problem .....</li>
            <li> Works well so far.</li>
            <li> After comparing the ingredients on my old bottle of Proactive and the &amp;#</li>
            <li> These will take almost a year to use up completely.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time.</li>
            <li> I struggle with adult acne and I lived in a humid climate at the time.</li>
            <li> Your skin needs balance and Proactiv is far from that.</li>
            <li> I will NEVER waste money on their products again.</li>
            <li> Proactive works great for me, and when the kiosk at the local mall closed, I was forced to go online for it.</li>
            <li> My only real problem is that when my package arrived, the toner was leaking.</li>
            <li> She is washing her face and using it daily and is a much kinder gentler preteen.</li>
            <li> When I received my shipment, I found out it was not the &amp;#34;New Formula&amp;#34;, it was the old formula.</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from acne darn near all my life I am now 30</li>
            <li> For me this product works its not harsh on my face</li>
            <li> This company is a complete scam.</li>
            <li> I occasionally have acne breakout, but it is much milder acne because I use Proactiv.  </li>
            <li> Received the old one.</li>
            <li> My daughter is going through her teenage acne phase and we wanted to find something simple but powerful that will help clear her skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 16 yr old.</li>
            <li> My 19 yr old refused to try it as she heard from friends</li>
            <li> As a person with hereditary acne I&#x27;ve tried damn near everything out there prescribed by dermatologists.</li>
            <li> and it destroyed the natural oil the skin has</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 31 years old</li>
            <li> This stuff works no matter how old you are.</li>
            <li> I recommend sticking with it for at least 2 months before you make a final judgment, that&#x27;s when my daughter started to notice nice results.  </li>
            <li> This shipped and, the only thing I can complain about is you do not get any of the free stuff that the regular site offers however; they put a very long shipment date</li>
            <li> My sister had amazing results, my daughter, not quite as dramatic.  </li>
            <li> But the odd thing about it is after a couple hours my skin is super oily.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my 13 yr old daughter who was experiencing major breakouts.  </li>
            <li> did try the new proactiv plus and went back to the old.</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t ready to give a long commitment</li>
            <li> had minor skin problems as a teenager, but I&#x27;ve really struggled with acne in my 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I thought maybe there was just an adjustment period, but I used the stuff for over two months and my face still isn&#x27;t back to normal.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews that said the earlier formula worked better, so that may be why my daughter didn&#x27;t have the same level of results, but there are also different types of acne, so some may take longer to treat.  </li>
            <li> It definitely clears out the patches of acne I used to get, but it does give me 2-3 large and very deep zits.  </li>
            <li> In total I paid nearly $100 for an order only a tablecloth spoon bigger than my first order that costed $29.95.</li>
            <li> To my astonishment I was charged $32.95 automatically the next month and sent an identical new supply.</li>
            <li> so I can get back to managing my acne though I am on the look for a new product.  </li>
            <li> I made sure to only search for and purchase proactiv&#x27;s &#x27;new formula&#x27; (as pictured), yet I received the old formula... Not exactly happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> Letting my face dry between each step really irritates my skin but doing me step immediately after another is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have moderate to severe acne, so it only works so much.  </li>
            <li> This product lives up to its reputation my teenage twins were starting to have a real problem with acne .</li>
            <li> Regular soap works just as well,and is much cheaper....or opt for the over the counter items such as Clearasil etc..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much acne and only get it occasionally</li>
            <li> I cannot use this product twice daily or even daily, but I found a way that really works for me.  </li>
            <li> Our records indicate that on December 21, 2011, your third Proactiv® shipment, a 60-Day 4 piece supply, was sent for a total of $57.75, which remained unpaid.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this for my 14 year old son and within a week, we have seen that his face is starting to clear up.  </li>
            <li> Ever several days my face got super dry and red.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for my daughter it wasn&#x27;t instant, but she did have good improvement over time.</li>
            <li> I ordered Proactiv and used the full three-step treatment twice a day for two days, and on the third day I awoke with red, very dry skin all over my face.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get swayed when you instantly break out, that happens at firt on your way to clear skin!</li>
            <li> I started using the Olay ProX and Aztec indian healing clay too and have seen a major improvement with my skin.</li>
            <li> Proactiv is actually a combination of these things and somehow it works much better than anything I have bought in the past.!  </li>
            <li> Proactiv is the only facial-cleaning product that completely clears-up my daughter&#x27;s acne, so she loves it!</li>
            <li> Any cleansing product will strip old skin and expose new, more vulnerable skin to the elements.</li>
            <li> Make sure you use a white towel and wear a white shirt, tank, or an old shirt due to them getting discolored due to some of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I may also only apply step 3 directly onto blemishes and/or small problem areas, because I think leaving the benzol peroxide on my non-oily skin may be a significant contributor to the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but when I consistently use Proactive my skin looks less red, my pores are smaller and my skin is always clear!!!</li>
            <li> The ONLY thing that keeps my daughter&#x27;s skin clear.</li>
            <li> Proactiv is definitely not for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I will go back to buying it directly from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> When I sighed up for a one month supply they automatically sigh you up for three month supply, so I was surprised when I got another package from them a month later.</li>
            <li> I tried Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Acne Gel Cleanser but that only worked for 2 months.</li>
            <li> I initially tried this because I had given up on clearing my adult acne.</li>
            <li> And, I have discovered that purchasing this product on amazon.com is cheaper than buying directly from the manufacturer, plus it alleviates the manufacturer&#x27;s auto-renewal, or my having to call and cancel until such time as my daughter needs me to re-order this for her.</li>
            <li> I used to wear dermablend just to cover them up, now I barely feather on my makeup.</li>
            <li> All Natural Acne Spot Treatment &amp;#x2605; Blemishes Gone or Your Money Back!]]    </li>
            <li> I am waiting to see if they will actually take legitimate action to recover their fraudulent debt.</li>
            <li> Use Google: Guthy Renker scam, Proactiv scam, Bare Minerals scam.</li>
            <li> I am an 18 year old male.</li>
            <li> And not only is my acne completely gone</li>
            <li> In fact, for most I would say it is ineffective or makes things worse.</li>
            <li> it was the worse thing I could have put into my body, Accutane was taken off the market and linked to too many illnesses and permanent problems.</li>
            <li> found proactive to really help my acne, (95% gone), and the only side effect I had was really dry skin.</li>
            <li> And if you have trouble with irritation don&#x27;t give up right away.</li>
            <li> she was basically a hot mess with hormonal acne.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use Proactive, my skin is naturally very oily and extremely prone to acne.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are other products out there that are less expensive with 2.5% benzoyl peroxide, but you can run into a problem with mixing products - the varied ingredients in the different products can cause more irritation and allergic reactions (learned through experience).  </li>
            <li> But, I didn&#x27;t feel too bad, becuase even though it was the old formula it was a good deal.</li>
            <li> When I only purchased three kits from them, their detailed invoice seems to have a lot of superfluous and purposefully confusing detail to it.  </li>
            <li> I am an African American and I bought this product to clear my pimples...</li>
            <li> The only things I&#x27;ve ever done that truly helped my skin clear up was eliminating milk from my diet, and starting to eat healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the everyday person I know eating healthy 100% of the time is financially impossible, but eating some or most of the time isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> it is the real product and is much better to order from amazon then from them directly since it is almost impossible to cancel your account</li>
            <li> think Proactiv the product deserves a three-star rating since it really is just an average product.  </li>
            <li> Buying via amazon is a great solution to the frustrating website and poor customer service that is received if u buy direct from the proactive website.</li>
            <li> In the last few weeks, however, I&#x27;ve been experiencing some mild to moderate break-outs on my upper back, neck, and at the corners of my mouth and in front of my ears on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cleanser is very watered down.</li>
            <li> Also, for the daughter it did work for to some degree, the results weren&#x27;t really any different than what she got from other products that we purchased for a fraction of the cost at the local grocery store.  </li>
            <li> Was the real thing, only down point is that its costing twice what you would pay if you ordered it off the tv</li>
            <li> So, free shipping, saving lots of money, and the expiration date is at least a year!</li>
            <li> understand that Proactiv typically works very well for people with oily skin, and I recognize now I should not have used the product even daily with my non-oily skin.</li>
            <li> think it is just as good as the newer products offered by Proactiv, plus, it is less expensive</li>
            <li> After dealing with adult acne that could only be a plague sent down by vindictive demi-gods, using various OTC treatments and prescription antibiotics, only to have the epic eruptions return, I tried the &amp;#34;As Seen of TV&amp;#34; ProActive.</li>
            <li> personally would recommend Rensa or the Body Shops facial exfoliators and any other sort of all natural (and not tested on animals of course)</li>
            <li> if I use other skin care products my skin still stays clear.  </li>
            <li> The price is a little high for this kit, but here on Amazon I compared to the Proactiv site and another site who also sell these products and</li>
            <li> I exercise a lot and eat a raw food and vegan diet, take supplements, I try to keep the stress levels under control and sleep well, and all this has helped a lot, but nothing ever really kept the acne away except Proactive.</li>
            <li> I have used the old version of pro active worked</li>
            <li> Occasionally I have minor breakouts, but nothing compared to before starting this kit.  </li>
            <li> Not much to say, we got what we ordered and expected and didn&#x27;t have to go through the normal channel (Manufacturer) where they send you supplies you don&#x27;t need based on a set schedule.</li>
            <li> I got the large set for one of the youths, and a small set that I nicked the lotion out of for me, and kept the rest as travel sizes for them.</li>
            <li> #1 will not last long</li>
            <li> , I wanted to try this for a long time but didn&#x27;t like the price, but I finally gave in</li>
            <li> This product started to clear up my acne after about a week and a half.</li>
            <li> I find that if I use Proactiv consistantly, every single day, don&#x27;t sleep in makeup, use only mineral makeup (I like Alima),</li>
            <li> Finally, when they did send me a accounting, it was pages and pages long and filled with all kinds of verbiage, making it quite difficult to read and understand.  </li>
            <li> but after trying various other products over the last year</li>
            <li> I decided to try Proactiv due to all the advertising and reviews, hoping it would cure my teenage nightmare that was following me into adulthood.  </li>
            <li> I was looking to clear up a little bit of acne,</li>
            <li> used it in the past as a young teen, and it seemed to work then.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> As long as i didnt over use</li>
            <li> what e-mail takes this long to be received?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know how this is possible, but after three days of use (only once a day as opposed to the twice a day directed), my entire face had dried out, EXCEPT for the pimple on my chin.</li>
            <li> As long as your kids do all the steps it works.</li>
            <li> Long time user.</li>
            <li> We just want to see if it works, not commit for so long.</li>
            <li> few people that I know said that the product was too drying, but my skin is naturally oily</li>
            <li> How long will this go on?  </li>
            <li> And as long as I do it once a day (but I try for twice)</li>
            <li> It was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> The only drag is it is rather time consuming and</li>
            <li> I think this is for minor acne.</li>
            <li> My acne got smaller and less red</li>
            <li> For two different sets, i&#x27;ve dropped one of the three different bottles and everytime, the little long piece of plastic that keeps the nozzle from clogging breaks off.  </li>
            <li> Works for one teen not as well for the other.</li>
            <li> My upper back and neck have cleared a little and are not dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, for those that don&#x27;t want to be a test bunny like I made myself, I found some other options that don&#x27;t hurt and actually work.</li>
            <li> However, after using for about a week to 2 weeks my skin becomes extremely dry.</li>
            <li> The toner and cream dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Made my skin extremely dry.  </li>
            <li> Yes, she had some dry skin for a couple weeks</li>
            <li> skin will get really dry and decrustation happens..</li>
            <li> I also have some dry spots.</li>
            <li> It says to do step me, let face dry, step, let toner dry, then step three.</li>
            <li> It did dry out my face in the beginning</li>
            <li> All it did was dry my face and the acne was still there.</li>
            <li> follow the routine and if my face gets dry</li>
            <li> it doesnt over dry my face</li>
            <li> , my face is extremely dry and flakey and the skin can even be peeled off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used proactiv in the past and it was too harsh for me and very drying...not anymore!  </li>
            <li> The active ingredient in Proactiv is benzoyl peroxide, the same ingredient in all acne treatments.  </li>
            <li> Aside from the negative reviews I decided to get this to treat my adult acne related to hormonal/menstrual cycles.</li>
            <li> If I stop this product, I get a few of the patches back but the deep impacted zits seem to disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> tried other products because I wondered \\&quot;maybe something else will work, perhaps it will be less expensive or not be as drying, or will be more natural.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Your Proactiv® account is now closed with no further balance due.</li>
            <li> Your account is closed with no further balance due.</li>
            <li> Though I haven&#x27;t used Proactiv in a few days, my face has completely cleared of acne, though the extreme dryness is persistent.</li>
            <li> Within a short time, it seems to cause dark, permanent spots to appear where a pimple has formed and attempted to heal.  </li>
            <li> Within a week of using Proactiv, we saw immediate results such as fading of dark marks, clearing of bumps, and an even tone of her complexion.</li>
            <li> It worked okay but was very expensive.</li>
            <li> Do not buy, terrible product that may cause strong allergies!!!</li>
            <li> the only down is if u stop using you may start to break out again.</li>
            <li> , I open this kit and they are tiny little bottles that look like motel shampoo bottles!</li>
            <li> Previously, it was only my chin that would break out...</li>
            <li> I found out from our dermatologist that this is basically benzoyl peroxide which you can buy the generic at CVS for much, much less.</li>
            <li> The only 2 differences is: 1, my face looks a bit softer and less oily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that your skin looks worse, it&#x27;s just that you are used to a new standard.</li>
            <li> My daughter was disappointed thather acne didn&#x27;t clear up overnight, and was only slowly going away, so being a mom, I looked around for something that she could safely add to her routine.</li>
            <li> Also I think this is really hard on your face if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> At the very least, it won&#x27;t make your skin worse, and motivates you to wash your face more times per day.</li>
            <li> So many of them dont work, or have really bad side</li>
            <li> I remember when my child was younger and ordered from ProActive that it was a negative option program (meaning they kept sending one each and every month regardless of actual usage).  </li>
            <li> My daughter says it works, but it is pricey for what you get and we are trying common drug store alternatives that seem to work nearly as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving Proactiv a negative review because it is grossly overpriced.  </li>
            <li> and, it took awhile to show up from a close location however; it was here way before expected from the shipment date.</li>
            <li> so just be careful of the doze..</li>
            <li> You will now only have to concern yourself with keeping it hydrated, maybe doing some microdermabrasion peels if you have scarring, maybe some masks and scrubs a few times a week, retinol ... things that improve and repair your skin after the breakouts are under control.  </li>
            <li> She recommended I use a gentle face wash, spot treatment, a mineral based night cream to heal my poor skin.   </li>
            <li> This product works wonders but just be careful when you order on line.  </li>
            <li> Not really Proactiv.&lt;br</li>
            <li> not a real product.&lt;br /&gt;May</li>
            <li> careful.</li>
            <li> I had tried it years ago for a few days, but I couldn&#x27;t stand how oily it left my face feeling.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used quite a few different products within the proactiv line for acne and skin care.</li>
            <li> I tried this for a few weeks, my skin cleared up a bit after several days</li>
            <li> By morning, her face was all HIVES and her eyes were swollen closed.  </li>
            <li> , it damaged my skin, especially my face completely dried out</li>
            <li> The product will show almost zero improvement after 3 weeks of use,and this is with minimal acne.  </li>
            <li> I spent a ton of money on this system and it never cleared my acne.</li>
            <li> I guess everyone is a little different, may work for others just not me, not strong enough.</li>
            <li> it looks like an allergy,it is specially bad when I sweat a lot which I do often because I live in a hot country ,in Costa Rica.</li>
            <li> My son had the usual teenage acne which we could not clear up with any other product.  </li>
            <li> I love proactive, but am sick of being over charged, trying to deal w/their overzealous sales techniques, &amp; all.</li>
            <li> Proactive works better than I ever imagined, but I was sick of dealing w/</li>
            <li> found these products to be very small for such a big cost.</li>
            <li> Moving forward, after the extreme dryness subsides, I plan to use Proactiv once every few days rather than daily.</li>
            <li> Much to my disappointment, this product was sent to me in a ziplock bag and not the original packaging.</li>
            <li> At first Proactiv was a little irritating and drying for me.  </li>
            <li> I have used Proactiv for years, and it helped to clear up my serious acne, along with getting my digestive system balanced.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have super bad acne, but enough to bother me.</li>
            <li> I use a bit less and add additional lotion, such as their green tea moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never used any of the other products in the line, except this 3 piece kit and another moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I wonder if there&#x27;s any other way to design the bottle so that doesn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li> adverts.&lt;br /&gt;Proactiv has never done anything for me other than irritate my skin</li>
            <li> and I have never had that problem with any other skin care package.</li>
            <li> I recently switched over to the Equate knockoff, and have been using it with IDENTICAL results for the past year.</li>
            <li> Granted, I don&#x27;t have extreme acne problems -</li>
            <li> I decided to risk ordering this kit even with the other reviews saying you would not get what you ordered.  </li>
            <li> This product will bleach your clothes, towels, sheets, pillowcases and any other fabric you may rub against while the product is on your hands or face.  </li>
            <li> In this case I usually switch to something else for a while but always end up coming back to it.</li>
            <li> It works by drying out your face to the extreme and stripping it.</li>
            <li> I have heard that once you use Proactiv and try to use other products they won&#x27;t work, so you have to keep using Proactiv.</li>
            <li> carefully, I wish I did!</li>
            <li> or so is money well spent!</li>
            <li> other products I have tried</li>
            <li> In fact, type scam with anything associated to Guthy Renker and you will find endless pages of people that have had problems dealing with this company.</li>
            <li> I usually buy each Proactiv Step separately, because Step 2 and Step 3 last longer than Step 1 does.  </li>
            <li> Milk, and other dairy products contain hormones from cows that can cause adverse affects in some humans.  </li>
            <li> Product was received in a timely fashion and it beat the price compared to other vendors.</li>
            <li> I have to be very careful to not stain all my colored clothing that drips off my face.  </li>
            <li> And I have noticed that when I do get acne and put the treatment on it the zit wont get a white head, instead it just peels of layers of skin at a time, leaving my with a dark spot and a small bump.  </li>
            <li> this product does work its just too expensive , however after a while it will stop working , I used it for 2 years and it stopped working , I currently can never get m eyebrows waxed because the chemicals in it made my face sensitive , so my skin comes off with the wax .....</li>
            <li> The Active ingredient in Proactive is 2.5% benzoyl peroxide, old-school stuff</li>
            <li> This is the type of acne that develops deep in the pores of your face and develop zits that are very large and painful.  </li>
            <li> It was expensive, had to not eat certain things and had to do blood work every so often.</li>
            <li> nothing crazy-a little around my chin and forehead but not much.</li>
            <li> Typical surface acne comes from sweat, dirt, and other things clogging a pore on the surface of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not worth bothering.</li>
            <li> /&gt;BUT - Proactiv is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Whatever is in the product burnt my face and made it dark in some places.</li>
            <li> NOT WORTH THE HEADACHE.</li>
            <li> Proactiv - another plus is that she didn&#x27;t end up with dark blotches on her face when the acne cleared up.  </li>
            <li> product is designed to keep you a long term customer, because even if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, it is designed as such to make your acne worse when you quit it.</li>
            <li> it is not worth the $$$$$$</li>
            <li> This product is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Spending only $30+ for a face system that lasts at least 8 months?</li>
            <li> and we went straight to the dermatologist who gave prescriptions for expensive treatments that didn&#x27;t work that well for her, given the price.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately we didn&#x27;t notice the expiration date on these bottles until three months after receipt when she was ready to use them, and they were all expired  - buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I dropped the product completely and had break outs worse than ever before.    </li>
            <li> However, the one unpleasant result is that your skin might become super oily.  </li>
            <li> I usually use this once a day at night, for some people using it twice a day makes their skin too dry.</li>
            <li> My skin type is &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;--not particularly dry nor oily, not even in the &amp;#34;T-zone.&amp;#34; I usually use salicylic acid-based cleansers and Ponds oil-base moisturizer to keep my skin acne-free and moist.</li>
            <li> I had read other reviews about being trapped in a mail order nightmare.</li>
            <li> it produces a few other unwanted</li>
            <li> The bottles came in a Zip Lock bag that looked like it had been used previously.</li>
            <li> She still Has the black dimples on her face.</li>
            <li> She has less and less pimples now</li>
            <li> Save your money and find some something with less chemicals.</li>
            <li> Saw the fees on my credit card, it turns out they put it as a hidden clause when you order.  </li>
            <li> i mix half repairing lotion and half retinol cream twice a day with a blemish cleanser, works wonders</li>
            <li> The green tea moisturizer I was supposed to get is smaller than a small carmex tube (.33oz)!</li>
            <li> Also, the acne free severe system burned my skin badly, and Proactive actually didn&#x27;t make the problem worse and now my skin is healing.  </li>
            <li> and I have a feeling that the only way this stuff might have worked for me was if I used all the ProActive products (moisturizers, make-up, etc.), but that would&#x27;ve been far too expensive for me!</li>
            <li> The small pimpled that I may get every once in a while are shallow and barely even considered a pimple.</li>
            <li> Not only is the product highly ineffective, but the customer service through Proactiv is atrocious.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it at all!</li>
            <li> So I ordered it and within days I noticed my dark spots on my chin diminishing that I had for years!</li>
            <li> I have cancelled twice in the past 2 years because I wanted to try some other products and they cancelled when I called, with no issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Proactive charges a lot of money for products with very little active ingredient.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to really write this review to caution everyone on the crazy price swings</li>
            <li> However, the price has gotten crazy in the last several years.</li>
            <li> Rarely do I get so frustrated at a company</li>
            <li> even if you don&#x27;t have an existing breakout, just apply a thin layer daily after you wash your face to prevent breakouts.</li>
            <li> This stuff made my acne ten times worse than it was when I started using it.  </li>
            <li> It starts with an exfoliator to get rid of dead skin cells and it also has benzoyl peroxide in it</li>
            <li> if you use it the way you are supposed to it works, if you do not then don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I few spots went away, but others persisted.  </li>
            <li> but for the few I have, the St.</li>
            <li> Really dried out his face</li>
            <li> I also ordered green tea moisturizer</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> These products dried out my skin</li>
            <li> &quot; She was dead on.</li>
            <li> I did like the green tea moisturizer, I will give them that.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like much is missing from the bottle, but everything was all sticky and messy.</li>
            <li> There are too much harsh chemicals inside it.</li>
            <li> I had seen a doctor who said they would give me an RX for it - which I&#x27;m not comfortable with (for reoccurring acne).</li>
            <li> but now if I use proactive everyday have no problems.</li>
            <li> Proactive has been a part of my life for a few years</li>
            <li> i wish i hadn&#x27;t wasted my money.</li>
            <li> This formula is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I tried to change a few things in my subscription</li>
            <li> For a few YEARS I just conceded to refusing delivery of the package when I checked my PO Box.</li>
            <li> Like everything out there that uses harsh chemicals (e.g. Salicylic Acid and others), it burns when you apply it.  </li>
            <li> She was home alone and had trouble getting a hold of me but eventually took Benedryl and applied ice packs to her face.</li>
            <li> A waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> and I used the green tea moisturizer along with that.</li>
            <li> and I started getting acne again a few months ago.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T waste your money.  </li>
            <li> I am betting they will do no such thing and that they just want to bully me into paying a false debt.</li>
            <li> You could spend way less money on a product that you can buy in a grocery store and it will probably work just as well if not better.</li>
            <li> I have 15 from previous purchases - it&#x27;s about $15 less-expensive!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other peoples reviews about this product and I will agree that Proactiv customer service sucks.</li>
            <li> Using Proactiv made my acne about ten times worse than usual.</li>
            <li> Some have decreased a small portion, some look the same.</li>
            <li> I went from bad adult acne (zits, pimples, redness) to cystic acne (large, deep painful zits).</li>
            <li> The acne treatment dries out my skin pretty bad.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Proactiv in the past and had to stop because it was too harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I was getting bad breakout recently, and I had remembered using Proactiv a couple years back</li>
            <li> I just had bad acne break outs not only on my face but on my back arms and chest.</li>
            <li> I feel bad for their customer service people - they don&#x27;t get paid nearly enough to deal with what they must deal with daily.</li>
            <li> All those persistant, swollen, painful spots under the skin finally went away within days of starting the Proactive regime again.  </li>
            <li> I am sorry I took so long to write, but i am on vacation and got a little time....</li>
            <li> They are painful and very tender.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time!</li>
            <li> I have used benzoyl peroxide in the past and they never worked well.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a scary thought actually...</li>
            <li> Please watch for the small letters</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the product delivers as promised since I just started using it.</li>
            <li> What was ordered, without the expensive local distributor prices.</li>
            <li> arrived on time through it was small size</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who isn&#x27;t lazy.</li>
            <li> They are expensive and although they have anti-aging products (which I have used), it is the same as all the rest and over priced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it in the past, and then would stop, and the breakouts would begin again.</li>
            <li> I personally feel it should be illegal to allow online membership that also doesn&#x27;t allow cancellation.  </li>
            <li> I have used it on and off for the past 9 years.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Usually I would get a bill</li>
            <li> so I got stuck with the usual prescription stuff.</li>
            <li> then using small amounts and increasing those amounts over time may work for you as it did for me.</li>
            <li> Not sure on formulas though.</li>
            <li> I frequently get large, painful, ugly pimples on my cheeks and chin.</li>
            <li> It made me break out worse, and the harsh chemicals dried my skin out like crazy, even though I only used it once a day</li>
            <li> i bought the 3 step system throu their website years ago and it was very annoying, they would ship it every other month and charge me 70 something dollars, i would be finishing the face wash, then have left over toner, and treaetment, i had extra bottles lying around!!</li>
            <li> (since it is nearly impossible to cancel if you order directly from Proactiv).  </li>
            <li> and I do not have allergies nor do I scrub hard.</li>
            <li> Had a hard time canceling it.</li>
            <li> At least they don&#x27;t test on animals.</li>
            <li> With that said, the packaging was a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> , I filed a complaint with BBB.</li>
            <li> My son suffers from cystic acne, this system keeps his condition manageable and believe me he has tried everything on the topical market.</li>
            <li> so it as at least serviceable.</li>
            <li> this is incredibly frustrating and a waste of my time.  </li>
            <li> These are all things that I have tried in the past but have never worked!</li>
            <li> Originally, I bought through their mail-order plan, but that was AWFUL!</li>
            <li> Food, allergies, and other auto-immune issues still apply - sorry.</li>
            <li> Guthy Renker sent me bills/delinquent notices for a time (no more packages yay!).</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re skeptical look at the other proactivreviews.</li>
            <li> no more BS from Guthy Renker!</li>
            <li> No more collections or worrying about my credit!</li>
            <li> So I found myself with very small products, overly priced and figured I might as well try them - or just return them.</li>
            <li> Not too mention it is so much less expensive than these proactiv products that are literally just sitting on my counter now not being used.</li>
            <li> Since Proactiv was a little on the expensive side, I decided to try cheaper brands out.</li>
            <li> Too bad I only received part 2&amp;3 in my kit.  </li>
            <li> Not a good mix.</li>
            <li> Hard to beat Amazon&#x27;s prices!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spoken with one of their representatives at least once a month since January!</li>
            <li> Then it turned the larger acne into real bad dark spots.</li>
            <li> You have to have some tough skin to use this product.</li>
            <li> My wife suffers a little bit with acne and no product helped.</li>
            <li> and unfortunately I found out the hard way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems it got worse for a couple weeks after using it for a month or so.</li>
            <li> I used this product for approximately eight months.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> I can even get away with eating poorly sometimes.  </li>
            <li> Lying rip-off scam artists.  </li>
            <li> So we ordered, not happy with the product it did not work for my son&#x27;s severe acne.</li>
            <li> After I cancel my account I still got outrageous fees and changes, like some vitamins that they said where a &amp;#34;free gift&amp;#34;, but really changed me $88.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t make my skin any worse, but it also didn&#x27;t make any improvement.</li>
            <li> In fact, it made her skin break out worse.  </li>
            <li> This time around it seemed to make my skin worse.</li>
            <li> I started using the treatments again, and it cleared somewhat, but I was still getting those zits and my lines were getting worse.  </li>
            <li> They also have poor record keeping and over charge us.</li>
            <li> Approximately $40 every six months</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t stick with it, your skin appear to look worse than before.</li>
            <li> and it made everything worse</li>
            <li> Words cannot express how absolutely vile and evil this company is.</li>
            <li> It made it worse.</li>
            <li> Worse mistake ever.</li>
            <li> and it just got worse.</li>
            <li> Acne was still there and even got worse.</li>
            <li> I kept the product, but I do not appreciate the false advertisement.</li>
            <li> False advertising&#x3D;three stars.</li>
            <li> My acne wasn&#x27;t terrible to begin with, but I was having consistant mild breakouts and they were driving me crazy.  </li>
            <li> It dried out my skin like crazy and my breakouts got even worse!</li>
            <li> We take these complaints very seriously and appreciate the time you have taken to let us know about your experience.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know whats worse, just letting the zit form and pop it, or having the weird aftermath of the acne treatment.  </li>
            <li> My worst years were my early teens, it seemed like</li>
            <li> My grandson had very bad facial breakouts in his teens.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had very bad acne (such as cystic)</li>
            <li> The new zits hurt like crazy and oozed nasty stuff</li>
            <li> Sad</li>
            <li> I was so wrong.  </li>
            <li> but sadly it didn&#x27;t work out so well for me,</li>
            <li> I have always been skeptical of Proactiv</li>
            <li> Oh, sorry.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately she must be allergic to it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, did not work for my son.  </li>
            <li> I paid almost $40 for this thing and am not happy!</li>
            <li> I have this a shot, but was not impressed.</li>
            <li> My teenage son suffered horribly from acne</li>
            <li> even worse!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weird.  </li>
            <li> but they were unable to accommodate.  </li>
            <li> The Post Office returned the package after I failed to pick it up after 14 days.</li>
            <li> I failed to notify them of anything.</li>
            <li> Expect to be billed and hit with random fees.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong for buying this.</li>
            <li> And they make it extremely difficult to cancel the product.</li>
            <li> Drying out my face, giving me painful cracked skin, and in some cases making my acne worse.    </li>
            <li> , proactive is very bad and way too harsh for skin.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m giving it a one-star rating due to the terrible business practices of the company that sells it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but she was no longer a disgusting pimply mess.  </li>
            <li> My thyroid was out of sorts and I started to get crazy hormonal acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this for anyone else who is as desperate as I have been...</li>
            <li> Mediocre!</li>
            <li> However, if you think you will just need one shipment of this you are wrong!</li>
            <li> I AM SO MAD</li>
            <li> It was so bad  that I have to rush to the dermatologist</li>
            <li> She is suffering from bad case of acne and she has been tried everything to get rid of acne for almost 4yrs.</li>
            <li> My acne has been bad since I was 10</li>
            <li> My partner has a bad acne problem.</li>
            <li> also noticed when I quit eating foods that are obviously bad for you, fried foods, burgers, pizza, things like that</li>
            <li> , I think it depends on you as a person, your skin type and how bad the acne is.</li>
            <li> we both were frustrated</li>
            <li> I am amazingly frustrated to have paid for a product-- and its shipping--</li>
            <li> I quit using Proactiv because I was getting frustrated with the automatic delivery and billing with Proactiv, but my skin started breaking out again.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed nonetheless.</li>
            <li> and I hate exfoliating micro</li>
            <li> I hate proactive, and I would not recommand this product to anybody, because when I bought proactive, I thought I was going to like result, but instead I regret it ever since after</li>
            <li> I hate this stuff with a passion.</li>
            <li> I will tell you that when I opened it I WAS SHOCKED!</li>
            <li> I had VERY BAD ACNE and proactiv works</li>
            <li> (&amp; Customer Service Was Dreadful.)</li>
            <li> SCAM, this is a horrible scam.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the WORST product i have ever used.</li>
            <li> it was the worst mistake of my life.</li>
            <li> Anyways all i&#x27;m saying is that this company is the worst of the worst.</li>
            <li> I ended up breaking out horribly.</li>
            <li> and she immediately said, \\&quot;That is the WORST thing you can use on your skin.</li>
            <li> I hate proactive!</li>
            <li> Worst product ever!</li>
            <li> They have terrible customer service.</li>
            <li> I used to have awful acne</li>
            <li> Says proactive smells awful, like chemicals.</li>
            <li> Proactiv (Guthy-Renker) is inherently evil, as a company.</li>
            <li> Worst product I have ever used!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works great I recommend this I gave it to my teenage son</li>
            <li> The new version is 10 times better. Don&#x27;t waste your time!</li>
            <li> Mediocre! Soo A No Gooo . I purchased a special one time offer of Proactiv for $29.95 online. I used the product daily for over a month &amp; continued to breakout. To my astonishment I was charged $32.95 automatically the next month and sent an identical new supply. I called to say I&#x27;d keep the order but wanted to cancel for the future. I was billed 32.95 2x after that. In total I paid nearly $100 for an order only a tablecloth spoon bigger than my first order that costed $29.95. Now That&#x27;s $130 done the drain &amp; my facial complexion still resembles a pizza. Sad But True, Folks . (&amp; Customer Service Was Dreadful.)</li>
            <li> works for me like a charm every time.</li>
            <li> proactiv helped me get a date for my prom and it got here just in time</li>
            <li> You have to have some tough skin to use this product.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this products everyday and her skin has cleared up very well.  I might just buy it for myself.</li>
            <li> Great. Clear my face up</li>
            <li> Trying to get a good description from him is not easy - LOL!  But he said &amp;#34;If I used it right I would give it 5 stars&amp;#34;.  He said it works, he just isn&#x27;t using it as often as he should.</li>
            <li> This is my second time using Proactiv. The first time it worked pretty well but the benzyl peroxide will bleach your clothes, towels, etc.</li>
            <li> This shipped and, the only thing I can complain about is you do not get any of the free stuff that the regular site offers however; they put a very long shipment date and it came way before since it is shipped within the united states and, it does not tell you where it ships from but, if you track the package it will tell you that it has been shipped and where it is located. However; i got the package today and it has stated for 3 days that it was in california close to where I live and, it took awhile to show up from a close location however; it was here way before expected from the shipment date.</li>
            <li> the shipment came on time, Proactiv roduct is very good, love it</li>
            <li> I got &amp;#34;Acne Treatment Cream&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s from &amp;#34;Family Dollar&amp;#34; store - I think I paid $1.29 for it, and in fact, it is a little more effective for me, than the much more expensive Proactiv.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What really matters is the percentage of Benzoyl Peroxide, I believe the FDA caps it at 15% for over the counter medication. The one I mentioned above that I got from the dollar store has 10% of it.</li>
            <li> Very very good product when it comes to eliminating pimples, blemishes and blackheads. It works very well. The only complain I have is that it dries out your skin tremendously, but besides that it really got rid of my blackheads on my back.</li>
            <li> My skin is acne prone and I have tried many things in the past to make it clear up, but nothing has worked.  At first Proactiv was a little irritating and drying for me.  Word of advice, don&#x27;t get it near your eyes because the cleanser does sting.  The 3 step worked right away for me, within a couple weeks my skin started getting clear and brighter.  Occasionally I have minor breakouts, but nothing compared to before starting this kit.  It&#x27;s been a year now and I&#x27;ve never used any of the other products in the line, except this 3 piece kit and another moisturizer.  The kit alone dries out my skin, so I use a separate moisturizer and SPF.  The price is a little high for this kit, but here on Amazon I compared to the Proactiv site and another site who also sell these products and this price here is most competitive.  I like being able to purchase what I need instead of an entire kit at one time.  A friend recommended Proactiv to me.  I would recommend this kit to most anyone except those with extremely sensitive or dry skin.  The formula is kind of strong and at first, like I said it dried my skin and stung a little if I got it near my eyes.</li>
            <li> This product works really well in helping to clear up acne. However, after using for about a week to 2 weeks my skin becomes extremely dry. So I am trying to find a balance of how often to use it. Maybe I can alternate with another cleanser.</li>
            <li> This product is great for fighting acne Us it on a regular basis for the best results ... even if you don&#x27;t have an existing breakout, just apply a thin layer daily after you wash your face to prevent breakouts. My acne was about an 8 on a scale of 1-10. Now after using this Proactive system, it is about a 2 or 3 (depending on the time of month). I definately recommend this for anyone struggling with breakouts. It has help me quite a bit.</li>
            <li> It was just what my wife was looking for.</li>
            <li> Works for one teen not as well for the other.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! Specially because it is at my door step when I &#x27;need&#x27; it and &#x27;want it.&#x27; No gimmicks of having to pay every 30 days for a new shipment! Will definitely be ordering again!</li>
            <li> I only really like the face wash. The toner and cream dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real thing! I order these for my wife and teen and the 3pc kit works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It is priced better than the TV add. I&#x27;ve used it for almost 10 years now, will not change</li>
            <li> This product proved to me that something I dont have to get a prescription to use, actually works</li>
            <li> This new formula is awesome.  I&#x27;ve used proactiv in the past and it was too harsh for me and very drying...not anymore!  It also was shipped very promptly.</li>
            <li> Do not buy, terrible product that may cause strong allergies!!! On top of that if you have any issues, you do not have any customer service that is normally provided by proactiv.</li>
            <li> I have tried Proactiv many times and when the new formula came out I thought maybe it would work on my skin.    NO    Did not work.. made me break out for months even after period when your skin is detoxing.    Made my skin extremely dry.  Using Proactiv made my acne about ten times worse than usual. It also lead me to develop scars from use.    I would not buy this product.   Even if you hope that it will work and want a solution.. this is not it.    may work for very mild acne. but for moderate to severe will not be helpful.</li>
            <li> It came in just a few days and it is the same great Proactiv product I have been using before.  The sizes are worth the money and I got a great deal. I will definately buy from them again!</li>
            <li> Since years I have problems with my forehead.It is not acne it looks like an allergy,it is specially bad when I sweat a lot which I do often because I live in a hot country ,in Costa Rica.No doctor could help me.  My wife suffers a little bit with acne and no product helped.Then she ordered PROACTIV and she told me.Just try it you never know.Of course as you can imagine I did not believe a bit in this.I tried already to many things and even the doctors....  O.K.I used it and I could not believe it.After 3 days my forehead was much better,after 1 week my forehead was clean it looked as I never had something.My wife and I could not believe it.  My wife is also better but the result is not so fast as mine.  I do not get paid for this review and usually I do not like to write,but it was so impressing that I wanted to share it.Probably this product will not help everyody but it helped me.    Now I am using the product for 1 month and everything is back as it was before.The rush is back,so of course I am not so exited with the product anymore.I would give after 1 month use only three stars</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she has gone through one round of it and is extremely impressed with the results.  She started using it twice a day as recommended and is now able to get away with once a day.  She didn&#x27;t have severe acne to begin with, but it was regular.  Now her face is notably clearer.  I wanted to really write this review to caution everyone on the crazy price swings this particular page seems to have.  I bought this on Dec 8th, 2011 and it was $43.25 before shipping.  It was Sold by: Great Skin Concepts LLC and order was fulfilled by Amazon (so Amazon Prime worked).</li>
            <li> I purchased the micro-crystal formula, they sent me the regular stuff. I still used it because it works fine, but that&#x27;s kind of ridiculous.</li>
            <li> This new formula of Proactiv made my face break out even more. I don&#x27;t really have a huge problem with acne (just occasional bumps here and there), but I was hoping to use this product to avoid any further pimples around my forehead and chin area. After using this kit for 2 days my entire face broke out. After a week by nose started to bubble up (looked like it was burned). Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter uses it and loves it</li>
            <li> I chose this product after reading the reviews.The product is actually for my girlfriend who was having some issues with her face and from the results am seeing on her face its doing a good job so far and she feels satisfied she made the right choice.In fact she bought another already so thumbs up to proactive for doing such a fine job so far.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriemd BC she was basically a hot mess with hormonal acne. She was really insulted that I bought it for her though and she claimed nothing can be done about hormonal acne. So we fought and ultimately broke up. During a period of sanity she asked if she could try it. Well wouldn&#x27;t you know, after like two days her acne was gone. Yes, she had some dry skin for a couple weeks but she was no longer a disgusting pimply mess.  Even after her skin rehydrated the pimples were still under control. So, it definitely works.&lt;br /&gt;With all that being said, we still couldn&#x27;t work things out. You&#x27;d think she would have thanked me.  Women.</li>
            <li> I am sure this was fake. I have used Proactiv before and it was nothing like this. It came with no box, no instructions. Do not buy !!!</li>
            <li> I used Proactiv throughout my teen years and it worked fairly well but I wasn&#x27;t completely impressed. However, I stopped using it when I was in my early 20&#x27;s and I started to experience frequent breakouts.  Since Proactiv was a little on the expensive side, I decided to try cheaper brands out. I tried just about every product out there that you can buy in the drugstores (including all of the different 3 step systems that claim to be better than Proactiv) and nothing worked.  I am now 24 and decided to give the Proactiv new formula a try.  It has worked wonders for me! I ordered it from this seller so that I wouldn&#x27;t be stuck with it if I didn&#x27;t like it (since it is nearly impossible to cancel if you order directly from Proactiv).  I&#x27;ve only been using it for about two weeks but my skin has cleared up almost completely and I haven&#x27;t gotten any new blemishes since I&#x27;ve started using it.  I am thrilled! Another bonus is that I received it 2 days after ordering.  I also use the refining mask 3 times per week and it makes my skin extremely soft! I love this product and I am so extremely happy to be comfortable in my skin again.  I am going to continue ordering from this seller and using Proactiv!! :)</li>
            <li> Proactiv worked within the first three days of use. My skin is completely clear. The blue solution causes some redness and irritation which disappears within ten minutes.</li>
            <li> I have used Proactive for 2 years now and I have not received even ONE blemish on my face since. It has also cleared up any blemish marks and my skin is perfectly clear. I used to purchase directly from the website but they always took almost two weeks to send my shipments. I am so happy that I can now get it on Amazon and receive my package in 2 days.</li>
            <li> I have used the proactive three step system for about 10 years. I am 38 years old - I will never stop using it!</li>
            <li> Not much to say, we got what we ordered and expected and didn&#x27;t have to go through the normal channel (Manufacturer) where they send you supplies you don&#x27;t need based on a set schedule.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with this product.  I&#x27;d heard nothing but great success stories from other people who had used it, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  My acne wasn&#x27;t terrible to begin with, but I was having consistant mild breakouts and they were driving me crazy.  I thought Pro Activ would clear it up great.  I was so wrong.  A week after I started using it I got bigger, angrier pimples than I&#x27;d ever had before on my cheeks.  My forehead cleared right up, but I now have acne scars on my cheeks and several blemishes that just won&#x27;t go away.  I thought maybe there was just an adjustment period, but I used the stuff for over two months and my face still isn&#x27;t back to normal.  This stuff made my acne ten times worse than it was when I started using it.  It&#x27;s entirely possible that I&#x27;m just an anomaly.  Seriously, everyone else I know had great results, I just feel compelled to tell my experience.  I will never use this brand again.  Just a warning, this product can cause severe drying.  The area around my mouth has been flaky for weeks, so I&#x27;ve been using cocoa butter, which seems to help tremendously.</li>
            <li> I have used the old version of pro active worked ok but this new one is amazing skin cleared within weeks. As long as i didnt over use my skin felt comfortable and normal. The only thing I recommend is stay on top of using product thats the only down is if u stop using you may start to break out again. Over all great product.</li>
            <li> Proactiv is definitely not for sensitive skin and unfortunately I found out the hard way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sensitive skin is such a pain in the you know what! I did have high hopes for this product since I was suffering from acne and willing to try anything but sadly it didn&#x27;t work out so well for me, all that happened is that it ended rubbing skin off the side of my face.</li>
            <li> this product is wonderful, I got it for my granddaughter and her face is amazingly clearer after only a week and a half</li>
            <li> SCAM, this is a horrible scam. You sign up for $39.95 then they continue billing your credit card every month. It took three call to hopefully have them stop, I am into this product well over $100. Really unethical.</li>
            <li> Just like they say it works. My skin looks much better and must have for teenagers with acne issue.</li>
            <li> The cleanser is very watered down. I have used Proactiv off and on for years and the Step 1 product has never been so watery. I will go back to buying it directly from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Used for two months per instructions and my skin never cleared up. It seems it got worse for a couple weeks after using it for a month or so. I&#x27;m using Christina Moss organic face wash and moisturizer now and love it! I started using the Olay ProX and Aztec indian healing clay too and have seen a major improvement with my skin. WONT be using Proactiv again!</li>
            <li> So... the acid kills any baddies that might make your skin break out.  However, the one unpleasant result is that your skin might become super oily.  I&#x27;m talking like frying pan oily, so it&#x27;s a tradeoff.  Blotting paper helps, but you can only do that so much in a day.  Proactive also sells an oil reducing lotion, which can be used in combo, but it seems like the oil reducer should be included in the kit.  The packaging is also very fragile.  For two different sets, i&#x27;ve dropped one of the three different bottles and everytime, the little long piece of plastic that keeps the nozzle from clogging breaks off.  I wonder if there&#x27;s any other way to design the bottle so that doesn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this product.I have always been skeptical of Proactiv but I decided to try it because nothing else was working for me.  Over the years I have tried a lot of different products including retinoids (differen), topical and oral antibiotics, and some others. Antibiotics have worked really well in the past but recently have become less effective, plus I don&#x27;t like being on them since bacteria can become more resistant to it. I have tried everything including different lotions, face cleaners, exfoliators, and also glycolic acid. I have used benzoyl peroxide in the past and they never worked well. Proactiv is actually a combination of these things and somehow it works much better than anything I have bought in the past.!  It starts with an exfoliator to get rid of dead skin cells and it also has benzoyl peroxide in it I believe. Then the toner is actually mainly glycolic acid which actually helps exfoliate your skin even more. Then the lotion is really just a benzoyl peroxide moisturizer. These are all things that I have tried in the past but have never worked! But for some reason Proactiv gets it right and it is working really well. I&#x27;ve been on it for about 2 months and it has gotten rid of almost all of my acne.  Also I think this is really hard on your face if you have sensitive skin. My sister used it and it made her face hurt and peel. I think my skin is not sensitive at all since I&#x27;ve tried so many different things so it works well for me.</li>
            <li> My son had tried this before .  We then tried another product that did not work.  This Product works .</li>
            <li> if you use it the way you are supposed to it works, if you do not then don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Great - on time, no issues.  Would go with them again; received all the right products per description; still using the proactiv</li>
            <li> My son loves this product. It is very effective and I don&#x27;t know what we would do without this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using ProActive for years (on and off).  I believe it truly is the best product on the market!  It makes my skin clear, smooth, and toned.  I recommend this product to any and everyone (not even just those with acne problems!).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years and helps my acne disappear. Not a miracle product, acne will return if you stop using.  Bottles will last as stated on your order.</li>
            <li> Far better than proactiv plus</li>
            <li> Seems to always help.  I don&#x27;t use it myself.  I can vouch for my family and claim on their behalf that it does work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the WORST product i have ever used. i wish i could give it a zero rate. it made my skin so dry and itchy, got more wrinkles from using it. i wish i could return it but i did international shipping and it&#x27;s not worth bothering. i don&#x27;t reccomend this product....</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s face has cleared up considerably after 3 weeks use.&lt;br /&gt;The first week the product brought everything up to the surface and she was horrified! Now she has fewer and smaller blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;We will keep using it.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great. My grandson had very bad facial breakouts in his teens. The dr had him on antibiotics both oral and topical, and it didnt do a thing. S we quit, and bought this. It took a couple months but his face cleared up real nice. Take a picture before you start, in a month or 2 compare it. I found this amazing! Now he is almost 22 and he needs this occasionally, he uses it a couple times a week and his face stays clear. We stopped ordering it for a while and we saw how much difference it makes.</li>
            <li> I am only writing a review to warn people that this product will ruin your clothes and towels!  Bought it at mall for my teenage son, and so far seems about as good as anything else he has used, no better, nothing fabulous.  But, the gal at the kiosk warned me to use only white towels.  Didn&#x27;t even think about how my son wipes his face on his t-shirt sleeve and neckline when he sweats.  He totally bleached out two favorite shirts.  The second one got bleached around the neckline by just pulling it on over his head after washing.  Will only use this product at night now.</li>
            <li> My daughter, 23 still needs this stuff. Best place to get it. Will buy here again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to keep her face clear.</li>
            <li> I used this product for approximately eight months.&lt;br /&gt;At no point did I honestly feel like it improved or healed my acne.&lt;br /&gt;In fact, it irritated my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I used it in the past as a young teen, and it seemed to work then.&lt;br /&gt;I really do think instead of helping my acne, it made it worse.&lt;br /&gt;If you suffer from super sensitive skin, do NOT use this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 16 year old grandson.  His mom was buying him a drug store product, but he still had zits.  I decided to try this for him.  He started using this on Christmas night.  The nest time I saw him was New Years Eve and he was completely clear.  He looked great in just one week. I&#x27;m sure he has to use it everyday or they will return but I don&#x27;t think it will be a problem because he&#x27;s very happy.  I gave it a five star rating because it really worked.  The bottles were smaller than I thought but I will buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Very Happy MiMi</li>
            <li> a product was expiring</li>
            <li> Okay, so, I just want to start this off by saying that if you started any skin care regime - it will work. Just like anything on this Earth - if it is taken care of and maintained then it will look and feel better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT - Proactiv is not worth the money. You can get better skin care packages for a better price. I would try Rensa or any Skin Care Package that is actually proven. I know proactiv says that it is but you can just tell these people are hired in the advertisements. Don&#x27;t take the word of someone who has JUST tried a skin care routine for the first time and picked Proactiv. Scout youtube for people that review these things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally would recommend Rensa or the Body Shops facial exfoliators and any other sort of all natural (and not tested on animals of course) moisturiser and toner. These things are so easy to find if you just give it a google or even a search on amazon and most of the time, it&#x27;s pretty darn cheap and you don&#x27;t get this B.S that you get from ProActiv adverts.&lt;br /&gt;Proactiv has never done anything for me other than irritate my skin and I do not have allergies nor do I scrub hard. I do not recommend it as not only did it make my skin more red, it stung when I used the moisturiser and toner and I have never had that problem with any other skin care package.</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter and son - saw immedate improvement in both kids within a matter of days.  Beats going the route of a demo - both kids are happy with results as am I.</li>
            <li> I am a 40 year old woman that never had acne growing up.  So, I struggled through my twenties and thirties until I came across an infomercial for Proactive.  I had nothing to lose, so gave it a shot and I became quite impressed.  I&#x27;ve been a user for over 10 years now.  I&#x27;ve tried the OTC product kits and they just don&#x27;t compare.  They actually cause more blemishes.  Proactive has worked really well for me and I think it&#x27;s worth spending the money on .</li>
            <li> Heard of it before.. really a good product! Now the acne&#x27;s fading away.. but! skin will get really dry and decrustation happens.. so just be careful of the doze..</li>
            <li> My daugther still happy with this product. This helped a lot in her face.definite I revommend this product, because is excellent.</li>
            <li> I am an African American and I bought this product to clear my pimples...it was the worst mistake of my life. Whatever is in the product burnt my face and made it dark in some places. It was so bad  that I have to rush to the dermatologist and he told me that the ingredient was too hash for my skin tone. I would not recommend this product to african American</li>
            <li> This is the best product out there for healthy acne free skin. I will be buying again for sure. Love it!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t stop using it.  The only thing that keeps my teen acne.  Has to be used regularly for best results.  Just good cleaning routine.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use Proactive, my skin is naturally very oily and extremely prone to acne.  I exercise a lot and eat a raw food and vegan diet, take supplements, I try to keep the stress levels under control and sleep well, and all this has helped a lot, but nothing ever really kept the acne away except Proactive. I used this a long time ago when I was in college and liked it okay.  I used it off and on.  One year my face burned and peeled and I cursed this system.  But everything else I tried did nothing to help the acne, and it comes and goes with a fury.  I love using products by Lush, or Clinique, or natural remedies like oil-cleansing and so on, but still the acne flared up everywhere on my face.  It might be hormonal, probably related to stress and possibly diet (if I eat sugar or dairy or cooked oils, etc.).  I eventually tried Proactive again when it was reformulated.  It cleared my skin for the most part, but at that time I was also using the Green Tea Moisturizer and didn&#x27;t like it.  But my skin was pretty good so I tried using natural products for a while just to see what would happen and my skin freaked out and broke out all over the place.  I then experimented wtih different lush regimes and while I liked these products, the acne kept coming, relentlessly.  I then tried Acne Free Severe, and to my surprise it didn&#x27;t help that much.  I few spots went away, but others persisted.  (See separate review there if you wish) So after about a week of mininal results with that system, I then went back to using Proactiv, and my skin cleared up swiftly.  All the acne and the damage started to heal up fast and I saw results very quickly.  Also, the acne free severe system burned my skin badly, and Proactive actually didn&#x27;t make the problem worse and now my skin is healing.  So obviously, for whatever reason, my skin dramatically reacts to the Proactive system and the acne clears up noticably quickly with minimalto no drying or peeling if you use a good moisturizer.  I use Bee Yummy skin food (which helped tremendously with the dryness and peeling) and then if I need more moisture I might use Vanishing Cream over a layer of skin food.  I find that if I use Proactiv consistantly, every single day, don&#x27;t sleep in makeup, use only mineral makeup (I like Alima), if I use other skin care products my skin still stays clear.  I can even get away with eating poorly sometimes.  Basically, if I don&#x27;t use Proactiv, I feel like everything makes my skin erupt in acne and I break out often.  If I use Proactive, the medicine somehow keeps the acne to a minimum and heals it up quickly.  All those persistant, swollen, painful spots under the skin finally went away within days of starting the Proactive regime again.  So maybe it doesn&#x27;t work for some people, but it does the trick for my skin.  I&#x27;d say if nothing else is working for you, use the 3 steps plus a moisturizer that you know won&#x27;t break you out and give it a week.  If this system works for your skin type like it works for mine, you won&#x27;t be worried about breakouts.  You will now only have to concern yourself with keeping it hydrated, maybe doing some microdermabrasion peels if you have scarring, maybe some masks and scrubs a few times a week, retinol ... things that improve and repair your skin after the breakouts are under control.  This controls my acne better than anything.  Maybe I can never stop using it!  That&#x27;s a scary thought actually... but for now I&#x27;m okay with having to use it.  At least they don&#x27;t test on animals.</li>
            <li> Kids, Teenagers listen up...this stuff is made of benzoyl peroxide which you can find in 100 products in walmart...its the same thing....but mostly let me tell you nothing in the stores or proactive will clean you acne...its internal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YOUR LAST ACNE PRODUCT WILL BE ACCUTANE ..please research this...this is all you need...Accutane will clear your acne up 100% and you will not have an oily face either...go to your demo and tell him you want this...yes you have to have a blood test and if your female be in birth control....it is so worth it...it saved my self esteem, and life.</li>
            <li> Proactiv is ok.  It works temporary.  I have moderate to severe acne, so it only works so much.  Proactiv is proactiv!! It may work for some and not for others.</li>
            <li> The product performs as advertised. it is easy to use and effective. Used as directed skin should clear and remain so.</li>
            <li> My daughter has used every day. There has been no improvement at all.  I was told that it is not for everyone.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been struggling with acne problems since i was a college freshman. I have tried many different things,so i decided to give pro active a try. I truly regret making this decision, not only did i not receive the orders after two weeks, but when i  called to find out what was going on, they told me that i needed to pay $74 after paying $32 for their product *hence the $19.99 commercials they have playing all on your television sets.Then they tell me that i ordered something in august which was a big lie, then they tell me that i will receive a cancellation e-mail in 24 hours! what e-mail takes this long to be received? Anyways all i&#x27;m saying is that this company is the worst of the worst. They steal and the only reason why they are not getting into legal trouble is because they are cooperate thieves.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good product but I buy it through Amazon rather than going to Proactiv itself because they are TOOOO pushy and you&#x27;ll end up with a ton of product that you may (all products have expiration dates) or may not use. Better to buy through Amazon, that way you&#x27;re in control of when product arrives.</li>
            <li> skin becomes immune to it. switched to a basic skin care routine which is working better. the benzoyl also dries out your skin over time.</li>
            <li> This product is great and works well. With that said, the packaging was a big disappointment. The bottles came in a Zip Lock bag that looked like it had been used previously. This was not mentioned online upon purchasing. Beware of this when buying.</li>
            <li> After ordering the ProActive product, I received this message, \\&quot;Thank you for your recent visit to Proactiv.com!&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re sorry you weren&#x27;t able to finish your transaction. (If you&#x27;ve already placed your Proactiv® order, please disregard this message.) To help you complete your purchase, we&#x27;ve made it easy ....\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They try to double bill you!  In addition, they automatically set you up on recurring charges and shipments three weeks apart.  I got on an on-line chat with Proactive and they simply said, \\&quot; Oh, sorry.  It&#x27;s Okay.  Just trust us to do the right thing\\&quot;.  Lying rip-off scam artists.  Further, they said they shipped it on Oct. 4.  It&#x27;s now Oct. 8 and they still have not shipped it.  Lie-rs!</li>
            <li> Proactive charges a lot of money for products with very little active ingredient.  They charge even more for products with a standard concentration of active ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The advanced blemish treatment contains 6% benzoyl peroxide and they charge $10.50 for 0.33 ounce.  You can get a 10% treatment at any drugstore or Target any pay $10 for 1.0 oz.  The standard facial cleanser is 0.5% salicylic acid.  They charge about a dollar an ounce.  For the same price you can get a 2% salicylic acid cleanser at any drugstore.  Proactiv&#x27;s 2% solution costs 1.33 dollars an ounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kiosks in the mall are staffed by know-nothing girls who tell you this is \\&quot;prescription strength\\&quot; treatments.  What?  The company charges a fortune to pay for its extensive advertising and prays on the lack of knowledge of basic chemistry.  Don&#x27;t be scammed.</li>
            <li> My grandson&#x27;s face showed a remarkable improvement after one day!  He is in high school and feels a low self esteem from his complexsion, but is headed in the right direction using Proactive Solution kit I bought for him.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I was getting bad breakout recently, and I had remembered using Proactiv a couple years back and it worked well. Although, this time it did not. I started to break out more and more, and the smell bothered me. I think my skin has issues with benzoyl peroxide because these products tend to never work for me, as well as the fact that I don&#x27;t like the smell of benzoyl peroxide. I would reccomend researching products that are good for you skin type and experiment. I will be giving this product to my cousin because she has success with benzoyl peroxide products. Proactiv is great for some people, and not for others. I have sensitive skin and would have done better with the sensitive formula. If your skin does do well with benzoyl peroxide, though, I would reccomend this product because it does a fantastic job and I&#x27;ve seen beautiful results from others, it just wasn&#x27;t my thing. The price is good for an acne product that will bring results, just make sure that your skin does will with benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li> I have switched and tried cheaper more accesible (local drugstores) answers to my acne and not found anything that works better. acne free claims to be better but after a week I was breaking out and came back to proactive. Buying via amazon is a great solution to the frustrating website and poor customer service that is received if u buy direct from the proactive website.</li>
            <li> My son used this and it cleared his acne within days.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because he said it is a lot of steps that he has to do two times a day to see results.</li>
            <li> I help my wife to order this product using the proactiv website. Please watch for the small letters were they will put you on a monthly contract unless you are very, very, very careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end they will fight you by telling you that you will have to pay the first three months, even when you only needed/wanted 30 days supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife didn&#x27;t get any good results from the product anyway.</li>
            <li> YES, this stuff did work for me. I&#x27;ve been using it since I was 13 -- I&#x27;m now 27. I have sensitive AND extremely oily skin, which is a combo that a lot of dermatologists don&#x27;t fully understand, and most medications WAY overdry my skin. However, the price has gotten crazy in the last several years. I recently switched over to the Equate knockoff, and have been using it with IDENTICAL results for the past year. The Equate product is $11.99.</li>
            <li> I have used proactive multiple times it never seems to work I then tried this marykay product and it was so much better my skin has never been better!    WAY BETTER!!  [...]</li>
            <li> Good tool !My daughter cured them face . Purchases for the third time.Face was very clean .We got what we wanted</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know how this is possible, but after three days of use (only once a day as opposed to the twice a day directed), my entire face had dried out, EXCEPT for the pimple on my chin.</li>
            <li> I signed up for the 19.95 order and specified that I didn&#x27;t want anymore but the package. One month later and I&#x27;m charged with 80$+ dollars and a email saying that my 3 month supply was on it&#x27;s way without any notification beforehand. Not worth it at all! Please go on youtube and look for reviews on drugstore products before purchasing this!!!</li>
            <li> It works when used correctly!!  My wife and daughter swear by it.  Don&#x27;t get swayed when you instantly break out, that happens at firt on your way to clear skin!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love proactiv! I had VERY BAD ACNE and proactiv works really well makes my skin glow and nice and smooth. However, if you think you will just need one shipment of this you are wrong! It took me about six months for my skin to get clear so, so yeah, definitely get regular shipments.I suggest go to the proactiv website and go from there. Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone who can afford it!</li>
            <li> This product really works.  It&#x27;s worth the money.  My son had the usual teenage acne which we could not clear up with any other product.  After 3 months of usage, his skin is completely clear.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 14 year old son and he has used it as directed.  He has had a visible improvement in his skin and acne condition.</li>
            <li> Product clears the skin, just like the infomercials suggest, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money. Granted, I don&#x27;t have extreme acne problems - but for the few I have, the St. Ive&#x27;s Apricrot Scrub does the job for 1/15th the price.</li>
            <li> This was not a 60 day supply the title says, its a 30 day. Proactive is my favorite face cleaner, its quick and works like a charm</li>
            <li> I had read other reviews about being trapped in a mail order nightmare. I did my homework read all the fine print before ordering and did not see anywhere in the fine print you are signing up for auto delivery. So we ordered, not happy with the product it did not work for my son&#x27;s severe acne. Guess what today a new charge hit my bank, so I called them and asked that they cancel my subscription (which I did not agree to anyway) and they needed to reverse the charge. They said they would do what they could (which in every day terms means no). The only way I can avoid this charge is to cancel my debit card, which I have a million drafts hitting it each month. Huge headache!!! SO BEWARE, you may not realize it but you are signing into an auto delivery when you order this product.</li>
            <li> My daughter tried this product with high hopes.Unfortunately she must be allergic to it. She felt burning on her face first use,and then developed what looked like red burns on her face,  most noticeable on her chin and forehead. Were they hives or irritation? I am returning the products. I would not recommend  ProActiv to people with sensitive skin and to discontinue if you feel burning or develop redness.Also check the ingredients if you have known allergies to skin products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lost almost $200 in this product. When I sighed up for a one month supply they automatically sigh you up for three month supply, so I was surprised when I got another package from them a month later. I tried to return it, but the customer service was a nightmare. They just gave me BS and kept trying to sell more of there product; in the end I just gave up. After I cancel my account I still got outrageous fees and changes, like some vitamins that they said where a &amp;#34;free gift&amp;#34;, but really changed me $88. So besides costing me hundreds of dollars, this product didn&#x27;t really work. You could spend way less money on a product that you can buy in a grocery store and it will probably work just as well if not better. So if you don&#x27;t want to lose a ton of money and you want a product that works, I would stay far away from this one.</li>
            <li> I have used Proactiv products for years and I ordered this set to replenish my supply. Much to my disappointment, this product was sent to me in a ziplock bag and not the original packaging. I have no idea if the product is expired, the old formula, etc.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, did not work for my son.  Really dried out his face</li>
            <li> I am sorry I took so long to write, but i am on vacation and got a little time.... I have never received my proactiv package from way of life....I am disappointed.  My skybox people tells me it never reached Miami!!!! Please help me....this product really works!!!!</li>
            <li> I just received my first package from proactive! I will tell you that when I opened it I WAS SHOCKED! I and looked at this in vending machines at malls and it was normal size bottles, I open this kit and they are tiny little bottles that look like motel shampoo bottles! I paid almost $40 for this thing and am not happy! The green tea moisturizer I was supposed to get is smaller than a small carmex tube (.33oz)! I have now tried to email them, the email will not send, I have tried to do their online chat with a rep, and OH imagine that- that does not work either!!! I want my money back and off there mailing list! Any suggestions how to get ahold of these people and actually get my money back? Don&#x27;t buy this - it is a RIP OFF!!!!</li>
            <li> I decided to risk ordering this kit even with the other reviews saying you would not get what you ordered.  My package arrived yesterday.  I received the toner and the repairing treatment.  NO CLEANSER IN SIGHT.  What is the point?  This system is supposed to work by using steps 1, 2, &amp;3 twice daily.  Too bad I only received part 2&amp;3 in my kit.  Amazon this is incredibly frustrating and a waste of my time.  Do not risk ordering this product here, find it somewhere else.  NOT WORTH THE HEADACHE.</li>
            <li> I used to use this product for years and it was really good. After taking a break from it for a while, i came back and ordered it, first thing i noticed is that the smell is different now, and as i expected, it&#x27;s not as good as it was before. Perhaps they changed the chemical to make it cheaper.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 3 weeks since my girlfriend is using the product but i ain&#x27;t see much change yet. She still Has the black dimples on her face. I know I gotta wait a bit more but I&#x27;m inpatient.</li>
            <li> Hard to beat Amazon&#x27;s prices!  Proactive is a great product. As long as your kids do all the steps it works.</li>
            <li> works great. anyone&#x27;s whose skin dries out from the medicine int his product should not use it daily, but its great for balancing skin that takes abuse from sweaty workouts!</li>
            <li> Purchased for my son and he is pleased with the results.  Quick delivery and didn&#x27;t have to sign up fir auto refills.  Can purchase as needed this way.</li>
            <li> My daughter used this product several years ago and it worked great for quite a while but then seemed to stop working but after trying various other products over the last year or so she went back to and it seems to be doing the trick. I don&#x27;t know what happened before but so far so good. The only problem we have ever run into is that it is so popular that sometimes it is unavailable but when it is unavailable through it is also unavailable through directly.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 kits on two separate occasions.  The first kit came as pictured, with instructions.  The second kit came in a manilla envelope, like someone packed it from home, without instructions, or product detail!!!  I&#x27;m not sure if the product delivers as promised since I just started using it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t discover Proactiv til my 30&#x27;s. Now I&#x27;ve 48 and I just occasionally use the lotion when my face goes all teenagery. But I get it for my 18 year old son and my 20 year old daughter. Using the monthly plan doesn&#x27;t really work for us, I like being able to go on Amazon and just order what we need. I got the large set for one of the youths, and a small set that I nicked the lotion out of for me, and kept the rest as travel sizes for them.</li>
            <li> it could VERY well just be my skin BUT..I&#x27;ve used this for 4 months and it did more breaking out my skin then fixing it. this will be my second time trying this product and I&#x27;ve just come to the conclusion its not for me...but I hope it works for you.</li>
            <li> Was for my daughter for xmas. She loves the product and was a great price . She adds that it changed the way her face feels and looks.</li>
            <li> This is not the NEW FORMULA!!  I have the new formula, which is Proactiv Plus...it is much different from this formula.  The cleanser has a pump bottle and the beads dissolve after a minute or two (they smell better, too).  There is no toner in the basic kit.  The BP is milder and does not bleach hair and fabric like the older formula.  And, for the first time there is a cream moisturizer, which is my favorite product--smooth, creamy, and effective (does not cause breakouts).  Overall, I like Proactiv Plus better; also, their customer service has improved quite a bit.  I have a question about the prices on Amazon...WHY are the price points all over the place???  I don&#x27;t understand; and it makes me not trust them anymore!</li>
            <li> I had cystic Acne and tried Proactive. It did not do anything for me. A friend recommended Accutane and it worked 100% I keep recommending it since. The only downside: it&#x27;s very strong since it cleans out your pores and as a woman you cannot get pregnant for 1 year.</li>
            <li> Great produvt for acne care, it ist perfect for the skin and has to be the best option for acne.</li>
            <li> I have this a shot, but was not impressed. it didn&#x27;t make my skin any worse, but it also didn&#x27;t make any improvement. I&#x27;ve heard this works much better for people with very oily or at least non-sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve noticed that I only respond to organic products, so that could be the reason it didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize the advertisements for this product line are convincing, but honesty you&#x27;d be better off with juice beauty (makes your skin softer than you can imagine), or even just Purpose, which is available at the drug store and can be used as many times a day as you want. If you&#x27;re unsure after reading this review, then give Proactiv a try. At the very least, it won&#x27;t make your skin worse, and motivates you to wash your face more times per day.</li>
            <li> This product lives up to its reputation my teenage twins were starting to have a real problem with acne . I bought proactive for them and right away their skin started clearing up. Now their skin looks gorgeous. They love it.</li>
            <li> I have not ordered from this buyer, this is only a review of Proactiv.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very oily skin. I frequently get large, painful, ugly pimples on my cheeks and chin. I also have some dry spots. Proactiv works great for me. However, I do not use exactly as directed. It says to do step me, let face dry, step, let toner dry, then step three. This irritates my skin.  I remember when I used Proactiv years ago, it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin, so I tried doing it how I did back then, which was without reading the directions and doing one step immediately after another. This works much better for me. Letting my face dry between each step really irritates my skin but doing me step immediately after another is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I&#x27;ve used Proactiv before, I got lots of compliments. Someone even said to me: &amp;#34;you&#x27;re glowing! You must have a new boyfriend.&amp;#34; To I honestly replied, &amp;#34;no, I&#x27;ve been using Proactiv.&amp;#34; LoL cheese, I know, but true.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Proactiv kit for my two oldest children as they started having issues with pimples.  The product worked OK for one of my daughters and didn&#x27;t work at all for the other one.  In fact, it made her skin break out worse.  Also, for the daughter it did work for to some degree, the results weren&#x27;t really any different than what she got from other products that we purchased for a fraction of the cost at the local grocery store.  She still has some pimples, just not as many.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think Proactiv the product deserves a three-star rating since it really is just an average product.  However, I&#x27;m giving it a one-star rating due to the terrible business practices of the company that sells it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since January, they have been billing me for an amount that I don&#x27;t believe I owe.  I have contacted them numerous times to show them an accounting of my bank statements and products received and asking them for an accounting to justify the extra amount they&#x27;re charging me.  For 7 months they never provided that accounting and just kept sending me letters demanding money.  Finally, when they did send me a accounting, it was pages and pages long and filled with all kinds of verbiage, making it quite difficult to read and understand.  When I only purchased three kits from them, their detailed invoice seems to have a lot of superfluous and purposefully confusing detail to it.  The day after I received the detailed invoice, I received another shaming letter in the mail from Proactiv Solutions saying that because I never contacted them regarding my account, they&#x27;ll never do business with me again and any request made for their product will be denied.  What?  I&#x27;ve spoken with one of their representatives at least once a month since January! (Not that I want to do business with them anyway.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really can&#x27;t tell if the company is unscrupulous or just grossly disorganized, but I would recommend buying something else.  The results my family got just weren&#x27;t worth the price or the frustration.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this product. At the beginning you start seeing some improvement but your acne comes back!!! Also, this company test on animals which is a cruelty!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only product that helped me was Rugby Acne Medication, I recommended 100%!!!</li>
            <li> Ive tried all the products out there. So many of them dont work, or have really bad side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found proactive to really help my acne, (95% gone), and the only side effect I had was really dry skin. To counteract that I started using [[ASIN:B00L3KEIZO NuNutrients - Cucumber Eye Cream]] around my eyes and face and it REALLY helped with the dryness. My skin is really great now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Tara</li>
            <li> Used faithfully for 60 days with zero net improvement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy that I ordered this acne kit for my 15yr old daughter. She is suffering from bad case of acne and she has been tried everything to get rid of acne for almost 4yrs. She tried everything from counter top face cream, topical cream from doctor and homemade acv toner,raw honey etc... we both were frustrated and I decided to try this kit. It took about 2weeks to see it&#x27;s really working but surely I can see the positive result using this kit. I also ordered green tea moisturizer and She uses along with this kit. #1 will not last long so will order #1 itself with a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> WORKS  ON MY ADULT NEPHEW VERY WELL..</li>
            <li> I ordered the proactiv kit-- but all I received was an oversized cleanser-- and nothing else.  I am amazingly frustrated to have paid for a product-- and its shipping-- that was not what I ordered.</li>
            <li> To me Proactiv is worth the extra money. Ive been using it every am for over a month. AWESOME!!  My face has cleared up. Also feels so soft and smooth. Going to continue with it.</li>
            <li> I buy this in stores and get tiny bottles. This kit is a 90 days supply for the same price of the 30 day. Great buy.</li>
            <li> I used this on my 10 year old who is involved in sports and has a forehead breakout problem .....THIS PRODUCT WORKS .........give it a week to turn around and another for them to clear up.</li>
            <li> This works.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Paid more than if I would have just ordered it from the commercials. My mistake will not do that again.</li>
            <li> What was ordered, without the expensive local distributor prices. Works well so far. Clean/new (just the solutions, no documentation, exactly as posted, expiry at end of next year).</li>
            <li> I wish there was  more in the bottle the products are great and my face has had no blemish. Love it</li>
            <li> got my delivery early which was a great I was getting it for a gift.</li>
            <li> Long time user. Never disappoints!  Great product and easy to use. Our whole family has found success with it, not just the teenagers.</li>
            <li> I remember when my child was younger and ordered from ProActive that it was a negative option program (meaning they kept sending one each and every month regardless of actual usage).  My next in line wanted to try it but I wasn&#x27;t ready to give a long commitment so I found this on Amazon and am so happy.  We just want to see if it works, not commit for so long.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping,  got it exactly when I was supposed to,  authentic product,  just like the practive i remember, ( I thought it was going to be some type of micro, new and improved type, but it actually was the original, not the biggest deal to me though), thanks!</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY thing that has cleared up my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this out of sheer desperation. My thyroid was out of sorts and I started to get crazy hormonal acne. Previously, it was only my chin that would break out... But with the hormonal acne, I had horrendous cystic acne on my cheeks and it scarred. This product started to clear up my acne after about a week and a half. It did take a month or so to 100% clear up - but the difference was noticeable after 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few people that I know said that the product was too drying, but my skin is naturally oily so it just gives me a really clean feeling. This was definitely a skin saver for me. I still have the scarring but it is almost totally faded. Thankfully my makeup covers most of it up. I&#x27;m checking out the Proactiv scar treatment to see if that will help banish any hint of my cystic acne nightmare :)</li>
            <li> Delivery OK, shapes on the other hand the efficiency n is there not.&lt;br /&gt;J have use the same range 7 years ago and it had been effective but the product is reelement disappointing, no improvement</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products and keep coming back to this, it really works and keeps my face clear, what&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> My teenage son suffered horribly from acne so I gave this a try. It did nothing to help his acne at all. The hype of this product and the commercials sell it. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I took my son to a dermatologist and 3 months later he was acne free.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my aunt, i noticed that her breakout is getting better. She has less and less pimples now so they work.</li>
            <li> I have read a lot of things both pro and con about Proactiv, and decided to try it for my daughter who was suffering from a lot of image issues because of her severe acne.  My sister used the product years ago and had great results with it.  It does work.  I think the plus side is helped by the fact that there is a 3 product \\&quot;system\\&quot; that works together to help acne - cleanser, toner, treatment - so that you are cleaning your face and then putting product on a clean face that treats the acne.  The cleanser is one of the best on the market for acne, that&#x27;s the best part of the system.  My sister had amazing results, my daughter, not quite as dramatic.  I&#x27;ve read other reviews that said the earlier formula worked better, so that may be why my daughter didn&#x27;t have the same level of results, but there are also different types of acne, so some may take longer to treat.  I recommend sticking with it for at least 2 months before you make a final judgment, that&#x27;s when my daughter started to notice nice results.  The active ingredient in Proactiv is benzoyl peroxide, the same ingredient in all acne treatments.  I&#x27;m sure there are other products out there that are less expensive with 2.5% benzoyl peroxide, but you can run into a problem with mixing products - the varied ingredients in the different products can cause more irritation and allergic reactions (learned through experience).  The good part of Proactiv is that it was formulated to work together, so if you don&#x27;t have a reaction to the product when you first use it, you know you can safely use the entire system without adverse effects.  I found this to be the best all around acne treatment out there that is easy to follow and gives you results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending on the type of problem you have, the system will either give you noticeable results from the beginning, or it may take some time. Unfortunately for my daughter it wasn&#x27;t instant, but she did have good improvement over time. My daughter was disappointed thather acne didn&#x27;t clear up overnight, and was only slowly going away, so being a mom, I looked around for something that she could safely add to her routine. Another reviewer mentioned a great all-natural supplement [[ASIN:B004LJ0ZK6 ClearZine (2 Bottles) - The Top Rated Acne Treatment Pill. Eliminates Blotchiness, Redness, Blackheads and Zits]]. I tried this for my daughter and it is easily the best investment to go with Proactiv. The Clearzine supplement prevents acne as well as working from the inside-out to quickly clear up skin. There are probably a lot of good supplements you can pair with a Proactiv, but this one worked wonders for my daughter.  Both my daughter and I are very happy with the results of Proactiv - another plus is that she didn&#x27;t end up with dark blotches on her face when the acne cleared up.  It is so great to see my daughter smiling in photos now!</li>
            <li> I love the product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years. and the Shipper was quick.</li>
            <li> Almost exactly what you get in the store. It doesn&#x27;t come with the mask or the moisturizer, but it never said it did. Shipped in good time.</li>
            <li> bought this item in December and started using it in this year and it doing the opposite of what it should when expiry date was check it is almost expired don&#x27;t know  if that&#x27;s the reason</li>
            <li> Need I say More. Good Product. ADAM recommended this product. He&#x27;s the coach of one of my favourite JAMAICAN girl \\&quot;T/CHIN\\&quot; Winner of The Voice, my lovely wife uses the product so what&#x27;s there not to like about it.</li>
            <li> I gave this product three stars becuase I don&#x27;t beleive there is such thing as a &amp;#34;New Formula&amp;#34;.  I ordered this in hopes that the &amp;#34;New Formula&amp;#34; would work better than the &amp;#34;Old Formula&amp;#34;.  After comparing the ingredients on my old bottle of Proactive and the &amp;#34;New Formula&amp;#34; there was no difference.  The ingredients were exactly the same!!  I have been using Proactive for over a year now.  At first it cleared up my face.  After about two months of using it my face began breaking out again.  I tried to stop using Proactive and my face broke out even worse! This product will bleach your clothes, towels, sheets, pillowcases and any other fabric you may rub against while the product is on your hands or face.  Make sure to wash your hands thoroughly after applying it to your face and use only white towels, washcloths and pillowcases!  I would not recommend this product to my friends or family.  However I do like the Sulfur mask that Proactive makes.  I use that once a week and it seems to help.</li>
            <li> my wife loves it very much.  I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> arrived on time through it was small size</li>
            <li> This is an iffy one. I was expecting a miracle product and thus didn&#x27;t deliver.it comes with a scrub,a toner,and a moisturizer.i may just need to let this stop.i am very overweight and have a lot of other things going on but at least I tried.the best thing would be to work on being happy.proactive is just as good as a $1 soap.dont be fooled if you think this is going to give your skin an advantage they just want your money but they are ding that right because they scammed 40 dollars from me .2 stars!</li>
            <li> I do not know it was a gift.</li>
            <li> Works great! Use step 3 sparingly as it can cause peeling.</li>
            <li> I started using ProActive about ten years ago.  It cleared up all my skin problems.  I still use it to this day.</li>
            <li> This product appears to be controversially effective. Some people it works for some it doesn&#x27;t. That will always be the case with skincare. For me it took about 3 months for it to work effectively and now that it has I have WAY less breakouts and my skin look healthy. Big downside is that it stains your towels and bed sheets...I believe that is the peroxide in it, but you win some you lose some. It did dry out my face in the beginning but I just used moisturizer after every application. Skin adapted to it and now its all good. I do notice that after about a year of using it, it becomes less effective. In this case I usually switch to something else for a while but always end up coming back to it. I love that this product is offered on Amazon because dealing with ProActiv&#x27;s monthly plan is horrendous. God forbid you ever want to stop ordering it, boy its a fight!! So if you&#x27;re thinking of trying this out definitely go with ordering it yourself, not through the Proactiv website.</li>
            <li> My daughter says it works, but it is pricey for what you get and we are trying common drug store alternatives that seem to work nearly as well.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my nephew and he loves it!!! It is the actual Proactive product, not fake!</li>
            <li> Aside from the negative reviews I decided to get this to treat my adult acne related to hormonal/menstrual cycles. I tried Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Acne Gel Cleanser but that only worked for 2 months. The Proactiv Solution 3pc has eliminated my acne and has tamed it down a great deal! I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 weeks now and have not had a pimple as of yet. The scars remain but will probably have to try something else for that but will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Only problem is there is never enough.  I should buy this stuff in bulk with my growing boys.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my teenage children.  Seems to work well.</li>
            <li> This size was larger than I could get locally without having a subscription. I don&#x27;t go through this very fast. These will take almost a year to use up completely. I have been using Proactiv for over 10 years now.</li>
            <li> This acne treatment works wonders. My friend&#x27;s son face started clearing up overnight. He looks &amp; feels like a new person. Self esteem is shining through.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have extremely sensitive skin, but certain things make me break out. I was looking to clear up a little bit of acne, nothing crazy-a little around my chin and forehead but not much. These products dried out my skin it felt like leather! I didn&#x27;t even finish my one month supply and cancelled it! NOT FOR ME!</li>
            <li> I quit using Proactiv because I was getting frustrated with the automatic delivery and billing with Proactiv, but my skin started breaking out again. I knew I had to keep using it and was so happy I was able to order it here on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Proactiv Solution works very well.  Everyone I know who used it achieve very good results.</li>
            <li> Proactive worked for me years ago so I thought I&#x27;d try it again.  This time around it seemed to make my skin worse. Maybe it will work for you but it did not for me.</li>
            <li> What a wonderful price for a product that usually costs an arm and a leg.  Proactiv works if you use it as directed.  I would recommend it to anyone who isn&#x27;t lazy.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, but item sent was not what was listed. The old formula Proactiv was sent not the new formula, so now I have a SUPER over priced set of the old formula Proactiv. Seller does not respond to messages. Buyer beware!!!</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time.Regular soap works just as well,and is much cheaper....or opt for the over the counter items such as Clearasil etc..</li>
            <li> First off, I didn&#x27;t order Proactiv through this seller, but from the company website. I struggle with adult acne and I lived in a humid climate at the time. Not a good mix. I decided to try Proactiv due to all the advertising and reviews, hoping it would cure my teenage nightmare that was following me into adulthood.  At first, it cleared up my skin within 2 weeks. I used it correctly and thought, well hey, this is actually working. After a month, I started getting big zits here and there and thought, well I know my skin won&#x27;t be perfect so it must be normal. Fast forward another few months and I was still getting these huge zits here and there, which was different from my normal breakouts. My skin was starting to develop more fine lines at a quicker pace and it looked blotchy and dull. I used a moisturizer and it didn&#x27;t help. I decided to give my drier skin a break. O.M.G. I ended up breaking out horribly. I started using the treatments again, and it cleared somewhat, but I was still getting those zits and my lines were getting worse.  I dropped the product completely and had break outs worse than ever before.    I decided to get a facial and the esthetician asked me what I was using on my face. I told her Proactiv and she immediately said, \\&quot;That is the WORST thing you can use on your skin. It strips paint off walls. It works by drying out your face to the extreme and stripping it. Your skin needs balance and Proactiv is far from that. Once you stop using, you break out more. That&#x27;s how hey make their money and make you think it is working.\\&quot; She was dead on. She recommended I use a gentle face wash, spot treatment, a mineral based night cream to heal my poor skin.   I will NEVER waste money on their products again. They are expensive and although they have anti-aging products (which I have used), it is the same as all the rest and over priced. I did like the green tea moisturizer, I will give them that. Save your money and find some something with less chemicals. If your acne is out of hand, go see a dermatologist to get proper treatment.</li>
            <li> If you buy a sample of proactive you will commit yourself to endless charges to your credit card, this is the the most aggravating company on earth to do business with. They are billionaires because they have a system to steal our money through our credit cards and bank accounts.</li>
            <li> People constantly comment on how nice my skin looks when I use Proactive. I don&#x27;t have much acne and only get it occasionally but when I consistently use Proactive my skin looks less red, my pores are smaller and my skin is always clear!!! It&#x27;s a great product and never irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> Proactive works great for me, and when the kiosk at the local mall closed, I was forced to go online for it. The price is only relatively more expensive, but that&#x27;s fine. My only real problem is that when my package arrived, the toner was leaking. It doesn&#x27;t look like much is missing from the bottle, but everything was all sticky and messy. Better packaging is needed - a box rather that an envelope which is easily crushed. But proactive is still the only thing that works for me, so I will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> I hate proactive! There are too much harsh chemicals inside it. It dried out my skin like crazy and my breakouts got even worse!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use proactive but my wife does and I have never seen a company with poorer customer service. They forget orders, their customer service representatives don&#x27;t change addresses. If they make a mistake it could take them 2 months to correct the problem. They also have poor record keeping and over charge us. Rarely do I get so frustrated at a company but no one should trust this company. Great commercials good product despicable customer service.</li>
            <li> This product works wonders but just be careful when you order on line.  you think you&#x27;re doing a one time order  but they will bill you every 3 months and keep on sending you the product even without your permission.  they also send you a vitamin product which you didn&#x27;t order.  if you want to continue using the product you can purchase it at Walmart for the same price and avoid the hassle of being charged every 3 months.  Hassle to have it cancelled.</li>
            <li> If you have acne.. GET PROACTIV. Def worth it but it did take like 10 days to receive. TRY IT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never go to a kiosk again! I have been using Proactive for almost 15 years now. Originally, I bought through their mail-order plan, but that was AWFUL! The kiosks were a godsend, then ...AMAZON! Through the Kiosks, the expiration date was sometimes only 3 months after purchase! Now, it&#x27;s more than a year! Every shipment I&#x27;ve received has been excellent. Also, because I don&#x27;t need the &#x27;clay&#x27; add-on - I have 15 from previous purchases - it&#x27;s about $15 less-expensive! So, free shipping, saving lots of money, and the expiration date is at least a year! Great value. Same great product! For those who haven&#x27;t used Proactive, this is the basic set. It&#x27;s excellent when battling acne problems and/or other skin issues. You clense, &#x27;tone,&#x27; then apply the creme. USE SUNSCREEN if you will be in the sun. Any cleansing product will strip old skin and expose new, more vulnerable skin to the elements. So it&#x27;s a good idea to protect yourself, but more if you use this product! You WILL get great results! It does not eliminate acne. It just improves the situation. Food, allergies, and other auto-immune issues still apply - sorry. But this is one of the best products available! I have tried multiple &#x27;Proactiv replacements.&#x27; NONE of them worked as well as this. For the price, it&#x27;s more than worth a try.</li>
            <li> Great product at reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Working great! Great experience</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and bought it for my daughter this last time.  My experience if you work the program with all three products it does work but you must reorder to continue the benefits or you&#x27;re back at square one again.</li>
            <li> This is the best product ever for oily skin!! I&#x27;ve noticed a visible difference overnight!! I am a big fan of the entire range of products by Proactiv!!</li>
            <li> Not really Proactiv.&lt;br /&gt;The label colors are off, the print comes off.&lt;br /&gt;Clearly not a real product.&lt;br /&gt;May have been who I purchased it from, but still was Amazon Prime, so has to be Amazon approved?&lt;br /&gt;Not sure exactly what happened.&lt;br /&gt;Be careful. You&#x27;re better off ordering off the Proactiv website.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes they have better deals and a lot more freebies.&lt;br /&gt;The toner works...to an extent.&lt;br /&gt;The lotion seems to make my face drier.&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser......don&#x27;t even get me started on the cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;Not real, the beads are nonexistent. Clumps on face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not seem like the real product to me...or has been stored for years in someone&#x27;s basement. Who knows.</li>
            <li> Great value and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I thought I was going to get 3 months worth of this product.  The product is good but there&#x27;s a problem with it!  I couldn&#x27;t cancel the order!!!  Am I locked into the order forever???!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I learned that this order is an automatic, on-going thing, I tried to cancel it and even sent an email message to the email address on the invoice but I haven&#x27;t even received an acknowledgement, after  a month.  I just found out that my card was charged for the next shipment.  How long will this go on?  Beware everyone!!!</li>
            <li> I just wish that the toner size was larger in this pack because having a fluid ounce vs. solid ounce lasts totally differently in usage...so the toner runs out first then the cleanser, then the lotion. But this doesn&#x27;t affect the productivity of the product, just a personal opinion over years of using.</li>
            <li> It keeps her skin clear if she remembers to use it!  It&#x27;s a very non-greasy formula, and seems to clear up breakouts extra fast.</li>
            <li> Proactive didn&#x27;t work so well for me.  I had tried it years ago for a few days, but I couldn&#x27;t stand how oily it left my face feeling.  Then about 6 months ago I decided to give it a real shot and use it for more than just a couple uses.  My face never felt truly CLEAN after using the wash, felt oily and gross.  The acne treatment dries out my skin pretty bad.  But the odd thing about it is after a couple hours my skin is super oily.  It&#x27;s weird.  And I have noticed that when I do get acne and put the treatment on it the zit wont get a white head, instead it just peels of layers of skin at a time, leaving my with a dark spot and a small bump.  Which I don&#x27;t know whats worse, just letting the zit form and pop it, or having the weird aftermath of the acne treatment.  Anyways, maybe this product is good for some people but not me.  It is full of chemicals, and after years of using chemical acne wash I think I am going to go to an all natural product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Proactiv in the past and had to stop because it was too harsh on my skin. As I&#x27;m in my 30s and still get breakouts, i wanted to try it again since there was apparently a new, gentler formula. I noticed a big difference this times - cleared up my skin within a week and no flaking or peeling.</li>
            <li> thought these were regular size when I bought next time will check all info before purchasing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;delived fast, and I use but need to buy more in less time</li>
            <li> My daughter is already having problems with acne but our insurance doesn&#x27;t cover the dermatologist or acne RX so I tried this and it worked immediately.  She is washing her face and using it daily and is a much kinder gentler preteen.</li>
            <li> I initially tried this because I had given up on clearing my adult acne. I had seen a doctor who said they would give me an RX for it - which I&#x27;m not comfortable with (for reoccurring acne). I decided to try the Proactiv starter kit - sounds simple and easy.&lt;br /&gt;I found these products to be very small for such a big cost. And yes, they automatically billed my card for a second order *automatically* in 2 months. So I found myself with very small products, overly priced and figured I might as well try them - or just return them. I tried them, the combo of the acne fighting ingredients proved too strong for my skin. I went from bad adult acne (zits, pimples, redness) to cystic acne (large, deep painful zits). I returned the entire product, stopped membership and was returned all costs. But this took three tries over the phone to complete, it took over one billing cycle to see the full amount returned.</li>
            <li> This product absolutely without a doubt DOES NOT WORK! I used this once-twice a day for 2 months and it truly didn&#x27;t do a thing! Worst product ever! DO NOT BUY! Just a fair warning before you waste any money.</li>
            <li> Never buy this. The ads are deceiving. It can work on you, but don&#x27;t be tricked - it DOES NOT work for everyone. In fact, for most I would say it is ineffective or makes things worse.</li>
            <li> This is a professional formula &amp; I saw great results right away.  Other product leave my face feeling both sticky and dry; this is by far the best acne line I have ever tried!</li>
            <li> Been using proactive for over 6 years &amp; can definitely say this works for me. The acne I had was sporadic though. However if I stop using this I can get the occasional break out. But if I use this religiously Im good.  Used to break out a lot with MAC make up but now if I use proactive everyday have no problems. Also had a cystic cyst that was starting to develop on my thigh and I washed with proactive(it was like a 15 minute wash, just over and over for 15 minutes twice a day and the inflammation literally went away-of course a pustule never developd so I don&#x27;t know if I just caught it right on time, but yeah-that was good)</li>
            <li> Daughter has been using this faithfully. Her skin is much clearer without getting too dried out.</li>
            <li> This stuff worked pretty good for the first 2 months of using it, then it just stopped working and my acne went back to the way it was before. After a few more months of using it I gave up and started using something else. Now that I&#x27;m not using ProActive anymore my face is the clearest it&#x27;s ever been! The ads are very misleading and I have a feeling that the only way this stuff might have worked for me was if I used all the ProActive products (moisturizers, make-up, etc.), but that would&#x27;ve been far too expensive for me!</li>
            <li> He had good results with this product. So glad we did not order it from the website as we would have continued to recieve charges on our charge card.</li>
            <li> My grandson loves this. When he doesn&#x27;t use it, you can tell the difference in his skin breakout. He is quick to ask for more when he is running out. It is a little pricey, but this distributor has made it more affordable.</li>
            <li> Nice stuff-working well for my 14-yr old!</li>
            <li> Thats was the best 40 dolars ive ever spent.it works 100%</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter. Doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Proactiv since I was 13, I&#x27;m now 25 and it&#x27;s the only thing that helps with my acne. There were times that I didn&#x27;t use Proactiv but I always went back to it since it&#x27;s helped my skin the most. My skin type is very fair and it gets oily very easily. I&#x27;ve never had very bad acne (such as cystic) but I have gotten lots of pimple at once in certain areas of my face. I&#x27;ve always gotten compliments on my skin and I really have to say it&#x27;s because of Proactiv. I also use it with my Clarisonic mia brush to help with deeper cleansing and wrinkles. I usually use this once a day at night, for some people using it twice a day makes their skin too dry. I have heard that once you use Proactiv and try to use other products they won&#x27;t work, so you have to keep using Proactiv. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve always had to go back to Proactiv and why it&#x27;s the only thing that seems to work. It has given me a better complexion and with this three piece set it can last me over 2 months. I would tell people to give it a shot if they haven&#x27;t and have tried everything to help their acne. If it doesn&#x27;t work you can always send it back. None of my bottles were expired either and they were all sealed upon receiving them. A warning for people who have never used this. Make sure you use a white towel and wear a white shirt, tank, or an old shirt due to them getting discolored due to some of the ingredients. I finally realized why my towels got discolored and shirts, please remember this.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping great product good condition thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it in the past, and then would stop, and the breakouts would begin again. My skin doesn&#x27;t stay clear without it! It is a must in my daily beauty routine. And buying through Amazon, you&#x27;re not locked in to a 3 month supply, and so on.</li>
            <li> I guess this was just too strong for my skin. When I started using it, my face was one huge fine rash. When I stopped my face cleared up.</li>
            <li> Proactiv is the only facial-cleaning product that completely clears-up my daughter&#x27;s acne, so she loves it! And, I have discovered that purchasing this product on amazon.com is cheaper than buying directly from the manufacturer, plus it alleviates the manufacturer&#x27;s auto-renewal, or my having to call and cancel until such time as my daughter needs me to re-order this for her. GO AMAZON!</li>
            <li> Proactive product works very well!! it is the real product and is much better to order from amazon then from them directly since it is almost impossible to cancel your account and they charge you every 3 months...will be ordering from here again</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy proactiv at first. Seeing all the infomericals on tv and I said to myself this couldn&#x27;t be true...but why not give it a try. I am putting everything else on my face why not proactiv? So I ordered it and within days I noticed my dark spots on my chin diminishing that I had for years! I couldn&#x27;t beilive it...in just days. I used to wear dermablend just to cover them up, now I barely feather on my makeup. I also noticed the texture of my skin is a lot smoother after each continued use as stated on the bottle my skins glowing. I love it! And wouldn&#x27;t trade it for anything. If your a skeptic like me, just give it a try....</li>
            <li> Product works well but bottle are more like sample sizes  . . .read oz.&lt;br /&gt; carefully, I wish I did! LOL</li>
            <li> im not gonna lie this product does work its just too expensive , however after a while it will stop working , I used it for 2 years and it stopped working , I currently can never get m eyebrows waxed because the chemicals in it made my face sensitive , so my skin comes off with the wax ..... beware , just go to your local dermatologist instead</li>
            <li> Works very well for clear skin. The price is worth it. My junior high age daughter loves this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it is just as good as the newer products offered by Proactiv, plus, it is less expensive</li>
            <li> the product is great and works well, the only thing is that on the STEP 1 bottle, the writing fell/washed off which was odd.</li>
            <li> nice product, fast shipping and good deal</li>
            <li> Came as described on Amazon. But after a couple times of using, the lids on all 3 bottles broke.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!&lt;br /&gt;It took two/three months to start working but once it did it was like POOF overnight. My acne got smaller and less red then overnight gone. And as long as I do it once a day (but I try for twice) then my face stays clear.  I&#x27;m so happy, I&#x27;ve always wanted clear skin and not to have to put make-up on. My acne has been bad since I was 10 and I tried a lot of meds, I wanted to try this for a long time but didn&#x27;t like the price, but I finally gave in and I&#x27;m happy I did!!&lt;br /&gt;I did try the new proactiv plus and went back to the old. The plus is to rich and broke me out all over again. The old had my face looking great again in two weeks.</li>
            <li> love this product. have been using it for 13 years and i will never use anything else</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used quite a few different products within the proactiv line for acne and skin care. I will be the first to tell you they didn&#x27;t all work very well for me. A couple actually did more damage than they did good. Drying out my face, giving me painful cracked skin, and in some cases making my acne worse.    This system really did not do much for me other than stopping new acne from forming. And to be honest I stopped using it and really didn&#x27;t even notice much of a difference.    The best acne treatment I have used is Treeactiv which is a tea tree oil acne medication -    [[ASIN:B00LFT0CFI TreeActiv+ Tea Tree Oil Acne Solution for Advanced Acne Treatment &amp;#x2605; All Natural Acne Spot Treatment &amp;#x2605; Blemishes Gone or Your Money Back!]]    Nothing else I have used to date has the ability to eliminate pimples within a day or two of applying it. Not too mention it is so much less expensive than these proactiv products that are literally just sitting on my counter now not being used. If you are trying to rid your face of acne I would recommend treeactiv and a good tea tree oil based face wash.</li>
            <li> shipped quickley  very satisfied</li>
            <li> The ONLY thing that keeps my daughter&#x27;s skin clear. We have tried everything and this is IT.</li>
            <li> I love proactive, but am sick of being over charged, trying to deal w/their overzealous sales techniques, &amp; all. Proactive works better than I ever imagined, but I was sick of dealing w/the company, so I cancelled, 6 months later they began sending &amp; billing again. I&#x27;m still waiting to be reimbursed...I said never again,but it&#x27;s amazing to know I can get some here, &amp; my skin won&#x27;t have to suffer. I hope you continue, &amp; I can get what I need &amp; spread the word that there&#x27;s no need to suffer through the pushy tella marketers &amp; all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this, because I know I&#x27;m probably not the only person in their 20&#x27;s with acne and the beginnings of wrinkles at the same time! I cannot use this product twice daily or even daily, but I found a way that really works for me.  I&#x27;m writing this for anyone else who is as desperate as I have been... maybe this will work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had minor skin problems as a teenager, but I&#x27;ve really struggled with acne in my 20&#x27;s (I&#x27;m 26). My skin is very sensitive, it breaks out when the weather changes, I&#x27;m under stress, PMSing, or there&#x27;s a full moon (kidding...). I have cabinets full of products! I had used Proactiv as a teenager (when I *thought* I had acne), and I remembered how quickly I got results, so I tried it again about 6 months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I don&#x27;t have the skin of a 13 year old any more! I definitely *cannot* use this product as directed.  When I tried, my face looked like it had chemical burns!  However, I have found that I can use the face scrub 1-2 times a week or when I notice my face is starting to break out(essentially to exfoliate), and the repairing lotion as more of a \\&quot;zit-zapper\\&quot;. I almost never use the toner. Using this, in combination with Aveeno&#x27;s calming wash and lotion works really well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am ordering it again, because the occasional use makes a huge difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance.  I have tried using some of the generic versions and other products, in a similar fashion, but have not had good results. Approximately $40 every six months or so is money well spent!</li>
            <li> Proactive has been a part of my life for a few years and I always get the best results from it.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work at all. All it did was dry my face and the acne was still there. It was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> My daughter is currently using it and I will have to get back to you on results. Looks good so far and just the fact that she is doing something about her acne makes her feel better than just waiting it out for it do magically disappear.</li>
            <li> In choosing a Proactiv purchase off of Amazon, I chose one based on the title of this product, &amp;#34;New Formula&amp;#34;. When I received my shipment, I found out it was not the &amp;#34;New Formula&amp;#34;, it was the old formula. I kept the product, but I do not appreciate the false advertisement. I will not purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> this product made me break out in a rash at any place that i applied it. i just can&#x27;t use the proactiv.  i wish i hadn&#x27;t wasted my money.</li>
            <li> This formula is a waste of money. While I was using it, I didn&#x27;t see any significant difference, but when I quit it, my acne came back much worse.&lt;br /&gt;This product is designed to keep you a long term customer, because even if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, it is designed as such to make your acne worse when you quit it. If you don&#x27;t believe this, research it online.</li>
            <li> If I found a similar product that helped my face, I would jump ship immediately.  While this does help my face it produces a few other unwanted issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. For one, I greatly dislike how much this bleaches items.  I exercise a lot and thus sweat a lot.  I have to be very careful to not stain all my colored clothing that drips off my face.  I now always keep a white towel and have to unlearn the habit of wiping my sweat off on my sleeve when it gets close to my eyes.  It also dawns on me that while this product is helping my image, in the back of my mind I&#x27;m always thinking of how harmful repeat use of something that can bleach out clothing can be on my skin...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It definitely clears out the patches of acne I used to get, but it does give me 2-3 large and very deep zits.  They are painful and very tender.  If I stop this product, I get a few of the patches back but the deep impacted zits seem to disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I am happy to see this product on amazon so I can get back to managing my acne though I am on the look for a new product.  I originally used this product straight from Proactiv but I found that I was using much more of one of the step bottles over others.  I tried to change a few things in my subscription but they were unable to accommodate.  I then attempted to end the subscription but they run the same scam many other companies are running by allowing you to sign up easily online for their subscription product but making you call in to cancel it which &#x27;may or may not&#x27; go through their system since its all done over the phone (ie, no record of you trying to cancel).  I personally feel it should be illegal to allow online membership that also doesn&#x27;t allow cancellation.  I struggled for over 4 months to get that account shut off.</li>
            <li> It works for me. My skin is getting better now. I think i should keep using it and recommend it to my friends with acne issues.</li>
            <li> not sure it worked as great as all the infomercials say it did.  my teen used it for about a month and then stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Bf bought this and it really does work but it wasnt wroth the prices it could be a lil cheaperbut it fir help with hus acne</li>
            <li> Great buy.... Items came In on time in perfect condition I been using it for almost a month I still have more then half the bottle left I only wash my face once a day before bed time and I am completely satisfied with the results I started noticing the difference within the 1st week I recommend.</li>
            <li> only product that works for me. fast shipping and twice as much product for the price. it lasts me a little more than two months</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re thinking that you&#x27;re buying the new micro-cystal formula, but you&#x27;re not.  I was warned by many reviews but didn&#x27;t listen because I wanted the cheaper price. And I did get the older formula.  But, I didn&#x27;t feel too bad, becuase even though it was the old formula it was a good deal.</li>
            <li> Son says it doesn&#x27;t wirk</li>
            <li> This is the only skincare I use for my oily skin. Keeps it clear all the time.</li>
            <li> It is not a 60 day supply. False advertising&#x3D;three stars.</li>
            <li> my son loves this product. It definitely works and helps his self esteem!</li>
            <li> My son is 14.5. He breaks out if he does not use Proactive. I bought the #1 recommended system at a local store. He breaks out more with it. This really does work. It is pricey, but not having damaged skin as an adult is well worth the cost now.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t what I thought it will be</li>
            <li> Happy with the result . My teenage Sons face cleared up.</li>
            <li> Hello there,&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for sending me the Proactiv. I love Proactiv! It really clears my face up :) Thank you so much!&lt;br /&gt;Elizabeth Mainor</li>
            <li> My current routine which keeps my skin looking good and mostly clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use the Proactiv 3 step system morning and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morning-then use Proactiv oil-free moisturizer with spf and I use Mario Badescu oil-free moisturizer in the dryer areas.&lt;br /&gt;Night-use the Proactiv blemish spot treatment on any blemishes then use either Argan oil or Jojoba oil all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2-3 times a week I exfoliate using Olive oil mixed with sugar. Works great and is natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This routine works for me.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the Mario Badescu moisturizer over the Proactiv one but with summer coming the Proactiv one will be good since it is more lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*******************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hoping this review will help others who are debating trying Proactiv: here I share my experience with the products and company.&lt;br /&gt;I have fair, oily skin and moderate acne, not cystic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company:&lt;br /&gt;I have had no issues with Guthy-Renker. I order from them and if I want my shipments spaced out, I just call and they will do it.&lt;br /&gt;Cancelling is not an ordeal. I have cancelled twice in the past 2 years because I wanted to try some other products and they cancelled when I called, with no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product:&lt;br /&gt;Proactiv just works for me, better than any other product I have tried. I have used it on and off for the past 9 years.&lt;br /&gt;I follow the routine and if my face gets dry I use a bit less and add additional lotion, such as their green tea moisturizer. I will also not scrub so hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, each time I have gone back to Proactiv my face did break out. This happens when starting most acne products, in my experience. But after the initial couple of weeks to month of breaking out, my skin clears up and looks great-not perfect, as I will occasionally still get a zit or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What other products I have tried and why did I try others when Proactiv works for me?&lt;br /&gt;I tried other products because I wondered \\&quot;maybe something else will work, perhaps it will be less expensive or not be as drying, or will be more natural.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried the following within the last 2 years but ended up going back to Proactiv because it just works best for me&lt;br /&gt;Dermologica, Acnefree, Mario Badescu (regular line and acne kit)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mario Badescu acne kit helped but still let blackheads and breakouts.</li>
            <li> I purchase over and over.  My skin is very clear.&lt;br /&gt;I will suggest that you find out what is triggering your flare-ups because no product will be 100% successful if your skin is sensitive to certain types of foods.  My triggers were excess salt, too many refined carbs and later discovered I was allergic to dark chocolate and certain dairy products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I can actually walk around without make-up with no problem at all!</li>
            <li> was allergic to it could not use it</li>
            <li> Worked out great, not a knock off</li>
            <li> My partner has a bad acne problem. He&#x27;s used a lot of over the counter medications but says this works the best and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> we received your product and after using the product for a couple of days has been very satisfied &amp; happy about the condition of her facial skin and how smooth &amp; soft her skin is</li>
            <li> The solution burned my skin and when brought the problem to the company, they ignored my concern. Plus, they enrolled me in a subscription service without my consent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are much better products available at a much lower cost. I&#x27;d recommend the products at Target over anything from this company.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I purchased for my teen-age grandson.  Its working much better than other brands he has tried.  After one week I could see a difference.</li>
            <li> Proactive has changed their product to a new formula which was ineffective with my skin type. I don&#x27;t think I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Proactiv is great. I don&#x27;t really have skin issues, but I still like using it since it makes your skin look great. I would recommend it to anyone, actually.</li>
            <li> I found out from our dermatologist that this is basically benzoyl peroxide which you can buy the generic at CVS for much, much less. it is not worth the $$$$$$</li>
            <li> I gave this product as a gift in the hopes it does what it claims.  I did not like the push to automatically  buy the product every month.  Had a hard time canceling it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT&lt;br /&gt;The solutions work great&lt;br /&gt;so far 3 days been seeing great results&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had acne for 3 years with no hope remaining :)&lt;br /&gt;Worth the money for it works !</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my teenage granddaughter.  She began using it and the results were almost immediate and very pleasing to her!</li>
            <li> Not that impressed, didn&#x27;t clear up my skin, I like the new version better. I guess everyone is a little different, may work for others just not me, not strong enough.</li>
            <li> You have to exfoliate a lot w/ this product, but it definitely works!!!!!!  Worked for my sister and I, I can&#x27;t wait to see what the new package will deliver in reality.  Would pay twice as much for it!</li>
            <li> This stuff works well enough. The only drag is it is rather time consuming and if you don&#x27;t stick with it, your skin appear to look worse than before. This is only a perception of course. It&#x27;s just that once you see how clear your skin can look, you just cringe when you skip the routine and see how your skin used to look. It&#x27;s not that your skin looks worse, it&#x27;s just that you are used to a new standard. Lol.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 13 yr old daughter who was experiencing major breakouts.  Product is definately clearing her up!  I think the product is worth it</li>
            <li> It worked fine with my son , the secound time he used it , it already started the job and in one week his face was clean and clear , i would recomend it for everybody</li>
            <li> DO NOT ORDER FROM GUTHY RENKER! If you are just here for the reviews before you decide to order the infomoercial special DON&#x27;T. All I feel like saying about Proactiv is I like the toner, the cleanser and lotion are ok but I found I never wanted to use them. Made my skin feel gross and I hate exfoliating micro beads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for Guthy Renker. I am only going to add to the current rant. I have had the same experience with Guthy Renker sending me packages and not cancelling my account. I reported my card lost in hope they would stop sending packages. I called, emaailed, and chatted with customer service and still they refuse to cancel my account. They just lie and say it is cancelled. For a few YEARS I just conceded to refusing delivery of the package when I checked my PO Box. Usually I would get a bill but the charges would be cleared after they received my return. THIS WENT ON FOR YEARS! I couldn&#x27;t get them stop. Thankfully I had the heads-up to report my debit card lost so they couldn&#x27;t take my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I moved, a package was forwarded by the Post Office to my new address. They held the package at the Post office and left me a delivery note in my mailbox. The Post Office returned the package after I failed to pick it up after 14 days. Guthy Renker sent me bills/delinquent notices for a time (no more packages yay!). Now they are using a scam collection agency called North Shore Agency (the NSA is after me! lol). I have thrown out all of the letters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I am waiting to see if they will actually take legitimate action to recover their fraudulent debt. They claim I owe $57.25. I am not going to pay it. I failed to notify them of anything. We will see if they will sell their scam debt account to an actual collection agency. I am betting they will do no such thing and that they just want to bully me into paying a false debt. I will check my credit report soon to see if it comes up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re skeptical look at the other proactivreviews. Use Google: Guthy Renker scam, Proactiv scam, Bare Minerals scam. In fact, type scam with anything associated to Guthy Renker and you will find endless pages of people that have had problems dealing with this company. Don&#x27;t get these products from the infomercial number or website. Use Amazon or retail store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try this for acne prone skin: theoilcleansingmethod.com This page simply states some information and is not selling any product. It describes a way to cleanse the skin with castor oil. I haven&#x27;t tried it just yet but I will soon. Currently, I do not use soap or cleansers of any kind on any skin. I take a warm shower and gently dry off with a clean towel. At night I splash a bit of warm water on my face and gently dry with a high-quality towel. My acne is much better since I stopped using cleansers. Especially on my chest and back. I have had zero acne on my chest and back since I quit using body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 10/3/2012&lt;br /&gt;So, I filed a complaint with BBB. I was very thorough in describing all of my dealings with Guthy Renker to the BBB. GR responded:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Company&#x27;s Initial Response - Posted 10/02/2012&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for contacting Guthy|Renker through the Better Business Bureau. We received your inquiry and sincerely apologize for any miscommunication. We take these complaints very seriously and appreciate the time you have taken to let us know about your experience. Our records indicate that on December 21, 2011, your third Proactiv® shipment, a 60-Day 4 piece supply, was sent for a total of $57.75, which remained unpaid. Our records further indicate that on March 28, 2012, we received this shipment back to our facility, but as it was received outside our 60-Day Money-Back Guarantee, no return credit was issued at that time. You were sent monthly invoices requesting payment and, on September 11, 2012, your $57.75 balance was transferred to collections. In an effort to fully resolve this matter, I have cleared the $57.75balance and contacted SKO Brenner American collections agency to have your account removed from their records. Please consider any invoices received after the date of this correspondence as having crossed in the mail. Your Proactiv® account is now closed with no further balance due. Nothing further will be shipped or billed.&lt;br /&gt;Initial Response Summary&lt;br /&gt;I have cleared the $57.75 balance owed. Your account is closed with no further balance due. Nothing further will be shipped or billed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yay! no more BS from Guthy Renker! No more collections or worrying about my credit! I can finally breath a sigh of relief! ahhhhh... If you have been harassed by this company as I have, know that you have some recourse and can get justice. I hope this helps others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other peoples reviews about this product and I will agree that Proactiv customer service sucks. But I am only writing this review based on the product itself. I have been suffering from acne darn near all my life I am now 30 and Ive tried it all literally. My acne was never cystic I just had bad acne break outs not only on my face but on my back arms and chest. I had cheap parents who never would invest money in this product for me so I got stuck with the usual prescription stuff. I had enough of using everything out there so I resorted to ACCUTANE, Accutane worked it got rid of all the acne but now that I think about it it was the worse thing I could have put into my body, Accutane was taken off the market and linked to too many illnesses and permanent problems. When I myself was able to afford Proactiv I tried it and it freakin works. I think everyones skin is different. I have very oily skin and breakout more so now during my period. I use this product night and day and you have to use the three step together for it to work. I tried just using the cream with different face washes and it doesnt work as good. For me this product works its not harsh on my face it doesnt over dry my face it doesnt burn its just perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Proactiv for a couple of years now. Overall it&#x27;s been good to my skin. Also, when I ordered this product, I received a bonus tube of the refining mask (I don&#x27;t think that the product description says that it&#x27;s included), so I&#x27;m pretty happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Good product.did Wat it is supposed to do, greatly recommended to anyone with breakout issues, try it &amp; be worry free</li>
            <li> My skin type is &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;--not particularly dry nor oily, not even in the &amp;#34;T-zone.&amp;#34; I usually use salicylic acid-based cleansers and Ponds oil-base moisturizer to keep my skin acne-free and moist. In the last few weeks, however, I&#x27;ve been experiencing some mild to moderate break-outs on my upper back, neck, and at the corners of my mouth and in front of my ears on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My normal skin care routine wasn&#x27;t helping the these frequent break-outs (generally surface-level blemishes with some cystic). My boyfriend had success with Proactiv when he was young with his cystic acne, so I decided to give it a try. I ordered Proactiv and used the full three-step treatment twice a day for two days, and on the third day I awoke with red, very dry skin all over my face. Since then I have stopped using Proactiv and have been using moisturizers regularly to try to restore the moisture to my skin. Though I haven&#x27;t used Proactiv in a few days, my face has completely cleared of acne, though the extreme dryness is persistent. My upper back and neck have cleared a little and are not dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand that Proactiv typically works very well for people with oily skin, and I recognize now I should not have used the product even daily with my non-oily skin. Moving forward, after the extreme dryness subsides, I plan to use Proactiv once every few days rather than daily. I may also only apply step 3 directly onto blemishes and/or small problem areas, because I think leaving the benzol peroxide on my non-oily skin may be a significant contributor to the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, I think Proactiv may work best for oily skin, and if you do not have oily skin, use with caution and moderation.</li>
            <li> One of the complaints I&#x27;ve read about Proactiv is that it can cause skin irritation. I experienced this myself when I first started to use it. In fact a number of people commented that my face looked sunburned. After some research on the Proactiv website I concluded that I had used too much of the product. So I stopped using it for a week then gradually started to use it again in smaller amounts until I reached the recommended amount. Right now I&#x27;m using it once a day with very good results. My skin still has a breakout here and there but is much improved. There is no longer any irritation or sunburned look.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend Proactiv. And if you have trouble with irritation don&#x27;t give up right away. Backing off the product for a week (or until the irritation goes away)  then using small amounts and increasing those amounts over time may work for you as it did for me.</li>
            <li> I have been exploring so many different ways to get rid of my acne and blemishes, and I keep seeing this stuff on TV so I thought I would try it.  Like everything out there that uses harsh chemicals (e.g. Salicylic Acid and others), it burns when you apply it.  This stuff was no different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, for those that don&#x27;t want to be a test bunny like I made myself, I found some other options that don&#x27;t hurt and actually work. A friend of mine tried Pomada, but it contains sulfur, and I am allergic. So I kept looking and found a product that I can&#x27;t find anywhere else...it&#x27;s called Powderma.  Great stuff and it&#x27;s gentle on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway...Best of luck to those that are still torturing themselves with this stuff.  I had to get out of the no pain, no gain mentality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product about 3 weeks now and I&#x27;m already starting to see some improvements. It was much needed and I&#x27;m very glad I made the decision to order these!</li>
            <li> i love this stuff... not much else to say, but to keep on top of actually using it: but it works like no other!</li>
            <li> I bought the Proactive kit for my daughter.  Her skin has never looked more lovely.  Great product and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love the proactive system. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> So amazing and it help to me a lot!</li>
            <li> This company is a complete scam. As others have stated once you put your order through, they will not leave you alone. They have terrible customer service. I called and their human resources told me my order would be canceled not to worry about it. I was puzzled because she didn&#x27;t even ask for my information so how would she know who I was? Surely enough, a couple days ago I get charged again by them on my credit card. I am still in the process of trying to cancel my orders with them. They will put you through a run around and you won&#x27;t get anywhere. STAY AWAY!! You&#x27;ve been warned.</li>
            <li> Yes.  This is a great deal for the Proactiv Solution Kit which includes the 3 Steps.  The cleanser is Step 1, toner is Step 2, and repairing treatment lotion is Step 3.  I have been using this kit for several years and can&#x27;t go without this product.  I occasionally have acne breakout, but it is much milder acne because I use Proactiv.  I do run out of product and that is when I have break outs.  I usually buy each Proactiv Step separately, because Step 2 and Step 3 last longer than Step 1 does.  If I find a great deal on whole 3pc kit, I will opt for the kit.  Amazon has great deals and prices, just be sure to check the shipping charges as well.  I would definitely recommend this product and be sure to check for expiration dates, especially for Step 1.</li>
            <li> I have used Proactiv for years, and it helped to clear up my serious acne, along with getting my digestive system balanced.  My skin looks better when I use this.</li>
            <li> Within a couple days I&#x27;ve seen the amount of acne on my face drastically reduced. This product works great on my skin. Its a bit pricy but it works.</li>
            <li> I had acne but since I started using proactiv they eventually started to fade away. Now I have a clear skin!</li>
            <li> My son suffers from cystic acne, this system keeps his condition manageable and believe me he has tried everything on the topical market.</li>
            <li> I tried this for a few weeks, my skin cleared up a bit after several days but then it stopped making progress so i got off of it and it made everything worse, I broke out a whole lot.</li>
            <li> This product is not worth the money.When a new zit comes up you put this product on it simply turns the zit red and takes a week to work.I am canceling my subscription.</li>
            <li> i got my shipment today thinking i was gone get what i paid for only to find out the the treatment number 3 was just refilled with lotion I AM SO MAD I WANT MY MONEY  BACK</li>
            <li> Does  what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> It works great for oily skin. Otherwise it drys you out</li>
            <li> I was really excited when i got this product, but when i went to go use it, my face started to burn, and it got really red, and itchy.</li>
            <li> 100% worth it. I have searched everywhere for a cheap way to battle acne, and this is it. With my face, I wash it once a day meaning that I can make this 60 day kit last WAYYYY longer. Spending only $30+ for a face system that lasts at least 8 months? Uh yes please.</li>
            <li> Excellent speed of delivery. Came with exactly the contents specified.</li>
            <li> This has worked pretty good for my teenage son.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne for over 10 years now.  I&#x27;m 24 years old and my acne is just now starting to really subside.  My worst years were my early teens, it seemed like back then there was nothing I could do to put a stop to it.  I tried Oxy, Clearasil, Clean &amp; Clear, Murad, Proactiv, everything.  I even tried all natural remedies which surprisingly worked, but only for so long.  The only things I&#x27;ve ever done that truly helped my skin clear up was eliminating milk from my diet, and starting to eat healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the milk thing isn&#x27;t true in everyone, so don&#x27;t take it to heart.  Milk, and other dairy products contain hormones from cows that can cause adverse affects in some humans.  For me, and many others, it causes cystic acne.  This is the type of acne that develops deep in the pores of your face and develop zits that are very large and painful.  Typical surface acne comes from sweat, dirt, and other things clogging a pore on the surface of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed when I quit eating foods that are obviously bad for you, fried foods, burgers, pizza, things like that, my face started to look better.  It started looking great when I started drinking A LOT of water throughout the day.  Water, even in excess helps cleanse your system, and keep you hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not advocating that everyone go out and be vegan to get flawless skin, I&#x27;m just saying try to watch what you eat.  For the everyday person I know eating healthy 100% of the time is financially impossible, but eating some or most of the time isn&#x27;t.  You can enjoy the weekends out at your favorite restaurants, or the occasional movie night with pizza, just don&#x27;t make it an every other day kind of thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know fighting acne always seems like an uphill battle, but these medicines that we scold when they don&#x27;t work miracles on us, its not their fault.  Just like with exercising, where looking better starts in the kitchen, same thing here.  Try altering your diet and see what theresults are, you may be more surprised than you&#x27;d think.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it and using it, I still have pretty much every pimple I had to start. Some have decreased a small portion, some look the same. The only 2 differences is: 1, my face looks a bit softer and less oily. 2, my face is extremely dry and flakey and the skin can even be peeled off. Note it: I do have very sensitive skin so maybe that enhances the dryness. I am an 18 year old male. Disappointed nonetheless.</li>
            <li> She states that it works great, thank you, size was a little small compared to bottles seen at the mall</li>
            <li> It may seem at first that this product works but I have to wonder if it isn&#x27;t \\&quot;skin cell confusion\\&quot; with the use of a new product. Within a short time, it seems to cause dark, permanent spots to appear where a pimple has formed and attempted to heal.  Not only in my daughter&#x27;s case, but also for TWO daughters of a friend.  (I will say in time--several months and the discontinuation of this product) the brown spots disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their practice/policy on \\&quot;automatic shipments\\&quot; is also risky to start because it can be a bear of a job to S*T*O*P the shipments and charges to your credit card.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, as a nurse, I was most concerned about the \\&quot;side effects\\&quot; (i.e., the brown spots) and what happened to my daughter several months into the program.  Her face was itching one night but she didn&#x27;t get up and look in the mirror.  By morning, her face was all HIVES and her eyes were swollen closed.  She was home alone and had trouble getting a hold of me but eventually took Benedryl and applied ice packs to her face. Her face remained swollen and red for about 3 days then continued to have red blotches for many days after that, including swollen, red eyelids that looked like she had not slept for days. I realize that was a personal reaction but....it seems to me that a product designed by \\&quot;two doctors\\&quot; should have some hypoallergenic qualities to it better than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proceed at your own risk....was a personal reaction but....it seems to me that a product designed by \\&quot;two doctors\\&quot; should have some hypoallergenic qualities to it better than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proceed at your own risk....</li>
            <li> I have purchased this for my 14 year old son and within a week, we have seen that his face is starting to clear up.  He is going on his second week with it and likes this product.</li>
            <li> It worked okay but was very expensive. It has 2.5% Benzoil Peroxide and you can buy 10% Benzoil Peroxide at a druggist for under $6.00.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item on Amazon for my teenage son.  We had purchased directly through Proactive the first time.  The product has had great results on his skin.  I saved a lot of money with the purchase on Amazon.  Same product, no automatic renewal tricks and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this product for my mother which has a crazy acne break out once in a while, great way of controlling it with this product, just make sure you use it very often as a break out might happen after some days of no usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty sure people have a basic understanding of this product since it has been featured on the television and online.</li>
            <li> Was the real thing, only down point is that its costing twice what you would pay if you ordered it off the tv</li>
            <li> i bought the 3 step system throu their website years ago and it was very annoying, they would ship it every other month and charge me 70 something dollars, i would be finishing the face wash, then have left over toner, and treaetment, i had extra bottles lying around!! now i can buy it when i need it and its much cheeper than buying from the mall!!!</li>
            <li> When I got poractive  m y face was so clear like it take2weeks to create 123 poractive thing worked I&#x27;m just so happy that I did not waste my money and just get on and they gave me five thing free just call at1_800_985_4200 call just call</li>
            <li> Description said NEW Formula. Received the old one.</li>
            <li> Been using it for years</li>
            <li> My daughter is going through her teenage acne phase and we wanted to find something simple but powerful that will help clear her skin. Within a week of using Proactiv, we saw immediate results such as fading of dark marks, clearing of bumps, and an even tone of her complexion.</li>
            <li> I like this company&#x27;s product. It is high quality product, and the price and quality ratio contained in the product is great. I like it</li>
            <li> This is like liquid gold but better because it removes acne. I used to have awful acne but after about 6 months of use I saw real progress and now 2 years later my face is as smooth a a babies butt. I really recommend.</li>
            <li> Good product and shipping was faster than stated. Does not work as well as stated on TV but wife continues to use it so it as at least serviceable.</li>
            <li> nothing else has worked but proactiv really does i recommend this to any one with any type of acne troubles</li>
            <li> Proactive solution is a great product and I recommend it to everyone. The best part about ordering on Amazon is there is no autoship. You order it when you want it, and the price is right.</li>
            <li> EFFECTIVE. Minimized my acne scars. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to all people with acne symptoms. costly but worth it, the results are always clearly seen.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok it&#x27;s a try and see product. Some people say it works for them some said it don&#x27;t, I think it depends on you as a person, your skin type and how bad the acne is. I think this is for minor acne. For severe acne I suggest you see a doctor if you can afford to. Yes it removed the smaller acne. Then it turned the larger acne into real bad dark spots. So now we have to find another product to remove the spot.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 16 yr old. It has really worked. My 19 yr old refused to try it as she heard from friends it didn&#x27;t work for them and we went straight to the dermatologist who gave prescriptions for expensive treatments that didn&#x27;t work that well for her, given the price. She will be using this once she gets home from college.</li>
            <li> After dealing with adult acne that could only be a plague sent down by vindictive demi-gods, using various OTC treatments and prescription antibiotics, only to have the epic eruptions return, I tried the &amp;#34;As Seen of TV&amp;#34; ProActive. And it worked. The end.</li>
            <li> As a person with hereditary acne I&#x27;ve tried damn near everything out there prescribed by dermatologists. I was even on accutane for several months as a teen. It was expensive, had to not eat certain things and had to do blood work every so often. I found out about Proactiv about 8 years ago. I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. I use it in the morning after getting up and just before bed. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I won&#x27;t ever be free of dealing with acne but with Proactiv, I won&#x27;t dread looking at myself in the mirror.</li>
            <li> Luv it, had no issue was delivered right on time.  This system really works for my face, i really like the tones bc it has no smell and no alcohol.</li>
            <li> I have always struggled with acne and nothing has ever really worked. This ( if used daily the way it says ) is a lifesaver. My acne has diminished. The small pimpled that I may get every once in a while are shallow and barely even considered a pimple. I am lost without this stuff and have gotten the auto ship on Proactiv&#x27;s website that&#x27;s how much I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I hate proactive, and I would not recommand this product to anybody, because when I bought proactive, I thought I was going to like result, but instead I regret it ever since after, it damaged my skin, especially my face completely dried out and it destroyed the natural oil the skin has, proactive is very bad and way too harsh for skin. I regret it deeply for using this product ...👎</li>
            <li> Wonderful! I&#x27;ll be buying this again!</li>
            <li> A waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I made sure to only search for and purchase proactiv&#x27;s &#x27;new formula&#x27; (as pictured), yet I received the old formula... Not exactly happy with my purchase - This is the first time this has happened to me as I&#x27;ve been buying proactiv on Amazon for years... I guess I need to be more careful in the future.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my wife. She said that it didn&#x27;t smell or feel like proactive. Says proactive smells awful, like chemicals. This stuff smells perfumey. Like a moisturizer. Not sure on formulas though. Did the old formula have a pleasant smell?</li>
            <li> Not only is the product highly ineffective, but the customer service through Proactiv is atrocious.  The product will show almost zero improvement after 3 weeks of use,and this is with minimal acne.  Expect to be billed and hit with random fees.  I ordered a one month supply at $19.95 and they hit you with an automatic signup for a $100 three month supply.  Saw the fees on my credit card, it turns out they put it as a hidden clause when you order.  They refused to refund any of it even though the second supply hadn&#x27;t even shipped.  Definitely DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li> Proactiv (Guthy-Renker) is inherently evil, as a company. They offer their Proactiv products ONLY as part of a subscription, and changing or cancelling that subscription, in my case, led to almost a year of unwanted product (and the bills), threatening phone calls (from me), threatening bills (from them), for products never received and never ordered, etc.  I recommend engaging the BBB at the first sign of trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short. If you need Proactiv, and it really is a good product, buy it from one of the resellers here on Amazon, and not straight from the Proactiv website.  I feel bad for their customer service people - they don&#x27;t get paid nearly enough to deal with what they must deal with daily. This company is pure evil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 10/20/12: Again, out of nowhere, I JUST GOT ANOTHER BILL FROM PROACTIV today.  The last product I got, I called them 4 times, refused delivery, etc.  Words cannot express how absolutely vile and evil this company is.</li>
            <li> ProActiv is an ok product and seems to work as well as the other acne prevention product we have tried, a 2% salicyclic acid topical treatment from Alba Botanica.  The Active ingredient in Proactive is 2.5% benzoyl peroxide, old-school stuff but it does work for keeping pimples at bay. The Acne Prevention Place responded quickly and shipped the product at a better price than anyone else seems to - no complaints from me.  If you want ProActiv, buy it from Acne Prevention Place.</li>
            <li> Product was received in a timely fashion and it beat the price compared to other vendors. I would order with them again.</li>
            <li> I hate this stuff with a passion. When I first started using it, I thought my skin was going to clear up. I didn&#x27;t have super bad acne, but enough to bother me. I was wrong for buying this. It made me break out worse, and the harsh chemicals dried my skin out like crazy, even though I only used it once a day and I used the green tea moisturizer along with that. The new zits hurt like crazy and oozed nasty stuff and I&#x27;ve never had that happen before in my life until after using these products. Maybe they work for some people but NOT for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 31 years old and I started getting acne again a few months ago. I tried Mary Kay Time wise and it just made it worse. This stuff works no matter how old you are. And not only is my acne completely gone, my skin feels like new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving Proactiv a negative review because it is grossly overpriced.  It is my own fault, however that I never read the fine print to realize that they auto-snip and auto-charge your card after you pay for the trial.  Do read the fine print!  I recently found that Target makes a \\&quot;compare to Proactiv\\&quot; product in their \\&quot;Up and Up\\&quot; product line.  I was delighted to see this and even more delighted to see that the ingredients are just about identical, except for one tiny (most likely insignificant) ingredient that the Target brand has that Proactiv does not.  It works identically to Proactiv (same results for me anyway) and the best part?  It was ONLY $11.99 for a 4-oz bottle of the cleanser, 4 oz of the toner and 2 oz of the repair treatment!  Same amount that is listed here for 4 times the cost!  DON&#x27;T waste your money.  GO TO TARGET and get the Up &amp; Up product!!</li>
            <li> Worst product I have ever used! I spent a ton of money on this system and it never cleared my acne. It made it worse. The proactive company is a scam!!!! Once you order from them they continue to charge your account! And they make it extremely difficult to cancel the product. I called to cancel and the next day they charged my account for no reason! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> It was lacking in the size department.  I could have gone to the mall for cheaper. And the only reason I didn&#x27;t Is I&#x27;m handicap, so pretty much I feel I was screwed out of my money!</li>
            <li> I tried proactiv after seeing all the commercials for it, I finally said let&#x27;s try this stuff out. Worse mistake ever. Ever several days my face got super dry and red. I started only doing it once a day and it just got worse. I couldn&#x27;t stop itching my face, my entire face felt like snake skin and I looked like I had my face in the sun for 12 hrs, it was so red. Acne was still there and even got worse. The stuff in it discolored so many shirts, could you imagine what it&#x27;s doing to your face? I would never recommend this to anyone, there is much better stuff out there.</li>
            <li> cleanser and toner dries out my face. i mix half repairing lotion and half retinol cream twice a day with a blemish cleanser, works wonders</li>
            <li> Ordered this at what seemed like a good price as the next round for my daughter when her current set rant out.  Unfortunately we didn&#x27;t notice the expiration date on these bottles until three months after receipt when she was ready to use them, and they were all expired  - buyer beware.</li>
