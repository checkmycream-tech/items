    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I am very happy with the cord  </li>
            <li>and it works great.</li>
            <li>I ordered , the price was good</li>
            <li>Fit perfectly to charge my razor!</li>
            <li>After many years of good service, I thought I was going to have to buy another Norelco electric razor.</li>
            <li>Great, an inch longer than the original</li>
            <li>This is undoubtedly the best power cord for a Norelco shaver of this age that has ever been remanufactured.&lt;br /&gt;I was not expecting the joy I experienced upon pressing that hard rubber end into the shaver.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the cord provides power perfectly, but just understand that not every model listed is a match apparently.</li>
            <li>It came quickly and works perfectly, saved my husband&#x27;s favorite shaver from certain death.</li>
            <li>This power cord has been all that for me and more, transforming my morning and my face, returning both to what they once were.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you get the correct one.</li>
            <li>It went in easily and began to charge without any fuss.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The price was fine, and delivery prompt.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak for every model but it fit my unit.</li>
            <li>Now perhaps I will find the original cord, but that would be fine.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what ! needed!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the irreplaceable link that is the difference between a scruffy face and a clean one.  </li>
            <li>This power cord worked out very nicely, it sure beats buying a new razor.</li>
            <li>right?  </li>
            <li>Was exactly what I oreded</li>
            <li>Exactly what we needed.</li>
            <li>Yes, the 74-C Power Cord is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Also I really don&#x27;t like using razors.</li>
            <li>I lost my cord to my razor and rather than throw it away or buy a new one I spent less than $5 including shippiong and got a new cord delivered to my front door, and now I am happily shaving once again.</li>
            <li>We appreciated you carrying a replacement for an item 40 years old.</li>
            <li>Purchased a new cord and the razor works like new.</li>
            <li>only wish I had misplaced the original years before.</li>
            <li>It turns out that the molded cord had just had too many years of twisting and turning and had broken a lead inside.</li>

            <li> Was exactly what I oreded</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the cord  I ordered , the price was good and so was the delivery time, I have been using it for a while and it works great.</li>
            <li> What can one say about a power cord?  It&#x27;s just a power cord, right?  Wrong!  It&#x27;s the irreplaceable link that is the difference between a scruffy face and a clean one.  A nobody and a go-getter.  A failure and a success.  This power cord has been all that for me and more, transforming my morning and my face, returning both to what they once were.  Literally turning back time, and I wouldn&#x27;t start my day any other way.  Also I really don&#x27;t like using razors.</li>
            <li> Simple, swift, and efficient; Just the way internet commerce should be.</li>
            <li> I lost my cord to my razor and rather than throw it away or buy a new one I spent less than $5 including shippiong and got a new cord delivered to my front door, and now I am happily shaving once again.</li>
            <li> Needed to replace the one I lost. Worked like a charm. Not sure what else to say, but I&#x27;d recommend it if your razor is one of the ones listed.</li>
            <li> Exactly what we needed. Fit perfectly to charge my razor! The price was fine, and delivery prompt. Now perhaps I will find the original cord, but that would be fine.</li>
            <li> After many years of good service, I thought I was going to have to buy another Norelco electric razor. It started to cut out on me while in use. It turns out that the molded cord had just had too many years of twisting and turning and had broken a lead inside. Purchased a new cord and the razor works like new.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see how this could go wrong. Make sure you get the correct one. I got the wrong one, then reordered the correct one.</li>
            <li> The listed model number of my shaver did not fit the cord end. I&#x27;m sure the cord provides power perfectly, but just understand that not every model listed is a match apparently.</li>
            <li> I left my power cord at a hotel and this replacement cord worked for me. I can&#x27;t speak for every model but it fit my unit.</li>
            <li> Great, an inch longer than the original and i saved money .</li>
            <li> Yes, the 74-C Power Cord is exactly what I needed. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> This power chord brought my shaver back to life after years without a charge. I wish I had thought of buying a power chord sooner.  thank you...</li>
            <li> It came quickly and works perfectly, saved my husband&#x27;s favorite shaver from certain death. We appreciated you carrying a replacement for an item 40 years old.</li>
