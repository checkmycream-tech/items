            <li> Had recently got a new tattoo and was worried since I&#x27;m always at the beach.</li>
            <li> However if you stay in the sun it gives you a really awkward tan line since it&#x27;s so strong compared to other SPF.</li>
            <li> I spent 2 days on the beach</li>
            <li> Small enough to carry anywhere.</li>
            <li> got the order before it was due as well</li>
            <li> It looked a bit funny, but it protected my rather expensive body art.</li>
            <li> Small enough to keep in my purse</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s slightly sticky feeling.  </li>
            <li> However, my friend bought the Miami Ink one which smells like coconuts and is about half the size of a deodorant stick.</li>
            <li> I had my eye liner tattooed on and had to stop going to the tanning beds because it was fading it out so bad that I had to have them done again.</li>
            <li> (1 being bad, 3 being no smell, and 5 being good)&lt;br /&gt;Size</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Goes on kinda greasy, very soft.....causing you to use more than you should</li>
            <li> just what I ordered. works good</li>
            <li> Small enough to carry anywhere. Not greasy. Works great! If you have a tattoo and want to keep the color, I recommend you get one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t put sunscreen on my tattoos and that worried me about exposing my skin there to the sun. This was the perfect solution !</li>
            <li> I like this cause it is in stick form instead of liquid. It is just suncreen, don&#x27;t let the word &amp;#34;tattoo&amp;#34; let you think it is something different, any sunscreen stick will do. Travels well.</li>
            <li> love this product!  got the order before it was due as well</li>
            <li> Had recently got a new tattoo and was worried since I&#x27;m always at the beach. This product is like a giant Chapstick and was easy to apply. It doesn&#x27;t smell either. However if you stay in the sun it gives you a really awkward tan line since it&#x27;s so strong compared to other SPF. I got a giant white circle where my tattoo is while the rest of me is tan.</li>
            <li> Daughter is a lifeguard at the lake and she said it was great.</li>
            <li> no sun burns and color remain looking good</li>
            <li> Loved the variety pack to sample the different flavors.  Now I know what to buy in bulk.</li>
            <li> like the ideal but too expensive</li>
            <li> I spent 2 days on the beach and my tattoo was the only place I didn&#x27;t have a sunburn! I love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> Works great, easy to apply.  I love the round shape.</li>
            <li> this stuff works really well it does exactly what it says and it looks just like the picture. and it was shipped very quick</li>
            <li> Not sure I was only able to use it once and then my 3yr old found it and that&#x27;s the end of that. It went on nicely though. Will be ordering again at some point.</li>
            <li> Totally love it. I had my eye liner tattooed on and had to stop going to the tanning beds because it was fading it out so bad that I had to have them done again. I don&#x27;t like wearing the goggles because you get raccoon eyes so I was at a stand still. With this stick, I can go over my eye liner and it protects my ink and I can still have the tan that I love :)</li>
            <li> Works perfectly. Pretty cheap, easy to apply, was to carry, and really works. I never use sun screen, but I wanted to protect my new chest piece. I put this stuff on my tattoo and didn&#x27;t apply protection to the rest of my body. After a day at the beach, pretty much every part of my body was burned except for my tattoo. It looked a bit funny, but it protected my rather expensive body art. Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Small enough to keep in my purse so it&#x27;s available whenever I need it.  Would give it 5 stars but it&#x27;s slightly sticky feeling.  Or maybe I just put too much on?</li>
            <li> Sunblockage 5/5&lt;br /&gt;Smell 2/5 (1 being bad, 3 being no smell, and 5 being good)&lt;br /&gt;Size 3/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish this product was bigger. This would work well for small, detailed tattoos. However, my friend bought the Miami Ink one which smells like coconuts and is about half the size of a deodorant stick. Next time I will be going with the Miami Ink stick.</li>
            <li> I felt VERY safe using this on my tattoo and it worked great for indoor tanning!!!</li>
            <li> works great on tatoos thanks</li>
