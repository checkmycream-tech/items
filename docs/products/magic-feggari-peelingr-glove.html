            <li>After 5 mins of standing under a warm shower (while shampooing my hair), then wetting the glove and wringing out excess water, I always see lots of skin shedding off.</li>
            <li>It exfoliates effectively and reduces the appearance of Granny Skin.</li>
            <li>Kind of snitchy?</li>
            <li>This works better than a lot of the chemical peels (both home and clinical)</li>

            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Will order more soon.</li>
            <li>This is glove is better then using sugar scrub.</li>
            <li>Another good way to do it is to soak in the tub first then get out of tub.</li>
            <li>I have now been using for three months and am really happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li>Love it love love love a much</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s peel and in easy way</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend standing in the shower or tub</li>
            <li>I did also use it very gently on my face, it makes your skin glow!!</li>
            <li>IMPORTANT..</li>
            <li>And afterward you have silky smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>I followed the directions precisely and didn&#x27;t see any \\&quot;skin\\&quot; being removed as others have noted.</li>
            <li>The key is making sure your skin is good and moisturized from the shower-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far easier (and more effective) to clean yourself with a washcloth while bathing.  </li>
            <li>This thing really works!!!</li>
            <li>I love it ,my skin felt very soft and  my color looked more even.</li>
            <li>This glove does require some muscle, and I am a bit sore after scrubbing with it, but it is worth it!</li>
            <li>I bought this glove thinking it would be an amazing product, but I had similar gloves from the korean spa for $6 that where much better.</li>
            <li>This product was recommended to me by my skin care aesthetician, and she was right!</li>
            <li>My skin is much softer and also more even-toned.  </li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t want to over do it.. start more gently if in doubt...</li>
            <li>Although there was a comment of this being &amp;#34;labour intensive&amp;#34;, I feel that this person really doesn&#x27;t understand how to use it appropriately.</li>
            <li>Useful for detailed exfoliation.</li>
            <li>For years I have been looking for a good exfoliant, but have fallen short.</li>
            <li>After using it, my skin is dewy and incredibly smooth - it was well worth the price.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product as an economical alternative to visiting a salon - like a day spa @ home! :-)</li>
            <li>I love it , It does exactly like the  the moroccan Exfoliating Glove but the difference that you do not need to put it in hot water for a while ! , just wash your body and the glove with hot water</li>
            <li>This fabric is so cheap its not even funny.</li>
            <li>It was gross, but amazing.</li>
            <li>It will thoroughly tire out your arms, but of course it&#x27;s worth the soreness.   </li>
            <li>This product is definitely worth the $$.</li>
            <li>Some of the best secrets are kept secret, this is one that should bust out.</li>
            <li>also like how it rinses off and drys up nice for the next use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled absolutely nothing special about this.</li>
            <li>need to be gentle if using for facial exfoliation as it is effective.</li>
            <li>I found that after using the glove, the lotion truly absorbed into my skin and it feels absolutely hydrated.    </li>
            <li>When I first got this I thought there is no WAY it will exfoliate...</li>
            <li>it worked exactly as described...</li>
            <li>Just received it, and used it for the first time.</li>
            <li>you so much!</li>
            <li>You must first moisten your skin and the glove, then use it without additional water.  </li>
            <li>I used this for the first time today, at first i did not see any difference.</li>
            <li>The second time I used it, I patted my skin dry per the instructions, and it worked great.</li>
            <li>My skin is as soft as my newborn&#x27;s and my husband can&#x27;t stop touching me and telling me how soft my skin is.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even understand how it works because the material is not abrasive and doesn&#x27;t irritate my super sensitive skin at all.  </li>
            <li>I have very dry skin that lotion tends to \\&quot;sit\\&quot; on top of.  </li>
            <li>be told, wasn&#x27;t expecting much.    </li>
            <li>Then gently rub the glove over your skin..  </li>
            <li>It was just because my skin was really wet, probably more than it should have been.</li>
            <li>Pumice doesn&#x27;t even work very well, and the words &#x27;gently exfoliates&#x27; drive me up the wall.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important that the glove is in contact with your skin only, without any soap, etc or else</li>
            <li>So gentle, know you dont have to scrub your skin off to exfoliate.</li>
            <li>It really works on my skin.</li>
            <li>This is a very labor-intensive product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>My skin is so much smoother now.</li>
            <li>The instructions to the glove&#x27;s use are very clear and I used it exactly as directed.    </li>
            <li>I originally bought about 5 or 6 years ago for $50 and am still using the same one.</li>
            <li>I used this glove and layers of dry skin were easily buffed off.</li>
            <li>This works exactly as I wish and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I would advise giving it a go, different things work for different people and this is something I am glad I gave a go myself.</li>
            <li>With this and my moisturizers my skin is now baby soft!!  </li>
            <li>Definitely get your moneys worth.  </li>
            <li>This works well on flat, long stretches of skin such as your forearm, or your thigh, but that&#x27;s not usually where folks need a good scrubbing.</li>
            <li>I have used it only 3 times after long showers, skin feels silky and much more hydrated.  </li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t use it on brand new ones otherwise</li>
            <li>Make sure you wash /rinse the glove afterwards and lay it out flat to dry...</li>
            <li>It leaves skin super soft, I got one a long time ago and wanted one for my daughter,</li>
            <li>I purchased this glove kind of as a last resort after gaining weight rather quickly due to a condition and being left with horrid stretch marks on my belly.  </li>
            <li>They certainly have not vanished but they are beginning to fade in colour and are not as deep to the touch.</li>
            <li>.. Make sure the glove is wet but not dripping wet- wring out the excess..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried virtually every sort of exfoliating glove available and wasted a lot of money over the years.  </li>
            <li>No exaggeration, my skin hasn&#x27;t felt this soft in years.  </li>
            <li>I have not had this soft of skin since I was 10.  </li>
            <li>I could have my whole body sorted within 7-10 mins, which is enough time for my hair conditioning treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using this product for a couple weeks I didn&#x27;t see a real difference between this and the basic exfoliating gloves you can purchase at a drugstore.  </li>
            <li>My skin is soft and is getting a sheen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>hands down, so cool.</li>
            <li>It can take a little scrubbing, but the results are worth it!</li>
            <li>This is my first written review, im passionate about this product!</li>
            <li>The loose skin was hidden in water droplets, so make sure your skin is pat-dry after the bath.</li>
            <li>I began using it weekly and continued to moisturise my whole body with a general vitamin e cream on a daily basis.   </li>
            <li>After a five minute soak in warm water, you are supposed to use the glove against your skin up and down a few times, and that&#x27;s that.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, my skin was too wet, and it didn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li>I have tried every type of exfoliator/scrubs and my lower legs &amp; shins were always dry and often very itchy.  </li>
            <li>It actually does what is says, and leaves my skin very soft.  </li>
            <li>I have used all sorts of exfoliating products with little success.</li>
            <li>and if nothing else I could use it as a general exfoliating mitt.  </li>
            <li>it does do the job but after just 3 tries, the whole glove is already out of shape like its about to die</li>
            <li>Winters are always rough for me skin-wise no matter how much lotion I use.</li>
            <li>that will tear them more and make them worse.</li>
            <li>you can buy other exfoliators out there for a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li>In fact, I should have been able to exfoliate because my skin was flaking a little due to the dry weather and the fact that I use AHA&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>They are so much smoother and less noticeable already, and this was only after one use.</li>

            <li> This is my first written review, im passionate about this product!</li>
            <li> The loose skin was hidden in water droplets, so make sure your skin is pat-dry after the bath.</li>
            <li> I began using it weekly and continued to moisturise my whole body with a general vitamin e cream on a daily basis.   </li>
            <li> After a five minute soak in warm water, you are supposed to use the glove against your skin up and down a few times, and that&#x27;s that.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, my skin was too wet, and it didn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> I have tried every type of exfoliator/scrubs and my lower legs &amp; shins were always dry and often very itchy.  </li>
            <li> It actually does what is says, and leaves my skin very soft.  </li>
            <li> I have used all sorts of exfoliating products with little success.</li>
            <li> and if nothing else I could use it as a general exfoliating mitt.  </li>
            <li> it does do the job but after just 3 tries, the whole glove is already out of shape like its about to die</li>
            <li> Winters are always rough for me skin-wise no matter how much lotion I use.</li>
            <li> that will tear them more and make them worse.</li>
            <li> you can buy other exfoliators out there for a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li> In fact, I should have been able to exfoliate because my skin was flaking a little due to the dry weather and the fact that I use AHA&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> They are so much smoother and less noticeable already, and this was only after one use.</li>
            <li> I do it once a week - take an extra long shower so your skin / pores open.. and then turn off the water, and with water not running use the glove</li>
            <li> I have never seen evidence of major improvement on harder-to-scrub angled parts like elbows, feet or knees--all the typically rough places people want to have smoother skin.</li>
            <li> Some worked but left my skin dry.</li>
            <li> I have super dry flaky skin that only seemed to look worse when I tried to exfoliate with a scrub and loofah.  </li>
            <li> Oh, and one other thing, as an Italian American, I am ashamed that this came from my mother land!  </li>
            <li> meaning take a long shower...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Best time to use is when washing your hair - given I have long hair, I put my conditioner in and go about scrubbing during that time.</li>
            <li> Glove was a bit smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> Before long, bits of skin were all over the floor!</li>
            <li> This is totally different from loofah and other scrub mits.  </li>
            <li> My dry skin doesn&#x27;t respond to anything,</li>
            <li> I have always had dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I have also notice the skin on my thighs is a lot smoother and not as dry.</li>
            <li> my skin was always been dry an flakes, stretch marks, ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin/eczema.</li>
            <li> I feel like an idiot that I paid that kind of money for such a joke of a product.  </li>
            <li> Usually I try to clearly list the Pros over the Cons, but I&#x27;m at a loss here.</li>
            <li> It is helping diminish my stretch marks, and also helping to tighten up some of my loose skin from pregnancy.  </li>
            <li> There were some rough spots on my arms that are almost gone now.</li>
            <li> You will see tiny flecks of dead skin come off in clumps.  </li>
            <li> I use jojoba oil after this and it sinks in.  </li>
            <li> Follow the directions carefully.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, this glove is very small, making it quite difficult for all but the most petite girl to squeeze her hand inside it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to believe people aren&#x27;t getting results, unless they aren&#x27;t following the directions to use after soaking or a long shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> most definitely would not recommend this item to others, especially considering the outrageous price.</li>
            <li> so you can rinse everything down the drain.  </li>
            <li> I wait until I am at the end of my shower, turn off the water, wipe off excess water, wait until I am damp then scrub down my body.  </li>
            <li> By that I mean you have to soak your skin, then you have to smash the glove into your skin as you rub back and forth.</li>
            <li> With your skin still slightly damp,scrub with the glove...then rinse off all the ..stuff.</li>
            <li> I DONT SEE ANY DIFFERENT NAMES PROVING OTHERWISE, ILL PURCHASE WHEN I SEE ACTUAL REVEIW FORM CUSOTMERS AND</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s half the problem:  </li>
            <li> otherwise it will turn into a stinky mess ..</li>
            <li> I have a 4 in surgical scar that even looks a little lighter after a few uses.</li>
            <li> if you do it I have described, all the dead skin rubs off... makes you feel like ewwww all that was on me...</li>
            <li> There are literally peels of dead skin that come off when using the glove.  </li>
            <li> It was a little pricey compared to the loofa I usually buy at the supermarket but for the results I could care less.</li>
            <li> but I was not getting the results I was after and was feeling really low and uncomfortable as my stretch mark were really raw looking,</li>
            <li> I have received in the past.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe just how much dead skin came off!</li>
            <li> It looks like a small flimsy piece of fabric.  </li>
            <li> I washed myself as usual then used the glove.</li>
            <li> After i rubbed for a few minutes i could feel rolls  of skin coming off!</li>
            <li> When I see mostly positive reviews for a product, I assume that at least some of the feedback is fake, so I&#x27;m always skeptical, but I took a gamble on this.</li>
            <li> I found that out the hard way - had to throw out one and replace it...</li>
            <li> This glove was so expensive that I hated to try it based on only 9 positive reviews</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to replace it, at least not for awhile.  </li>
            <li> I bought the glove thinking I could at least give it a go</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t want you to wash before use because it just removes the dirt and dead skin that soap would!!</li>
            <li> Sorry folks, but this does NOT exfoliate anything.  </li>
            <li> Boy, was I wrong.  </li>
            <li> THE ONLY CUSOTMER REVIEW IVE SEEN SAID IT WAS A HORRIBLE PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a (shocked) believer.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This thing really works!!!</li>
            <li> My skin is much softer and also more even-toned.  This works better than a lot of the chemical peels (both home and clinical) I have received in the past.  Surprisingly, the pores on my face have diminished as well.</li>
            <li> Sorry folks, but this does NOT exfoliate anything.  I feel like an idiot that I paid that kind of money for such a joke of a product.  In fact, I should have been able to exfoliate because my skin was flaking a little due to the dry weather and the fact that I use AHA&#x27;s.  But this glove did NOTHING.  If I could ask for a refund, I would!  Oh, and one other thing, as an Italian American, I am ashamed that this came from my mother land!  Wine, olives, fennochio, and pomegranates maybe, but NOT a celluose exfoliating glove!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried virtually every sort of exfoliating glove available and wasted a lot of money over the years.  I figured I&#x27;d give this a shot based on the reviews and truth be told, wasn&#x27;t expecting much.    Boy, was I wrong.  The instructions to the glove&#x27;s use are very clear and I used it exactly as directed.    No exaggeration, my skin hasn&#x27;t felt this soft in years.  I have very dry skin that lotion tends to \\&quot;sit\\&quot; on top of.  I found that after using the glove, the lotion truly absorbed into my skin and it feels absolutely hydrated.    The directions do caution that the product should only be used twice weekly on \\&quot;mature\\&quot; skin.  It must be for a reason.  The glove exfoliated my skin to the point where I found that my body lotion stung me in a couple areas where I must have rubbed too vigorously.    I&#x27;m a (shocked) believer.</li>
            <li> When I first got this I thought there is no WAY it will exfoliate... BUT I read the directions and followed them andYES. it worked exactly as described... yes my skin glows... NOTE It will NOT work if you do not follow the directions. The key is making sure your skin is good and moisturized from the shower- meaning take a long shower... I do it once a week - take an extra long shower so your skin / pores open.. and then turn off the water, and with water not running use the glove.. Make sure the glove is wet but not dripping wet- wring out the excess.. Then gently rub the glove over your skin..  if you do it I have described, all the dead skin rubs off... makes you feel like ewwww all that was on me... afterward your skin will glow..be careful by the way if your skin is sensitive - you don&#x27;t want to over do it.. start more gently if in doubt... Another good way to do it is to soak in the tub first then get out of tub. With your skin still slightly damp,scrub with the glove...then rinse off all the ..stuff. Last NOTE IMPORTANT.. Make sure you wash /rinse the glove afterwards and lay it out flat to dry... otherwise it will turn into a stinky mess .. I found that out the hard way - had to throw out one and replace it...</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t want you to wash before use because it just removes the dirt and dead skin that soap would!! Don&#x27;t be fooled absolutely nothing special about this.</li>
            <li> This glove is AMAZING! Just received it, and used it for the first time. I followed the instructions, and even began to despair when I didn&#x27;t see any layer pieces coming off. It was just because my skin was really wet, probably more than it should have been. The loose skin was hidden in water droplets, so make sure your skin is pat-dry after the bath. Before long, bits of skin were all over the floor! It even noticeably evened out my skin color, and its effects on stretchmarks are next to none of any of the prior products I&#x27;ve used on them. They are so much smoother and less noticeable already, and this was only after one use. I expect in a couple more, they&#x27;ll be a miraculous difference in all of my skin woes. I even used it on my face for blemishes, which it faded. It will thoroughly tire out your arms, but of course it&#x27;s worth the soreness.   I&#x27;ll finally achieve the skin I&#x27;ve always dreamed...</li>
            <li> I like this exfoliating mitt enough to get rid of all of my body scrubbs.</li>
            <li> Ok, I was skeptical. My dry skin doesn&#x27;t respond to anything, boy how I have tried! Pumice doesn&#x27;t even work very well, and the words &#x27;gently exfoliates&#x27; drive me up the wall.  I read the rave reviews here, and I bought the glove because it was cheaper than a belt sander. It shipped quickly enough, and came in a package emblazoned with instructions in several languages. After a five minute soak in warm water, you are supposed to use the glove against your skin up and down a few times, and that&#x27;s that.  Oh. My. God. I love this thing. I can&#x27;t believe just how much dead skin came off! It can take a little scrubbing, but the results are worth it! There were some rough spots on my arms that are almost gone now. I have a 4 in surgical scar that even looks a little lighter after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I threw out all my loofahs, body scrubs, etc...because this glove is all I need.  It actually does what is says, and leaves my skin very soft.  There are literally peels of dead skin that come off when using the glove.  It is helping diminish my stretch marks, and also helping to tighten up some of my loose skin from pregnancy.  This glove does require some muscle, and I am a bit sore after scrubbing with it, but it is worth it!</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with this.  I have not had this soft of skin since I was 10.  I have super dry flaky skin that only seemed to look worse when I tried to exfoliate with a scrub and loofah.  This glove was so expensive that I hated to try it based on only 9 positive reviews but I am so glad I did.  NOTHING works like this.  I don&#x27;t even understand how it works because the material is not abrasive and doesn&#x27;t irritate my super sensitive skin at all.  I even used it on my face with better results than microdermabrasion and no burning.  The process is truly stomach turning, though.  I couldn&#x27;t beleive the amount of skin that came off.  I strongly recommend standing in the shower or tub so you can rinse everything down the drain.  If I had to pick only three beauty products for the rest of my life it would be cleanser, moisturizer, and this.  I would forfeit all my makeup to keep this. I am going to order more so that I am never without one again.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely worth the $$. I originally bought about 5 or 6 years ago for $50 and am still using the same one. The website says &amp;#34;lasts for 6-8 months&amp;#34; but with the time I have used it, it obviously lasts longer depending how you treat it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best time to use is when washing your hair - given I have long hair, I put my conditioner in and go about scrubbing during that time. Although there was a comment of this being &amp;#34;labour intensive&amp;#34;, I feel that this person really doesn&#x27;t understand how to use it appropriately. After 5 mins of standing under a warm shower (while shampooing my hair), then wetting the glove and wringing out excess water, I always see lots of skin shedding off. It&#x27;s important that the glove is in contact with your skin only, without any soap, etc or else it will not work. I could have my whole body sorted within 7-10 mins, which is enough time for my hair conditioning treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product as an economical alternative to visiting a salon - like a day spa @ home! :-)</li>
            <li> I love it , It does exactly like the  the moroccan Exfoliating Glove but the difference that you do not need to put it in hot water for a while ! , just wash your body and the glove with hot water then use it !</li>
            <li> Glove was a bit smaller than expected. Useful for detailed exfoliation.NOTE: need to be gentle if using for facial exfoliation as it is effective.</li>
            <li> I bought this glove thinking it would be an amazing product, but I had similar gloves from the korean spa for $6 that where much better. Do not buy!</li>
            <li> Some of the best secrets are kept secret, this is one that should bust out. I want everyone to know this product works. So gentle, know you dont have to scrub your skin off to exfoliate. For years I have been looking for a good exfoliant, but have fallen short. Trying acid lotions, sugar scrubs etc. but nothing comes close to this! AmaZing.. hands down, so cool. Imagine when you roll a towel over your skin, times 100. didnt know something could work so well. Every girl should have one. I know what the next Christmas and birthday presents will be. This is my first written review, im passionate about this product!</li>
            <li> I am so happy i tried Magic Peeling  Feggari  Exfoliating Glove.It really works on my skin.I love it!Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> WHY IS IT THAT ALL THESE REVIEWS ARE COMING FROM THE SAME SOURCE. I DONT SEE ANY DIFFERENT NAMES PROVING OTHERWISE, ILL PURCHASE WHEN I SEE ACTUAL REVEIW FORM CUSOTMERS AND THE ONLY CUSOTMER REVIEW IVE SEEN SAID IT WAS A HORRIBLE PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I too, upon opening my package, thought I had been ripped off.  It looks like a small flimsy piece of fabric.  However now after using it, I am a believer.  My skin is as soft as my newborn&#x27;s and my husband can&#x27;t stop touching me and telling me how soft my skin is.  This lasts too.  It&#x27;s is a durable fabric that doesn&#x27;t mildew so you don&#x27;t have to replace it, at least not for awhile.  Definitely get your moneys worth.  I can only use it once a week. I wait until I am at the end of my shower, turn off the water, wipe off excess water, wait until I am damp then scrub down my body.  You will see tiny flecks of dead skin come off in clumps.  It is gnarly.  And afterward you have silky smooth skin.  I use jojoba oil after this and it sinks in.  I have always had dry skin.  With this and my moisturizers my skin is now baby soft!!  Oh and I almost forgot, it has helped and reduced my pregnancy stretch marks.  Just don&#x27;t use it on brand new ones otherwise that will tear them more and make them worse.</li>
            <li> While this is not a review I still feel it necessary to comment on this product.  I was all set to purchase this product before I looked at the before and after pictures and noticed a picture that I had seen for another advertisement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO, WITH THAT SAID, I WILL NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> After using this product for a couple weeks I didn&#x27;t see a real difference between this and the basic exfoliating gloves you can purchase at a drugstore.  I followed the directions precisely and didn&#x27;t see any \\&quot;skin\\&quot; being removed as others have noted. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love it Love it Love it !&lt;br /&gt;its Really magic Peeling .. i like it and it&#x27;s must have for all women</li>
            <li> This product performs as described, if used according to directions--but that&#x27;s half the problem:  It doesn&#x27;t work while bathing.  You must first moisten your skin and the glove, then use it without additional water.  It&#x27;s far easier (and more effective) to clean yourself with a washcloth while bathing.  Furthermore, this glove is very small, making it quite difficult for all but the most petite girl to squeeze her hand inside it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I most definitely would not recommend this item to others, especially considering the outrageous price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this glove kind of as a last resort after gaining weight rather quickly due to a condition and being left with horrid stretch marks on my belly.  I had tried all sorts of creams to help fade the marks but I was not getting the results I was after and was feeling really low and uncomfortable as my stretch mark were really raw looking, even after 6 months they were still a deep red/purple.   I bought the glove thinking I could at least give it a go and if nothing else I could use it as a general exfoliating mitt.  I began using it weekly and continued to moisturise my whole body with a general vitamin e cream on a daily basis.   I have now been using for three months and am really happy with the results so far. They certainly have not vanished but they are beginning to fade in colour and are not as deep to the touch. I am definitely happy with how they are looking and will continue to use the glove. I have also notice the skin on my thighs is a lot smoother and not as dry. I would advise giving it a go, different things work for different people and this is something I am glad I gave a go myself. It was a little pricey compared to the loofa I usually buy at the supermarket but for the results I could care less.</li>
            <li> Love it love love love a much it is a magic it&#x27;s peel and in easy way l Io v</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my skin care aesthetician, and she was right! It exfoliates effectively and reduces the appearance of Granny Skin.</li>
            <li> This fabric is so cheap its not even funny. It looks like it doesnt cost them any more than $1 to make one. Keep in mind this product is about $40! you can buy other exfoliators out there for a much cheaper price. I sense a lot of these reviews are made by the company people themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it does do the job but after just 3 tries, the whole glove is already out of shape like its about to die out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it was packaged in a way that when you remove the product out of the bag, you end up tearing the package. Kind of snitchy? Probably trying to avoid selling it back or something.</li>
            <li> This is a very labor-intensive product. By that I mean you have to soak your skin, then you have to smash the glove into your skin as you rub back and forth. It takes a while and you notice peels of skin coming off. This works well on flat, long stretches of skin such as your forearm, or your thigh, but that&#x27;s not usually where folks need a good scrubbing. I have never seen evidence of major improvement on harder-to-scrub angled parts like elbows, feet or knees--all the typically rough places people want to have smoother skin. I bought it about 9 months ago and I&#x27;m so blas&amp;eacute; about the results I&#x27;ve used it three or maybe four times. Usually I try to clearly list the Pros over the Cons, but I&#x27;m at a loss here. The only way this would make sense is if several technicians at a spa were scrubbing you all over, but for home use it&#x27;s a dud.</li>
            <li> I have used all sorts of exfoliating products with little success. Some didn&#x27;t work. Some worked but left my skin dry. This works exactly as I wish and leaves my skin soft. Follow the directions carefully. The first time I used it, my skin was too wet, and it didn&#x27;t work well. The second time I used it, I patted my skin dry per the instructions, and it worked great.</li>
            <li> I love this glove. I brought it from priceline in Australia for around 40 dollars. I thought it was a bit over priced but I wanted to try it. Nothing has ever worked for me my skin was always been dry an flakes, stretch marks, ingrown hairs. I washed myself as usual then used the glove. Rolls of skin started to come off. Now after two uses my skin is like a babies bum, no ingrown hairs an my marks are fading. :) so happy words cannot explain!</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time today, at first i did not see any difference. After i rubbed for a few minutes i could feel rolls  of skin coming off! I love it ,my skin felt very soft and  my color looked more even. I did also use it very gently on my face, it makes your skin glow!! Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This glove is wonderful. When I see mostly positive reviews for a product, I assume that at least some of the feedback is fake, so I&#x27;m always skeptical, but I took a gamble on this. I have extremely dry skin/eczema. Winters are always rough for me skin-wise no matter how much lotion I use. I used this glove and layers of dry skin were easily buffed off. It was gross, but amazing. My skin is so much smoother now. I think dermatologists should recommend this product to their patients. I wish mine had.</li>
            <li> Its a great exfoliation item!! It leaves skin super soft, I got one a long time ago and wanted one for my daughter, im glad I found it</li>
            <li> This is totally different from loofah and other scrub mits.  It&#x27;s hard for me to believe people aren&#x27;t getting results, unless they aren&#x27;t following the directions to use after soaking or a long shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this mitt.  I have tried every type of exfoliator/scrubs and my lower legs &amp; shins were always dry and often very itchy.  I have used it only 3 times after long showers, skin feels silky and much more hydrated.  The moisturizers I used are working now.  My skin is soft and is getting a sheen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like how it rinses off and drys up nice for the next use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it!</li>
            <li> I love this product. Will order more soon. This is glove is better then using sugar scrub. I also use this on my face too.</li>
            <li> This exfoliates so well - without irritation.  After using it, my skin is dewy and incredibly smooth - it was well worth the price.</li>
