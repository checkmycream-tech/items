            <li>my mouth is doing great!!!</li>
            <li>If you need a travel case and don&#x27;t need the sanitize feature, this will be perfect.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still great!</li>
            <li>Great to use at home or while traveling.  </li>

            <li>It works great</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li>Battery lasts a good while.</li>
            <li>But it looks good, and works as it is supposed to.</li>
            <li>I had been looking for another one and was delighted to find it at Amazon.</li>
            <li>good for storage and lightweight.</li>
            <li>Good for mouth health.</li>
            <li>This is a really good sanitizer its got a fairly nice design stands out on the counter</li>
            <li>the reason i gave it four stars is the flimsy construction when this item is knocked over my toothbrush is sent skipping across the floor and the mirror on the front pops out if the tooth brush was more secure this would be the best</li>
            <li>Excellent product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Amazon kindly sent bme a replacement.</li>
            <li>so I thought one for travel would be nice.  </li>
            <li>I liked this product.  </li>
            <li>This is great for someone who doesn&#x27;t have a lot of room on their sink for a full size sanitizer.</li>
            <li>works fine ...for about 2 months!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these things.</li>
            <li>but I expect it to go soon so should have been more around $10...</li>
            <li>This one is light and fits nicely into my cosmetic bag that holds my toothbrush, toothpaste, etc.  </li>
            <li>Just ok.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>and I love them all.</li>
            <li>but I think it could be made much better to accommodate attachments for electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Purchased for our son for college - trying to keep him healthy.</li>
            <li>Takes 2 AAA batteries that are not included but the price is better than many sanitizers I have seen.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I love knowing I have a clean place to put my toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The light doesnt always come on when it is shut.    </li>
            <li>I repeat until the light comes on.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, easy to clean and the light goes on immediately when you close the cover insted of having to push a button.  </li>
            <li>The one I have at home you have to push a button for the light to go on</li>
            <li>i always know it&#x27;s germ free.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The light comes on and goes off automatically in 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>sometimes the light won&#x27;t come on.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product, I no longer feel paranoid when I flush the toilet, for fear I would have a contaminated toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell how effective that blue light is, but it sure makes me feel protected.</li>
            <li>Ok product and nice case for my recent travel</li>
            <li>The cons are that it seems to go through batteries quickly, and the light goes on as soon as you close the cover.  </li>
            <li>to clean and store</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good enough and has made it a year in my gym bag.</li>
            <li>SUPER ITEM.WORKS GREAT.NICE GIFT FOR ALL</li>
            <li>it isnt very pretty</li>
            <li>I just got  this because I really think it is important to protect myself from unseen germs</li>
            <li>I have bought other kinds and here is the difference; better construction to this one; removable tray to rinse out as opposed to others; light unit seems much better; overall a better option</li>
            <li>Well, mine still works some few months later, but like all the rest, its performance is spotty, at best.</li>
            <li>They also go through the batteries very fast.  </li>
            <li>After the first 2 uses I now have to slap it to get it to go on - still working though</li>
            <li>First, these do burn through AAA batteries.</li>
            <li>It worked pretty well when I was overseas.</li>
            <li>Not only does it store the brush safely in a drawer</li>
            <li>It worked at first, but had an insatiable appetite for batteries.  </li>
            <li>Second, after the first month, the light \\&quot;usually\\&quot; comes on after you close the case.</li>
            <li>Also I have purchased the large stand alone ones for the toothbrushes at home.  </li>
            <li>They work fine initially, but the switch stops working after six months or so.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes it comes on if you gently tap the case.</li>
            <li>No worries, you just open it and put your brush or brush head in if using an electric toothbrush and the light goes on again.</li>
            <li>but I am very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The light never actually came on.</li>
            <li>It looked like it worked, but really, how can you really tell?  </li>
            <li>so much I wanted to have my mother have one too.</li>
            <li>I tried a different brand, twice, of a UV light toothbrush holder for my travel suitcase.  </li>
            <li>I guess it really isn&#x27;t working now.</li>
            <li>I did buy this one because it was a lower cost than some of the other models, and it is OK.  </li>
            <li>This brand is more durable than the other brand I tried.  </li>
            <li>seems to be a better product and definitely goes through batteries much more slowly.</li>
            <li>Not sure how well it sanitizes but its handy.</li>
            <li>Decent... I had to reattach the window/mirror piece when I received mine.</li>
            <li>(They only last so many years).  </li>
            <li>Both issues do seem to be the only functions this item should perfom properly on, but the fixes are easy...</li>
            <li>My new product is the Violight, which uses AA batteries,</li>
            <li>Since both expensive and inexpensive units tend to have these same problems, according to reviews, this unit is a better buy than most because it is inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>I believe this is a must have product if you are germ conscious.</li>
            <li>After two months, it completely stopped working.  </li>
            <li>I feel much better knowing that my wet toothbrush doesn&#x27;t just sit in its holder--this little gadget is just the thing to sanitize and keep unwanted germs away.</li>
            <li>I guess there is no certain way to know if this really removes germs, but it does what it says.</li>
            <li>The only negative is that the light does not always come on</li>
            <li>As a Nurse I can attest that the technology behind this toothbrush is sound but unless you want to buy a new one of these about every other toothbrush change i would steer clear!</li>
            <li>(how do you know if it&#x27;s really killing the germs?); but after only a month and a half, the lights don&#x27;t come on anymore, so</li>
            <li>My problem is I am trying to use the Sanitizer with a battery operated 360 degree Colgate toothbrush and the Sanitizer doesn&#x27;t really like it; however, with a little pushing and pulling, it works.  </li>

            <li> so it eventually died in October of 2011, after two and a half years of service, as described above.</li>
            <li> it does work to kill bacteria that grow in a wet brush head....</li>
            <li> Be careful.</li>
            <li> like I expected.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to say that I recently got this and mine was dead too</li>
            <li> Hard to tell if it actually ever worked at all</li>
            <li> I had owned one previously and it lasted a couple years.  </li>
            <li> I have owned at least 3 of these in the past several years.</li>
            <li> (It was dead.)</li>
            <li> It, too, was dead.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush sanitizer because I travel a lot and the one I have at home is too heavy and bulky for traveling.  </li>
            <li> no light...</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no way to tell if it even works since no light comes on when you close the case.  </li>
            <li> I have had it for a few months</li>
            <li> Seemed sturdy without being too heavy.  </li>
            <li> However, after 4 trips and a month of use, the product is dead.  </li>
            <li> I had one of these in the past and it died.</li>
            <li> Very hard use.</li>
            <li> (They no longer sell them -- unfortunately.)</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s just an expensive box.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m still disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I got a toothbrush sanitizer to replace a Verilux one that gave up the ghost. (They no longer sell them -- unfortunately.) It didn&#x27;t work. (It was dead.) Amazon kindly sent bme a replacement. It, too, was dead. I gave up.</li>
            <li> I have bought these for myself and our  traveling granddaughters who are in the traveling competing guards through the summer.  Also I have purchased the large stand alone ones for the toothbrushes at home.  I absolutely love these things. I can&#x27;t tell how effective that blue light is, but it sure makes me feel protected. If you had 10 stars I would make it 10!!</li>
            <li> I did buy this one because it was a lower cost than some of the other models, and it is OK.  However, it has two performance issues.  1) It doesnt stay shut.  It will open in my bag.   Solution: I use a rubber band.  2) The light doesnt always come on when it is shut.    Solution: I give it a firm smack near the battery.  I repeat until the light comes on.  Both issues do seem to be the only functions this item should perfom properly on, but the fixes are easy...and it is just a fancy a toothbrush holder.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I no longer feel paranoid when I flush the toilet, for fear I would have a contaminated toothbrush. The only negative is that the light does not always come on and I have to shut the lid several times.</li>
            <li> I have excellant checkups at the dentist...it does work to kill bacteria that grow in a wet brush head....my mouth is doing great!!!</li>
            <li> After the first 2 uses I now have to slap it to get it to go on - still working though so that&#x27;s good.  Ok product and nice case for my recent travel but I expect it to go soon so should have been more around $10...</li>
            <li> Decent... I had to reattach the window/mirror piece when I received mine.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Compact. Great to use at home or while traveling.  Shuts off by its self</li>
            <li> I purchased this UV toothbrush sanitizer because it had yet to garner a \\&quot;it quit working\\&quot; review. Well, mine still works some few months later, but like all the rest, its performance is spotty, at best. First, these do burn through AAA batteries. You will want to consider buying some rechargables. Second, after the first month, the light \\&quot;usually\\&quot; comes on after you close the case. Sometimes, it comes on when you set it back down. Sometimes it comes on if you gently tap the case. Or if you open and close it again. Or not at all. You get the picture. It works 90% of the time, who knows why or why not. Since both expensive and inexpensive units tend to have these same problems, according to reviews, this unit is a better buy than most because it is inexpensive.  UPDATE: so it eventually died in October of 2011, after two and a half years of service, as described above. I established a working \\&quot;relationship\\&quot; with this product, much like you would an alcoholic at work. Sometimes it did it&#x27;s job, sometimes it didn&#x27;t, but when it did work, it worked well. My new product is the Violight, which uses AA batteries, seems to be a better product and definitely goes through batteries much more slowly. The jury is still out on how long it will last, however, the big problem with these machines.</li>
            <li> I feel much better knowing that my wet toothbrush doesn&#x27;t just sit in its holder--this little gadget is just the thing to sanitize and keep unwanted germs away. Lightweight, too-perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush sanitizer because I travel a lot and the one I have at home is too heavy and bulky for traveling.  This one is light and fits nicely into my cosmetic bag that holds my toothbrush, toothpaste, etc.  It&#x27;s light, easy to clean and the light goes on immediately when you close the cover insted of having to push a button.  The cons are that it seems to go through batteries quickly, and the light goes on as soon as you close the cover.  The one I have at home you have to push a button for the light to go on so I keep forgetting it happens automatically when you close the cover which I tend to do once I take the toothbrush out to brush my teeth.  No worries, you just open it and put your brush or brush head in if using an electric toothbrush and the light goes on again.</li>
            <li> works fine ...for about 2 months! I have owned at least 3 of these in the past several years. As a Nurse I can attest that the technology behind this toothbrush is sound but unless you want to buy a new one of these about every other toothbrush change i would steer clear!</li>
            <li> I just got  this because I really think it is important to protect myself from unseen germs but I am very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After placing the AAA batteries in the unit, then placing my toothbrush in the unit shutting the lid nothing happen, no light...nothing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know Amazon will either replace it or refund my money but I&#x27;m still disappointed.</li>
            <li> It looks like it should work great. The light never actually came on. If you need a travel case and don&#x27;t need the sanitize feature, this will be perfect. The little green tray inside falls out, so you can clean it.</li>
            <li> I travel with this.  I love knowing I have a clean place to put my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good enough and has made it a year in my gym bag. Very hard use. Battery lasts a good while.</li>
            <li> Feel totally ripped off.  There&#x27;s no way to tell if it even works since no light comes on when you close the case.  I don&#x27;t think the UVC bulb ever worked.</li>
            <li> Just ok.  Did not last long.  I had owned one previously and it lasted a couple years.  This only lasted a couple months.</li>
            <li> I just used it for a travel trip.  It looked like it worked, but really, how can you really tell?  I don&#x27;t know the germ ratio before I use it so I have to take it on faith.  But it looks good, and works as it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> I travel a lot for work. I leave my toothbrush in hotels constantly. This is great and elmiinates having to replace my brush every time I travel. i always know it&#x27;s germ free. I love it.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of them, One simply stopped working. Changed the batteries several times, adjusted positions, checked switch on lid.  Nothing.  Be careful. Not a reliable product.</li>
            <li> I love this. I have bought four of these over the years and I love them all.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product but I think it could be made much better to accommodate attachments for electric toothbrushes. It will only accommodate manual toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> This is great for someone who doesn&#x27;t have a lot of room on their sink for a full size sanitizer. Also great for someone who travels. Its slim an compact. Fits larger toothbrushes as well. Easy to clean. Takes only 5 minutes for it to do its work.</li>
            <li> I have bought other kinds and here is the difference; better construction to this one; removable tray to rinse out as opposed to others; light unit seems much better; overall a better option</li>
            <li> Purchased for our son for college - trying to keep him healthy.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these toothbrush sanitizers... one for me and one for my mother.  I already have one for my husband and me so I thought one for travel would be nice.  I like it so much I wanted to have my mother have one too.</li>
            <li> SUPER ITEM.WORKS GREAT.NICE GIFT FOR ALL</li>
            <li> I tried a different brand, twice, of a UV light toothbrush holder for my travel suitcase.  I travel 2-3 nights, 3 weeks out of each month.  So, this case goes a lot of places with me.  This brand is more durable than the other brand I tried.  I have had it for a few months and it&#x27;s still great!</li>
            <li> I had one of these in the past and it died. I had been looking for another one and was delighted to find it at Amazon. I believe this is a must have product if you are germ conscious. I intend to buy one for all of my family for Christmas!</li>
            <li> It worked pretty well when I was overseas. The climate where I was was humid. There is no way to keep the toothbrush dry after it&#x27;s sanitized.</li>
            <li> This uv toothbrush holder is great. Not only does it store the brush safely in a drawer but I feel like my toothbrush isn&#x27;t germy anymore. Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I guess there is no certain way to know if this really removes germs, but it does what it says. You put your toothbrush in it and close it. The light comes on and goes off automatically in 5 minutes. Takes 2 AAA batteries that are not included but the price is better than many sanitizers I have seen.</li>
            <li> this is the second UVC toothbrush sanitizer I have gotten.  (They only last so many years).  It works great like I expected.</li>
            <li> Hard to tell if it actually ever worked at all (how do you know if it&#x27;s really killing the germs?); but after only a month and a half, the lights don&#x27;t come on anymore, so I guess it really isn&#x27;t working now.</li>
            <li> sometimes the light won&#x27;t come on.  Not sure how well it sanitizes but its handy. good for storage and lightweight.</li>
            <li> I like it as it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space on my counter, and no cords hanging.  I&#x27;m big on neat.  My problem is I am trying to use the Sanitizer with a battery operated 360 degree Colgate toothbrush and the Sanitizer doesn&#x27;t really like it; however, with a little pushing and pulling, it works.  The product is great--I am the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three Months Later.  Never mind....it has now died on me. Gimme me back two stars...</li>
            <li> I liked this product.  Seemed sturdy without being too heavy.  However, after 4 trips and a month of use, the product is dead.  I will be contacting the company for a replacement.</li>
            <li> I had two of these.  They work fine initially, but the switch stops working after six months or so.  They also go through the batteries very fast.  Batteries only last about a month.  Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to say that I recently got this and mine was dead too (it didn&#x27;t work.)  I can&#x27;t return it because I don&#x27;t have the time, I&#x27;m going overseas.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> So I purchased this sanitizer just three short months ago.  It worked at first, but had an insatiable appetite for batteries.  In the two solid months that it was working, it went through about 4 sets of AAA batteries.  After two months, it completely stopped working.  Now it&#x27;s just an expensive box.</li>
            <li> This is a really good sanitizer its got a fairly nice design stands out on the counter so people know not to knock it over it isnt very pretty but thats not the goal for it.  the reason i gave it four stars is the flimsy construction when this item is knocked over my toothbrush is sent skipping across the floor and the mirror on the front pops out if the tooth brush was more secure this would be the best</li>
            <li> Good for mouth health. After every brush to desinfect it. Use it at home or travel&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean and store</li>
