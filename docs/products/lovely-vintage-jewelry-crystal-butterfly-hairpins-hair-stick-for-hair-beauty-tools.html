            <li>This is very pretty and worth the price.</li>
            <li>This barrette is beautiful, but it is so heavy that is falls right out of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever bought anything so worth</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Beautiful product at an unbelievable price.</li>

            <li>it slips right thru.</li>
            <li>Worth the money spent and came to me packaged nicely.</li>
            <li>It took over a month to get it, but it a pretty big size, clips closed well and is gorgeous!  </li>
            <li>The stones are pretty and haven&#x27;t fall out of any of the clips we have.</li>
            <li>It is so well made and just so pretty.  </li>
            <li>I ordered six different hair clips and I thought this one would be my favorite.</li>
            <li>I will pay more attention to size details in the future!</li>
            <li>Product looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve looked around for a pretty clip but couldn&#x27;t find just what I was searching for in stores</li>
            <li>I went to clip this on for the first time.</li>
            <li>If it were just a different color than expected, I would be happy but that isn&#x27;t the problem.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice hair clip; beautiful and well-made, but unfortunately, it is way too heavy for my hair.  </li>
            <li>This lovely hair clip is strong and very heavy duty.</li>
            <li>This is large hair clip</li>
            <li>Its beautiful!!Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>It is very well made.</li>
            <li>Pic does no justice to what really looks like when you receive it...</li>
            <li>So, really 3 1/2 stars.</li>
            <li>Which, by itself, isn&#x27;t much to complain about.</li>
            <li>Usually, these clips come packaged in bubble wrap envelopes, but this one was just placed in a tiny envelope and shipped, and this is the first time I have ever received one of these hair clips that wasn&#x27;t in great condition.</li>
            <li>With free shipping from China and the very low cost, it doesn&#x27;t make sense to pay to return it.  </li>
            <li>This is a very well made product.  </li>
            <li>I think there are prettier in real life then the pics</li>
            <li>It is heavier than I thought &amp; the detail is absolutely beautiful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>What I wanted was a true red hair pin.</li>
            <li>I love the charm that comes down, as well.</li>
            <li>When they arrived though, this particular hair clip with the butterfly and dangling chain looked nothing like the picture.  </li>
            <li>and it would cost me more to ship it back to China than I spent on it in the first place.  </li>
            <li>Works great for wearing hair up, down, or half up/down.</li>
            <li>It looks very vintage and classy, despite the costume stones.</li>
            <li>I usually buy in pairs but have since ordered more for myself and my sister.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s pretty big.  </li>
            <li>Packaged a little cheaply in just a plastic</li>
            <li>However, the hairpin is huge and heavy.</li>
            <li>My 6 year old daughter likes to wear them to school.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I absolutely adore it and definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>Has an old fashioned look to it, like it would have been worn in another time.  </li>
            <li>Love the different uses and its not too heavy.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and big enough to hold thick bsl hair.</li>
            <li>I have average hair thickness and no matter how much I pull together, the pin just slips off.  </li>
            <li>If you have long, thick hair and put it up in a bun and then place this pin around/thru the bun, it will stay in just fine.</li>
            <li>The original item was supposed to have two hanging pieces/chains, mine came with only one, the other one is missing and a piece of chain was found in the envelope it came in.</li>

            <li> My 6 year old daughter likes to wear them to school.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I absolutely adore it and definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Has an old fashioned look to it, like it would have been worn in another time.  </li>
            <li> Love the different uses and its not too heavy.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and big enough to hold thick bsl hair.</li>
            <li> I have average hair thickness and no matter how much I pull together, the pin just slips off.  </li>
            <li> If you have long, thick hair and put it up in a bun and then place this pin around/thru the bun, it will stay in just fine.</li>
            <li> The original item was supposed to have two hanging pieces/chains, mine came with only one, the other one is missing and a piece of chain was found in the envelope it came in.</li>
            <li> The dangly thing actually broke while I was trying to take it off, so I don&#x27;t think it would have lasted very long, anyway.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Must have hair that is on the thick side to hold product in place because it is quite large and heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller</li>
            <li> , I have long hair and wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else to clip my hair up with...</li>
            <li> I ordered a red hair clip, the one I received is the pink version to it.</li>
            <li> And bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is long as the palm of my hand end to end.</li>
            <li> The clip is only big enough to clip about half of the bun, but it is tight and sturdy enough to hold in place all day.</li>
            <li> Very pretyy- a little on the heavy side</li>
            <li> The first hair clip arrived broken, I sent the picture of the damaged clip as requested.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is VERY sparkly, which is not a complaint, but it does make this clip difficult to dress down for work/school.</li>
            <li> put my hair up in a loose bun and then clip it from the side.</li>
            <li> loose stones had to be glued</li>
            <li> I tried to wiped the glue off with a damp towel, and the stones began coming loose from their setting.</li>
            <li> My hair is so long and heavy that ponytails were painful, so this has provided me with a very viable option for getting my hair up and out of my face quickly and painlessly.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, it was inexpensive enough that I won&#x27;t feel too bad donating it to the secondhand store.</li>
            <li> The gems on the butterfly are red(ish), but the gems on the rest of the pin are pink.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of them: one purple and one pink.  </li>
            <li> so it was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair and specifically chose one that was double-pronged because I felt it would hold better, so I am a bit disappointed by this.</li>
            <li> I guess the damage must have occurred during the shipping process, due to the lack of protection/padding.</li>
            <li> only it is a little heavy daughters</li>
            <li> it was bent and would not open or close properly, and a piece by the hinge was broken off (as in, missing), and a rhinestone was actually missing.</li>
            <li> They are almost identical in color although one has a slightly darker shade.  </li>
            <li> A little too formal for everyday wear though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little heavier than I would like, but since it holds my hair so well, that&#x27;s not a huge problem.</li>
            <li> It is almost 5&amp;#34; and would really only work for someone with very thick or curly hair.</li>
            <li> few days ago.</li>
            <li> We have a few of these hair clips.</li>
            <li> Although, it falls out of my hair because it is really heavy.</li>
            <li> This is just heavy.</li>
            <li> In any case, I have a few things to say about this item.</li>
            <li> Another waste of money.</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t any stones missing, nor is there any damage from shipping.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a bit heavy for the hair, tends to slide out</li>
            <li> To sum up, it was broken in several places, it was the wrong colour, and it would not open/close properly.</li>
            <li> Too bad I was really looking forward to wearing it.</li>
            <li> It seemed from the picture posted that its a small hair pin</li>
            <li> but not sure how to get it to hold</li>
            <li> the item is not cheap made..awesome piece to wear!</li>
            <li> have long thick hair don&#x27;t know if it would work for someone with thin hair</li>
            <li> The picture provided on the web site makes it look like small hair pins you could slide on the sides of your hair</li>
            <li> It is also very heavy.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing since the picture looks so pretty.</li>
            <li> When I removed the hair clip from the package the stones had a dull look to them and the hair clip was sticky.</li>
            <li> The colors were awful and it looks so cheap.</li>
            <li> People keep complaining that it is too heavy for their thin hair-</li>
            <li> you have thick (even incredibly thick hair like me-</li>
            <li> It is a bit too thick to try placing bobby pins around it to keep it in place, but once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s not a problem.</li>
            <li> If you have thin hair, don&#x27;t buy this piece.</li>
            <li> Part of the bit that hangs off the chain had broken off.</li>
            <li> The colors are a weird muted tone and they don&#x27;t sparkle at all.  </li>
            <li> Seriously!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so bad</li>
            <li> disappointed with purchase.</li>
            <li> I was also slightly disappointed in the color.  </li>
            <li> I am definitely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed with any if these hair clips or barettes from China metal not plastic</li>
            <li> I just got this today and was terribly disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great clip - it holds my fine, waist-length hair up off my neck perfectly.  It&#x27;s a little heavier than I would like, but since it holds my hair so well, that&#x27;s not a huge problem.</li>
            <li> It is a bit heavier than i thought it would be but its a really pretty accessory and stays in the hair fairly well. Also easy to adjust if it dose fall out of place.</li>
            <li> I love this one it&#x27;s lighter weight than the other one and stays in my hair and look very nice.</li>
            <li> This lovely hair clip is strong and very heavy duty. Every time I wear this one, I get a lot of compliments. Very sturdy and pretty this hair clip is strong and is made with love and care. I&#x27;d recommend this seller to anyone who asks.</li>
            <li> People keep complaining that it is too heavy for their thin hair- well, you&#x27;ve been warned! If you have thin hair, don&#x27;t buy this piece. Go to Dollar Tree and buy a cute plastic hairpin that will help you! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have thick (even incredibly thick hair like me- to the point almost no hairpiece ever works!) hair and like the style- BUY THESE PIECES! Seriously!!! They are so sturdy for the price! Plus, the design detail is amazing! I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever bought anything so worth it&#x27;s weight. Because of this, I bought one for every member of my thick haired family as a gift! :D</li>
            <li> Gift for a friend, and she absolutely loved it. It has a cute vintage look to it. The two &amp;#34;dangly&amp;#34; strands tend to get tangled though.</li>
            <li> These are Beautiful hair clips, they are made strong and hold well, I have long hair and wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else to clip my hair up with...Such Beautiful colors. Every where I go strangers stop and ask me, where did you get that hair clip.</li>
            <li> This is just lovely wished I had bought two.  I usually buy in pairs but have since ordered more for myself and my sister.  These clips are just beautiful and this seller has prompt delivery.  thank yoy.  I will order again.</li>
            <li> A lot of reviewers say that this is too heavy to wear, but you really just have to get the trick of placing it. If you have long, thick hair and put it up in a bun and then place this pin around/thru the bun, it will stay in just fine. It is a bit too thick to try placing bobby pins around it to keep it in place, but once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s not a problem. I always get compliments when I wear this out.</li>
            <li> It seemed from the picture posted that its a small hair pin but actually it was a big hair pin, one which i already ordered of the same size and shape (but different color) few days ago. besides, this didn&#x27;t meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Its beautiful!!Thank you so much. I&#x27;ve already wore it &amp; enjoyed it. Have a great day!! God Bless</li>
            <li> Takes awhile to arrive so order it awhile before you need it.  It is a beautiful hairpin!  I gave it for a gift and they loved it!</li>
            <li> disappointed with purchase. they have 2 different images for the same item??? purchased 1 thing received something completely different. won&#x27;t order again.</li>
            <li> This is very pretty, I think it&#x27;s even prettier in person. Definitely worth the money. I purchased it in several colors.</li>
            <li> We have a few of these hair clips. This one is as good as the rest! Its on the heavier side, which is nice because it stays put pretty well. Very well made. My 6 year old daughter likes to wear them to school. We pull her hair back in a ponytail and put the clips above the ponytail. They stay in all day, through whatever she does at school. From library to gym class. This one in particular sparkles nicely. The stones are pretty and haven&#x27;t fall out of any of the clips we have. I am very happy with this clip and can&#x27;t wait to purchase more!!!!!</li>
            <li> The item I received is actually different from what is pictured. The picture shows a double-prong clamp and the one I received from BUY in House is single-pronged. I have a lot of hair and specifically chose one that was double-pronged because I felt it would hold better, so I am a bit disappointed by this. That said, the one I received seems to work okay and it would cost me more to ship it back to China than I spent on it in the first place.  It&#x27;s very pretty and feels sturdy. I removed the dangly thing, because I didn&#x27;t want it getting tangled in my hair. The dangly thing actually broke while I was trying to take it off, so I don&#x27;t think it would have lasted very long, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put my hair up in a loose bun and then clip it from the side. The clip is only big enough to clip about half of the bun, but it is tight and sturdy enough to hold in place all day. My hair is so long and heavy that ponytails were painful, so this has provided me with a very viable option for getting my hair up and out of my face quickly and painlessly.</li>
            <li> This is very pretty and worth the price. Seems to be make of pretty good quality. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I ordered the butterfly pin for me, and I have not had the chance to wear it yet, but it is very pretty. I cannot wait until I get to show it off to my friends!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold in my hair and the colors don&#x27;t match. i will probably try to color in the butterfly and anything that color to make it look ok. but not sure how to get it to hold</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price it was sold. Although, it falls out of my hair because it is really heavy.</li>
            <li> This just came. What I wanted was a true red hair pin. The gems on the butterfly are red(ish), but the gems on the rest of the pin are pink. It won&#x27;t work for me at all. Fortunately, it was inexpensive enough that I won&#x27;t feel too bad donating it to the secondhand store.</li>
            <li> I only got the hair piece and you got your money,but I have never got any thing else I ordered..I want it please</li>
            <li> Shipping/packaging : Arrived on time. Packaged a little cheaply in just a plastic envelope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product : very pretty, great craftsmanship. I receive compliments every time I wear it. Must have hair that is on the thick side to hold product in place because it is quite large and heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller : I would order from this seller again. Beautiful product at an unbelievable price.</li>
            <li> I waited 3-4 weeks for this to arrive because it is imported.  It is so well made and just so pretty.  I am very happy with it, and will most likely buy more.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this item.  It is even prettier than it appears in the picture.  It is very well made.</li>
            <li> Did not receive the item as pictured.</li>
            <li> This is just heavy. I have to use bobby pins in order to keep it in place.  It would be perfect other than that.  It is lovely!</li>
            <li> Pic does no justice to what really looks like when you receive it...my sisters loved it so much that they are ordering one as well..the item is not cheap made..awesome piece to wear! So if your thinking of buying you should..I&#x27;m ordering more..I love these hair clips!</li>
            <li> Lovely , antique and gold , you can have it for years and pass it on to a loved one .</li>
            <li> I gave this to my sister and she loves it. She wears them all the time. This is just one of the many I have given here.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice hair clip; beautiful and well-made, but unfortunately, it is way too heavy for my hair.  I have shoulder length, fine hair and this clip just falls out of it.  It&#x27;s about the length of my palm so it&#x27;s pretty big.  I was expecting something more bobby pin sized  but that&#x27;s my fault; not theirs.  I was also slightly disappointed in the color.  I bought 2 of them: one purple and one pink.  They are almost identical in color although one has a slightly darker shade.  So, really 3 1/2 stars.</li>
            <li> This clip is so super beautiful.  It took over a month to get it, but it a pretty big size, clips closed well and is gorgeous!  I love the charm that comes down, as well.</li>
            <li> Pretty and strong clip</li>
            <li> I ordered six different hair clips and I thought this one would be my favorite. It came from China so it took about a month to receive them. I knew that going in, so no big deal. When they arrived though, this particular hair clip with the butterfly and dangling chain looked nothing like the picture.  The colors were awful and it looks so cheap. The colors are a weird muted tone and they don&#x27;t sparkle at all.  If it were just a different color than expected, I would be happy but that isn&#x27;t the problem. The problem is it looks cheap! It&#x27;s so bad I threw it away.  The other clips I bought were beautiful but this one is not.  Very disappointing since the picture looks so pretty.</li>
            <li> The item I ordered is not the one pictured here, the photo has been changed since I placed my order. In any case, I have a few things to say about this item. I ordered a red hair clip, the one I received is the pink version to it. Which, by itself, isn&#x27;t much to complain about. The original item was supposed to have two hanging pieces/chains, mine came with only one, the other one is missing and a piece of chain was found in the envelope it came in. The part by the hinge that you have to squeeze to open it was bent and would not open or close properly, and a piece by the hinge was broken off (as in, missing), and a rhinestone was actually missing. Usually, these clips come packaged in bubble wrap envelopes, but this one was just placed in a tiny envelope and shipped, and this is the first time I have ever received one of these hair clips that wasn&#x27;t in great condition. I am definitely disappointed. I guess the damage must have occurred during the shipping process, due to the lack of protection/padding. To sum up, it was broken in several places, it was the wrong colour, and it would not open/close properly.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product and arrived in only a couple of weeks. Looks worth way more than I paid. Get compliments every time I wear it.</li>
            <li> great for long hair to dress up a pony tail or  1/2 up etc.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and big enough to hold thick bsl hair. It&#x27;s beautiful in person andI received lots of compliments on it. Makes a lovely gift too :)</li>
            <li> For the price and free shipping, this product is good quality and looks just like the photo.  However, the hairpin is huge and heavy. It is almost 5&amp;#34; and would really only work for someone with very thick or curly hair. I have average hair thickness and no matter how much I pull together, the pin just slips off.  With free shipping from China and the very low cost, it doesn&#x27;t make sense to pay to return it.  I will pay more attention to size details in the future!</li>
            <li> This is large hair clip and I love it. I have received many compliments about it because it is just gorgeous. Totally worth it in my opinion. I greatly enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Pictures do not do this justice.  This is absolutely beautiful.  I figured it would be like something from Wal-Mart but it is definitely NOT.  This is a very well made product.  It is heavy but stays put very well.  Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed with any if these hair clips or barettes from China metal not plastic</li>
            <li> Love the this pretty hair clip, nothing cheap about it.  Worth the money spent and came to me packaged nicely.</li>
            <li> Beautiful hair clip, the colors are amazing and it looks great. Works great for wearing hair up, down, or half up/down. Love the different uses and its not too heavy.</li>
            <li> loose stones had to be glued</li>
            <li> Very pretyy- a little on the heavy side so you need a lot of hair to keep it in place. Well worth the money</li>
            <li> This is prettier than the picture shows. And bigger than I expected. It was a birthday gift  that was worn the same night.  I think she was happy with it.</li>
            <li> for the price great deal it is made out of metal seams well built only it is a little heavy daughters have long thick hair don&#x27;t know if it would work for someone with thin hair I think there are prettier in real life then the pics</li>
            <li> I did not see the part HAIR STICK so it was not what I expected. I can&#x27;t wear it my FINE hair it slips right thru. The picture provided on the web site makes it look like small hair pins you could slide on the sides of your hair</li>
            <li> The first hair clip arrived broken, I sent the picture of the damaged clip as requested. Another was shipped to me. Upon opening the package, I notice a stronge &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; smell. When I removed the hair clip from the package the stones had a dull look to them and the hair clip was sticky. I tried to wiped the glue off with a damp towel, and the stones began coming loose from their setting.</li>
            <li> It weighs a ton and is much larger then I thought it would be. It is bulky and won&#x27;t stay in my hair</li>
            <li> Thought this was very pretty.  This one was requested and I thought it was a good choice.  Loved the color of it and hope it lasts, haven&#x27;t heard yet.</li>
            <li> This barrette is beautiful, but it is so heavy that is falls right out of my hair.  I cannot wear it.  Again, no invoice so I cannot return it.  Another waste of money.</li>
            <li> I just got this today and was terribly disappointed. It was cheaply shipped - not even in a box. When I opened it a piece fell out. Part of the bit that hangs off the chain had broken off. The beads are cheap plastic that were not an even color. Too bad I was really looking forward to wearing it.</li>
            <li> Product looks exactly like the picture. There aren&#x27;t any stones missing, nor is there any damage from shipping.&lt;br /&gt;It is VERY sparkly, which is not a complaint, but it does make this clip difficult to dress down for work/school. It is also very heavy. I have thin blonde hair, which means I have to put all my hair up to get this clip to hold securely. However, my friend with curly hair tried it on and she can use it to clip back smaller pieces (like just one side around her face, or a half-up hairstyle).&lt;br /&gt;Overall I absolutely adore it and definitely recommend it. It looks very vintage and classy, despite the costume stones.</li>
            <li> This is a HUGE barrette.  I must have not paid attention to the dimensions of the product.  However, it looks beautiful in my daughter&#x27;s long, brown hair.</li>
            <li> Very pretty and well made piece.  Has an old fashioned look to it, like it would have been worn in another time.  I can see a flapper with a bob wearing this to hold her hair back. A little too formal for everyday wear though.</li>
            <li> This is really a nice hair clip. It is heavier than I thought &amp; the detail is absolutely beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve looked around for a pretty clip but couldn&#x27;t find just what I was searching for in stores so took a chance on this one.&lt;br /&gt;It is long as the palm of my hand end to end. Looks great in my hair &amp; is well made.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let the price fool you here, this clip really is well made, a nice size &amp; looks adorable on.</li>
            <li> I love this hair pin. It&#x27;s gorgeous it really is worth the money. I would love to get more in many different colors. Do get this item.</li>
            <li> I went to clip this on for the first time. The metal where you squeeze, broke and scratched my hand. I can&#x27;t get this to open in a practical way anymore, and the back is jagged.</li>
            <li> Very beautiful inexpensive makes a great conversation piece . But it&#x27;s a bit heavy for the hair, tends to slide out must pin hair to help hold in, but it&#x27;s worth it, I got more than one! Love them</li>
