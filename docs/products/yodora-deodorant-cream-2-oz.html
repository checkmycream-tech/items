            <li>A great price, nice, light scent, goes on smoothly, but I must apply it more than once a day for it to work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love Yodora, works just as described.</li>
            <li>I have used yodora for years and love it.</li>
            <li>I love using Yodora.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Was better off keeping what I was using before.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>It also stops odor as well as, or better than anything else that I have used.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have purchased many deodorants over the years that just has not woked out.  </li>
            <li>It has a very clean, refreshing scent -- yet neutral.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I take this and use liquid chlorophyll and it keeps me odor free all day for the most part.</li>
            <li>Yodora is safe and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use anti perspirants they irritate me, so this product is very mild without any discomfort.</li>
            <li>easy on your underarm with out contaminating your skin , or shall i say metal in your system</li>
            <li>I was able to use this for about 3 months with amazing success from the very first day.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t available on Amazon for quite a while.  </li>
            <li>At that time it was also available in a tube.</li>
            <li>This is a good deodorant product for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>This is a good, natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it!</li>
            <li>I was sooo excited.  </li>
            <li>Quick ship.</li>
            <li>This item was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>the 1950&#x27;s and recently re-discovered this perfect product -- can only hope the new&lt;br /&gt;producers do not change a thing.</li>
            <li>Non staining, mild fragrance.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve found yourself somewhat allergic to harsher deodorants I can recommend this as a mild alternative.</li>
            <li>This is the best deodorant that I have used.. not one complaint about it and it is natural and healthy for you.</li>
            <li>It is mild but effective for my purposes and it does not contain aluminum which I see as a big plus.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product with complete success for more years than I can remember.</li>
            <li>Not irritating to sensitive skin, and effective as a deodorant; doesn&#x27;t seem to affect clothing.</li>
            <li>Best working non irritating deodorant on the market.  </li>
            <li>I received yodora right on time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had, for some reason, more problems with odor in my left armpit than my right!</li>
            <li>very soft creamy easy to use works well for me,</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>I have at least a dozen deodorants in my cabinet, all of which cause me great irritation.</li>
            <li>Most drug stores in my area do not stock it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>So glad to see it&#x27;s back!</li>
            <li>First used Yodora&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone willing to try something as an alternative to roll-ons.</li>
            <li>If i&#x27;ve been really active I can get a good 8 hours out of this but still thats better than all the other products i&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>It feels a wee bit gritty and greasy at first but melts with body temp leaving a smooth barrier.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to keep changing, and it helps really well with underarm odors.</li>
            <li>and the aluminum-based anti-perspirant/deodorants just weren&#x27;t working very well.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>Unlike most natural deodorants, this one actually works!</li>
            <li>Lush has a dry rub on that&#x27;s even better than Soapwalla, but the price is also high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great smell, and can work for 24 hours without fail.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend Yodora deodorant cream for users with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of weird when you first start using it because it&#x27;s in a jar</li>
            <li>The cream does seem to oil-stain certain types of fabric, but usually hitting the shirt with shout before hand helps clean that out.</li>
            <li>After unsuccessful trials of Tom&#x27;s and Herbal Clear, I&#x27;m ordering Yodora in bulk.</li>
            <li>It washes out completely in my experience.</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time and really works.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it is worth those tiny inconveniences to have an aluminum and propylene glycol-free deodorant that actually works!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it now for a couple of months and not only does it work, but it doesn&#x27;t bother my very sensitive under arms.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as gentle as competitive \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products, but it&#x27;s also very effective--unlike Tom&#x27;s and Herbal Clear, which only protect for a few hours.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of like Brylcream, a little dab will do ya, so I&#x27;ve got enough to last a long long time now.</li>
            <li>I break out from using the regular stick deodorants even Dove for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that regular deodorants will make my underarms sore if I don&#x27;t change them frequently.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of expensive</li>
            <li>Decided to give it a try, first day was good second day was not good third day not good at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Soapwalla offers a better alternative that lasts longer, but it&#x27;s expensive.  </li>
            <li>Very natural prodiuct that will not break you out and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>deodorant, using only a very little, keeps me odor free and dry, as well -- for two days.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li>So I tried this and have had MUCH less odor problem and find the fact that it&#x27;s not an anti-perspirant to not be too much of an issue.</li>

            <li> deodorant, using only a very little, keeps me odor free and dry, as well -- for two days.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> So I tried this and have had MUCH less odor problem and find the fact that it&#x27;s not an anti-perspirant to not be too much of an issue.</li>
            <li> Also purchased all non aluminum and other natural but never worked.  </li>
            <li> I have absolutely no irritation and it works for me even on the second day if I skip a shower.</li>
            <li> but it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> I was getting rashes and sore underarms form all the other male deodorants, have been using this ever since.</li>
            <li> This has the common problem that all natural deodorants seems to possess; no staying power.  </li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY NO ALUMINUM SALTS</li>
            <li> Some people also find that their particular body chemistry doesn&#x27;t mix well with aluminums,and smell worse with anti-perspirant--not an issue with Yodora.</li>
            <li> Spent a year buying every natural expensive deodorant and the only thing that worked was baking soda and water but that was too harsh.</li>
            <li> By the end of summer I deciced I was allergic to it  due to itchy underarms and a gray discoloration!  </li>
            <li> I gave up mainstream deodorant a year and half ago.</li>
            <li> It typically lasts me all day, though sometimes in the boiling heat of summer I have to re-apply once.</li>
            <li> It is in cream form, so it isn&#x27;t messy.  </li>
            <li> It is a little hard to wipe off the fingers, and it smells a bit like sunscreen.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a small price to pay.</li>
            <li> Yodora is a miracle I have used it for the past 7 months.</li>
            <li> When they stopped manufacturing the tube I switched to other brands, including no deodorant at all, because there&#x27;s a chemical in all of those brands that chapped me under my arms and smelled worse than BO.</li>
            <li> If you are having trouble with deodorant irritating</li>
            <li> Just wish it was less expensive.  </li>
            <li> That led me to Amazon, which is, along with ebay, the source of all things that are difficult to find nowadays.</li>
            <li> using this deodorant for over 30 years if you are afraid of aluminum salts use this</li>
            <li> It is not an antiperspirant which for me caused painful bumps under my arms.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have at least a dozen deodorants in my cabinet, all of which cause me great irritation. I would rotate through them, a different one each day, to avoid severe discomfort and finally quit using them all together. Then I found Yodora and for the last 2 years have been using it every time. I have absolutely no irritation and it works for me even on the second day if I skip a shower.</li>
            <li> This product my Mom of 91 years uses.  Won&#x27;t buy anything else. She uses this cream everywhere on her body.  Who knows maybe this is what is keeping her going. We couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores so when I found it on line she was thrilled. Just wish it was less expensive.  But if it makes her happy it&#x27;s a small price to pay.</li>
            <li> This is a good deodorant product for sensitive skin.  Most drug stores in my area do not stock it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for 20 years.  Great product.  Note that this is not an anti-perspirant, but a deodorant.  It has no aluminums, which means that (a) it&#x27;s healthier (b) it won&#x27;t leave yellow stains under the arms of your clothes (c) it won&#x27;t sting, even after shaving. Some people also find that their particular body chemistry doesn&#x27;t mix well with aluminums,and smell worse with anti-perspirant--not an issue with Yodora. And, you can use it anywhere that perspiration odor is a problem, so you can preserve your shoes, sneakers and sandals.     The only down-side is that it&#x27;s a cream, so you do have to wash your hands after you use it.      It wasn&#x27;t available on Amazon for quite a while.  So glad to see it&#x27;s back!</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery.  Great product.  It lasts all day.  I used it in my youth and am returning to it now in my later years.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> Love Yodora, works just as described. Quick ship. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Yodora deodorant cream for users with sensitive skin.  It&#x27;s as gentle as competitive \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products, but it&#x27;s also very effective--unlike Tom&#x27;s and Herbal Clear, which only protect for a few hours.  I&#x27;ve been using Yodora for years for all-day protection, and my stock recently ran out.  After unsuccessful trials of Tom&#x27;s and Herbal Clear, I&#x27;m ordering Yodora in bulk.</li>
            <li> I have used yodora for years and love it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 30 years.  My parents used it and now I do.  It lasts a long time and really works.  To put it simply, if you sweat alot, you won&#x27;t stink!</li>
            <li> I received yodora right on time. It work very good.</li>
            <li> Best deodorant. I gave up mainstream deodorant a year and half ago.

Came across this on a forum somewhere and decided to give it a try, i&#x27;ve been hooked ever since. I take this and use liquid chlorophyll and it keeps me odor free all day for the most part. If i&#x27;ve been really active I can get a good 8 hours out of this but still thats better than all the other products i&#x27;ve purchased. Always buy the 3+ packs. Stock up on this.</li>
            <li> The only deodorant I use. Mom brought it with her from Florida 60 years ago and it&#x27;s all she used. It allows your underarm to breath unlike antiperspirants. A healthy effective alternative. Holds me all day.</li>
            <li> I love using Yodora. Everyone in my family uses it. I break out from using the regular stick deodorants even Dove for sensitive skin. My family told me to use Yodora. They have been using since they were kids. So I listened to my great aunts and uncles. Yodora is a miracle I have used it for the past 7 months. I have no breakouts or rashes. It&#x27;s a wonderful product. It&#x27;s a deodorizer not an antiperspirant so if you don&#x27;t want to sweat take a container that you have put baby powder or corn starch in and a make up applicator and dust it under your arms and you won&#x27;t sweat. I love this product. It even saves me money from going to the doctor because of those rashes.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best non aluminum deodorant around! The scent is really nice and it lasts ALL day!! It&#x27;s kind of weird when you first start using it because it&#x27;s in a jar and you literally scoop some out and rub it into your armpit. I&#x27;ve been using it now for 3 years and nothing compares! It&#x27;s kind of expensive but it lasts a long time! 1 jar lasts me almost 2 months!! Totally worth it! I&#x27;ll never use anything else!!</li>
            <li> very soft creamy easy to use works well for me, trying to get away from all the chemicals of regular deodorants</li>
            <li> This item was delivered quickly. My husband will only use Yodora Deodorant Cream!  Price was very good.</li>
            <li> This is a good, natural deodorant. Unlike most natural deodorants, this one actually works! It typically lasts me all day, though sometimes in the boiling heat of summer I have to re-apply once. It is a little hard to wipe off the fingers, and it smells a bit like sunscreen. Overall, it is worth those tiny inconveniences to have an aluminum and propylene glycol-free deodorant that actually works!</li>
            <li> My mother turned me on to this about 25 years ago. I was getting rashes and sore underarms form all the other male deodorants, have been using this ever since. Need not apply every day since it stays effective for some time.</li>
            <li> for the perfect deoderant.  I was able to use this for about 3 months with amazing success from the very first day.  I was sooo excited.  By the end of summer I deciced I was allergic to it  due to itchy underarms and a gray discoloration!  Bummer, it worked well for odor control.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant!</li>
            <li> This has the common problem that all natural deodorants seems to possess; no staying power.  A great price, nice, light scent, goes on smoothly, but I must apply it more than once a day for it to work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soapwalla offers a better alternative that lasts longer, but it&#x27;s expensive.  Lush has a dry rub on that&#x27;s even better than Soapwalla, but the price is also high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll finish the Yodora, but wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing product I read all the reviews.Decided to give it a try, first day was good second day was not good third day not good at all. Was better off keeping what I was using before.It went back.To each his own if it worked for you.</li>
            <li> This is the best deodorant that I have used.. not one complaint about it and it is natural and healthy for you.</li>
            <li> This non-aluminum deodorant cream is amazing.  It has a very clean, refreshing scent -- yet neutral.&lt;br /&gt;This deodorant, using only a very little, keeps me odor free and dry, as well -- for two days.&lt;br /&gt;No irritation whatsoever.  While one review cited a perceived inconvenience that you must&lt;br /&gt;apply Yodora with your finger -- no problem at all from my point of view.  First used Yodora&lt;br /&gt;in the 1950&#x27;s and recently re-discovered this perfect product -- can only hope the new&lt;br /&gt;producers do not change a thing.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for years,  I love it</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years. GREAT STUFF!!!........if you like creams. Non staining, mild fragrance. Would recommend to anyone willing to try something as an alternative to roll-ons.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful I can&#x27;t use anti perspirants they irritate me, so this product is very mild without any discomfort.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years.  I&#x27;ve found that regular deodorants will make my underarms sore if I don&#x27;t change them frequently. This cream works wonders.  I don&#x27;t have to keep changing, and it helps really well with underarm odors.</li>
            <li> easy on your underarm with out contaminating your skin , or shall i say metal in your system</li>
            <li> As someone that has become allergic to antiperspirant, I am always on the lookout for something that has a deodorant in it, but no aluminum.  This one fits the bill. It is in cream form, so it isn&#x27;t messy.  It also stops odor as well as, or better than anything else that I have used.  I would recommend this product to anyone.  I&#x27;ve been using it now for a couple of months and not only does it work, but it doesn&#x27;t bother my very sensitive under arms.  Yay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product with complete success for more years than I can remember. It is mild but effective for my purposes and it does not contain aluminum which I see as a big plus. If you&#x27;ve found yourself somewhat allergic to harsher deodorants I can recommend this as a mild alternative.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Yodora as a teenager by my mom. At that time it was also available in a tube. When they stopped manufacturing the tube I switched to other brands, including no deodorant at all, because there&#x27;s a chemical in all of those brands that chapped me under my arms and smelled worse than BO. I&#x27;ve since learned that the chemical is some form of aluminum. There is no aluminum in Yodora.  I was thinking about this a couple of months ago and decided to see if I could find Yodora on Google. That led me to Amazon, which is, along with ebay, the source of all things that are difficult to find nowadays. I purchased three jars. It&#x27;s kind of like Brylcream, a little dab will do ya, so I&#x27;ve got enough to last a long long time now. No more BO on hot days.</li>
            <li> Not irritating to sensitive skin, and effective as a deodorant; doesn&#x27;t seem to affect clothing.</li>
            <li> Best working non irritating deodorant on the market.  ABSOLUTELY NO ALUMINUM SALTS so it doesn&#x27;t cause bumps or clog pores.  Great smell, and can work for 24 hours without fail.  It feels a wee bit gritty and greasy at first but melts with body temp leaving a smooth barrier.  Doesn&#x27;t stain clothes in my experience.  It washes out completely in my experience.</li>
            <li> I have used yodora for 50 years. It has no aluminum. It stops any odor. It is not an antiperspirant which for me caused painful bumps under my arms. Yodora is safe and comfortable. I love it.</li>
            <li> using this deodorant for over 30 years if you are afraid of aluminum salts use this</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. I will always us this product you get my Five Star Wilma Jean Darnell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had, for some reason, more problems with odor in my left armpit than my right! and the aluminum-based anti-perspirant/deodorants just weren&#x27;t working very well. (and I would develop a rash with the clinical-strength formulas). So I tried this and have had MUCH less odor problem and find the fact that it&#x27;s not an anti-perspirant to not be too much of an issue. The cream does seem to oil-stain certain types of fabric, but usually hitting the shirt with shout before hand helps clean that out.</li>
            <li> This just didn&#x27;t work for me, but it might work for you.  Hold on, I just use the container to make my own deodorant cream and that works!!!!</li>
            <li> If you are having trouble with deodorant irritating you try this.  It really works.</li>
            <li> Works and nothing without aluminum has ever worked for me before.</li>
            <li> Use it all that time!</li>
            <li> I like the deodorant because it does what it say. I don&#x27;t like that it is a cream. I wish it came in a roll on or stick.</li>
            <li> the only one I have used for 30 years.</li>
            <li> Very natural prodiuct that will not break you out and long lasting.  I have purchased many deodorants over the years that just has not woked out.  Also purchased all non aluminum and other natural but never worked.  This was recommended and it GREAT!</li>
