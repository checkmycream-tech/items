            <li>Excellent product for anyone with braces.</li>
            <li>Since these toothbrushes were made specifically by Oral-B, I anticipated that they would be the best.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent product.</li>
            <li>The toothbrushes themselves are of great quality at a wonderful price.</li>
            <li>Great orthodontic toothbrushes but</li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>This is a great toothbrush if you have braces or a retainer.</li>
            <li>Price is great and my son has no complains</li>
            <li>Which was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>Good grip as well.</li>
            <li>Thought it would be good to have some extras for her (school, travel, etc).  </li>
            <li>good quality and good price.</li>
            <li>This is a really good brush.  </li>
            <li>hope, if you need a good toothbrush, for your braces, it is good to buy this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Prompt delivery and good quality.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased to get this pack of orthodontic toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I like the trimmed bristles which allow for better reach around the brace wires &amp; I feel like like I&#x27;m getting as good a clean as I can.</li>
            <li>we have the recommended electric toothbrushes, but sometimes when the child&#x27;s mouth is sore, a gentler touch with this vee brush is much better.  </li>
            <li>The indentation in the bristles allows for better brushing.</li>
            <li>Since he started using it the reports from dentist are outstanding before it was needed work.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to find the specialty toothbrushes for braces.  </li>
            <li>I have braces &amp; I like these toothbrushes better than any store bought.</li>
            <li>You will have to replace the toothbrush more quickly than you would if you weren&#x27;t wearing braces.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the ortho toothbrushes &amp; all that amazon offers !</li>
            <li>My daughter uses this brush to clean her retainer.  </li>
            <li>She says it works fine but not quite as good as the one she got from her orthodontist a long time ago.  </li>
            <li>Better than what you can find in the corner drug store and ends up being much cheaper as well.  </li>
            <li>Amazon refunded quickly.</li>
            <li>The v-cut in the middle really lets you get around wires and brackets, and it does a great job on your teeth when the braces come off.</li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced on Amazon!</li>
            <li>It has a special groove for the braces on pretty</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t begin to say how useful this product is.</li>
            <li>Nothing major -- just $6 grand.  </li>
            <li>so far i used 2. 1 toothbrush was excellent, i used it up to 2months until it frayed because i always push hard when brushing.</li>
            <li>They really get around the brackets and clean the wires while getting to the teeth better then a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>They are great for brushing since the head is much smaller than regular toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s easier to manufacture that way, but after buying this one, I&#x27;ve seen other designs that clean easier and under braces and the arch wires, like the Easy Braces brush!</li>
            <li>Have to throw away the whole box after I used the first piece for 4 days!</li>
            <li>As far as the price, you paid a lot for your braces why not spend a little more on a toothbrush that will clean them better and easier.</li>
            <li>Glad to have found them here since I can&#x27;t buy these in any local stores.</li>
            <li>Gets around brackets and wires much better than standard brushes.</li>
            <li>I would definitely be buying more of this.</li>
            <li>I recommend a toothbrush with soft bristles to clean and remove \\&quot;leftovers\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>the design is way much better than regular toothbrush, but it does need to be replaced very often</li>
            <li>I prefer Oral-B and was delighted to find that I could get the toothbrush I needed in the brand I preferred, while at the same time purchasing 6 toothbrushes at once so they will last me 18 months.</li>
            <li>The orthodontist is happy to know the kids can now brush better around all of that (expensive!)</li>
            <li>I could not find them easily at the Department Stores only through Amazon.</li>
            <li>The bristles also seem to hold up better on the rough brackets.</li>
            <li>this vee-shaped toothbrush really helps get into the nookes and crannies around the brackets.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>it works very well for braces.</li>
            <li>Great for reaching those back teeth too due to the smaller head.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for anyone wearing braces.</li>
            <li>Might as well get the subscription if you and/or your kids are in braces, since most cases take 2-3 years anyway and you can save a little money and time reordering.</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;m not convinced that using something more firm than the SOFT bristles is the way to go.</li>
            <li>I supposed the picture showed the old \\&quot;orthodontic\\&quot; model and not the new one.  </li>
            <li>The handle is not as it is in the Amazon product photo, it&#x27;s one of the newer clear handles with the colored rubberized grip.</li>
            <li>what is pictured is the old design.  </li>
            <li>and I think that should have been the one that was pictured, not the old model.   </li>
            <li>Soft (Pack of 6)]]</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft, but not overly soft.</li>
            <li>Her original retainer brush was worn out and this was the only brush that I could find that had a notch cut out like her previous brush.  </li>
            <li>the second brush i am using right now is mental.</li>
            <li>They have to be stiff because they are hitting on metal braces and wear out quickly.</li>
            <li>My teeth are always sensitive now due to the braces &amp; I find I can use these without too much discomfort.</li>
            <li>She complained she couldn&#x27;t get her teeth as clean as she wanted.</li>
            <li>Exactly as shown, but not all of them are purple - I also received some green ones.</li>
            <li>Now - a little help with the orthodontist&#x27;s bill would be appreciated.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the bristles tend to splay out after about 2 months, so I replace these brushes a little more than the 3 months that I would for a regular brush.</li>

            <li> You should also know that the bristles are very stiff, so if you are sensitive to stiff brushes, don&#x27;t get this one.</li>
            <li> This is a  serious solution for one of my children who was really having a hard time brushing around her hardware.</li>
            <li> The bristles were so firm that they hurt my gums, and skipped over small particles.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how this works with your braces.  </li>
            <li> In small, unmarked bills.</li>
            <li> They are however impossible to find at our local markets/drug stores.  </li>
            <li> Only bad thing was a order a pack</li>
            <li> I recommend purchasing the least expensive toothbrushes you can find at the dollar store or grabbing a handful of toothbrushes from the Orthodontists office at each exam.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very tough, could make you gum bleeding!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> This tooth brush is worst one I ever had!!!</li>
            <li> it feels awful!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This was a purchase for my daughter. She complained she couldn&#x27;t get her teeth as clean as she wanted. But she isn&#x27;t complaining anymore.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to get this pack of orthodontic toothbrushes. The toothbrushes themselves are of great quality at a wonderful price. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great orthodontic toothbrushes but what I received is NOT what is pictured here.  I did receive the Oral-B Orthodontic toothbrushes - they are V-cut (meaning the inner bristles are shorter than the outer bristles) but the toothbrush head is oval not rectangular.   The toothbrush handles are white with contrasting color - I believe this is the newer design and what is pictured is the old design.  Glad to have found them here since I can&#x27;t buy these in any local stores.</li>
            <li> The product that was pictured is the one that I thought I would receive in the mail.  The delivery was different.  Turns out, it was not the toothbrush I saw in the photograph.  I supposed the picture showed the old \\&quot;orthodontic\\&quot; model and not the new one.  My shipment contained the newer version and I think that should have been the one that was pictured, not the old model.   Therefore, I think I was misled into thinking that I would receive what was depicted in the picture.  Upon further investigation about the item, its description appeared to be correct just not the picture.  This misrepresentation needs to be corrected so that future consumers will know actually what they will receive after ordering this toothbrush.

            <li> These brushes work excellent. They really get around the brackets and clean the wires while getting to the teeth better then a regular toothbrush. Good grip as well. I highly recommend for anyone wearing braces. As far as the price, you paid a lot for your braces why not spend a little more on a toothbrush that will clean them better and easier.</li>
            <li> Gets around brackets and wires much better than standard brushes. The bristles also seem to hold up better on the rough brackets. Wearing braces means a lot of brushing and one goes through lots of toothbrushes, no suprise. Might as well get the subscription if you and/or your kids are in braces, since most cases take 2-3 years anyway and you can save a little money and time reordering. It&#x27;s a simple product that will make your life a bit easier.</li>
            <li> It works great. Only bad thing was a order a pack but only one came. Amazon refunded quickly. I will order agin.</li>
            <li> Braces aren&#x27;t triangular, so why do the big corporations cut a V-shaped channel trimmed down the middle of the brush and say it fits well around rectangular braces? I guess it&#x27;s easier to manufacture that way, but after buying this one, I&#x27;ve seen other designs that clean easier and under braces and the arch wires, like the Easy Braces brush!</li>
            <li> These are the identical brushes that my daughtr&#x27;s orthodontist reccommends and gives out.  Thought it would be good to have some extras for her (school, travel, etc).  They are however impossible to find at our local markets/drug stores.  When I saw them here for $2.50 per, it seemed like a no-brainer.</li>
            <li> there are times when a parent just has to help their child brush their teeth when wearing braces.  this vee-shaped toothbrush really helps get into the nookes and crannies around the brackets.  we have the recommended electric toothbrushes, but sometimes when the child&#x27;s mouth is sore, a gentler touch with this vee brush is much better.  i send these to school with my child so they can brush at lunch.</li>
            <li> good quality and good price.</li>
            <li> Suggested by my dental hygienist! Very reasonably priced on Amazon! Enough toothbrushes for each of my children with each having a spare/replacement 3 or 4 months from now. The orthodontist is happy to know the kids can now brush better around all of that (expensive!) dental work (braces) in their mouths. This is a  serious solution for one of my children who was really having a hard time brushing around her hardware.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the ortho toothbrushes &amp; all that amazon offers !</li>
            <li> Found these on Tanga in a 12 pack for $10 + shipping in Oct 2013.  Also, I&#x27;m not convinced that using something more firm than the SOFT bristles is the way to go.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this brush to clean her retainer.  Her original retainer brush was worn out and this was the only brush that I could find that had a notch cut out like her previous brush.  She says it works fine but not quite as good as the one she got from her orthodontist a long time ago.  Not sure how this works with your braces.  My daughter only uses an electric toothbrush which she received from her orthodontist after she got her braces.  My daughter is 19 and still uses her electric toothbrush and will never use a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get between some areas of your teeth with braces on, despite the fact that it&#x27;s a specialty toothbrush designed for people with braces. Because of this flaw, I would try other toothbrushes before committing to this one, and I would use this toothbrush in tandem with other toothbrushes. You should also know that the bristles are very stiff, so if you are sensitive to stiff brushes, don&#x27;t get this one. They have to be stiff because they are hitting on metal braces and wear out quickly. You will have to replace the toothbrush more quickly than you would if you weren&#x27;t wearing braces.</li>
            <li> Better than what you can find in the corner drug store and ends up being much cheaper as well.  Cleans great!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my son who has braces. The indentation in the bristles allows for better brushing. Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Just what was needed. Thanks</li>
            <li> Excellent toothbrush for braces</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush if you have braces or a retainer. The v-cut in the middle really lets you get around wires and brackets, and it does a great job on your teeth when the braces come off. I still use this brush for my retainer and my un-braced teeth. My only complaint is that the bristles tend to splay out after about 2 months, so I replace these brushes a little more than the 3 months that I would for a regular brush. The handle is not as it is in the Amazon product photo, it&#x27;s one of the newer clear handles with the colored rubberized grip.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for anyone with braces.</li>
            <li> Price is great and my son has no complains</li>
            <li> Exactly as shown, but not all of them are purple - I also received some green ones. Which was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> This tooth brush is worst one I ever had!!! The bristles are very tough, could make you gum bleeding! Especially the bristles fell in your mouth everywhere during you brush, makes you want to throw up!  it feels awful!! Have to throw away the whole box after I used the first piece for 4 days! It is wasting my money !!!</li>
            <li> Dear Buyer,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This is a really good brush.  It has a special groove for the braces on pretty faces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We hope, if you need a good toothbrush, for your braces, it is good to buy this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  JC</li>
            <li> it works very well for braces. the design is way much better than regular toothbrush, but it does need to be replaced very often, I guess because of the braces</li>
            <li> Recommended by a friend who is a dental assistant and could not find locally.  Since he started using it the reports from dentist are outstanding before it was needed work.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to find the specialty toothbrushes for braces.  I prefer Oral-B and was delighted to find that I could get the toothbrush I needed in the brand I preferred, while at the same time purchasing 6 toothbrushes at once so they will last me 18 months.</li>
            <li> My orthodontist gave me one of these brushes when I had my braces put on in 2009. I couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere, until I discovered them at Amazon. They are great for brushing since the head is much smaller than regular toothbrushes. My teeth are always sensitive now due to the braces &amp; I find I can use these without too much discomfort. I like the trimmed bristles which allow for better reach around the brace wires &amp; I feel like like I&#x27;m getting as good a clean as I can. Great for reaching those back teeth too due to the smaller head. The bristles are soft, but not overly soft.</li>
            <li> I recommend a toothbrush with soft bristles to clean and remove \\&quot;leftovers\\&quot;.  Since these toothbrushes were made specifically by Oral-B, I anticipated that they would be the best.  I was very disappointed.  The bristles were so firm that they hurt my gums, and skipped over small particles.  I recommend purchasing the least expensive toothbrushes you can find at the dollar store or grabbing a handful of toothbrushes from the Orthodontists office at each exam.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well. Lasts only a month because braces tear up the bristles, but that&#x27;s not the toothbrushes fault. Just the nature of the situation.</li>
            <li> i bought 2 dozens (2 boxes of 6 brushes inside). so far i used 2. 1 toothbrush was excellent, i used it up to 2months until it frayed because i always push hard when brushing. the second brush i am using right now is mental. the bristles get caught in my braces.</li>
            <li> I recd. the item in on 2nd day.  Prompt delivery and good quality.</li>
            <li> I have braces &amp; I like these toothbrushes better than any store bought.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t begin to say how useful this product is. A regular toothbrush would be destroyed in about a week&#x27;s time. This money saver buster lasts about 3 weeks. This is an excellent product. I would definitely be buying more of this.</li>
            <li> Now - a little help with the orthodontist&#x27;s bill would be appreciated. Maybe a miracle? Nothing major -- just $6 grand.  In small, unmarked bills.</li>
            <li> I chose this product as it is part of my braces treatment. I could not find them easily at the Department Stores only through Amazon. Thank you for having this product.</li>
