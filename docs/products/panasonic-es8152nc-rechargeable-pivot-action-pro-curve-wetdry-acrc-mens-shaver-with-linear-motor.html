    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The side trimmer is not the greatest but works.  </li>
            <li>Quality of shave is excellent, being as close as Gillette Mach 3 Turbo razors.  </li>
            <li>It was an excellent product.</li>

            <li>shaver has been the best.</li>
            <li>I purchased this Panasonic shaver about 1 month ago and have been very happy with it.</li>
            <li>shaver has treated my skin the best of any shaver I have ever used, and the closeness is among the best.</li>
            <li>I bought what I thought it was the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had, until just 7 months after the purchase, the batteries didn&#x27;t charge anymore.</li>

            <li>The wet-and-dry use is excellent.  </li>
            <li>It is the best razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li>I did spend quite a while researching which would suit the best for a guy like me!!</li>
            <li>and it was the best shaver at the time.</li>
            <li>This is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Oh and it&#x27;s an awesome deal to boot.</li>
            <li>I was impressed with the technology.</li>
            <li>or so I was very happy with the unit.</li>
            <li>It isnt perfect, doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a razor, but it is the best I have ever used</li>
            <li>This is a great product!  </li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;ve been on a quest for the best electric shaver for years.</li>
            <li>it just didn&#x27;t do that impressive of a job.  </li>
            <li>All in all an excellent shaver with all the features anybody would need.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is the best electric I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>I think it is the best shaver I have used to date and that includes Braun.</li>
            <li>An excellent buy.</li>
            <li>best shaver i&#x27;ve ever used.braun is not even (close).that was unintended.</li>
            <li>But no electric shaver is perfect, including this one.  </li>
            <li>believe Amazon is the best place to buy this shaver.  </li>
            <li>&#x27;Best Buy&#x27; carries them, but their price, availability, and model selection are spotty at best.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the best shavers on the market.</li>
            <li>Have been very happy,</li>
            <li>Great!</li>
            <li>- the results have been very good.  </li>
            <li>Not as close as a safety razor, but very good.  </li>
            <li>I find it does a very good job on the neck region, always a problem spot.  </li>
            <li>This is a very good shaver.</li>
            <li>Really ideal.</li>
            <li>Good Luck!</li>
            <li>Great service.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these shavers for about six years, and they&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li>This is a great shaver at a great price.</li>
            <li>I was happy, but didn&#x27;t try anything else.</li>
            <li>The ability to use it in the shower or with shaving cream is great.  </li>
            <li>Not too happy with this model at this time.</li>
            <li>Lectric Shave is also great stuff</li>
            <li>now I am happy with it&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li>IF PANSONIC WERE TO INVENT THAT INTELLIGENT SHAVER..</li>
            <li>6 month ago I bought this shaver, great shaver.  </li>
            <li>This thing looks great.  </li>
            <li>I travel to Europe, so the auto-voltage adjustment is great for me.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with it.</li>
            <li>another thing is that although it shaves great, my neck area always seems to have patches of stubble that will just not come off.  </li>
            <li>have been using it for month or so..&amp; it works great.</li>
            <li>I works great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for all types of shaving.  </li>
            <li>I waited for a good deal and good reviews to try a linear shaver and am very happy with this Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>Upon using it I know think it was a fabulous deal!!!</li>
            <li>Love this razor and it still works after all these years!!</li>
            <li>Very very nice and</li>
            <li>The good news is that it also works great.  </li>
            <li>A give it a try shot attitude has been pleasantly rewarded.</li>
            <li>Battery life is excellent and easily monitored with the 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 percent LED.    </li>
            <li>Battery is good</li>
            <li>it is good.   </li>
            <li>but now the battery is not so good now.   </li>
            <li>I will be fair.</li>
            <li>It defenitely is a good quality shaver.</li>
            <li>I call that a good deal.</li>
            <li>It is a good shaver comparing to the cheaper models.</li>
            <li>Nowadays I have to struggle to get that good results.</li>
            <li>the quality of the product is great, and the shave is nice.  </li>
            <li>Close, comfortable shave and best of all...</li>
            <li>I found this electric shaver on sale and thought it was a good deal.</li>
            <li>Anyway, still recommended for the good shave.</li>
            <li>(Men love beautiful toys- from Gameboy Advance to Pro Curve shavers.)</li>
            <li>Admittedly, I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver in over 5 years, but this one performs exceptionally well.  </li>
            <li>Well, I cannot say that this razor is perfect, but it sure is significantly better than the $20-$40 electrics I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also find that it pulls at the hair more than the rotary as you shave and that it sometimes takes longer, especially in warm weather when the face is more sweaty.</li>
            <li>great weighted item and very comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m very glad that I did.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;YOU WILL LOVE IT !</li>
            <li>The Panasonic Pro Curve is just amazing.  </li>
            <li>or if you use some kind of pre-shave.</li>
            <li>This is a nice shaver.</li>
            <li>i bought this shaver as a gift to my father, but it comes without its own package at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the kind of person who prefers the poorer shave of an electric razor to the cuts I get with a blade.</li>
            <li>Many brands of disposable shavers do a good job.</li>
            <li>the trimmer isn&#x27;t as effective as some shavers I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this excellent product.</li>
            <li>This one has a true plug in charge and works great.    </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re taking more than 5 minutes a day, you&#x27;re being more anal than ME!  </li>
            <li>As always, it&#x27;s great to be able to clean this shaver under running water using an antibacterial liquid soap -- compare that with the klutzy and noisy &#x27;cleaner&#x27; that comes with Braun that requires refills every couple of months.</li>
            <li>Mach 3 is still by far the best razor for shaving.  </li>
            <li>honestly don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll find a better electric........  </li>
            <li>The models with the linear motor are by far the best.</li>
            <li>This is the best so far...</li>
            <li>Every thing went very smoothly and as for the product ...</li>
            <li>I loved the super close shaves for a couple of months.</li>
            <li>of the things I liked with this razor is that the clean-up is easy</li>
            <li>This is a very good electric shaver and it does not cause a lot of irritation to sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic shaver is about 60% quieter,easier on my face,and shaves my neck area better.</li>
            <li>this razor is better than the product at 2-3x the price.  </li>
            <li>The razor works OK.</li>
            <li>I expect better from a company like Panasonic.</li>
            <li>In the short time I have had this razor, it appears to be an excellent product.  </li>
            <li>i have used it for more than five years.   </li>
            <li>The slide-up trimmer does a much better job on sideburns.</li>
            <li>I bought two more.</li>
            <li>Often thought that the geometry of a linear shaver would put more blade front in contact with a beard at any one time for a better shave.</li>
            <li>Go over the spots you just did and make sure you got it all.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ALREADY bought two of the \\&quot;top of the line\\&quot; razors, and I&#x27;ve returned them both; braun and norelco.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d gladly buy this raxor again.</li>
            <li>This is probably one of the best shavers that I&#x27;ve owned in recent memory.</li>
            <li>This model has some improvements that make it even better.</li>
            <li>I really love this shaver.  </li>
            <li>slap on your favorite shaving creme/gel and watch the thing work its magic...</li>
            <li>my girlfriend loves when i use this shaver because my face becomes smooth as a baby&#x27;s [...]!  </li>
            <li>just make sure your skin isn&#x27;t prone to irritation...</li>
            <li>As much as I&#x27;d love to be able to shave with a blade, every time I do it seems to tear up my skin.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use any shaving cream yet make sure to put lotion on my head after I shower, and that&#x27;s been working well.</li>
            <li>and I realised that my skin is even more irritated and sore after shaving with this.</li>
            <li>but I think I am getting better every time I use it.</li>
            <li>This shaver gives a better shave than the Braun that it replaced.  </li>
            <li>I have used several electric shavers over the years and have found that Panasonic does the best for me.</li>
            <li>This razor is much, much better in features and maintenance than my Braun.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another is the price - $60 A comparable Braun for this price does not have as many features.. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;</li>
            <li>half-heartedly thinking that I would have to return it as most of the people don&#x27;t find these kinda shavers performing.</li>
            <li>This is a marvelous upgrade to the Panasonic ES8067 which has been my favorite razor for several years.</li>
            <li>This is quite simply the best shaver I have owned.  </li>
            <li>That said, I don&#x27;t feel that it shaves as close as a blade but for most people I feel it would be a satisfactory shave.  </li>
            <li>Most have always had a problem of one sort or another.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>It takes me a while longer to shave with it to be sure I get all the hairs</li>
            <li>&quot; Well, lets leave some room for more HiTech advances...</li>
            <li>I really have nothing unflattering to say about this great electric shaver.</li>
            <li>and I have seen the same shaver for a lot more money!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very smooth and very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>I actually look forward to shaving with this thing every morning - I  am sure that will wear off with time, but in the meantime I can easily say this is the best shaver I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>The battery life is good, charging is easy, battery level indicator is useful, etc etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i was very happy with the service and the condition of the shaver,very easy to use and very gentle on my skin, i would recommend it very highly.</li>
            <li>Pretty good razor for the price</li>
            <li>I was using a Mach 3 turbo before which gave me a pretty good shave.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, ergonomic, nice design.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Does much better on the smooth expanse of my cheeks.</li>
            <li>Panasonic is an excellent wet shaver.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;e really good for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;But, its really nice and worth a shot - saves a lot of time too.</li>
            <li>The other thing that pushed me to buy this shaver was the excellent price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The cleaning function was a sell for me - run under water and turn it on - its that easy.  </li>
            <li>Easy cleanup.</li>
            <li>The button may be easily bumped in a shave kit, &amp; unless you bring the re-charging unit you may find a shaver that&#x27;s out of juice...</li>
            <li>The battery charges very quickly (it says about an hour, and although I&#x27;ve never timed it...</li>
            <li>What I like about it is that your could use it while taking shower(no gel required) and cleaning is easy,</li>
            <li>I believe this to be the fastest and most comfortable electric razor available today and</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;a plus feature, cleaning is easy, just wash it under the &lt;br /&gt;water.</li>
            <li>My beef with Panasonic Linear models was that the screen deformed quite easily by accident and impaired the shave quality.  </li>
            <li>I like it and recommend it strongly.</li>
            <li>strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The new Panasonic shavers, , except for the very top of the line, are mostly made in China now.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Immediately noticed how comfortable the shave was; took a little while to adjust and get a good shave, but definitely happy with the switch.</li>
            <li>if you haven&#x27;t got a great shave with other electrics, don&#x27;t go by reviews about how amazing this is.</li>
            <li>and I liked panasonic after I used the first one.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I bought this kind of electric shaver, after having used a rotary all my life.</li>
            <li>The charging stand works fine and the razor keeps fully charged.  </li>
            <li>the previous model it works excellent.</li>
            <li>This is the best shaver i ever owned,the replacement blades and screen is expensive,almost half of what i paid for the shaver.</li>
            <li>a perfect shave will be like sandpaper in half a day.</li>
            <li>Bought this unit to shave my head and face and find it does a half way job at best.  </li>
            <li>Easy to handle and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Another huge advantage is time savings.  </li>
            <li>It does fit and move to the contour of my face well.</li>
            <li>I use it with shaving soap and really enjoy the burn and irritation free shave.  </li>
            <li>I have used Panasonic shavers for about the last 10-15 years and have always gotten a great shave with them.</li>
            <li>The price made it all the more worth it.</li>
            <li>All I can say is that I liked it so much</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable to hold &amp; gives a close shave.</li>
            <li>And the replacement foil/blade combo is cheap too.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll sell you mine for cheap.</li>
            <li>/&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shaving is close &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>but once I&#x27;m done my face is as smooth as it can be.</li>
            <li>and still gives a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s given me good shaves and surprised me with no irritation.</li>
            <li>The old one lasted about 9-years; if this one does as well I will have paid about $6/year for good shaves.</li>
            <li>The sonic clean setting seems like a gimic but may be intended for cleaning oily electric shave products, but I have found just rinsing under faucet works fine.</li>
            <li>Seems to be very powerful, with the 13,000 rpm linear motor.</li>
            <li>This one, which allows you to shave in the shower and to clean the head with liquid soap and water, turns out to be much superior to my old Braun in shaving ability and ease of cleaning.</li>
            <li>I bought the first generation of this Panasonic shaver many years ago (~10y) in Japan (~$200) and it stil works fine.</li>
            <li>: Hugely easier to clean than the Norelco.</li>
            <li>close, comfortable and clean shave.  </li>
            <li>Charges quickly and cleans easily -</li>
            <li>Once in a while you discover a product that is so far superior to any of its competitors that you can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s true, and you kick yourself for not having discovered it sooner.  </li>
            <li>And super easy to clean because you can just rinse it with water.</li>
            <li>Some places were $30 or more higher.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth checking it out!</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>However, it seems not user friendly.</li>
            <li>How could I tell it&#x27;s a refurb aside from it coming in a cardboard box instead of the original sealed plastic packaging?  </li>
            <li>Worth every dime!</li>
            <li>The first pass makes me look respectably shaved, however, so a two-minute shave is not out of the question when I&#x27;m in a hurry.</li>
            <li>The shaver is large, but it&#x27;s ergonomically designed and very comfortable to hold while shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have yet to change the screen or the blades, perhaps because I apply liquid soap to clean the shaver after every use as recommended.</li>
            <li>&quot; clean (not washed).  </li>
            <li>snap to clean</li>
            <li>It is sturdy, holds a charge, and give a quick, clean shave.</li>
            <li>Plus it looks cool.  </li>
            <li>But finally I could find a solution for my good shave after buying this product.</li>
            <li>pivot action on the Panasonic is nice</li>
            <li>Panasonic will sell more of their shavers if the replacement blade and screen are reasonable priced.</li>
            <li>I am planning on trying it for the full 30 days before I make up my mind</li>
            <li>you, if you are looking for a simple shaver that is washable (you can put the whole thing in water) and is easy to clean with a great shave, then you have made the right choice.</li>
            <li>and I liked it more because I didn&#x27;t have to wait for my face to be perfectly dry.</li>
            <li>It does clean the razor any better than the normal speed.</li>
            <li>The other reviews speak for themselves, it is a great razor.</li>
            <li>It does a great job shaving without creating irritation around my mouth or on my neck - with other electrics and with blades I always break out in both places.</li>
            <li>Pros : powerful shaver, always deliver clean shave.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never found an electric razor that shaves as close or as quickly.</li>
            <li>IT REQUIRES IS A QUICK RINSE WITH WATER FOR CLEANING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives a decent shave though not any better than the rotaries</li>
            <li>Charges quickly and holds its charge well.</li>
            <li>The blades shave quickly and do not pull wiskers.</li>
            <li>it does get mildly noisy after about a years use</li>
            <li>So if you are looking for a great electronic wet shaver, the Panasonic is the right choice.</li>
            <li>But gradually the shaving quality went down, foil has been loosing its sharpness and battery capacity greatly diminished.</li>
            <li>they say to use it for 30 days, since it takes the skin about a month to get used to a new shaving method, but i haven&#x27;t been able to do that yet.  </li>
            <li>Cleaning is fast and easy and leaves the razor odor-free.  </li>
            <li>If you want a good dry shaver, I would still go with the Norelco.</li>
            <li>BUT its so comfortable and easy to shave with this thing that shaving everyday (or more than once a day) is easy.</li>
            <li>Battery is quick to charge and the charging indicator is handy, but battery life seems short.  </li>
            <li>With a smooth finish and a clean cut, I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li>and you need to clean all of the parts just about every time you use it, with hot water and hand soap.</li>
            <li>The result- he&#x27;s been shaving every 2 days thanks to the fact this model makes less noise, has a great easy-grip design, recharges incredibly quickly and looks cool in the bathroom</li>
            <li>IF I shave everyday or wait a couple of days this razor still shaves great.</li>
            <li>Very close, smooth shave.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re especially good for fast growing, thick beards like mine, because you can use them with shaving cream in the shower.</li>
            <li>So far, I love using it.</li>
            <li>Love the gimbal action.</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;m back to square one, because he loved it so much</li>
            <li>I use a fog free mirror and basic shaving foam and love the results I get.  </li>
            <li>My old rotaries never smelled and never required cleaning more than once every week or two.</li>
            <li>&quot; worth to you?</li>
            <li>but when this thing works many times better wet</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s even more comfortable than my Braun electric, and whisper quiet.</li>
            <li>For most of my adult life I have used electric shavers.  </li>
            <li>But do like the wet shaving...gives a nice clean close shave...</li>
            <li>I bought this after reading the good reviews by other users.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;After using the same, I think conventional shaving is the best way for a man to go.</li>
            <li>The price is right.</li>
            <li>Right out of the box</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s about right).</li>
            <li>Repalced older Panasonic shaver with this one - what a difference and really smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>This was my first electric razor, and let me tell you all that it is WELL WORTH the money.</li>
            <li>and I decided to buy a new, more advanced, model for him since he&#x27;s been kind of reluctant to shave lately.</li>
            <li>Added bonus: cleaning is easy and complete while in the shower.</li>
            <li>It easily out performs my old Norelco quadra. &lt;br</li>
            <li>This razor does better on most of my neck but even if I go back and forth at every conceivable angle, there are 2 large spots it loves to miss.</li>
            <li>It seems to be made for kids just starting to shave or guys with a very light beard growth.</li>
            <li>i have to clean up with a normal razor.  </li>
            <li>and I ordered it on a Sunday night and got it three days later using their free shipping!  </li>
            <li>At first I could get about 4 shaves off of 1 charge but after about 6 months, I could not even get 2 shaves off 1 charge.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using a wet/dry shaver</li>
            <li>Pretty much that should say it all!</li>
            <li>I never get my Braun&#x27;s (and that&#x27;s the only one I use) to work for more than 1-2 yrs.</li>
            <li>If you are a first time user just be patient.  </li>
            <li>This is the first electric razor I&#x27;ve tried in 30 years</li>
            <li>First, it has no manual.</li>
            <li>The ES8086 was the first</li>
            <li>Watch for deals first before buying.</li>
            <li>This is the first time experience that I am unsatisfied with Amazon.</li>
            <li>This was my first purchase at Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Started off with a Remington, and believe it or not that actually did an ok job.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The shaver&#x27;s ergonomic shape fits well in my hands, and the vibrations are pretty minimal...especially compared to clippers.  </li>
            <li>;) &lt;</li>
            <li>The reason was that I was having to go over the same areas more than 2 times and I am still getting a hang of it.</li>
            <li>I have also realized that the key is to shave more often with these shavers.</li>
            <li>This razor can work on both 110v and 240v, which is important for me as I travel overseas frequently.  </li>
            <li>This was my first electric shaver &amp; i boutht after going through Product specification &amp; User reviews.</li>
            <li>It has a better and faster charging system, which is also smaller and easier to pack for travel.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll buy him more Panasonic products in the future; recommend you to do the same; won&#x27;t regret it!!!:) &lt;</li>
            <li>2 hours to do first charge, the sideburn trimmer is  </li>
            <li>The reviews were pretty positive</li>
            <li>Good buy for your son&#x27;s first time shave till he gets a little older.</li>
            <li>When i bought it i thought that it was coming with a trimmer because i don&#x27;t like shaving completely as my skin irritates very easy, so i have to give it to my cousin who had exactly the same problems as mine.</li>
            <li>I get about 8 shaves between charges, but I take a long time to shave compared to most people.</li>
            <li>It works much better than dry</li>
            <li>This is a real nice shaver, I enjoyed it very much though it&#x27;s a little big and heavy.</li>
            <li>shaver is realy good in giving as close shave as a new razors only above chin area..</li>
            <li>I use it dry most often and it is better that way (on my face)  than the times I&#x27;ve tried it wet.</li>
            <li>I did a little research online and discovered that bacteria build up in this kind of shaver</li>
            <li>I find the ability clean the shaver by rinsing it under the tap a big plus and it shaves and recharges fast!</li>
            <li>The wet shave comes out better than the dry shave from Norelco, although still not as good as I was expecting (I guess that is only capable with the the razor).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shaver to anyone willing to switch from a blade.  </li>
            <li>It is comfortable to hold and very quiet for an electric.  </li>
            <li>The foil is thinner curved and this allows you to shave in curves much easier, like under chin or under nose.  </li>
            <li>THANKS FOR LETTING ME VENT.  </li>
            <li>Panasonic is the only one that delivers a close and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Shaves very close with no razor &#x27;burn&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>This is my second Linear shaver and that feature is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Very close, and still   gentle to the skin.</li>
            <li>(just 2 in the whole country)</li>
            <li>as no service center in my country was able to change this so \\&quot;special\\&quot; batteries.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as close as a shave with a straight razor</li>
            <li>The harder I tried the more they tore up my face.</li>
            <li>, I guess, I haven&#x27;t really noticed the benefit between it and having it locked.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really seem to change anything.</li>
            <li>My hand is not tired by the time</li>
            <li>,it seems to work better when using wet with foam</li>
            <li>I was amazed how gentle this shaver was.</li>
            <li>The ES8003 offered a very close shave, but was getting on in years.</li>
            <li>But I was amazed at how gentle it was.</li>
            <li>but as i said I am not satissfied with it even a bit as the whole purpose of buying this shaver was to replace my mach-3 shavers..</li>
            <li>Gotta ask yourself: How much is the \\&quot;gold\\&quot; vs. \\&quot;silver\\</li>
            <li>Shaves very close.</li>
            <li>Also charges fast.</li>
            <li>and it did a reasonable job in that time.</li>
            <li>- I guess they really want you to sign up for the Amazon prime</li>
            <li>The idea of a wet shave with an electric seemed interesting</li>
            <li>I like a really close shave and always shave against the grains.</li>
            <li>razor is very sturdy.</li>
            <li>It gives me a shave that is as smooth as a razor shave without the nicks and constant replacement of blades.  </li>
            <li>I really like the fact that I can lather up my face with shaving cream and shave while showering.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t compare to this panasonic razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to try one more razor out there, and if it doesn&#x27;t meet my expectations then I am sticking with this same old Panasonic</li>
            <li>Ditto to (most) of the other reviews.</li>
            <li>This version is much lighter and charges faster than my older one.</li>
            <li>Then I graduated to a Braun and again, a decent job (very noisy though).  </li>
            <li>If I want to travel with it I have to carry a special bag only for the shaver.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy the shaver for wet shaving as I have always had good luck with dry shaving.</li>
            <li>The dry mode gives a good shave but not as close as the wet mode.</li>
            <li>the Panasonic shaver, I shake the larger chunks out of the easy to remove head directly into a trash can.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic ES8152NC Shaver is one of the best electric shavers I&#x27;ve owned, and I&#x27;ve had quite a few from really cheap to really expensive (the Sharper Image Panasonic at over $400).    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;d been a long time since my cheeks felt that smooth.</li>
            <li>probably the shaver is good, but it is definetly not good for gift.</li>
            <li>only downside I have discovered is that it can take several passes to get a shave that feels very smooth.  </li>
            <li>-- he is wearing a little too much makeup I think), these shavers are $250 or more.  </li>
            <li>but I have found 4-5 is more typical but the one hour charge negates this issue.</li>
            <li>For once I&#x27;d love an electric razor that would give me a close shave and do it in less time than a non-electric.  </li>
            <li>while panasonic makes terrible cordless phones, they make good elect razors</li>
            <li>/&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, a decent value, but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just another electric razor, and at a decent price.</li>
            <li>I was never able to successfully shave with a standard razor, so I always have used an electronic Norelco.</li>
            <li>I got this shaver mainly because I wanted to shave in the shower.  </li>
            <li>But compared to my older and cheaper Panasonic, not as close a shave.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this shaver.   </li>
            <li>highly recommend this model.</li>
            <li>Have been using a Braun 7526 and before that a high end Norelco.  </li>
            <li>would highly recommend item again.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this shaver to others.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Panansonic makes quality electronics and appliances, but unless you plan on buying this for its sleek high tech look, save your money.  </li>
            <li>However the reason I can&#x27;t reccommend purchase is it started having charging problems after a little more than a year and soon wouldn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li>I had an older panasonic shaver for over 5 years and needed a new one.</li>
            <li>It shaves very close to skin, done its job seamlessly.</li>
            <li>It gives me a close shave in a much quicker time than the 2-year old Norelco I was using.  </li>
            <li>I was satisfied with it for a long time, especially with</li>
            <li>He has dark, coarse, straight hair on his beard and seems to think this shaver is not as good as the last one for his type of hair.  </li>
            <li>I had trouble finding fitting blades here in the US</li>
            <li>It is extremely slow (not unlike the rotaries) and despite the time investment with frequent back and forth or eliptical movements, the closeness is greatly lacking.  </li>
            <li>So it is normal that it will wear out someday.</li>
            <li>Probably I wouldn&#x27;t have had problem  if everyday was Saturday or Sunday for me :)  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;</li>
            <li>In some areas of the face, this razor does fine, but in other areas, it performs pitifully.  </li>
            <li>shaving wet or dry it does an amazing job.  </li>
            <li>This product is far better than the one I have previously.  </li>
            <li>I have a heavy beard and very sensitive skin, so many shavers I have tried either won&#x27;t shave close, or make my skin look like I shaved with a brick (scraped &amp; bleeding).This</li>
            <li>Just as a word of warning about OTHER induction charge shavers, I had a Panasonic induction charge and it never seemed to have as much battery power as a true plug in shaver.</li>
            <li>All of the parts were enclosed and everything looked brand new, but it still made me wonder.</li>
            <li>I called Panasonic and they sent me a new foil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll sent my new shaver to a \\&quot;razor junkyard\\&quot;...</li>
            <li>I use to upgrade my razor according to Gillette&#x27;s new products.</li>
            <li>I bought this about a month ago, figuring I&#x27;d try something new after a couple of Norelcos.</li>
            <li>I expect a return of a new razor or I can send it and have it repaired.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s cheaper to buy a new one than to replace the battery.  </li>
            <li>so I decided to get a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am going to  throw it out, for even if I buy a new foil ($39.95)</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how I feel about my new Panasonic 8152.  </li>
            <li>After two Panasonic shavers with quality issues, I tried one of the new Brauns</li>
            <li>However, the adjustable swivel function and foil/screen redesign on this series is much improved giving me a reasonably close shave, with little irritation of my otherwise sensitive neck, and much better than any competitor short of a blade.</li>
            <li>I have only used it as a dry shaver, but it is also good for wet shaving.</li>
            <li>AFTER EXPERIENCING, I CAN ONLY READ THOSE REVIEWS AND LAUGH LOUDLY ..</li>
            <li>is one of the few examples where I&#x27;ve been deceived by Amazon and where they have not measured up to their own quality standard.</li>
            <li>I am sure I&#x27;m not the only one getting shafted by amazon for this product, curious if we should initiate a class action suit against them for misleading consumers!  </li>
            <li>Very fast shave, and very quiet.</li>
            <li>Looking at this product using for about a month or so, I am not so thrilled about what is said , only thing this shaver does not allow you to shave if your batteries are dead and you have plugged in the wall to use it,I had no problem with Norelco products while plugged in the outlet and it will let you shave, you have to be sure that there is charge to shave, Also I noticed that the battery does not last 5 days for regular shaving time which is listed as 3 to 5 min, so the charge on this battery is not enough for what it is said in the manual.</li>
            <li>for as the charging base concerned, one of the previous panasonic shavers ES7006 featured an excellent wall mountable design which I liked but the similar designs are not in the market now.</li>
            <li>Actually, the Norelco would tend to leave big red marks on my skin if I didn&#x27;t get the right angle or on more sensitive areas (lower and back of neck).  </li>
            <li>Nicad rechargable batteries last longer if you first fully charge and then drain them all the way.    </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t actually bled from this since the first week, though.</li>
            <li>This shaver gives me the exact closeness of a regular blade.</li>
            <li>And, needless to say, I like him better with smooth and soft shaved skin...</li>
            <li>I have a thick beard, and after only a couple of weeks, this shaver gives me a nice close shave without much fuss.  </li>
            <li>After using it for 2 weeks, I have found that I only have to go back and clean up with a razor every once in a while</li>
            <li>Shaves fairly well when new and sharp, but blades dull fairly quickly and the shave gets less and less complete fairly soon after starting to use it.</li>
            <li>(I actually   bought a whole new shaver instead of a new foil because I found the shaver on sale for $60 and replacement foil ($35) and blades ($25)</li>
            <li>A full charge lasts over a week with daily use and only takes an hour to fully recharge.</li>
            <li>The wet shave is much better than the dry shave.</li>
            <li>I have found the Panasonic ES8152NC to be the best yet and less expensive.  </li>
            <li>With just a little shaving cream, you&#x27;re off to a smooth, close shave.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually better than the razor in getting a hard to reach area on the side of my neck.      </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lighter, a good tradeoff for the light weight base.</li>
            <li>It comes in a non-branded cardboard box and is clearly reconditioned.  </li>
            <li>Panasonic MUST clear up whether they can allow the shavers to be placed on an induction stand or not.</li>
            <li>Amazon offers this razor at the lowest price I could find.  </li>
            <li>My 10 year old Braun went belly up</li>
            <li>and I like it so much that I am actually writing a review.  </li>
            <li>I have written to the seller and to amazon to see if someone will help my 85 year old dad.</li>
            <li>This is a $100.00 product and I purchased it for the glorified comments (except the last one which I suspect is the real truth.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve used this razor in the hardest way.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s adjustable blade to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This blows my old Norelco out of the water.  </li>
            <li>say I have sensitive skin, but have been wondering about the electric razors for some time now.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave quite as close as my old Panasonic Model ES762 but is faster and easier on my face.</li>
            <li>This shaver is pricey and is quiet, gentle, and ergonomic.  </li>
            <li>out of all thousands of reviews I read for various shavers.. Braun Syncro model came very close..</li>
            <li>cord directly into the shaver in order to recharge it.</li>
            <li>so i dub my old one, the traveler.  </li>
            <li>It also got very noisy over the course of a year and finally started breaking on me.</li>
            <li>It does leave tiny bits of hair on my shoulder, so I have to shower, but it makes cleaning it off that much easier since it&#x27;s a wet/dry shaver.  </li>
            <li>so much so that I now use this regularly and have retired my 10-year-old Braun.  </li>
            <li>Has a harder time than the Norelco on harder to reach spots like just under nostrils, and the top of my jawline.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have thick hair, even if I shave twise a week that&#x27;s ok for the amount of hair growth on my face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an Ok shaver (if your beard is not as thick as mine).</li>
            <li>design is also excellent: Ergonomic power plug, charging base that keeps the razor upright at all times.</li>
            <li>It made quite a mess as I&#x27;d have to surround the bathroom and sink area with newspapers to keep it clean.</li>
            <li>30% angle of the cutting head is also a real positive improvement, getting the correct position for a fast, close shave is easy.</li>
            <li>it is simple as you can run the whole head in a stream of water with a little liquid soap - saves having to buy special solutions like in the Braun shaver cleaner.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Cons : docking station is too small, easy to be flipped over.</li>
            <li>Focking station is too small, easy to be flipped over.</li>
            <li>and it is the first ever to do a half decent job under my chin along my neck.</li>
            <li>all parts was filled in a small amazon box.</li>
            <li>When it goes on sale, its actually cheaper than buying a new set of blade and schreen.</li>
            <li>Further, I contacted Amazon customer service and was assured that the product was new.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Norelco rotaries, including one of the new models which dispense gel, and a Braun foil shaver prior to this one.</li>
            <li>Some were  so bad I have a mental block on their company name, but this one works flawlessly.</li>
            <li>The  dry shave is very close</li>
            <li>Norelco has a much closer dry shave than the Panasonic.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s spent more than a few days inside of the pouch that comes with it.</li>
            <li>It is excellent and useful for hard shave, I mean my beard is very hard and I tried with almost all the types of razors.</li>
            <li>Over the years, I have tried all the major brands and Panasonic still delivers the closest shave for me.  </li>
            <li>Works so much better than my old electric rotary one, and is nearly as close as shaving with a razor without all the hassle (I don&#x27;t use this as a wet shaver, or at least haven&#x27;t yet).  </li>
            <li>A couple years ago I tried a Norelco, and while the concept seems cool (each hair theoretically gets pulled up a little before being snipped)</li>
            <li>: The Norelcos have never done a great job on my neck, but it was evenly bad.</li>
            <li>I came back to the old style of shaving with the manual razor.</li>
            <li>My skin is too sensitive for a blade, so I&#x27;d been using various models of Norelco shavers for over 20 years.</li>
            <li>Shaves closer than my 8 year old Remington which recently died.  </li>
            <li>The only thing lacking on this model that my old Panasonic shaver had was a wall mount charger/holder.</li>
            <li>This could be a BIG problem early in the morning...</li>
            <li>but it was nowhere near as close as my last Panasonic.</li>
            <li>I have tried almost every brand of shaver, but Panasonic certaily discovered the secret to an outstanding shave.</li>
            <li>Any minor bumps will get shaved away in the process in the beginning, causing minor discomfort, but once you have used the shaver for a few days, you&#x27;ll be glad you took the time to get used to it.  </li>
            <li>I looked at other Panasonic shavers and this one has the same specs of higher priced models (RPM, foil head design, etc.).</li>
            <li>I just received this shaver in a small yellow box, not in the original panasonic box.</li>
            <li>I used many electric razors in the past but the Panasonic beats every other razors I&#x27;ve ever used including Norelco and Braun.  </li>
            <li>While he likes the pivot action on this more expensive model, he says the old one actually provided a closer shave.  </li>
            <li>The only real drawback is that it tends to pull a bit in the dry mode if you go several days between shaves.  </li>
            <li>(I didn&#x27;t have any trouble with my previous Remington rotary shaver), I would have to go over the area many times and at different angles.  </li>
            <li>At first I was a little hesitant about ordering stuff from the site</li>
            <li>For wet shaving highly rated.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m not at all disappointed with its performance, its rather great.</li>
            <li>Second, hard to clean.</li>
            <li>I have had a lot of trouble with this shaver after the first couple of months of use.  </li>
            <li>have thick and tough stubbles that cheap shavers could not tackle well, but the sharp blades combined with high RPM motor of this shaver mowed them away smoothly.  </li>
            <li>main problem is due to my face and how it&#x27;s shaped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As I don&#x27;t live in US, I tried to buy them over the internet but nobody sells them, as you have to send the product to a service center to have the batteries replaced.</li>
            <li>I went back to a Braun (the self-cleaning set up), but it really didn&#x27;t do any better of a job than any of the other shavers I&#x27;d had and was expensive to buy that cleaning fluid.  </li>
            <li>Ofcourse, there&#x27;s no match to a conventional razor, but still its decent.</li>
            <li>It would take a little longer than a manual but wouldn&#x27;t scratch as much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s now time for me to find a new electric razor because the blades are no longer as sharp.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> The side trimmer is not the greatest but works.  </li>

            <li> It was an excellent product.</li>

            <li> shaver has treated my skin the best of any shaver I have ever used, and the closeness is among the best.</li>
            <li> I bought what I thought it was the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had, until just 7 months after the purchase, the batteries didn&#x27;t charge anymore.</li>
            <li> The ultrasonic cleaning feature is great too!</li>
            <li> Has one of best trimmers I have used.</li>
            <li> The shaver is excellent.  </li>
            <li> been using item for a week now and very very happy with it.</li>

            <li> The wet-and-dry use is excellent.  </li>
            <li> It is the best razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> I did spend quite a while researching which would suit the best for a guy like me!!</li>
            <li> and it was the best shaver at the time.</li>
            <li> This is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Oh and it&#x27;s an awesome deal to boot.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with the technology.</li>
            <li> or so I was very happy with the unit.</li>
            <li> It isnt perfect, doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a razor, but it is the best I have ever used</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  </li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve been on a quest for the best electric shaver for years.</li>
            <li> it just didn&#x27;t do that impressive of a job.  </li>
            <li> All in all an excellent shaver with all the features anybody would need.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is the best electric I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> I think it is the best shaver I have used to date and that includes Braun.</li>
            <li> An excellent buy.</li>
            <li> best shaver i&#x27;ve ever used.braun is not even (close).that was unintended.</li>
            <li> But no electric shaver is perfect, including this one.  </li>
            <li> believe Amazon is the best place to buy this shaver.  </li>
            <li> &#x27;Best Buy&#x27; carries them, but their price, availability, and model selection are spotty at best.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the best shavers on the market.</li>
            <li> Have been very happy,</li>
            <li> Great!</li>
            <li> - the results have been very good.  </li>
            <li> Not as close as a safety razor, but very good.  </li>
            <li> I find it does a very good job on the neck region, always a problem spot.  </li>
            <li> This is a very good shaver.</li>
            <li> Really ideal.</li>
            <li> Good Luck!</li>
            <li> Great service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these shavers for about six years, and they&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver at a great price.</li>
            <li> I was happy, but didn&#x27;t try anything else.</li>
            <li> The ability to use it in the shower or with shaving cream is great.  </li>
            <li> Not too happy with this model at this time.</li>
            <li> Lectric Shave is also great stuff</li>
            <li> now I am happy with it&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li> IF PANSONIC WERE TO INVENT THAT INTELLIGENT SHAVER..</li>
            <li> 6 month ago I bought this shaver, great shaver.  </li>
            <li> This thing looks great.  </li>
            <li> I travel to Europe, so the auto-voltage adjustment is great for me.  </li>
            <li> I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> another thing is that although it shaves great, my neck area always seems to have patches of stubble that will just not come off.  </li>
            <li> have been using it for month or so..&amp; it works great.</li>
            <li> I works great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for all types of shaving.  </li>
            <li> I waited for a good deal and good reviews to try a linear shaver and am very happy with this Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> Upon using it I know think it was a fabulous deal!!!</li>
            <li> Love this razor and it still works after all these years!!</li>
            <li> Very very nice and</li>
            <li> The good news is that it also works great.  </li>
            <li> A give it a try shot attitude has been pleasantly rewarded.</li>
            <li> Battery life is excellent and easily monitored with the 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 percent LED.    </li>
            <li> Battery is good</li>
            <li> it is good.   </li>
            <li> but now the battery is not so good now.   </li>
            <li> I will be fair.</li>
            <li> It defenitely is a good quality shaver.</li>
            <li> I call that a good deal.</li>
            <li> It is a good shaver comparing to the cheaper models.</li>
            <li> Nowadays I have to struggle to get that good results.</li>
            <li> the quality of the product is great, and the shave is nice.  </li>
            <li> Close, comfortable shave and best of all...</li>
            <li> I found this electric shaver on sale and thought it was a good deal.</li>
            <li> Anyway, still recommended for the good shave.</li>
            <li> (Men love beautiful toys- from Gameboy Advance to Pro Curve shavers.)</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver in over 5 years, but this one performs exceptionally well.  </li>
            <li> Well, I cannot say that this razor is perfect, but it sure is significantly better than the $20-$40 electrics I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also find that it pulls at the hair more than the rotary as you shave and that it sometimes takes longer, especially in warm weather when the face is more sweaty.</li>
            <li> great weighted item and very comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m very glad that I did.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;YOU WILL LOVE IT !</li>
            <li> The Panasonic Pro Curve is just amazing.  </li>
            <li> or if you use some kind of pre-shave.</li>
            <li> This is a nice shaver.</li>
            <li> i bought this shaver as a gift to my father, but it comes without its own package at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the kind of person who prefers the poorer shave of an electric razor to the cuts I get with a blade.</li>
            <li> Many brands of disposable shavers do a good job.</li>
            <li> the trimmer isn&#x27;t as effective as some shavers I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend this excellent product.</li>
            <li> This one has a true plug in charge and works great.    </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re taking more than 5 minutes a day, you&#x27;re being more anal than ME!  </li>
            <li> As always, it&#x27;s great to be able to clean this shaver under running water using an antibacterial liquid soap -- compare that with the klutzy and noisy &#x27;cleaner&#x27; that comes with Braun that requires refills every couple of months.</li>
            <li> Mach 3 is still by far the best razor for shaving.  </li>
            <li> honestly don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll find a better electric........  </li>
            <li> The models with the linear motor are by far the best.</li>
            <li> This is the best so far...</li>
            <li> Every thing went very smoothly and as for the product ...</li>
            <li> I loved the super close shaves for a couple of months.</li>
            <li> of the things I liked with this razor is that the clean-up is easy</li>
            <li> This is a very good electric shaver and it does not cause a lot of irritation to sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic shaver is about 60% quieter,easier on my face,and shaves my neck area better.</li>
            <li> this razor is better than the product at 2-3x the price.  </li>
            <li> The razor works OK.</li>
            <li> I expect better from a company like Panasonic.</li>
            <li> In the short time I have had this razor, it appears to be an excellent product.  </li>
            <li> i have used it for more than five years.   </li>
            <li> The slide-up trimmer does a much better job on sideburns.</li>
            <li> I bought two more.</li>
            <li> Often thought that the geometry of a linear shaver would put more blade front in contact with a beard at any one time for a better shave.</li>
            <li> Go over the spots you just did and make sure you got it all.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ALREADY bought two of the \\&quot;top of the line\\&quot; razors, and I&#x27;ve returned them both; braun and norelco.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d gladly buy this raxor again.</li>
            <li> This is probably one of the best shavers that I&#x27;ve owned in recent memory.</li>
            <li> This model has some improvements that make it even better.</li>
            <li> I really love this shaver.  </li>
            <li> slap on your favorite shaving creme/gel and watch the thing work its magic...</li>
            <li> my girlfriend loves when i use this shaver because my face becomes smooth as a baby&#x27;s [...]!  </li>
            <li> just make sure your skin isn&#x27;t prone to irritation...</li>
            <li> As much as I&#x27;d love to be able to shave with a blade, every time I do it seems to tear up my skin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any shaving cream yet make sure to put lotion on my head after I shower, and that&#x27;s been working well.</li>
            <li> and I realised that my skin is even more irritated and sore after shaving with this.</li>
            <li> but I think I am getting better every time I use it.</li>
            <li> This shaver gives a better shave than the Braun that it replaced.  </li>
            <li> I have used several electric shavers over the years and have found that Panasonic does the best for me.</li>
            <li> This razor is much, much better in features and maintenance than my Braun.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another is the price - $60 A comparable Braun for this price does not have as many features.. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;</li>
            <li> half-heartedly thinking that I would have to return it as most of the people don&#x27;t find these kinda shavers performing.</li>
            <li> This is a marvelous upgrade to the Panasonic ES8067 which has been my favorite razor for several years.</li>
            <li> This is quite simply the best shaver I have owned.  </li>
            <li> That said, I don&#x27;t feel that it shaves as close as a blade but for most people I feel it would be a satisfactory shave.  </li>
            <li> Most have always had a problem of one sort or another.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> It takes me a while longer to shave with it to be sure I get all the hairs</li>
            <li> &quot; Well, lets leave some room for more HiTech advances...</li>
            <li> I really have nothing unflattering to say about this great electric shaver.</li>
            <li> and I have seen the same shaver for a lot more money!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very smooth and very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> I actually look forward to shaving with this thing every morning - I  am sure that will wear off with time, but in the meantime I can easily say this is the best shaver I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> The battery life is good, charging is easy, battery level indicator is useful, etc etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i was very happy with the service and the condition of the shaver,very easy to use and very gentle on my skin, i would recommend it very highly.</li>
            <li> Pretty good razor for the price</li>
            <li> I was using a Mach 3 turbo before which gave me a pretty good shave.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, ergonomic, nice design.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Does much better on the smooth expanse of my cheeks.</li>
            <li> Panasonic is an excellent wet shaver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;e really good for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;But, its really nice and worth a shot - saves a lot of time too.</li>
            <li> The other thing that pushed me to buy this shaver was the excellent price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The cleaning function was a sell for me - run under water and turn it on - its that easy.  </li>
            <li> Easy cleanup.</li>
            <li> The button may be easily bumped in a shave kit, &amp; unless you bring the re-charging unit you may find a shaver that&#x27;s out of juice...</li>
            <li> The battery charges very quickly (it says about an hour, and although I&#x27;ve never timed it...</li>
            <li> What I like about it is that your could use it while taking shower(no gel required) and cleaning is easy,</li>
            <li> I believe this to be the fastest and most comfortable electric razor available today and</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;a plus feature, cleaning is easy, just wash it under the &lt;br /&gt;water.</li>
            <li> My beef with Panasonic Linear models was that the screen deformed quite easily by accident and impaired the shave quality.  </li>
            <li> I like it and recommend it strongly.</li>
            <li> strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The new Panasonic shavers, , except for the very top of the line, are mostly made in China now.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Immediately noticed how comfortable the shave was; took a little while to adjust and get a good shave, but definitely happy with the switch.</li>
            <li> if you haven&#x27;t got a great shave with other electrics, don&#x27;t go by reviews about how amazing this is.</li>
            <li> and I liked panasonic after I used the first one.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I bought this kind of electric shaver, after having used a rotary all my life.</li>
            <li> The charging stand works fine and the razor keeps fully charged.  </li>
            <li> the previous model it works excellent.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver i ever owned,the replacement blades and screen is expensive,almost half of what i paid for the shaver.</li>
            <li> a perfect shave will be like sandpaper in half a day.</li>
            <li> Bought this unit to shave my head and face and find it does a half way job at best.  </li>
            <li> Easy to handle and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Another huge advantage is time savings.  </li>
            <li> It does fit and move to the contour of my face well.</li>
            <li> I use it with shaving soap and really enjoy the burn and irritation free shave.  </li>
            <li> I have used Panasonic shavers for about the last 10-15 years and have always gotten a great shave with them.</li>
            <li> The price made it all the more worth it.</li>
            <li> All I can say is that I liked it so much</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable to hold &amp; gives a close shave.</li>
            <li> And the replacement foil/blade combo is cheap too.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll sell you mine for cheap.</li>
            <li> /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shaving is close &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> but once I&#x27;m done my face is as smooth as it can be.</li>
            <li> and still gives a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s given me good shaves and surprised me with no irritation.</li>
            <li> The old one lasted about 9-years; if this one does as well I will have paid about $6/year for good shaves.</li>
            <li> The sonic clean setting seems like a gimic but may be intended for cleaning oily electric shave products, but I have found just rinsing under faucet works fine.</li>
            <li> Seems to be very powerful, with the 13,000 rpm linear motor.</li>
            <li> This one, which allows you to shave in the shower and to clean the head with liquid soap and water, turns out to be much superior to my old Braun in shaving ability and ease of cleaning.</li>
            <li> I bought the first generation of this Panasonic shaver many years ago (~10y) in Japan (~$200) and it stil works fine.</li>
            <li> : Hugely easier to clean than the Norelco.</li>
            <li> close, comfortable and clean shave.  </li>
            <li> Charges quickly and cleans easily -</li>
            <li> Once in a while you discover a product that is so far superior to any of its competitors that you can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s true, and you kick yourself for not having discovered it sooner.  </li>
            <li> And super easy to clean because you can just rinse it with water.</li>
            <li> Some places were $30 or more higher.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth checking it out!</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> However, it seems not user friendly.</li>
            <li> How could I tell it&#x27;s a refurb aside from it coming in a cardboard box instead of the original sealed plastic packaging?  </li>
            <li> Worth every dime!</li>
            <li> The first pass makes me look respectably shaved, however, so a two-minute shave is not out of the question when I&#x27;m in a hurry.</li>
            <li> The shaver is large, but it&#x27;s ergonomically designed and very comfortable to hold while shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have yet to change the screen or the blades, perhaps because I apply liquid soap to clean the shaver after every use as recommended.</li>
            <li> &quot; clean (not washed).  </li>
            <li> snap to clean</li>
            <li> It is sturdy, holds a charge, and give a quick, clean shave.</li>
            <li> Plus it looks cool.  </li>
            <li> But finally I could find a solution for my good shave after buying this product.</li>
            <li> pivot action on the Panasonic is nice</li>
            <li> Panasonic will sell more of their shavers if the replacement blade and screen are reasonable priced.</li>
            <li> I am planning on trying it for the full 30 days before I make up my mind</li>
            <li> you, if you are looking for a simple shaver that is washable (you can put the whole thing in water) and is easy to clean with a great shave, then you have made the right choice.</li>
            <li> and I liked it more because I didn&#x27;t have to wait for my face to be perfectly dry.</li>
            <li> It does clean the razor any better than the normal speed.</li>
            <li> The other reviews speak for themselves, it is a great razor.</li>
            <li> It does a great job shaving without creating irritation around my mouth or on my neck - with other electrics and with blades I always break out in both places.</li>
            <li> Pros : powerful shaver, always deliver clean shave.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never found an electric razor that shaves as close or as quickly.</li>
            <li> IT REQUIRES IS A QUICK RINSE WITH WATER FOR CLEANING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives a decent shave though not any better than the rotaries</li>
            <li> Charges quickly and holds its charge well.</li>
            <li> The blades shave quickly and do not pull wiskers.</li>
            <li> it does get mildly noisy after about a years use</li>
            <li> So if you are looking for a great electronic wet shaver, the Panasonic is the right choice.</li>
            <li> But gradually the shaving quality went down, foil has been loosing its sharpness and battery capacity greatly diminished.</li>
            <li> they say to use it for 30 days, since it takes the skin about a month to get used to a new shaving method, but i haven&#x27;t been able to do that yet.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning is fast and easy and leaves the razor odor-free.  </li>
            <li> If you want a good dry shaver, I would still go with the Norelco.</li>
            <li> BUT its so comfortable and easy to shave with this thing that shaving everyday (or more than once a day) is easy.</li>
            <li> Battery is quick to charge and the charging indicator is handy, but battery life seems short.  </li>
            <li> With a smooth finish and a clean cut, I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> and you need to clean all of the parts just about every time you use it, with hot water and hand soap.</li>
            <li> The result- he&#x27;s been shaving every 2 days thanks to the fact this model makes less noise, has a great easy-grip design, recharges incredibly quickly and looks cool in the bathroom</li>
            <li> IF I shave everyday or wait a couple of days this razor still shaves great.</li>
            <li> Very close, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re especially good for fast growing, thick beards like mine, because you can use them with shaving cream in the shower.</li>
            <li> So far, I love using it.</li>
            <li> Love the gimbal action.</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m back to square one, because he loved it so much</li>
            <li> I use a fog free mirror and basic shaving foam and love the results I get.  </li>
            <li> My old rotaries never smelled and never required cleaning more than once every week or two.</li>
            <li> &quot; worth to you?</li>
            <li> but when this thing works many times better wet</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s even more comfortable than my Braun electric, and whisper quiet.</li>
            <li> For most of my adult life I have used electric shavers.  </li>
            <li> But do like the wet shaving...gives a nice clean close shave...</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading the good reviews by other users.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;After using the same, I think conventional shaving is the best way for a man to go.</li>
            <li> The price is right.</li>
            <li> Right out of the box</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s about right).</li>
            <li> Repalced older Panasonic shaver with this one - what a difference and really smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> This was my first electric razor, and let me tell you all that it is WELL WORTH the money.</li>
            <li> and I decided to buy a new, more advanced, model for him since he&#x27;s been kind of reluctant to shave lately.</li>
            <li> Added bonus: cleaning is easy and complete while in the shower.</li>
            <li> It easily out performs my old Norelco quadra. &lt;br</li>
            <li> This razor does better on most of my neck but even if I go back and forth at every conceivable angle, there are 2 large spots it loves to miss.</li>
            <li> It seems to be made for kids just starting to shave or guys with a very light beard growth.</li>
            <li> i have to clean up with a normal razor.  </li>
            <li> and I ordered it on a Sunday night and got it three days later using their free shipping!  </li>
            <li> At first I could get about 4 shaves off of 1 charge but after about 6 months, I could not even get 2 shaves off 1 charge.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a wet/dry shaver</li>
            <li> Pretty much that should say it all!</li>
            <li> I never get my Braun&#x27;s (and that&#x27;s the only one I use) to work for more than 1-2 yrs.</li>
            <li> If you are a first time user just be patient.  </li>
            <li> This is the first electric razor I&#x27;ve tried in 30 years</li>
            <li> First, it has no manual.</li>
            <li> The ES8086 was the first</li>
            <li> Watch for deals first before buying.</li>
            <li> This is the first time experience that I am unsatisfied with Amazon.</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase at Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Started off with a Remington, and believe it or not that actually did an ok job.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The shaver&#x27;s ergonomic shape fits well in my hands, and the vibrations are pretty minimal...especially compared to clippers.  </li>
            <li> ;) &lt;</li>
            <li> The reason was that I was having to go over the same areas more than 2 times and I am still getting a hang of it.</li>
            <li> I have also realized that the key is to shave more often with these shavers.</li>
            <li> This razor can work on both 110v and 240v, which is important for me as I travel overseas frequently.  </li>
            <li> This was my first electric shaver &amp; i boutht after going through Product specification &amp; User reviews.</li>
            <li> It has a better and faster charging system, which is also smaller and easier to pack for travel.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy him more Panasonic products in the future; recommend you to do the same; won&#x27;t regret it!!!:) &lt;</li>
            <li> 2 hours to do first charge, the sideburn trimmer is  </li>
            <li> The reviews were pretty positive</li>
            <li> Good buy for your son&#x27;s first time shave till he gets a little older.</li>
            <li> When i bought it i thought that it was coming with a trimmer because i don&#x27;t like shaving completely as my skin irritates very easy, so i have to give it to my cousin who had exactly the same problems as mine.</li>
            <li> I get about 8 shaves between charges, but I take a long time to shave compared to most people.</li>
            <li> It works much better than dry</li>
            <li> This is a real nice shaver, I enjoyed it very much though it&#x27;s a little big and heavy.</li>
            <li> shaver is realy good in giving as close shave as a new razors only above chin area..</li>
            <li> I use it dry most often and it is better that way (on my face)  than the times I&#x27;ve tried it wet.</li>
            <li> I did a little research online and discovered that bacteria build up in this kind of shaver</li>
            <li> I find the ability clean the shaver by rinsing it under the tap a big plus and it shaves and recharges fast!</li>
            <li> The wet shave comes out better than the dry shave from Norelco, although still not as good as I was expecting (I guess that is only capable with the the razor).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shaver to anyone willing to switch from a blade.  </li>
            <li> It is comfortable to hold and very quiet for an electric.  </li>
            <li> The foil is thinner curved and this allows you to shave in curves much easier, like under chin or under nose.  </li>
            <li> THANKS FOR LETTING ME VENT.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic is the only one that delivers a close and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Shaves very close with no razor &#x27;burn&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> This is my second Linear shaver and that feature is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Very close, and still   gentle to the skin.</li>
            <li> (just 2 in the whole country)</li>
            <li> as no service center in my country was able to change this so \\&quot;special\\&quot; batteries.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as close as a shave with a straight razor</li>
            <li> The harder I tried the more they tore up my face.</li>
            <li> , I guess, I haven&#x27;t really noticed the benefit between it and having it locked.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really seem to change anything.</li>
            <li> My hand is not tired by the time</li>
            <li> ,it seems to work better when using wet with foam</li>
            <li> I was amazed how gentle this shaver was.</li>
            <li> The ES8003 offered a very close shave, but was getting on in years.</li>
            <li> But I was amazed at how gentle it was.</li>
            <li> but as i said I am not satissfied with it even a bit as the whole purpose of buying this shaver was to replace my mach-3 shavers..</li>
            <li> Gotta ask yourself: How much is the \\&quot;gold\\&quot; vs. \\&quot;silver\\</li>
            <li> Shaves very close.</li>
            <li> Also charges fast.</li>
            <li> and it did a reasonable job in that time.</li>
            <li> - I guess they really want you to sign up for the Amazon prime</li>
            <li> The idea of a wet shave with an electric seemed interesting</li>
            <li> I like a really close shave and always shave against the grains.</li>
            <li> razor is very sturdy.</li>
            <li> It gives me a shave that is as smooth as a razor shave without the nicks and constant replacement of blades.  </li>
            <li> I really like the fact that I can lather up my face with shaving cream and shave while showering.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t compare to this panasonic razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to try one more razor out there, and if it doesn&#x27;t meet my expectations then I am sticking with this same old Panasonic</li>
            <li> Ditto to (most) of the other reviews.</li>
            <li> This version is much lighter and charges faster than my older one.</li>
            <li> Then I graduated to a Braun and again, a decent job (very noisy though).  </li>
            <li> If I want to travel with it I have to carry a special bag only for the shaver.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy the shaver for wet shaving as I have always had good luck with dry shaving.</li>
            <li> The dry mode gives a good shave but not as close as the wet mode.</li>
            <li> the Panasonic shaver, I shake the larger chunks out of the easy to remove head directly into a trash can.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES8152NC Shaver is one of the best electric shavers I&#x27;ve owned, and I&#x27;ve had quite a few from really cheap to really expensive (the Sharper Image Panasonic at over $400).    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;d been a long time since my cheeks felt that smooth.</li>
            <li> probably the shaver is good, but it is definetly not good for gift.</li>
            <li> only downside I have discovered is that it can take several passes to get a shave that feels very smooth.  </li>
            <li> -- he is wearing a little too much makeup I think), these shavers are $250 or more.  </li>
            <li> but I have found 4-5 is more typical but the one hour charge negates this issue.</li>
            <li> For once I&#x27;d love an electric razor that would give me a close shave and do it in less time than a non-electric.  </li>
            <li> while panasonic makes terrible cordless phones, they make good elect razors</li>
            <li> /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, a decent value, but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just another electric razor, and at a decent price.</li>
            <li> I was never able to successfully shave with a standard razor, so I always have used an electronic Norelco.</li>
            <li> I got this shaver mainly because I wanted to shave in the shower.  </li>
            <li> But compared to my older and cheaper Panasonic, not as close a shave.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this shaver.   </li>
            <li> highly recommend this model.</li>
            <li> Have been using a Braun 7526 and before that a high end Norelco.  </li>
            <li> would highly recommend item again.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this shaver to others.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Panansonic makes quality electronics and appliances, but unless you plan on buying this for its sleek high tech look, save your money.  </li>
            <li> However the reason I can&#x27;t reccommend purchase is it started having charging problems after a little more than a year and soon wouldn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> I had an older panasonic shaver for over 5 years and needed a new one.</li>
            <li> It shaves very close to skin, done its job seamlessly.</li>
            <li> It gives me a close shave in a much quicker time than the 2-year old Norelco I was using.  </li>
            <li> I was satisfied with it for a long time, especially with</li>
            <li> He has dark, coarse, straight hair on his beard and seems to think this shaver is not as good as the last one for his type of hair.  </li>
            <li> I had trouble finding fitting blades here in the US</li>
            <li> It is extremely slow (not unlike the rotaries) and despite the time investment with frequent back and forth or eliptical movements, the closeness is greatly lacking.  </li>
            <li> So it is normal that it will wear out someday.</li>
            <li> Probably I wouldn&#x27;t have had problem  if everyday was Saturday or Sunday for me :)  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;</li>
            <li> In some areas of the face, this razor does fine, but in other areas, it performs pitifully.  </li>
            <li> shaving wet or dry it does an amazing job.  </li>
            <li> This product is far better than the one I have previously.  </li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard and very sensitive skin, so many shavers I have tried either won&#x27;t shave close, or make my skin look like I shaved with a brick (scraped &amp; bleeding).This</li>
            <li> Just as a word of warning about OTHER induction charge shavers, I had a Panasonic induction charge and it never seemed to have as much battery power as a true plug in shaver.</li>
            <li> All of the parts were enclosed and everything looked brand new, but it still made me wonder.</li>
            <li> I called Panasonic and they sent me a new foil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll sent my new shaver to a \\&quot;razor junkyard\\&quot;...</li>
            <li> I use to upgrade my razor according to Gillette&#x27;s new products.</li>
            <li> I bought this about a month ago, figuring I&#x27;d try something new after a couple of Norelcos.</li>
            <li> I expect a return of a new razor or I can send it and have it repaired.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s cheaper to buy a new one than to replace the battery.  </li>
            <li> so I decided to get a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am going to  throw it out, for even if I buy a new foil ($39.95)</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how I feel about my new Panasonic 8152.  </li>
            <li> After two Panasonic shavers with quality issues, I tried one of the new Brauns</li>
            <li> However, the adjustable swivel function and foil/screen redesign on this series is much improved giving me a reasonably close shave, with little irritation of my otherwise sensitive neck, and much better than any competitor short of a blade.</li>
            <li> I have only used it as a dry shaver, but it is also good for wet shaving.</li>
            <li> AFTER EXPERIENCING, I CAN ONLY READ THOSE REVIEWS AND LAUGH LOUDLY ..</li>
            <li> is one of the few examples where I&#x27;ve been deceived by Amazon and where they have not measured up to their own quality standard.</li>
            <li> I am sure I&#x27;m not the only one getting shafted by amazon for this product, curious if we should initiate a class action suit against them for misleading consumers!  </li>
            <li> Very fast shave, and very quiet.</li>
            <li> Looking at this product using for about a month or so, I am not so thrilled about what is said , only thing this shaver does not allow you to shave if your batteries are dead and you have plugged in the wall to use it,I had no problem with Norelco products while plugged in the outlet and it will let you shave, you have to be sure that there is charge to shave, Also I noticed that the battery does not last 5 days for regular shaving time which is listed as 3 to 5 min, so the charge on this battery is not enough for what it is said in the manual.</li>
            <li> for as the charging base concerned, one of the previous panasonic shavers ES7006 featured an excellent wall mountable design which I liked but the similar designs are not in the market now.</li>
            <li> Actually, the Norelco would tend to leave big red marks on my skin if I didn&#x27;t get the right angle or on more sensitive areas (lower and back of neck).  </li>
            <li> Nicad rechargable batteries last longer if you first fully charge and then drain them all the way.    </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t actually bled from this since the first week, though.</li>
            <li> This shaver gives me the exact closeness of a regular blade.</li>
            <li> And, needless to say, I like him better with smooth and soft shaved skin...</li>
            <li> I have a thick beard, and after only a couple of weeks, this shaver gives me a nice close shave without much fuss.  </li>
            <li> After using it for 2 weeks, I have found that I only have to go back and clean up with a razor every once in a while</li>
            <li> Shaves fairly well when new and sharp, but blades dull fairly quickly and the shave gets less and less complete fairly soon after starting to use it.</li>
            <li> (I actually   bought a whole new shaver instead of a new foil because I found the shaver on sale for $60 and replacement foil ($35) and blades ($25)</li>
            <li> A full charge lasts over a week with daily use and only takes an hour to fully recharge.</li>
            <li> The wet shave is much better than the dry shave.</li>
            <li> I have found the Panasonic ES8152NC to be the best yet and less expensive.  </li>
            <li> With just a little shaving cream, you&#x27;re off to a smooth, close shave.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually better than the razor in getting a hard to reach area on the side of my neck.      </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lighter, a good tradeoff for the light weight base.</li>
            <li> It comes in a non-branded cardboard box and is clearly reconditioned.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic MUST clear up whether they can allow the shavers to be placed on an induction stand or not.</li>
            <li> Amazon offers this razor at the lowest price I could find.  </li>
            <li> My 10 year old Braun went belly up</li>
            <li> and I like it so much that I am actually writing a review.  </li>
            <li> I have written to the seller and to amazon to see if someone will help my 85 year old dad.</li>
            <li> This is a $100.00 product and I purchased it for the glorified comments (except the last one which I suspect is the real truth.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used this razor in the hardest way.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s adjustable blade to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This blows my old Norelco out of the water.  </li>
            <li> say I have sensitive skin, but have been wondering about the electric razors for some time now.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave quite as close as my old Panasonic Model ES762 but is faster and easier on my face.</li>
            <li> This shaver is pricey and is quiet, gentle, and ergonomic.  </li>
            <li> out of all thousands of reviews I read for various shavers.. Braun Syncro model came very close..</li>
            <li> cord directly into the shaver in order to recharge it.</li>
            <li> so i dub my old one, the traveler.  </li>
            <li> It also got very noisy over the course of a year and finally started breaking on me.</li>
            <li> It does leave tiny bits of hair on my shoulder, so I have to shower, but it makes cleaning it off that much easier since it&#x27;s a wet/dry shaver.  </li>
            <li> so much so that I now use this regularly and have retired my 10-year-old Braun.  </li>
            <li> Has a harder time than the Norelco on harder to reach spots like just under nostrils, and the top of my jawline.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have thick hair, even if I shave twise a week that&#x27;s ok for the amount of hair growth on my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an Ok shaver (if your beard is not as thick as mine).</li>
            <li> design is also excellent: Ergonomic power plug, charging base that keeps the razor upright at all times.</li>
            <li> It made quite a mess as I&#x27;d have to surround the bathroom and sink area with newspapers to keep it clean.</li>
            <li> 30% angle of the cutting head is also a real positive improvement, getting the correct position for a fast, close shave is easy.</li>
            <li> it is simple as you can run the whole head in a stream of water with a little liquid soap - saves having to buy special solutions like in the Braun shaver cleaner.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Cons : docking station is too small, easy to be flipped over.</li>
            <li> Focking station is too small, easy to be flipped over.</li>
            <li> and it is the first ever to do a half decent job under my chin along my neck.</li>
            <li> all parts was filled in a small amazon box.</li>
            <li> When it goes on sale, its actually cheaper than buying a new set of blade and schreen.</li>
            <li> Further, I contacted Amazon customer service and was assured that the product was new.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Norelco rotaries, including one of the new models which dispense gel, and a Braun foil shaver prior to this one.</li>
            <li> Some were  so bad I have a mental block on their company name, but this one works flawlessly.</li>
            <li> The  dry shave is very close</li>
            <li> Norelco has a much closer dry shave than the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s spent more than a few days inside of the pouch that comes with it.</li>
            <li> It is excellent and useful for hard shave, I mean my beard is very hard and I tried with almost all the types of razors.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I have tried all the major brands and Panasonic still delivers the closest shave for me.  </li>
            <li> Works so much better than my old electric rotary one, and is nearly as close as shaving with a razor without all the hassle (I don&#x27;t use this as a wet shaver, or at least haven&#x27;t yet).  </li>
            <li> A couple years ago I tried a Norelco, and while the concept seems cool (each hair theoretically gets pulled up a little before being snipped)</li>
            <li> : The Norelcos have never done a great job on my neck, but it was evenly bad.</li>
            <li> I came back to the old style of shaving with the manual razor.</li>
            <li> My skin is too sensitive for a blade, so I&#x27;d been using various models of Norelco shavers for over 20 years.</li>
            <li> Shaves closer than my 8 year old Remington which recently died.  </li>
            <li> The only thing lacking on this model that my old Panasonic shaver had was a wall mount charger/holder.</li>
            <li> This could be a BIG problem early in the morning...</li>
            <li> but it was nowhere near as close as my last Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every brand of shaver, but Panasonic certaily discovered the secret to an outstanding shave.</li>
            <li> Any minor bumps will get shaved away in the process in the beginning, causing minor discomfort, but once you have used the shaver for a few days, you&#x27;ll be glad you took the time to get used to it.  </li>
            <li> I looked at other Panasonic shavers and this one has the same specs of higher priced models (RPM, foil head design, etc.).</li>
            <li> I just received this shaver in a small yellow box, not in the original panasonic box.</li>
            <li> I used many electric razors in the past but the Panasonic beats every other razors I&#x27;ve ever used including Norelco and Braun.  </li>
            <li> While he likes the pivot action on this more expensive model, he says the old one actually provided a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> The only real drawback is that it tends to pull a bit in the dry mode if you go several days between shaves.  </li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t have any trouble with my previous Remington rotary shaver), I would have to go over the area many times and at different angles.  </li>
            <li> At first I was a little hesitant about ordering stuff from the site</li>
            <li> For wet shaving highly rated.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not at all disappointed with its performance, its rather great.</li>
            <li> Second, hard to clean.</li>
            <li> I have had a lot of trouble with this shaver after the first couple of months of use.  </li>
            <li> have thick and tough stubbles that cheap shavers could not tackle well, but the sharp blades combined with high RPM motor of this shaver mowed them away smoothly.  </li>
            <li> main problem is due to my face and how it&#x27;s shaped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As I don&#x27;t live in US, I tried to buy them over the internet but nobody sells them, as you have to send the product to a service center to have the batteries replaced.</li>
            <li> I went back to a Braun (the self-cleaning set up), but it really didn&#x27;t do any better of a job than any of the other shavers I&#x27;d had and was expensive to buy that cleaning fluid.  </li>
            <li> Ofcourse, there&#x27;s no match to a conventional razor, but still its decent.</li>
            <li> It would take a little longer than a manual but wouldn&#x27;t scratch as much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s now time for me to find a new electric razor because the blades are no longer as sharp.</li>
            <li> : If I&#x27;m not careful, trying to get whiskers left behind after the first couple passes at the edge of my lip, this razor will suck the edge of my upper lip between the two inner blades and slice up the skin in a way that stings like a paper cut.</li>
            <li> The only feature, which I am missing is the induction recharge connection, but for the price I can live without it.</li>
            <li> The combination of blades takes care of the short and long hairs.  </li>
            <li> It was marked down quite a bit at the time as a clearance item.</li>
            <li> I have only used it dry</li>
            <li> Typically, I have to go over my neck with my old manual razor.</li>
            <li> I sent it back to the service center and they replaced the body and sent it back to me with a ruined foil.</li>
            <li> Despite the high RPM, it&#x27;s the quietest electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned, with very little vibration.  </li>
            <li> I also like the fact that it&#x27;s easy to clean with soap and water instead of a gimmicky auto-cleaning base (i.e. Braun).  </li>
            <li> If you only shave once or twice a week, use the wet mode.</li>
            <li> ; Electrics have come a long way.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t shave on the weekend, you spend all week getting caught up with all the stray long hairs.</li>
            <li> When used wet this shaver actually does shave as close as a blade.  </li>
            <li> if I let the hair get too long for the shaver to handle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is make of a low-quality piece of plastic that look like &lt;br /&gt;it will melt or break in long term because the connectors are</li>
            <li> /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Braun has lost its market base by making shavers that can only be cleaned at the very top.  </li>
            <li> Third, the battery doesn&#x27;t hold long enough, espically after 1 and half year use.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s wet and dry, just pop open the shave head and rinse away the debris in two seconds.  </li>
            <li> think the bottom line is that an electric isn&#x27;t going to give as close a shave as a plain old blade, and any brand I try is going to leave some stray whiskers, but I can compare this razor to Norelcos, and maybe that will help someone:</li>
            <li> Shaves are extremely close and satisfactory for daily shaving.  </li>
            <li> is that, if you use the shaver for \\&quot;wet\\&quot; shaving (i.e., in the shower or at the sink with shaving cream) and rinse it out, then the foil head should not be re-attached until the unit is completely dry (as per Panasonic&#x27;s instructions).</li>
            <li> Dry with no beard preparation at all (not even a wash).</li>
            <li> Also, it seems you get a closer shave when dry.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like dry</li>
            <li> , whats the point of even bothering with a dry shave anymore...</li>
            <li> downside is that my cheapo 3X circular blade electric shaver does the job quicker when dry...</li>
            <li> For dry Braun then Norelco &amp; Panasonic (close tie).  </li>
            <li> The slide-up trimmer is harder to aim properly than the Norelco trimmer that pops out perpendicularly - it&#x27;s just harder to see what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li> but I started to notice after a few days that it had a peculiar smell, which I can only describe as similar to the way feet smell after sweating a lot in the summer.</li>
            <li> Admittedly I have a heavy coarse beard and others may not have the same concerns.</li>
            <li> This product is not new but reconditioned.  </li>
            <li> I dread going back to conventional blade shavers.</li>
            <li> Very little razor burn compared to the old panasonic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finished shaving, meaning I don&#x27;t find it too heavy to handle, and it&#x27;s not as loud as other electric shavers.</li>
            <li> Because of the speed and efficiency of this electric shaver, it takes me one half to one third the time it used to with a razor!    </li>
            <li> After five portable shavers in less than five years I finally found one that works as described.</li>
            <li> I usually get it to last me the entire week before having to recharge it.  </li>
            <li> this panasonic has that same problem i ve had with previous electric shavers.</li>
            <li> I chose this for Wet and Dry option.. &lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Since I had been using clippers regularly for so long, it took my head no time to adjust (except for some parts of my head by the neck, and my face took a few weeks to get used to the shaver.  </li>
            <li> It took me about 3 weeks to start to get used to the razor and it makes a big difference in terms of mess, time, etc.</li>
            <li> only problem is that my skin is really sensitive and i tend to get small irratations on my face after a few days of using it.  </li>
            <li> This is not a true AC/RC shaver as you can not use it while it is plugged in, but if it does run out of battery, it can be charged for a few minutes and you can complete your shave.   </li>
            <li> I usually shave five in the morning and by early afternoon using other electric razors</li>
            <li> There is a little technical error there</li>
            <li> usually use it daily, after my workout in the gym - and use the conventional for extra close shave, when its required.</li>
            <li> I tried the shaver wet.</li>
            <li> Heavy and big.</li>
            <li> I EXPECTED A LONGER LIFE FROM A PANASONIC.  </li>
            <li> For my surprise, I&#x27;d have to send to a service center in US</li>
            <li> but I have yet to try wet or \\&quot;solution\\&quot; shaving.</li>
            <li> Absolutely NO complaints on Panasonic.</li>
            <li> This shaver has converted me from a lifelong blade user to an electric enthusiast.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic give me a shave that is indistinguishable from that of a blade when used as a wet razor.</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t have to hesitate in getting it wet.</li>
            <li> Shaves as close as a safety razor in the wet mode</li>
            <li> What if, God forbid, you accidentally get the charging section wet?  </li>
            <li> In addition, though this is a Wet and Dry shaver, I only use it wet because the dry is not very good.</li>
            <li> ; can miss that single hair or 2 or area that ruins the rest of the smothness.  </li>
            <li> Whether it was leaving the fine hairs behind or having a hard time dealing with the weekend growth, something was always lacking; this shaver takes it all on!</li>
            <li> Not much is more aggrivating than having stubble on a few spots but clear everywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The new ES8152NC is cheaper than any of the above, because it deletes both the (silly, IMO) LCD of the 8097 &amp; the fancier, induction-based charging system of all the 8090-series shavers.</li>
            <li> bought this few days ago but the battery life is really long and has a close shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Panasonic has been my choice after years of trying all of the other brands including Braun, Norelco and Remington.  </li>
            <li> find several small scratchs on the shaver.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried other makes becoz I like to stay with linear shavers</li>
            <li> No matter what anyone says, I don&#x27;t believe that anything shaves as close as a sharp blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had Norelco, Remington, Braun, and other shavers.</li>
            <li> other reviews have noted, this is not as well suited to longer hairs as a Norelco.  </li>
            <li> was not sure if these shavers could match the closeness of regular blades.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers say it isn&#x27;t, and for the life of me I can&#x27;t figure out why they say that.</li>
            <li> Just try and compare the quality of Panasonic to the other brands.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;the main thing that i find very disturbing is how loud this shaver is.  </li>
            <li> That being said, the shaver falls short in its performance especially with a tough beard.  </li>
            <li> After trying various electric shavers in the $50 range that gave poor shave and skin irratations, I finally gave in and bought this top-of-the-line shaver, which is lives up to the hype.  </li>
            <li> only thing that bothered me is that the shaver and accessories arrived in a small, sealed brown cardboard box rather than in the typical retail packaging.</li>
            <li> My other panasonics had the magnetic induction charger and it was big and bulky and hard to pack when traveling.</li>
            <li> One other plus: unlike all previous razors that buzzed noisily, this one hums and does not disturb anyone else.</li>
            <li> Huge AC adaptor for recharging that will be annoying traveling compared to the simple little cord that comes with a Norelco.</li>
            <li> the only negative is that the base for recharging is a little small and unstable, but other than that, love it !</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that if you don&#x27;t rinse it during use, you get \\&quot;lines\\&quot; of the shaved hair that you just have to wash off of your face.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint hence the 4 star out of 5 rating is there isn&#x27;t a switch lock for traveling pruposes.</li>
            <li> I think the battery should last at least 4 years of reqular use.</li>
            <li> Many years ago I tried an electric shaver, Was crap</li>
            <li> you have to use it everyday and even then you still have a rough touch to the beard.</li>
            <li> It now charges down to 60% and dies.  </li>
            <li> If you wish to keep your beard and hair down to a</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It takes a few days to become accustomed to this shaver due to the closeness of the shave you get.  </li>
            <li> For you fellow head shavers...it takes me about 5 minutes if I shave everyday, about 8-10 every other day, and a bit of a chore if I let three days go by.  </li>
            <li> I  still have to touch up the neck area sometimes, but there is less irritation with this shaver than a razor</li>
            <li> I have shaved with a safety razor for 40 some odd years.  </li>
            <li> I previously had a Bayer Porsche (since bought by Wahl).</li>
            <li> Well, this does half the trick.  </li>
            <li> I have this shaver a year and a half.</li>
            <li> This razor has given me shaves as close as a safety razor with lots less hassle.  </li>
            <li> Even on the face it does a half shave.</li>
            <li> Panasonic&#x27;s cutters and screens are quite expensive and this model is no exception ($37 for a replacement set), especially compared to the overall price of the shaver.</li>
            <li> This linear motor is also quieter than my previous models.  </li>
            <li> Fast forward through 4 Norelco shavers and the last one I had ($40 cordless model) had lousy battery life, poor blade torque and didn&#x27;t get close.</li>
            <li> For a $100 shaver this is just not good enough; I will not buy another Panasonic.</li>
            <li> This leaves the delicate foils and blades exposed while they dry, so care is required here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for a little over a month</li>
            <li> Read the manual to figure out what that little switch on the side does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had this shaver for a little under 18 months</li>
            <li> Then, I put a little bit of liquid hand soap on it and put it in the ultrasonic mode under running water, and the blades get cleaned thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of little scrapes all over my face.</li>
            <li> only issues I had with it were that it was very hard to shave my neck</li>
            <li> The pop-up trimmer is basically worthless and when opened and used will shower you with fine beard clippings.  </li>
            <li> Especially if you have tough stubble under your chin and on your throat area.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the USP crushed the shipping package so Amazon sent out a replacment next day air!  </li>
            <li> I threw my money to the waste can.</li>
            <li> I DON&#x27;T WANT TO GO TO THE TROUBLE OF GETTING IT REPAIRED.  </li>
            <li> The speed of the blades never decreases till the battery is dead.   </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had problems shaving even with a blade in the neck region - took me a few months with a blade to get it</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;d say that I learned a few things with this razor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> rechargeable shavers I&#x27;ve owned got replaced because the battery got weaker after s few years and didn&#x27;t have the power for a heavy beard.</li>
            <li> Also, in order to maintain the peak performance, you must replace the foil and blade every few months, which are not cheap either.  </li>
            <li> the downside, the charging base is made of flimsy plastic that looks ready to crack any second.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned to be very careful in this area, but it still got me today when I was a bit sleepy and not thinking hard about it.</li>
            <li> That is, instead of just setting the bottom of the shaver on its charging base, you have to actually plug in a normal elec.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that the shaver is not very good at trimming at areas where there is less support.</li>
            <li> My only real complaint is that the shaving stand that hold the razor for charging is rather flimsy.</li>
            <li> I guess the blades get dull after a few months.</li>
            <li> I jumped into the shower, applied a small amount of my wife&#x27;s body soap to my face and in minutes had the closest, smoothest shave I&#x27;d had in over 20 years.</li>
            <li> i m not sure if its just me, but it seems like i m sticking a lawn mower into my ear</li>
            <li> I used to get initially horrible irritation, but after forcing myself to use it for more than 3 weeks (shave thrice a week at max)</li>
            <li> For eg the area under the lower jaw under the molars usually does not get a close shave as compared to the cheeks below the side burns.</li>
            <li> not sure what the hi-speed feature is for.</li>
            <li> I have used Panasonic shavers in the past and I am now a fan of all Panasonic products.  </li>
            <li> The charger is hard wired with a small plug, not the fancy induction.  </li>
            <li> it takes at least a week to ship even though Amazon states \\&quot;usually ships in 24 hours\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m maybe going about the dry shave all wrong...</li>
            <li> I usually shave once a week since I feel the razor burn if I do it when the stubs are very small.</li>
            <li> At least a week or two.</li>
            <li> nit pick would be that the base is stuck to the shaver while docked, so a quick single handed pickup is impossible.</li>
            <li> not only time consuming to shave using this shaver but also irritating!!</li>
            <li> If anybody is seriously thinking about buying this razor, contact me</li>
            <li> Changed from a Norelco Reflex whose blades were getting dull and whose battery was tired-  &lt;</li>
            <li> My old model can be placed fully in water and charged on its induction base.  </li>
            <li> (I just hated cleaning the Norelco rotary heads with the two tiny brushes, with the little flimsy parts invariably popping out of place in the process.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After placing the shaver on the little charger base, it does take two hands to remove it from there, but I don&#x27;t have a problem with that like other reviewers do.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could rate their customer service in a negative rating as it is a joke!</li>
            <li> have a tough beard</li>
            <li> Always either wash your face or have a wet rag nearby to avoid having a dry face- that makes shaving terrible even with this razor.  </li>
            <li> So what&#x27;s not great?  </li>
            <li> But after using it a couple of months the battery power seems to be poor again.</li>
            <li> When you deal with elderly people they can get confused as to when it fell apart, but it sounds like it has been awhile.</li>
            <li> For me, happily not so. &lt;</li>
            <li> and I think it must be due to a bad translation.</li>
            <li> You might find it a little annoying when you try to shave the neck area because in my case i need to make 2-3 passes till all hair leaves.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic shaves just as close or closer than the expensive one, and is quieter.  </li>
            <li> SORRY FOR YELLING,</li>
            <li> In addition, Norelco changes their head design so that replacement rotary blades are difficult to find.</li>
            <li> I had nothing to lose -- I was already getting lousy results from the Norelco.</li>
            <li> Done this on purpose  as a worst case test not only to see if it could produce but also to see the effect on my skin.</li>
            <li> and I have had some expensive electric razors.</li>
            <li> the replacement screen and blades are expensive</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s sometimes difficult to see through the shaving cream),</li>
            <li> , I must say that Panasonic does a lousy job of explaining whether the shavers are FULLY washable or not.  </li>
            <li> but its realy annoying to find that still you are not done with shaving moving around the shaver below your chin for a while(at least 4-5 min)..</li>
            <li> thats realy irritating and unfortunate!!</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Charging base is an unnecessary component.</li>
            <li> The poor design of the base also forces you to use two hands when separating the shaver from the charger.  </li>
            <li> It removes hair from some areas and not from some :(.</li>
            <li> and you had to use your mach-3 to do the finishing job :(</li>
            <li> Crazy!  </li>
            <li> I hate it.</li>
            <li> Base is a bit flimsy.</li>
            <li> I like the charging base and the fact that I can remove the cord from it.</li>
            <li> very disappointed, and will return.</li>
            <li> I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE ES8152NC PANASONIC SHAVER.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed this item took a week to ship</li>
            <li> I was so wrong!!!</li>
            <li> It has been the worst shaver I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li> am a worst case scenario for an electric razor.</li>
            <li> have used Norelco and Remington before and they are worthless!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have owned this shaver for about 6 months and have had no problems with it.This shaver appears to be the same one that \\&quot;THE SHARPER IMAGE\\&quot; company is selling for $199.95. IF I shave everyday or wait a couple of days this razor still shaves great. I tried the Remington Titanium MS3 which shaved close also. The Panasonic shaver is about 60% quieter,easier on my face,and shaves my neck area better. I still miss some stubble on my neck area but I had this problem with the mach 3 razor also. I tried the shaver wet. It works much better than dry or if you use some kind of pre-shave. When I am in the shower I just put on some shaving cream and when I am fininshed I just rinse the shaver out. The wet shave is much better than the dry shave. I  still have to touch up the neck area sometimes, but there is less irritation with this shaver than a razor</li>
            <li> this razor is better than the product at 2-3x the price.  while panasonic makes terrible cordless phones, they make good elect razors</li>
            <li> This is a real nice shaver, I enjoyed it very much though it&#x27;s a little big and heavy. It shaves very close to skin, done its job seamlessly. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Amazon offers this razor at the lowest price I could find.  Some places were $30 or more higher.  The other reviews speak for themselves, it is a great razor.</li>
            <li> It has been the worst shaver I&#x27;ve ever bought. I came back to the old style of shaving with the manual razor. I threw my money to the waste can. Heavy and big. If I want to travel with it I have to carry a special bag only for the shaver. I hate it.</li>
            <li> This product is far better than the one I have previously.  It improved alot compare to the one I have.</li>
            <li> I have been a Braun user for over 10 years using all of their various electric shavers.  I have found the Panasonic ES8152NC to be the best yet and less expensive.  I have only used it dry - the results have been very good.  Not as close as a safety razor, but very good.  The combination of blades takes care of the short and long hairs.  I find it does a very good job on the neck region, always a problem spot.  You do need (like any electric) to go over the face areas several times to get the closest shave.  It is comfortable to hold and very quiet for an electric.  The side trimmer is not the greatest but works.  I get around six shaves befor recharging is needed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cleaning it is simple as you can run the whole head in a stream of water with a little liquid soap - saves having to buy special solutions like in the Braun shaver cleaner.  Really ideal. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this shaver.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As a side note, the price at Amazon was the lowest and I ordered it on a Sunday night and got it three days later using their free shipping!  Unfortunately the USP crushed the shipping package so Amazon sent out a replacment next day air!  Great service. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> This is a nice shaver. The price is right. I have only used it as a dry shaver, but it is also good for wet shaving.</li>
            <li> The razor works OK. I&#x27;ve always shaved with a safety razor and I&#x27;ve never found an electric razor that shaves as close or as quickly. The Panasonic is no exception. It does fit and move to the contour of my face well. After using it for about 4 months, a piece of plastic that holds the shaver head broke. I sent it to the Panasonic repair facility in San Francisco. After a month, I received a letter from them that the part needed was not in their inventory and that they had to order it from Japan. I expect better from a company like Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these shavers for about six years, and they&#x27;re great. This is my third model. They&#x27;re especially good for fast growing, thick beards like mine, because you can use them with shaving cream in the shower. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only thing that bothered me is that the shaver and accessories arrived in a small, sealed brown cardboard box rather than in the typical retail packaging. All of the parts were enclosed and everything looked brand new, but it still made me wonder. Did anyone else have the same experience?</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver at a great price. My 10 year old Braun went belly up and I looked at a number of shavers. This one, which allows you to shave in the shower and to clean the head with liquid soap and water, turns out to be much superior to my old Braun in shaving ability and ease of cleaning. For the money you can&#x27;t beat this shaver. It is sturdy, holds a charge, and give a quick, clean shave.</li>
            <li> bought this few days ago but the battery life is really long and has a close shave. i recommend this prodcut</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES8152NC Shaver is one of the best electric shavers I&#x27;ve owned, and I&#x27;ve had quite a few from really cheap to really expensive (the Sharper Image Panasonic at over $400).    This Panasonic shaves just as close or closer than the expensive one, and is quieter.  The foil is thinner curved and this allows you to shave in curves much easier, like under chin or under nose.  Battery life is excellent and easily monitored with the 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 percent LED.    So what&#x27;s not great?  The charger is hard wired with a small plug, not the fancy induction.  It comes with a stand but you need two hands to take the shaver off of it.  Big deal.  You don&#x27;t want to keep charging it everytime anyway.  Nicad rechargable batteries last longer if you first fully charge and then drain them all the way.    Quality of shave is excellent, being as close as Gillette Mach 3 Turbo razors.  It&#x27;s actually better than the razor in getting a hard to reach area on the side of my neck.      Another huge advantage is time savings.  Because of the speed and efficiency of this electric shaver, it takes me one half to one third the time it used to with a razor!    Plus it looks cool.  Did I mention that I like this razor?  Yes, I would definitely recommend it.      EDIT ON FEB 4, 2006:  RAZOR DIED ONLY AFTER 6 MONTHS.  I EXPECTED A LONGER LIFE FROM A PANASONIC.  I DON&#x27;T WANT TO GO TO THE TROUBLE OF GETTING IT REPAIRED.  BOO HISS.  I&#x27;D LIKE TO CHANGE MY RATING TO ONE OR TWO STARS, BUT I CAN&#x27;T.  SORRY FOR YELLING, THANKS FOR LETTING ME VENT.  PEACE.</li>
            <li> Prior to this purchase I had owned a Panasonic wet/dry for over 7 years.  In that time I never changed the blades or the foil nor did I have any problems with the shaver.  It was an excellent product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When I saw the price for the ES8152NC I couldn&#x27;t pass it up.  This version is much lighter and charges faster than my older one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Panasonic has been my choice after years of trying all of the other brands including Braun, Norelco and Remington.  It&#x27;s not even close when comparing the shavers.  Panasonic is the only one that delivers a close and comfortable shave. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be a customer for life.</li>
            <li> My skin is too sensitive for a blade, so I&#x27;d been using various models of Norelco shavers for over 20 years. I started using a Norelco when a friend gave one to me as a gift. I was happy, but didn&#x27;t try anything else. Fast forward through 4 Norelco shavers and the last one I had ($40 cordless model) had lousy battery life, poor blade torque and didn&#x27;t get close. In addition, Norelco changes their head design so that replacement rotary blades are difficult to find. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At the recommendation of a friend, I tried this Panasonic ES8152NC. I had nothing to lose -- I was already getting lousy results from the Norelco. I jumped into the shower, applied a small amount of my wife&#x27;s body soap to my face and in minutes had the closest, smoothest shave I&#x27;d had in over 20 years. It&#x27;d been a long time since my cheeks felt that smooth. Added bonus: cleaning is easy and complete while in the shower. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only drawback I can think of is that, if you use the shaver for \\&quot;wet\\&quot; shaving (i.e., in the shower or at the sink with shaving cream) and rinse it out, then the foil head should not be re-attached until the unit is completely dry (as per Panasonic&#x27;s instructions). This leaves the delicate foils and blades exposed while they dry, so care is required here. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this model. I looked at other Panasonic shavers and this one has the same specs of higher priced models (RPM, foil head design, etc.).</li>
            <li> Have been using a Braun 7526 and before that a high end Norelco.  Right out of the box the ES8152NC has given me a close shave.  It&#x27;s quiet, well-built and versatile.  The ability to use it in the shower or with shaving cream is great.  I also like the fact that it&#x27;s easy to clean with soap and water instead of a gimmicky auto-cleaning base (i.e. Braun).  So far, I love using it.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  Shaves very close with no razor &#x27;burn&#x27;.  Charges quickly and cleans easily - I foresee years of use out of this razor.</li>
            <li> In the short time I have had this razor, it appears to be an excellent product.  The charging stand works fine and the razor keeps fully charged.  I use it with shaving soap and really enjoy the burn and irritation free shave.  I can recommend this shaver without reservation. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I had an older panasonic shaver for over 5 years and needed a new one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This shaver has been the best. Very little razor burn compared to the old panasonic. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have a tough beard but this shaver has no problem with it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give a close shave atall. It removes hair from some areas and not from some :(. Seems as you have trimmed and not shaved. Battery is good and so is the trimmer. &lt;br /&gt;After using the same, I think conventional shaving is the best way for a man to go.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Panasonic shaver about 1 month ago and have been very happy with it. I have used Panasonic shavers for about the last 10-15 years and have always gotten a great shave with them. Over the years, I have tried all the major brands and Panasonic still delivers the closest shave for me.  I have a heavy beard and very sensitive skin, so many shavers I have tried either won&#x27;t shave close, or make my skin look like I shaved with a brick (scraped &amp; bleeding).This shaver has treated my skin the best of any shaver I have ever used, and the closeness is among the best. This is my second Linear shaver and that feature is fantastic. The speed of the blades never decreases till the battery is dead.   This is not a true AC/RC shaver as you can not use it while it is plugged in, but if it does run out of battery, it can be charged for a few minutes and you can complete your shave.   Just as a word of warning about OTHER induction charge shavers, I had a Panasonic induction charge and it never seemed to have as much battery power as a true plug in shaver. This one has a true plug in charge and works great.    Update on this shaver as of June 2006.  I have had a lot of trouble with this shaver after the first couple of months of use.  The battery system would not seem to hold a charge. At first I could get about 4 shaves off of 1 charge but after about 6 months, I could not even get 2 shaves off 1 charge. Also, after removing the head for cleaning and replacing it on the shaver, the blades would not engage. I would have to remove it about 3-4 times before it would work again.  I sent it back to the service center and they replaced the body and sent it back to me with a ruined foil. I called Panasonic and they sent me a new foil. But after using it a couple of months the battery power seems to be poor again. Not too happy with this model at this time.</li>
            <li> close, comfortable and clean shave.  I always look for the wet/dry shavers and Panasonic is tops.</li>
            <li> i bought this shaver as a gift to my father, but it comes without its own package at all. all parts was filled in a small amazon box. can not believe it. find several small scratchs on the shaver. look like a refurbished one. very disappointed, and will return. probably the shaver is good, but it is definetly not good for gift.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every brand of shaver, but Panasonic certaily discovered the secret to an outstanding shave. Very close, and still   gentle to the skin.</li>
            <li> I bought what I thought it was the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had, until just 7 months after the purchase, the batteries didn&#x27;t charge anymore. As I don&#x27;t live in US, I tried to buy them over the internet but nobody sells them, as you have to send the product to a service center to have the batteries replaced. For my surprise, I&#x27;d have to send to a service center in US (just 2 in the whole country) as no service center in my country was able to change this so \\&quot;special\\&quot; batteries.  I&#x27;ll sent my new shaver to a \\&quot;razor junkyard\\&quot;...</li>
            <li> i have used it for more than five years.   it is good.   but now the battery is not so good now.   I like it and recommend it strongly.</li>
            <li> Repalced older Panasonic shaver with this one - what a difference and really smooth shave.  The ultrasonic cleaning feature is great too!</li>
            <li> It is excellent and useful for hard shave, I mean my beard is very hard and I tried with almost all the types of razors. I use to upgrade my razor according to Gillette&#x27;s new products. But finally I could find a solution for my good shave after buying this product.</li>
            <li> i had all this years Norelco product, but i wanted to change the comapny to see how they make any difference. Looking at this product using for about a month or so, I am not so thrilled about what is said , only thing this shaver does not allow you to shave if your batteries are dead and you have plugged in the wall to use it,I had no problem with Norelco products while plugged in the outlet and it will let you shave, you have to be sure that there is charge to shave, Also I noticed that the battery does not last 5 days for regular shaving time which is listed as 3 to 5 min, so the charge on this battery is not enough for what it is said in the manual.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a wet/dry shaver and I like it so much that I am actually writing a review.  With just a little shaving cream, you&#x27;re off to a smooth, close shave.  It&#x27;s not as close as a shave with a straight razor but it shaves closer than the Braun it replaced.  Cleaning is fast and easy and leaves the razor odor-free.  I&#x27;ve had this razor for a little over a month and I still don&#x27;t dread shaving in the morning.  The price made it all the more worth it.</li>
            <li> The functions on this shaver make shaving an easier process.  With a smooth finish and a clean cut, I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> I bought this about a month ago, figuring I&#x27;d try something new after a couple of Norelcos. I&#x27;m the kind of person who prefers the poorer shave of an electric razor to the cuts I get with a blade. In fact, I&#x27;m the sort who can cut himself with an electric razor when sleepy and forceful. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I think the bottom line is that an electric isn&#x27;t going to give as close a shave as a plain old blade, and any brand I try is going to leave some stray whiskers, but I can compare this razor to Norelcos, and maybe that will help someone: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pros: Hugely easier to clean than the Norelco. Does much better on the smooth expanse of my cheeks. The slide-up trimmer does a much better job on sideburns. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cons: Still dribbles whiskers after cleaning. Has a harder time than the Norelco on harder to reach spots like just under nostrils, and the top of my jawline. The slide-up trimmer is harder to aim properly than the Norelco trimmer that pops out perpendicularly - it&#x27;s just harder to see what you&#x27;re doing. Huge AC adaptor for recharging that will be annoying traveling compared to the simple little cord that comes with a Norelco. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Neither pro nor con: The Norelcos have never done a great job on my neck, but it was evenly bad. This razor does better on most of my neck but even if I go back and forth at every conceivable angle, there are 2 large spots it loves to miss. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Possibly personal con: If I&#x27;m not careful, trying to get whiskers left behind after the first couple passes at the edge of my lip, this razor will suck the edge of my upper lip between the two inner blades and slice up the skin in a way that stings like a paper cut. I&#x27;ve learned to be very careful in this area, but it still got me today when I was a bit sleepy and not thinking hard about it. I haven&#x27;t actually bled from this since the first week, though. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, a decent value, but if you haven&#x27;t got a great shave with other electrics, don&#x27;t go by reviews about how amazing this is. It&#x27;s just another electric razor, and at a decent price.</li>
            <li> I am an addicted/reliable panasonic user. I haven&#x27;t tried other makes becoz I like to stay with linear shavers and I liked panasonic after I used the first one. So my views may be biased. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pros: &lt;br /&gt;Smooth shave &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cons: &lt;br /&gt;Charging base is an unnecessary component. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As for as the charging base concerned, one of the previous panasonic shavers ES7006 featured an excellent wall mountable design which I liked but the similar designs are not in the market now.</li>
            <li> I find the ability clean the shaver by rinsing it under the tap a big plus and it shaves and recharges fast!</li>
            <li> I have written to the seller and to amazon to see if someone will help my 85 year old dad. This had a 90 day warrantly. I ordered it on Dec. 15, 2005. it was delievered around the 19 or 20, which means we are talking DAYS only of expiration. When you deal with elderly people they can get confused as to when it fell apart, but it sounds like it has been awhile. At least a week or two. This is a $100.00 product and I purchased it for the glorified comments (except the last one which I suspect is the real truth. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;DO NOT buy this object until you find out how responsive they are to me. I will keep you advised.  I expect a return of a new razor or I can send it and have it repaired. I will be fair. I expect the seller to be as well.</li>
            <li> Does not do the job! Pretty much that should say it all!</li>
            <li> How do people get to use their shavers for years. Gadgetster, for example above, has used his Braun for 10 years. I never get my Braun&#x27;s (and that&#x27;s the only one I use) to work for more than 1-2 yrs. The battery dies. And it&#x27;s cheaper to buy a new one than to replace the battery.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I like the wet/dry feature. I will probably try this one.</li>
            <li> I have shaved with a safety razor for 40 some odd years.  I have never been a proponent of electric razors.  I am now a believer.  The Panasonic Pro Curve is just amazing.  My wife loves it because after shaving with it I don&#x27;t scrape her face.  If you are a first time user just be patient.  It takes about a week or so for you and your face to get used to the razor.  Cleaning the instrument is a breeze compared to anything else.  All I can say is that I liked it so much I bought two more.</li>
            <li> A give it a try shot attitude has been pleasantly rewarded. I waited for a good deal and good reviews to try a linear shaver and am very happy with this Panasonic.  &lt;br /&gt;   Been using disposable blades for years after writing off electric shavers. I had tried a couple 3 blade rotary heads and they never gave me a close shave. The harder I tried the more they tore up my face. Often thought that the geometry of a linear shaver would put more blade front in contact with a beard at any one time for a better shave. However I feared electric is electric and it would irritate also. For me, happily not so. &lt;br /&gt;   So far I&#x27;ve used this razor in the hardest way. Dry with no beard preparation at all (not even a wash). Done this on purpose  as a worst case test not only to see if it could produce but also to see the effect on my skin. It&#x27;s given me good shaves and surprised me with no irritation. Love the gimbal action.</li>
            <li> After five portable shavers in less than five years I finally found one that works as described. The  dry shave is very close but I have yet to try wet or \\&quot;solution\\&quot; shaving. The sonic clean setting seems like a gimic but may be intended for cleaning oily electric shave products, but I have found just rinsing under faucet works fine. Has one of best trimmers I have used. Directions say it will give up to 14 three minute shaves but I have found 4-5 is more typical but the one hour charge negates this issue. One other plus: unlike all previous razors that buzzed noisily, this one hums and does not disturb anyone else. Definitely worth checking it out!</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for a number or reasons (1)not made in China, (2)rechargeable nimhd batteries (NOT NICAD), and (3) the reputation of Panasonic. &lt;br /&gt;I was not disappointed. I didn&#x27;t buy the shaver for wet shaving as I have always had good luck with dry shaving. I previously had a Bayer Porsche (since bought by Wahl). Had to canibalize a newer Wahl to get the NICAD batteries to extend the Porsche service to 15 years. But when their charge lasted only 3-4 days, I knew it was time to change. Absolutely NO complaints on Panasonic. I have only had it 5 weeks, though.</li>
            <li> The shaver is excellent.  My husband had to try it.  Now, I&#x27;m back to square one, because he loved it so much, I hand to let him keep it.</li>
            <li> been using item for a week now and very very happy with it. shaving wet or dry it does an amazing job.  great weighted item and very comfortable to hold.  would highly recommend item again. the only negative is that the base for recharging is a little small and unstable, but other than that, love it !</li>
            <li> I was never able to successfully shave with a standard razor, so I always have used an electronic Norelco. I was satisfied with it for a long time, especially with it&#x27;s adjustable blade to my sensitive skin. However, when I did try shaving with the razor, it was in the shower and I liked it more because I didn&#x27;t have to wait for my face to be perfectly dry. That is when I knew I wanted to combine the two. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic is an excellent wet shaver. The wet shave comes out better than the dry shave from Norelco, although still not as good as I was expecting (I guess that is only capable with the the razor). In addition, though this is a Wet and Dry shaver, I only use it wet because the dry is not very good. Norelco has a much closer dry shave than the Panasonic. So if you are looking for a great electronic wet shaver, the Panasonic is the right choice. If you want a good dry shaver, I would still go with the Norelco. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The pivot action on the Panasonic is nice, I guess, I haven&#x27;t really noticed the benefit between it and having it locked. It doesn&#x27;t really seem to change anything. The other thing that pushed me to buy this shaver was the excellent price on Amazon. It was marked down quite a bit at the time as a clearance item.</li>
            <li> I received this shaver from Amazon in July, 2005.  I have used it every day except some weekends and I have yet to change the screen or the blades, perhaps because I apply liquid soap to clean the shaver after every use as recommended. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It takes a few days to become accustomed to this shaver due to the closeness of the shave you get.  Any minor bumps will get shaved away in the process in the beginning, causing minor discomfort, but once you have used the shaver for a few days, you&#x27;ll be glad you took the time to get used to it.  Shaves are extremely close and satisfactory for daily shaving.  Until you&#x27;re used to this shaver, I recommend feeling your face with your hand to recognize areas that weren&#x27;t shaved as close.  I use a fog free mirror and basic shaving foam and love the results I get.  My hand is not tired by the time I&#x27;m finished shaving, meaning I don&#x27;t find it too heavy to handle, and it&#x27;s not as loud as other electric shavers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The duration of the battery will always vary per individual.  I usually get it to last me the entire week before having to recharge it.  After placing the shaver on the little charger base, it does take two hands to remove it from there, but I don&#x27;t have a problem with that like other reviewers do.  The unit is fully charged within an hour.  I highly recommend this shaver to anyone willing to switch from a blade.  I no longer suffer from in-grown hairs while getting an almost \\&quot;close as a blade\\&quot; shave.</li>
            <li> I got this shaver mainly because I wanted to shave in the shower.  It defenitely is a good quality shaver. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only issues I had with it were that it was very hard to shave my neck (I didn&#x27;t have any trouble with my previous Remington rotary shaver), I would have to go over the area many times and at different angles.  Also, it seems you get a closer shave when dry.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband as a replacement for a cheaper ($40) Panasonic wet/dry shaver he used for over a year with no problems.  While he likes the pivot action on this more expensive model, he says the old one actually provided a closer shave.  He has dark, coarse, straight hair on his beard and seems to think this shaver is not as good as the last one for his type of hair.  The best feature for him is the ability to take it into the shower.</li>
            <li> i was very happy with the service and the condition of the shaver,very easy to use and very gentle on my skin, i would recommend it very highly.</li>
            <li> Very fast shave, and very quiet. But compared to my older and cheaper Panasonic, not as close a shave. On balance I prefer the speed.</li>
            <li> I have bought this model for 2 years in a row. When it goes on sale, its actually cheaper than buying a new set of blade and schreen. Shaves great!!!</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver in over 5 years, but this one performs exceptionally well.  I have a thick beard, and after only a couple of weeks, this shaver gives me a nice close shave without much fuss.  The wet-and-dry use is excellent.  My only complaint is that if you don&#x27;t rinse it during use, you get \\&quot;lines\\&quot; of the shaved hair that you just have to wash off of your face.  (Of course, that&#x27;s probably an issue with any shaver.) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this shaver to others.</li>
            <li> This blows my old Norelco out of the water.  Closest, smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever had each morning.  The cleaning function was a sell for me - run under water and turn it on - its that easy.  I highly reccomend this excellent product.</li>
            <li> Well, I cannot say that this razor is perfect, but it sure is significantly better than the $20-$40 electrics I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main problem is due to my face and how it&#x27;s shaped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had problems shaving even with a blade in the neck region - took me a few months with a blade to get it so my neck didnt&#x27; look like I had been strangled in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say I have sensitive skin, but have been wondering about the electric razors for some time now.  Almost bought a Braun last xmas but I&#x27;m too cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;d say that I learned a few things with this razor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Read the manual to figure out what that little switch on the side does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Always either wash your face or have a wet rag nearby to avoid having a dry face- that makes shaving terrible even with this razor.  Lectric Shave is also great stuff but I wish that they had something that did what Lectric Shave did without alcohol.  Don&#x27;t like dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  You&#x27;ll probably have to find the position and direction on your face that works for taking off the hair.  My hair runs several directions in some cases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  Go over the spots you just did and make sure you got it all.  Not much is more aggrivating than having stubble on a few spots but clear everywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  Stick with it!!!!  It took me about 3 weeks to start to get used to the razor and it makes a big difference in terms of mess, time, etc. by using the electric as opposed to the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.  No matter what anyone says, I don&#x27;t believe that anything shaves as close as a sharp blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s it!  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> This is a very good shaver. It doesn&#x27;t shave quite as close as my old Panasonic Model ES762 but is faster and easier on my face. The old one lasted about 9-years; if this one does as well I will have paid about $6/year for good shaves. I call that a good deal.</li>
            <li> Pretty good razor for the price,it seems to work better when using wet with foam and it&#x27;s easy to clean.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Shaves closer than my 8 year old Remington which recently died.  Also get some whiskers which the Remington never could but occasionally misses some.  Battery is quick to charge and the charging indicator is handy, but battery life seems short.  It only goes about 5 days between charges whereas the Remington lasted 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> After using this shaver for about a month now I am happy with it&#x27;s performance. It&#x27;s comfortable to hold &amp; gives a close shave. A full charge lasts over a week with daily use and only takes an hour to fully recharge. The only thing lacking on this model that my old Panasonic shaver had was a wall mount charger/holder.</li>
            <li> i usually dont like using electric shavers because they usually miss spots, no matter how many times you go over them. this panasonic has that same problem i ve had with previous electric shavers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;the main thing that i find very disturbing is how loud this shaver is.  i m not sure if its just me, but it seems like i m sticking a lawn mower into my ear everytime i shave.</li>
            <li> I bought the first generation of this Panasonic shaver many years ago (~10y) in Japan (~$200) and it stil works fine. I had trouble finding fitting blades here in the US so I decided to get a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the previous model it works excellent. The only feature, which I am missing is the induction recharge connection, but for the price I can live without it.</li>
            <li> This was my first electric razor, and let me tell you all that it is WELL WORTH the money. It is the best razor I have ever used. I&#x27;ve used it for over a year now and I haven&#x27;t even replaced the blades yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALL IT REQUIRES IS A QUICK RINSE WITH WATER FOR CLEANING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s now time for me to find a new electric razor because the blades are no longer as sharp. I&#x27;ve ALREADY bought two of the \\&quot;top of the line\\&quot; razors, and I&#x27;ve returned them both; braun and norelco. They don&#x27;t compare to this panasonic razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to try one more razor out there, and if it doesn&#x27;t meet my expectations then I am sticking with this same old Panasonic razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend this product. The battery life is good, charging is easy, battery level indicator is useful, etc etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YOU WILL LOVE IT !</li>
            <li> This shaver is pricey and is quiet, gentle, and ergonomic.  That being said, the shaver falls short in its performance especially with a tough beard.  It is extremely slow (not unlike the rotaries) and despite the time investment with frequent back and forth or eliptical movements, the closeness is greatly lacking.  The pop-up trimmer is basically worthless and when opened and used will shower you with fine beard clippings.  It simply doesn&#x27;t perform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panansonic makes quality electronics and appliances, but unless you plan on buying this for its sleek high tech look, save your money.  Get a quicker closer shave from a Remington.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric razor I&#x27;ve tried in 30 years and I&#x27;m impressed. This shaver has converted me from a lifelong blade user to an electric enthusiast. This Panasonic give me a shave that is indistinguishable from that of a blade when used as a wet razor. The dry mode gives a good shave but not as close as the wet mode. The only real drawback is that it tends to pull a bit in the dry mode if you go several days between shaves.  If you only shave once or twice a week, use the wet mode. I&#x27;d gladly buy this raxor again.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I bought this kind of electric shaver, after having used a rotary all my life. The reviews were pretty positive so I thought I&#x27;d take a chance. It gives a decent shave though not any better than the rotaries but I started to notice after a few days that it had a peculiar smell, which I can only describe as similar to the way feet smell after sweating a lot in the summer. I did a little research online and discovered that bacteria build up in this kind of shaver and you need to clean all of the parts just about every time you use it, with hot water and hand soap. My old rotaries never smelled and never required cleaning more than once every week or two. So my Panasonic is in a constant state of drying out from a cleaning. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s spent more than a few days inside of the pouch that comes with it. I also find that it pulls at the hair more than the rotary as you shave and that it sometimes takes longer, especially in warm weather when the face is more sweaty. I will probably return to the Norelco rotary next time out.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my familes. It is a good shaver comparing to the cheaper models. However, it seems not user friendly. First, it has no manual. Second, hard to clean. Third, the battery doesn&#x27;t hold long enough, espically after 1 and half year use. But hey, it is a shaver not a house. So it is normal that it will wear out someday.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver i ever owned,the replacement blades and screen is expensive,almost half of what i paid for the shaver.Panasonic will sell more of their shavers if the replacement blade and screen are reasonable priced.</li>
            <li> I was amazed how gentle this shaver was. I had owned a Panason ES8003 for quite a while after owning a lifetime of Norelco shavers. The ES8003 offered a very close shave, but was getting on in years. I tried replacing the blades and foil, but it did not help. So I bought the ES8152NC. It gave me the same close shave. But I was amazed at how gentle it was.</li>
            <li> I was basically migrating from Mach-3 to the electronic shaver.. I did spend quite a while researching which would suit the best for a guy like me!! out of all thousands of reviews I read for various shavers.. Braun Syncro model came very close.. I chose this for Wet and Dry option.. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This shaver is realy good in giving as close shave as a new razors only above chin area.. (now you now why it gets 1 star.. otherwise -ve) but its realy annoying to find that still you are not done with shaving moving around the shaver below your chin for a while(at least 4-5 min).. and you had to use your mach-3 to do the finishing job :( thats realy irritating and unfortunate!! Probably I wouldn&#x27;t have had problem  if everyday was Saturday or Sunday for me :)  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I do like the way it shaves but as i said I am not satissfied with it even a bit as the whole purpose of buying this shaver was to replace my mach-3 shavers.. I used to get initially horrible irritation, but after forcing myself to use it for more than 3 weeks (shave thrice a week at max) my skin got used to it!! LOT OF REVIEWS SAY THE SHAVER GETS ADJUSTED TO YOUR SKIN!! AFTER EXPERIENCING, I CAN ONLY READ THOSE REVIEWS AND LAUGH LOUDLY .. IF PANSONIC WERE TO INVENT THAT INTELLIGENT SHAVER.. MAN.. BELIVE ME IT WOULD COST THEM IN BILLIONS.. Dont&#x27; beleive those reviews please.  &lt;br /&gt;I Don&#x27;t have thick hair, even if I shave twise a week that&#x27;s ok for the amount of hair growth on my face. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Its not only time consuming to shave using this shaver but also irritating!! Who cares to spending extra time?? I had bought 2 of them... one for my father. I don&#x27;t know I would I convince him to use it when I myself regretting.</li>
            <li> For once I&#x27;d love an electric razor that would give me a close shave and do it in less time than a non-electric.  Well, this does half the trick.  In some areas of the face, this razor does fine, but in other areas, it performs pitifully.  Especially if you have tough stubble under your chin and on your throat area. I can run this razor over that area of my face and it might not cut anything.  Mach 3 is still by far the best razor for shaving.  This was a big dissapoinment.</li>
            <li> This is probably one of the best shavers that I&#x27;ve owned in recent memory. Very close, smooth shave. Easy cleanup. Seems to be very powerful, with the 13,000 rpm linear motor. My only complaint hence the 4 star out of 5 rating is there isn&#x27;t a switch lock for traveling pruposes. The button may be easily bumped in a shave kit, &amp; unless you bring the re-charging unit you may find a shaver that&#x27;s out of juice...This could be a BIG problem early in the morning...Just remember to bring the re-charger on any trips out of town...</li>
            <li> 6 month ago I bought this shaver, great shaver.  Now that I ordered one for my dad, they sent me a refurbished unit.  How could I tell it&#x27;s a refurb aside from it coming in a cardboard box instead of the original sealed plastic packaging?  It&#x27;s the presence of someone else&#x27;s hair on the shaver!!  N-A-S-T-Y!  I called amazon to replace it, and got another refurb!!  I am sure I&#x27;m not the only one getting shafted by amazon for this product, curious if we should initiate a class action suit against them for misleading consumers!  I wish I could rate their customer service in a negative rating as it is a joke!</li>
            <li> This is the second Panasonic linear shaver I&#x27;ve owned. The ES8086 was the first and it was the best shaver at the time. This model has some improvements that make it even better. It is quieter, a big improvement when trimming sideburns. It&#x27;s lighter, a good tradeoff for the light weight base. &lt;br /&gt;The 30% angle of the cutting head is also a real positive improvement, getting the correct position for a fast, close shave is easy. I turn it over to shave my neck and the shaver is then held in a comfotable hand position. &lt;br /&gt;Most rechargeable shavers I&#x27;ve owned got replaced because the battery got weaker after s few years and didn&#x27;t have the power for a heavy beard. This one has a replaceable battery. I think the battery should last at least 4 years of reqular use. &lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to clean. I recommend this razor to you. It&#x27;e really good for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> To address some of the questions K Martin raised in his review: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1. The only diff. betw. the ES8092NC &amp; 8095NC is the color. Gotta ask yourself: How much is the \\&quot;gold\\&quot; vs. \\&quot;silver\\&quot; worth to you? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2. ES8097A is a model, formerly exclusive to The Sharper Image, which subs the metallic blue color &amp; fancier LCD status window in place of silver/gold &amp; the simple red/green LED indicators, above &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;3. The new ES8152NC is cheaper than any of the above, because it deletes both the (silly, IMO) LCD of the 8097 &amp; the fancier, induction-based charging system of all the 8090-series shavers. That is, instead of just setting the bottom of the shaver on its charging base, you have to actually plug in a normal elec. cord directly into the shaver in order to recharge it. Woo-hoo.</li>
            <li> This is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. Shaves very close. Very Quiet. And super easy to clean because you can just rinse it with water. Also charges fast. And the replacement foil/blade combo is cheap too. Oh and it&#x27;s an awesome deal to boot.</li>
            <li> This thing looks great.  The good news is that it also works great.  It gives me a close shave in a much quicker time than the 2-year old Norelco I was using.  I travel to Europe, so the auto-voltage adjustment is great for me.  I actually look forward to shaving with this thing every morning - I  am sure that will wear off with time, but in the meantime I can easily say this is the best shaver I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> Many years ago I tried an electric shaver, Was crap and I stuck with a blade. Many brands of disposable shavers do a good job. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Out of curiousity I decided to give this one a shot. I was impressed with the technology. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pros; Electrics have come a long way.  I CAN get a close shave with this although it takes a bit of time of smoothing and reshaving. Easy to clean, ergonomic, nice design. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cons; can miss that single hair or 2 or area that ruins the rest of the smothness.  Base is a bit flimsy. Can take a bit of time and patience trying to replicate a blades closeness. Admittedly I have a heavy coarse beard and others may not have the same concerns. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall;  I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an Ok shaver (if your beard is not as thick as mine). You might find it a little annoying when you try to shave the neck area because in my case i need to make 2-3 passes till all hair leaves. When i bought it i thought that it was coming with a trimmer because i don&#x27;t like shaving completely as my skin irritates very easy, so i have to give it to my cousin who had exactly the same problems as mine.</li>
            <li> Easy to handle and easy to clean. Shaves smoother than any electric razor we&#x27;ve tried. Charges quickly and holds its charge well.</li>
            <li> I really love this shaver.  Works so much better than my old electric rotary one, and is nearly as close as shaving with a razor without all the hassle (I don&#x27;t use this as a wet shaver, or at least haven&#x27;t yet).  I would recommend this shaver to just about anyone, and at the $60 price it cannot be beat!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m maybe going about the dry shave all wrong... but when this thing works many times better wet, whats the point of even bothering with a dry shave anymore... slap on your favorite shaving creme/gel and watch the thing work its magic... and if you are concerned about it not shaving close enough, it has even cut me on two occasions, it&#x27;s that close. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The downside is that my cheapo 3X circular blade electric shaver does the job quicker when dry... so i dub my old one, the traveler.  &lt;br /&gt;Another nit pick would be that the base is stuck to the shaver while docked, so a quick single handed pickup is impossible.</li>
            <li> I like the tilt feature. I also like the speed, and the charge display.</li>
            <li> I bought Panasonic ES8152NC foil shaver about 6 monthes ago. &lt;br /&gt;First three months or so I was very happy with the unit. But gradually the shaving quality went down, foil has been loosing its sharpness and battery capacity greatly diminished. I am going to  throw it out, for even if I buy a new foil ($39.95) it would not solve my battery problems.  &lt;br /&gt;Just my opinion. -LR-</li>
            <li> For wet shaving highly rated. For dry Braun then Norelco &amp; Panasonic (close tie).  But do like the wet shaving...gives a nice clean close shave...would recommend..bought mine when under $60.  Watch for deals first before buying.</li>
            <li> I guess the blades get dull after a few months. I loved the super close shaves for a couple of months. Nowadays I have to struggle to get that good results. I was using a Mach 3 turbo before which gave me a pretty good shave. Having said that, I will keep using the Panasonic as it doesn&#x27;t hurt my skin. I dread going back to conventional blade shavers. Maybe replacing the blades of the panasonic every year will do the trick.</li>
            <li> I just received this shaver in a small yellow box, not in the original panasonic box. It must be refurbished one. This is the first time experience that I am unsatisfied with Amazon.</li>
            <li> This product is not new but reconditioned.  The description is misleading.  Further, I contacted Amazon customer service and was assured that the product was new.  It comes in a non-branded cardboard box and is clearly reconditioned.  I do not recommend it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is one of the few examples where I&#x27;ve been deceived by Amazon and where they have not measured up to their own quality standard.</li>
            <li> I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE ES8152NC PANASONIC SHAVER.  NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.  BACK TO MY BRAUN.</li>
            <li> I had this Panasonic shaver for about 9 months when the battery/charging system gave out.  It now charges down to 60% and dies.  At that point it needs to be recharged again.  That&#x27;s all I&#x27;m doing with this thing... CHARGING IT!!! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this shaver.  My next purchase will be a Braun.</li>
            <li> I have this shaver a year and a half. The blades shave quickly and do not pull wiskers. I have had Norelco, Remington, Braun, and other shavers. Some were  so bad I have a mental block on their company name, but this one works flawlessly. Bought a second for my son.</li>
            <li> It isnt perfect, doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a razor, but it is the best I have ever used and I have had some expensive electric razors. It easily out performs my old Norelco quadra. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am a worst case scenario for an electric razor. This is the closest shaving electric I have ever used and it is the first ever to do a half decent job under my chin along my neck.</li>
            <li> I had this shaver for a little under 18 months and it did a reasonable job in that time. I would slide its gently buzzing body over my face for a few minutes in the shower then \\&quot;mop up\\&quot; the stray remaining hairs with a hand razor. It would take a little longer than a manual but wouldn&#x27;t scratch as much. However the reason I can&#x27;t reccommend purchase is it started having charging problems after a little more than a year and soon wouldn&#x27;t work at all. For a $100 shaver this is just not good enough; I will not buy another Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to the convenience of an electric shaver, but find this razor to be anything but convenient. It takes forever to get anything even resembling a close shave, especially on my neck. Typically, I have to go over my neck with my old manual razor. If anybody is seriously thinking about buying this razor, contact me and I&#x27;ll sell you mine for cheap.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed this item took a week to ship - I guess they really want you to sign up for the Amazon prime</li>
            <li> my girlfriend loves when i use this shaver because my face becomes smooth as a baby&#x27;s [...]!  only problem is that my skin is really sensitive and i tend to get small irratations on my face after a few days of using it.  they say to use it for 30 days, since it takes the skin about a month to get used to a new shaving method, but i haven&#x27;t been able to do that yet.  another thing is that although it shaves great, my neck area always seems to have patches of stubble that will just not come off.  that part i have to clean up with a normal razor.  the quality of the product is great, and the shave is nice.  just make sure your skin isn&#x27;t prone to irritation...</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase at Amazon.com.  At first I was a little hesitant about ordering stuff from the site but I&#x27;m very glad that I did.  Every thing went very smoothly and as for the product ... I used many electric razors in the past but the Panasonic beats every other razors I&#x27;ve ever used including Norelco and Braun.  I usually shave five in the morning and by early afternoon using other electric razors I had a five o&#x27;clock shadow on me but with this shaver I no longer have that problem.  It&#x27;s very smooth and very easy to clean.  I even shave my head with it.  Very very nice and the price was unbeatable.  Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Changed from a Norelco Reflex whose blades were getting dull and whose battery was tired-  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Immediately noticed how comfortable the shave was; took a little while to adjust and get a good shave, but definitely happy with the switch. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As other reviews have noted, this is not as well suited to longer hairs as a Norelco.  If you don&#x27;t shave on the weekend, you spend all week getting caught up with all the stray long hairs. BUT its so comfortable and easy to shave with this thing that shaving everyday (or more than once a day) is easy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Buy One!</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  As much as I&#x27;d love to be able to shave with a blade, every time I do it seems to tear up my skin.  So, I&#x27;ve been on a quest for the best electric shaver for years. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Started off with a Remington, and believe it or not that actually did an ok job.  Then I graduated to a Braun and again, a decent job (very noisy though).  A couple years ago I tried a Norelco, and while the concept seems cool (each hair theoretically gets pulled up a little before being snipped) it just didn&#x27;t do that impressive of a job.  Actually, the Norelco would tend to leave big red marks on my skin if I didn&#x27;t get the right angle or on more sensitive areas (lower and back of neck).  I went back to a Braun (the self-cleaning set up), but it really didn&#x27;t do any better of a job than any of the other shavers I&#x27;d had and was expensive to buy that cleaning fluid.  It also got very noisy over the course of a year and finally started breaking on me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then I saw an ad for the Panasonic.  The idea of a wet shave with an electric seemed interesting so I took the plunge.  OH MY (Insert deity)!!!  When used wet this shaver actually does shave as close as a blade.  And, it&#x27;s quiet! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I honestly don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll find a better electric........  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Minor problems:  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- it does get mildly noisy after about a years use &lt;br /&gt;- the replacement screen and blades are expensive (I actually   bought a whole new shaver instead of a new foil because I found the shaver on sale for $60 and replacement foil ($35) and blades ($25) made it a wash. &lt;br /&gt;- the trimmer isn&#x27;t as effective as some shavers I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Panasonic Linear Wet/Dry ES8152 at Amazon.com for about $60.  It works as well as a blade without the nicks, cuts, or razor burns...  I was \\&quot;shaving\\&quot; my head with clippers (no guards) for years, and with clippers, it was an ordeal to do it about every 7-10 days.  It made quite a mess as I&#x27;d have to surround the bathroom and sink area with newspapers to keep it clean. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With the Panasonic shaver, I shake the larger chunks out of the easy to remove head directly into a trash can.  Then, I put a little bit of liquid hand soap on it and put it in the ultrasonic mode under running water, and the blades get cleaned thoroughly.  It does leave tiny bits of hair on my shoulder, so I have to shower, but it makes cleaning it off that much easier since it&#x27;s a wet/dry shaver.  I don&#x27;t use any shaving cream yet make sure to put lotion on my head after I shower, and that&#x27;s been working well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Since I had been using clippers regularly for so long, it took my head no time to adjust (except for some parts of my head by the neck, and my face took a few weeks to get used to the shaver.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The shaver&#x27;s ergonomic shape fits well in my hands, and the vibrations are pretty minimal...especially compared to clippers.  The battery charges very quickly (it says about an hour, and although I&#x27;ve never timed it...it&#x27;s about right). For you fellow head shavers...it takes me about 5 minutes if I shave everyday, about 8-10 every other day, and a bit of a chore if I let three days go by.  If you&#x27;re taking more than 5 minutes a day, you&#x27;re being more anal than ME!  Just remember...a perfect shave will be like sandpaper in half a day. ;) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;~M &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> This razor has given me shaves as close as a safety razor with lots less hassle.  Worth every dime!</li>
            <li> I ordered this item 7 days ago and although Amazon says it shipped, UPS states it recieved only the electronic shipping order.  The Shaver has yet to ship.  So, don&#x27;t expect to recieve this item soon...it takes at least a week to ship even though Amazon states \\&quot;usually ships in 24 hours\\&quot;.  Good Luck!</li>
            <li> I bought this with a lot of skepticism. I have always used the traditional brush foam and shaving blade for my shaving needs. I like a really close shave and always shave against the grains. I usually shave once a week since I feel the razor burn if I do it when the stubs are very small. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was not sure if these shavers could match the closeness of regular blades. I was so wrong!!! This shaver gives me the exact closeness of a regular blade.So there is no question about it. However I have been using this for a week now and I realised that my skin is even more irritated and sore after shaving with this. The reason was that I was having to go over the same areas more than 2 times and I am still getting a hang of it. The documentation along with the shaver pleads with you to try to use it for 30 days. I am planning on trying it for the full 30 days before I make up my mind but I think I am getting better every time I use it.I have also realized that the key is to shave more often with these shavers. &lt;br /&gt;However everytime I apply the after shave my face is literally on fire. I have a lot of little scrapes all over my face. I also noticed that the shaver is not very good at trimming at areas where there is less support. For eg the area under the lower jaw under the molars usually does not get a close shave as compared to the cheeks below the side burns. &lt;br /&gt;I am still figuring out various ways of reducing my effort. All in all an excellent shaver with all the features anybody would need. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> This shaver gives a better shave than the Braun that it replaced.  I use it dry most often and it is better that way (on my face)  than the times I&#x27;ve tried it wet.</li>
            <li> I have used several electric shavers over the years and have found that Panasonic does the best for me. The models with the linear motor are by far the best. It does a great job shaving without creating irritation around my mouth or on my neck - with other electrics and with blades I always break out in both places. After using it for 2 weeks, I have found that I only have to go back and clean up with a razor every once in a while if I let the hair get too long for the shaver to handle. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The razor is very sturdy. Other reviewers say it isn&#x27;t, and for the life of me I can&#x27;t figure out why they say that. This thing is a tank. I also like the 3 settings it has that allow the heads to float or stay locked. I get about 8 shaves between charges, but I take a long time to shave compared to most people. I like the charging base and the fact that I can remove the cord from it. My other panasonics had the magnetic induction charger and it was big and bulky and hard to pack when traveling. This razor can work on both 110v and 240v, which is important for me as I travel overseas frequently.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is the best electric I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> Ditto to (most) of the other reviews. No complaints. Close, comfortable shave and best of all...it&#x27;s wet-dry.</li>
            <li> This was my first electric shaver &amp; i boutht after going through Product specification &amp; User reviews. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for month or so..&amp; it works great. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shaving is close &amp; smooth. &amp; Cleaning is simpler. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Only downside is it takes to shave area below chin.. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I would recommand to buy the product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Enjoy &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I found this electric shaver on sale and thought it was a good deal. Upon using it I know think it was a fabulous deal!!! I works great and I have seen the same shaver for a lot more money!!! I am convinced that Amazon is the place to shop!</li>
            <li> I am using electric shavers since last 10 years. This is the best so far...</li>
            <li> This razor is much, much better in features and maintenance than my Braun. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One of the things I liked with this razor is that the clean-up is easy and I don&#x27;t have to buy refills for the job (unlike Braun which performs cleaning with a cleaning cartridge that needs to be replaced periodically). And I don&#x27;t have to hesitate in getting it wet. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Another is the price - $60 A comparable Braun for this price does not have as many features.. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The design is also excellent: Ergonomic power plug, charging base that keeps the razor upright at all times. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Downside?  &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what the hi-speed feature is for. It does clean the razor any better than the normal speed.</li>
            <li> Bought this unit to shave my head and face and find it does a half way job at best.  Even on the face it does a half shave. If you wish to keep your beard and hair down to a can&#x27;t see look you have to use it everyday and even then you still have a rough touch to the beard. It seems to be made for kids just starting to shave or guys with a very light beard growth. Garage sale item.Good buy for your son&#x27;s first time shave till he gets a little older. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;                                                                DLR &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver half-heartedly thinking that I would have to return it as most of the people don&#x27;t find these kinda shavers performing. But I&#x27;m not at all disappointed with its performance, its rather great. Ofcourse, there&#x27;s no match to a conventional razor, but still its decent. What I like about it is that your could use it while taking shower(no gel required) and cleaning is easy, just keep it under running tap water, and its done. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I usually use it daily, after my workout in the gym - and use the conventional for extra close shave, when its required. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But, its really nice and worth a shot - saves a lot of time too.</li>
            <li> I have used this shaver for about 3 weeks now and it has met all my expectations. I bought this after reading the good reviews by other users. I think it is the best shaver I have used to date and that includes Braun. I can&#x27;t think of any negatives for this product. For the price, it cannot be beat!</li>
            <li> Once in a while you discover a product that is so far superior to any of its competitors that you can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s true, and you kick yourself for not having discovered it sooner.  That&#x27;s how I feel about my new Panasonic 8152.  Shaves as close as a safety razor in the wet mode but it&#x27;s even more comfortable than my Braun electric, and whisper quiet.</li>
            <li> This is a marvelous upgrade to the Panasonic ES8067 which has been my favorite razor for several years. It has a better and faster charging system, which is also smaller and easier to pack for travel.  I believe this to be the fastest and most comfortable electric razor available today and the Amazon price was 50% of retail.  An excellent buy.</li>
            <li> This is quite simply the best shaver I have owned.  It gives me a shave that is as smooth as a razor shave without the nicks and constant replacement of blades.  I have also owned Norelco and Remington electric shavers, and although I used the Norelco for a number of years, it never performed as well as this product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only downside I have discovered is that it can take several passes to get a shave that feels very smooth.  The first pass makes me look respectably shaved, however, so a two-minute shave is not out of the question when I&#x27;m in a hurry.</li>
            <li> This is a very good electric shaver and it does not cause a lot of irritation to sensitive skin.  That said, I don&#x27;t feel that it shaves as close as a blade but for most people I feel it would be a satisfactory shave.  My only real complaint is that the shaving stand that hold the razor for charging is rather flimsy.</li>
            <li> For most of my adult life I have used electric shavers.  Most have always had a problem of one sort or another.  Whether it was leaving the fine hairs behind or having a hard time dealing with the weekend growth, something was always lacking; this shaver takes it all on!</li>
            <li> best shaver i&#x27;ve ever used.braun is not even (close).that was unintended. &lt;br /&gt;joe ben-nun</li>
            <li> And it still works like a charm. This is a power work horse made in Japan circa 2005.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gone are the days when Japan still made affordable, quality electronics. The new Panasonic shavers, , except for the very top of the line, are mostly made in China now.</li>
            <li> Shaves fairly well when new and sharp, but blades dull fairly quickly and the shave gets less and less complete fairly soon after starting to use it.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned. I&#x27;ve used the Norelco rotaries, including one of the new models which dispense gel, and a Braun foil shaver prior to this one. I retunred the Norelco prior to getting this model from Amazon. It takes me a while longer to shave with it to be sure I get all the hairs (it&#x27;s sometimes difficult to see through the shaving cream), but once I&#x27;m done my face is as smooth as it can be.</li>
            <li> After trying various electric shavers in the $50 range that gave poor shave and skin irratations, I finally gave in and bought this top-of-the-line shaver, which is lives up to the hype.  It&#x27;s definitely the Lexus of shavers.  I really like the fact that I can lather up my face with shaving cream and shave while showering.  Since it&#x27;s wet and dry, just pop open the shave head and rinse away the debris in two seconds.  (I just hated cleaning the Norelco rotary heads with the two tiny brushes, with the little flimsy parts invariably popping out of place in the process.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick and tough stubbles that cheap shavers could not tackle well, but the sharp blades combined with high RPM motor of this shaver mowed them away smoothly.  Despite the high RPM, it&#x27;s the quietest electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned, with very little vibration.  The shaver is large, but it&#x27;s ergonomically designed and very comfortable to hold while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the downside, the charging base is made of flimsy plastic that looks ready to crack any second.  The poor design of the base also forces you to use two hands when separating the shaver from the charger.  Also, in order to maintain the peak performance, you must replace the foil and blade every few months, which are not cheap either.  (However, you can order these from Amazon - look up the keyword \\&quot;WES9006WC\\&quot;.)  But no electric shaver is perfect, including this one.  I actually use the Mach-3 at the end to &#x27;sandpaper&#x27; away the spots that are scratchy to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe Amazon is the best place to buy this shaver.  &#x27;Best Buy&#x27; carries them, but their price, availability, and model selection are spotty at best.  Further, their staff had zero knowledge about shavers.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best shavers on the market. Whatever they say about Norelco being the best,I think Panasonic rocks when it comes to shavers. My husband&#x27;s been using a 7xxx model for 3 years now and I decided to buy a new, more advanced, model for him since he&#x27;s been kind of reluctant to shave lately. And, needless to say, I like him better with smooth and soft shaved skin...The result- he&#x27;s been shaving every 2 days thanks to the fact this model makes less noise, has a great easy-grip design, recharges incredibly quickly and looks cool in the bathroom (Men love beautiful toys- from Gameboy Advance to Pro Curve shavers.) I&#x27;ll buy him more Panasonic products in the future; recommend you to do the same; won&#x27;t regret it!!!:) &lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;d ask \\&quot;why 4 stars, then?\\&quot; Well, lets leave some room for more HiTech advances...</li>
            <li> Got this on my last trip to Vegas when I forgot to pack my Braun.  Have been very happy, so much so that I now use this regularly and have retired my 10-year-old Braun.  It&#x27;s great for all types of shaving.  I really have nothing unflattering to say about this great electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Pros : powerful shaver, always deliver clean shave. &lt;br /&gt;Cons : docking station is too small, easy to be flipped over. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Take 2 hours to do first charge, the sideburn trimmer is  &lt;br /&gt;a plus feature, cleaning is easy, just wash it under the &lt;br /&gt;water. Focking station is too small, easy to be flipped over. &lt;br /&gt;It is make of a low-quality piece of plastic that look like &lt;br /&gt;it will melt or break in long term because the connectors are &lt;br /&gt;inside. Anyway, still recommended for the good shave. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I have used Panasonic shavers in the past and I am now a fan of all Panasonic products.  Great! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However, I must say that Panasonic does a lousy job of explaining whether the shavers are FULLY washable or not.  My old model can be placed fully in water and charged on its induction base.  Panasonic MUST clear up whether they can allow the shavers to be placed on an induction stand or not. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;According to Panasonic.com, Wet/DRy means that it can be used in the shower.  However, washable means that the shaver can be \\&quot;RINSED\\&quot; clean (not washed).  There is a little technical error there and I think it must be due to a bad translation. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When I went to stores like Brookstone or Sharper Image (have you seen Richard Thalheimer&#x27;s mug shots -- he is wearing a little too much makeup I think), these shavers are $250 or more.  Crazy!  They are also offering insurance on the products. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Mind you, if you are looking for a simple shaver that is washable (you can put the whole thing in water) and is easy to clean with a great shave, then you have made the right choice. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Braun has lost its market base by making shavers that can only be cleaned at the very top.  What if, God forbid, you accidentally get the charging section wet?  You are out of luck buddy! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have used Norelco and Remington before and they are worthless!  Just try and compare the quality of Panasonic to the other brands.  You can&#x27;t. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps you all.</li>
            <li> After two Panasonic shavers with quality issues, I tried one of the new Brauns but it was nowhere near as close as my last Panasonic. My beef with Panasonic Linear models was that the screen deformed quite easily by accident and impaired the shave quality.  Panasonic&#x27;s cutters and screens are quite expensive and this model is no exception ($37 for a replacement set), especially compared to the overall price of the shaver. However, the adjustable swivel function and foil/screen redesign on this series is much improved giving me a reasonably close shave, with little irritation of my otherwise sensitive neck, and much better than any competitor short of a blade. This linear motor is also quieter than my previous models.  As always, it&#x27;s great to be able to clean this shaver under running water using an antibacterial liquid soap -- compare that with the klutzy and noisy &#x27;cleaner&#x27; that comes with Braun that requires refills every couple of months.</li>
            <li> Love this razor and it still works after all these years!! and still gives a smooth shave. snap to clean</li>
