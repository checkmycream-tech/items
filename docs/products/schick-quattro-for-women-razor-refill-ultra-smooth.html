    <ol>
            <li>Best razer ever.</li>
            <li>Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>After using it, I am so impressed with the closeness of the shave that the four blades give!</li>
            <li>No irritation and works great!  </li>
            <li>These are wonderful.</li>
            <li>amazon&#x27;s the best place to get them.</li>
            <li>I think they are the best for shaving</li>

            <li>Very happy with how moisturizing these are.</li>

            <li>Venus Embrace blades and had heard good things about these blades</li>

            <li>Good  news</li>

            <li>Smooth shave and excellent price.</li>
            <li>My legs feel so good after I shave.</li>
            <li>has a good weight to it and you have good choices for blades.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for a good price on these blades.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend these and the price was fair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still looking for a good alternative.</li>
            <li>I have since switched to Gillette Venus - very satisfied with my choice.</li>
            <li>Great product deserves more than 5 stars.</li>
            <li>This is a really good and cost effective way to get replacement blades for Women&#x27;s Shick Quattro razor.  </li>
            <li>i had to try to go over some spots so many times that i now have razor burn!  </li>
            <li>and i fell in love with it!</li>
            <li>Been using these for years, much better than disposable razors!</li>
            <li>Love the Schick Quatro!</li>
            <li>Love these razors!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t buy two packs to stock up!</li>
            <li>They are great products providing a smooth shave every time.</li>
            <li>Good, but for the price should be better.</li>
            <li>Nice leg skin.</li>
            <li>I used to use Gillette razors/razor blades, but about 3-4 years ago, I started getting razor burn every time I shaved, no matter how often I changed the blades or what kind of &amp;#34;product&amp;#34</li>
            <li>To be honest, I will be buying them here from now on.</li>
            <li>Wife a Daughter liked</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with Amazon&#x27;s offered price and the convenient shipping.  </li>
            <li>Quattro delivers a nice close shave and never gives me razor burn.</li>
            <li>this razor is amazing, totally worth the price!!!</li>
            <li>but this one is great with the first swipe!</li>
            <li>This was the best price I have found them for so far</li>
            <li>I have great success with these blades, so</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and these are the best razor blades for my skin.</li>
            <li>I ordered the blades for my wife as replacement and she said that they are some of the best blade that you get if you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Great value for the money and the packaging is very nice too--it&#x27;s easy to grab new razors and store them in your shower.</li>
            <li>I really love this razor because it&#x27;s very easy to use and doesn&#x27;t cut of nick you.</li>
            <li>No other razor has been so consistently awesome as this one.</li>
            <li>Very smooth, no razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>I can get them from the locla stores but would pay muich more for them if I did.</li>
            <li>better buy than shelling out all the money for Venus</li>
            <li>Love these razors.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t use each more than 4 times.</li>
            <li>I love the four blades.</li>
            <li>This comes with 8 cartridges, which is way more than you think it will be.</li>
            <li>Interesting comments coming from a \\&quot;non-girlie\\&quot; girl.</li>
            <li>I figured 4 blades, better shave...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definately the most luxurious razor for women I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I love the schick quattro that is made for women and has four blades.</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save definitely gives me the best price.</li>
            <li>I love how close the shave is with these.  </li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>and I get way more cuts with those.</li>
            <li>I never was completely satisfied with them.</li>
            <li>I love these razors, nothing works as well for me.  </li>
            <li>razor itself, I like the control and the way the razor head moves better then</li>
            <li>One of my favorite razors on the market.</li>
            <li>Love the quattro.  </li>
            <li>These are some of my favorite razor heads.</li>
            <li>and I have never found a better brand at a better price.</li>
            <li>Love them and was glade to find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say much more about them.  </li>
            <li>I have found that my favorite blade is the men&#x27;s with 5 blades and</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheaper than the women&#x27;s blade, go figure, and does a better job.</li>
            <li>My favorite razors on the market.</li>
            <li>I like them a lot more than the Venus razors.</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t want to complain because I did get the refill cartridges that I wanted, it should have been better written.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product a many years, and would continue to use it for many more years to come.</li>
            <li>Every couple of months my wife tells me to order more of these for her, and I do.</li>
            <li>Amazon remains my go-to, favorite, virtual store.</li>
            <li>I can shave my arm pits many times, but once I use the razor for my legs</li>
            <li>Love my schick quattro.</li>
            <li>I find that these are much more comfortable and convenient on my face than &amp;#34;Gillette&amp;#34; razors.</li>
            <li>Ultra Smooth Cartridges is way better (no wire strips.)</li>
            <li>These are great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>- they do a great job and leave my skin soft after.</li>
            <li>I love how smooth my legs feel too.</li>
            <li>I have loved it from the very beginning.</li>
            <li>I recomend just learning to hoan and get a good straight razor .</li>
            <li>Schick makes excellent shaving products and I would not buy any other brand.</li>
            <li>Easy Easy Easy</li>
            <li>Why oh why can&#x27;t i be brave enough to let it all grow out?  :)</li>
            <li>It is easy to replace and works well.</li>
            <li>Trying to be more green, I do my best not to buy disposal items.  </li>
            <li>The handle is comfortably contoured and easy to grip.</li>
            <li>Work just fine.</li>
            <li>, maybe a tad less impressive.</li>
            <li>I like the close shave it gives me, since I have fine hair</li>
            <li>almost never have coupons available, so I&#x27;m happy to be able to get them for less on amazon. :)</li>
            <li>are always so smooth after a shave with this razer.</li>
            <li>and I was happy to find these at a cheaper price than my local Target.</li>
            <li>Always smooth.  </li>
            <li>It provides a smooth shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t fit all Schick brand handles.</li>
            <li>I find that changing my blades out every 3-5 weeks (depending on how often I&#x27;ve had to shave) keeps me razor burn free.</li>
            <li>The blades themselves are really quite nice, they moisturize a bit and never cut.</li>
            <li>Great deal compared to your big box store.</li>
            <li>Gives me a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I always purchase from Amazon and appreciate the free shipping.</li>
            <li>My husband used the men&#x27;s version as well and the men&#x27;s razor refills fit the women&#x27;s too.</li>
            <li>Well, it honestly is superior to anything I&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
            <li>These are my favorite razors and the price is right for the subscribe and save offer by amazon.</li>
            <li>The shower hanger is a true bonus and attaches easily to the shower wall with a suction cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It removes the hairs very well, its very cute, I dont have to change the blade very often, and most importantly it doesnt knick me.</li>
            <li>Smooth clean shaved.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this product and would recommend it to any female :)</li>
            <li>this is the first time I am able to say, this one did not perform as it should.</li>
            <li>Original packaging.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to find these on Subscribe and Save.</li>
            <li>Smooth shave, but it seems to start pulling quickly.  </li>
            <li>The razors leave a clean shave on my skin.  </li>
            <li>It glides down your legs so nicely for such a good smooth leg shave!!</li>
            <li>- we replace almost after one full use (his face then my bikini line and toss it).  </li>
            <li>The Schick Quattro razor is very non-irritating and I never cut myself, and it does seem slightly better than the Venus Embrace on underarms in terms of irritation and getting stray hairs, but that does not make up for the dismal job it does on my legs.</li>
            <li>The razors are good, but I only get one use out of shaving my legs.</li>
            <li>Really good price, same blades as always</li>
            <li>Sometimes I get nicked every once in while, but it is not bad.</li>
            <li>It took me a long time to find one that I liked and I&amp;#34;m happy with this one, finally..</li>
            <li>the other reviewers, I found the heft and balance pleasant and comfortable.</li>
            <li>The blades are easy to remove from the razor and easy to put the new blade in.</li>
            <li>My order was correct, as described, and came quickly.  </li>
            <li>bath water in an artistic swirl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am brand loyal when it comes to razors</li>
            <li>I have tried many kinds (like most women), but I always come back to the Schick Quattro.  </li>
            <li>I had such a pleasant - no LUXORIOUS - experience on the first shave</li>
            <li>Great razor blade cartridges - super easy to use, and I hardly ever manage to cut myself.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use shaving cream, but I get a great shave with the Venus Embrace without shaving cream, and in a lot less time.</li>
            <li>This is an exact replacement for the ones that originally came with the razzor.</li>
            <li>(I forget little inconsequential items with great frequency).</li>
            <li>This item being available via subscribe and save makes it very competitively priced</li>
            <li>They are totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>Rarely knicks.  </li>
            <li>Pretty sweet.</li>
            <li>but when we found this razor we knew it would be worth it.  </li>
            <li>prime deal well worth it</li>
            <li>This brand works well, and rarely causes cuts or nicks in the skin.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite women&#x27;s razor.  </li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite blades.</li>
            <li>good reliable razor, blades last a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li>and she was right.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the razor itself as much as the one I was replacing (an old two blade from 15 years ago that I had purchased a ton of blades for) but everyone loves a fresh blade.</li>
            <li>I was honestly going to ignore it/toss it, because although I pay attention to personal grooming, I&#x27;ve never been the sort to really \\&quot;get into\\</li>
            <li>If you enjoy working harder for more money to buy junky things and to fill our land fills this is for you.</li>
            <li>No hassle, no worries about if someone can open the darn case, and even better, they are shipped right to my house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used to use the Schick Silk Effects (also with the microfine wires but only two blades), but the Quattro is much better.</li>
            <li>First of all I have been using Schick Quattro products forever.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve used several women&#x27;s and mens brands over 25 years because I&#x27;ve never been happy long term with any of them.)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Reading magazines in the tub alerts me to all the personal care products I&#x27;d love to try.</li>
            <li>and it is the first four-blade razor to touch my legs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is such a close shave and the smootness lasts for 2 or more days.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It is important that one realizes that the cartridges need to be replaced more frequently when used on coarse hair</li>
            <li>exactly what i was expecting, thanks!</li>
            <li>These are much better than the basic ones.</li>
            <li>, they seem to prevent razor burn pretty well.</li>
            <li>I can tell you that it is absolutely a piece of junk!</li>
            <li>I have to go over the same area again and again, and it still doesn&#x27;t feel smooth!</li>
            <li>I use this regularly for many years.</li>
            <li>first time buying from the this vendor and i received it with no problem.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>But even still, I just use soap while shaving and I haven&#x27;t had any issues, so it glides pretty well.</li>
            <li>i am an experienced shaver who has had no problems with other razors, so i know that this is not due to error on my part.  </li>
            <li>Priced these all around grocery and drug stores during other shopping and this price ($18) was far better for more.  </li>
            <li>I love it so much that I&#x27;ve decided to only use them.</li>
            <li>This is pretty much all I&#x27;m willing to shell out for razor replacements, so you know.  </li>
            <li>And considering that I get major razor burn if my razor gets even SLIGHTLY dull, I go through a LOT of razor blades, so cheaper is a VERY GOOD THING.</li>
            <li>I bought this razor and blades because I couldn&#x27;t find my usual (and loved)</li>
            <li>The artistically designed fuchsia rubber grip on the metal handle (the weight is still light, but heavy enough to make it more stable) encourages precise control</li>
            <li>The blades are exactly as stated and purchase price couldn&#x27;t be beat, especially with the free shipping.</li>
            <li>I had to purchase a refill locally and it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>I have used this brand for years on my fine hair (thighs), my medium hair (legs, pits) and coarse hair (</li>
            <li>The price is a bit much for a blade I can only use three or four times, but at least while I am using it, it does a very good job.</li>
            <li>I do not even have to use shaving cream for these to trim comfortably, the blades also last much longer than Gillette for men.</li>
            <li>last comment is amazing coming from someone who is Italian and has course hair, I&#x27;ll tell you! &lt;</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I disagree entirely, but it hasn&#x27;t been a huge issue like I thought it might be.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>&quot; the whole \\&quot;girlie thing\\&quot; (eg.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really need to...</li>
            <li>I really like the shave I get with these.....</li>
            <li>This refill package is as stated on the add and was delivered really fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Schick Quattro razor for years, and find it performs very well.  </li>
            <li>This product goes with my fancy razor, I really like it a lot.  </li>
            <li>Such a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this razor since Venus Embrace is twice the price</li>
            <li>I get very close shave.</li>
            <li>I find they glide over my skin much easier</li>
            <li>These leave my legs silky smooth and last for quite awhile.</li>
            <li>I switched from a Gillette Venus to the Schick Quattro, and much prefer the Quattro.  </li>
            <li>Fast service.</li>
            <li>I have to admit that I would use men&#x27;s razors to get a very close shave on my legs but these razors do as good of a job and at least it looks girly hanging in my shower.</li>
            <li>These things excel a hair removal, much better than other things like tweezers or tape.</li>
            <li>the schick quattro is such a popular razor (probably because it&#x27;s cheaper than many of the alternatives) that i can never find the refill cartridges in my local stores, and when i do they&#x27;re more expensive.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;Papaya and Pearl Complex&amp;#34; was gooey and almost completely gone by the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>On a recent beach trip, shaving daily caused me to have several bright red bumps, which isn&#x27;t unusual for me and these blades, but it also doesn&#x27;t mean these are sooooo great</li>
            <li>and I wasnt satisfied at all; everytime I shaved my legs in the shower I would knick myself and would have blood dripping down my leg.  </li>
            <li>Now I can get more for less money</li>
            <li>I did have to throw one cartridge out after using it less than a week, but when these cost $16 for a pack of 4 in drug stores, this is still a better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the razer that works with these cartridges for about a year and a half and love them.</li>
            <li>and it did a decent job for a Friday shave.</li>
            <li>Decent price for the razors.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone not just women.</li>
            <li>This razor glides across your skin like silk on satin and truly delivers on its high performance guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smooth lime moisture strip helps the blades to slide gracefully over your most delicate skin and there are four tiny strips of wire over the blades that create a protective environment.</li>
            <li>Definitely got my money&#x27;s worth...</li>
            <li>It is worth the extra dollars.</li>
            <li>I use these every few days, and I love them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is well worth it to buy online if you have problems like I do with the local stores locking them up and</li>
            <li>The last me several shaves without causing any problems, although the ultra-smooth layers wear out very quickly.</li>
            <li>and i would suggest for anyone looking for a new option</li>
            <li>it is time for a new one.</li>
            <li>The razors that came from the original package lasted a really long time and were super sharp.</li>
            <li>(I have very sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t understand how these tiny pieces of sharpened metal and plastic can cost this much!  </li>
            <li>The product is the same, but the price is much nicer!</li>
            <li>my Venus, it&#x27;s much smaller and more flexible, but that doesn&#x27;t help any if the blades themself suck, which they do.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely not worth it.</li>
            <li>The extra blades really eliminates a lot of razor burn, though I use oil for shaving my legs because I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I had been using a gallette shaver since I was about thirteen years old</li>
            <li>The blades do last for a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>( I do not have a lot of hair thanks to decades of shaving) , yet these refills do not even last a day.</li>
            <li>Slides over knees with ease and never irritates sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The Venus sensitive skin razor blades seem thinner</li>
            <li>The blades do have a pretty long lifespan too, which is another plus for the price.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>These really don&#x27;t seem to be the same heads that came with my razor.</li>
            <li>I tried the Schick Quattro, I threw out all my old razors and razor blades.</li>
            <li>also wouldn&#x27;t give these the highest praise in the world, because I still get razor burn if I shave without having warmed up my skin considerably</li>
            <li>but they still Grab my old Schick Quattro</li>
            <li>WOW, what a difference.  </li>
            <li>overall, this razor is a complete disaster!!!</li>
            <li>and although the cartridges are a little pricey, it is worth every penny you spend on them!</li>
            <li>The NEW Venus blade was less comfortable to use than my last Quattro blade was when I decided I needed to replace it.  </li>
            <li>It took several tries and two days for me to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li>My only beef is the width of the razor head, which is too small in my opinion and therefore requires more strokes to complete shaving.  </li>
            <li>I finally changed the first cartridge after what seemed like weeks after ordering the initial razor.</li>
            <li>Not sure it is any better than any other razor; and I am really not sure that 4 blades are better than one.</li>
            <li>i think there are two problems:  the little wires that cover the razors do not allow the razors to function efficiently, and the rubber part on the bottom sticks out farther than the razors so the razors can&#x27;t really even touch your skin unless you apply too much pressure.  </li>
            <li>I still had 1 new blade left for my Venus, so I decided to go ahead and use.  </li>
            <li>ago!i haven&#x27;t cut my self at all (knock on wood) and have enjoyed shaving more rather than thinking of it as sn annoying chore.</li>
            <li>I purchased an 8-pack and have been through  four refills; they are not sharp.</li>
            <li>i will say that my leg hair does grow in coarse enough to put most men to shame, but that hasn&#x27;t been a problem with other razors, including the single blade disposable BIC.  </li>
            <li>Seriously never going to another razor as long as this one stays around.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a very long time since I purchased a new razor and was surprised at the cost of the replacement blades.</li>
            <li>As far as razors go, these are the only ones that have ever not given me razor rash.  </li>
            <li>Barely lasted 2 shaves...</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>These are suppose to be exactly the same as what is sold in stores however these do not seem to be as sharp.</li>
            <li>Great product just a little expensive though</li>
            <li>, you really can skip a day here and there due to the supremely close shave.</li>
            <li>The smoothness really suprised me considering how ihave extremely course hair</li>
            <li>Other places, not so much.</li>
            <li>So far I have only knicked myself once and oddly enough</li>
            <li>I was first attracted to this razor because of the microfine wires around the blades, making it less likely to nick the skin.</li>
            <li>This brand, as long as the blade is fairly new, does not leave anything behind but smooth skin.</li>
            <li>It is possible that out of all orders, I received the only package with refills which are not sharp.</li>
            <li>Though it is a little bit cheaper than the stores, I still think it&#x27;s quite expensive for shaving cartridges :P</li>
            <li>The only comparable thing to this in Gillette, I have had three of as they all broke within a few months, this is still running strong and costs less.</li>
            <li>I only use this kind of razor and usually don&#x27;t have any issues, but these came and were already so dull.</li>
            <li>A few months ago I was at lady footlocker buying a pair of black toe shelled adidas with white stripe and some socks; if you bought something they would give you a free quatro for women shaver.</li>

            <li> Love these razors!</li>

            <li> Nice leg skin.</li>
            <li> I used to use Gillette razors/razor blades, but about 3-4 years ago, I started getting razor burn every time I shaved, no matter how often I changed the blades or what kind of &amp;#34;product&amp;#34</li>

            <li> Interesting comments coming from a \\&quot;non-girlie\\&quot; girl.</li>
            <li> I figured 4 blades, better shave...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definately the most luxurious razor for women I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I love the schick quattro that is made for women and has four blades.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save definitely gives me the best price.</li>
            <li> I love how close the shave is with these.  </li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> and I get way more cuts with those.</li>
            <li> I never was completely satisfied with them.</li>
            <li> I love these razors, nothing works as well for me.  </li>

            <li> Love the quattro.  </li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t say much more about them.  </li>
            <li> I have found that my favorite blade is the men&#x27;s with 5 blades and</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheaper than the women&#x27;s blade, go figure, and does a better job.</li>
            <li> My favorite razors on the market.</li>
            <li> I like them a lot more than the Venus razors.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t want to complain because I did get the refill cartridges that I wanted, it should have been better written.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product a many years, and would continue to use it for many more years to come.</li>
            <li> Every couple of months my wife tells me to order more of these for her, and I do.</li>
            <li> Amazon remains my go-to, favorite, virtual store.</li>
            <li> I can shave my arm pits many times, but once I use the razor for my legs</li>
            <li> Love my schick quattro.</li>
            <li> I find that these are much more comfortable and convenient on my face than &amp;#34;Gillette&amp;#34; razors.</li>
            <li> Ultra Smooth Cartridges is way better (no wire strips.)</li>
            <li> These are great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> - they do a great job and leave my skin soft after.</li>
            <li> I love how smooth my legs feel too.</li>
            <li> I have loved it from the very beginning.</li>
            <li> I recomend just learning to hoan and get a good straight razor .</li>
            <li> Schick makes excellent shaving products and I would not buy any other brand.</li>
            <li> Easy Easy Easy</li>
            <li> Why oh why can&#x27;t i be brave enough to let it all grow out?  :)</li>
            <li> It is easy to replace and works well.</li>
            <li> Trying to be more green, I do my best not to buy disposal items.  </li>
            <li> The handle is comfortably contoured and easy to grip.</li>
            <li> Work just fine.</li>
            <li> , maybe a tad less impressive.</li>
            <li> I like the close shave it gives me, since I have fine hair</li>
            <li> almost never have coupons available, so I&#x27;m happy to be able to get them for less on amazon. :)</li>
            <li> are always so smooth after a shave with this razer.</li>
            <li> and I was happy to find these at a cheaper price than my local Target.</li>
            <li> Always smooth.  </li>
            <li> It provides a smooth shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t fit all Schick brand handles.</li>
            <li> I find that changing my blades out every 3-5 weeks (depending on how often I&#x27;ve had to shave) keeps me razor burn free.</li>
            <li> The blades themselves are really quite nice, they moisturize a bit and never cut.</li>
            <li> Great deal compared to your big box store.</li>
            <li> Gives me a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I always purchase from Amazon and appreciate the free shipping.</li>
            <li> My husband used the men&#x27;s version as well and the men&#x27;s razor refills fit the women&#x27;s too.</li>
            <li> Well, it honestly is superior to anything I&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
            <li> These are my favorite razors and the price is right for the subscribe and save offer by amazon.</li>
            <li> The shower hanger is a true bonus and attaches easily to the shower wall with a suction cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It removes the hairs very well, its very cute, I dont have to change the blade very often, and most importantly it doesnt knick me.</li>
            <li> Smooth clean shaved.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product and would recommend it to any female :)</li>
            <li> this is the first time I am able to say, this one did not perform as it should.</li>
            <li> Original packaging.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to find these on Subscribe and Save.</li>
            <li> Smooth shave, but it seems to start pulling quickly.  </li>
            <li> The razors leave a clean shave on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It glides down your legs so nicely for such a good smooth leg shave!!</li>
            <li> - we replace almost after one full use (his face then my bikini line and toss it).  </li>
            <li> The Schick Quattro razor is very non-irritating and I never cut myself, and it does seem slightly better than the Venus Embrace on underarms in terms of irritation and getting stray hairs, but that does not make up for the dismal job it does on my legs.</li>
            <li> The razors are good, but I only get one use out of shaving my legs.</li>
            <li> Really good price, same blades as always</li>
            <li> Sometimes I get nicked every once in while, but it is not bad.</li>
            <li> It took me a long time to find one that I liked and I&amp;#34;m happy with this one, finally..</li>
            <li> the other reviewers, I found the heft and balance pleasant and comfortable.</li>
            <li> The blades are easy to remove from the razor and easy to put the new blade in.</li>
            <li> My order was correct, as described, and came quickly.  </li>
            <li> bath water in an artistic swirl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am brand loyal when it comes to razors</li>
            <li> I have tried many kinds (like most women), but I always come back to the Schick Quattro.  </li>
            <li> I had such a pleasant - no LUXORIOUS - experience on the first shave</li>
            <li> Great razor blade cartridges - super easy to use, and I hardly ever manage to cut myself.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use shaving cream, but I get a great shave with the Venus Embrace without shaving cream, and in a lot less time.</li>
            <li> This is an exact replacement for the ones that originally came with the razzor.</li>
            <li> (I forget little inconsequential items with great frequency).</li>
            <li> This item being available via subscribe and save makes it very competitively priced</li>
            <li> They are totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> Rarely knicks.  </li>
            <li> Pretty sweet.</li>
            <li> but when we found this razor we knew it would be worth it.  </li>
            <li> prime deal well worth it</li>
            <li> This brand works well, and rarely causes cuts or nicks in the skin.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite women&#x27;s razor.  </li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite blades.</li>
            <li> good reliable razor, blades last a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> and she was right.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love the razor itself as much as the one I was replacing (an old two blade from 15 years ago that I had purchased a ton of blades for) but everyone loves a fresh blade.</li>
            <li> I was honestly going to ignore it/toss it, because although I pay attention to personal grooming, I&#x27;ve never been the sort to really \\&quot;get into\\</li>
            <li> If you enjoy working harder for more money to buy junky things and to fill our land fills this is for you.</li>
            <li> No hassle, no worries about if someone can open the darn case, and even better, they are shipped right to my house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to use the Schick Silk Effects (also with the microfine wires but only two blades), but the Quattro is much better.</li>
            <li> First of all I have been using Schick Quattro products forever.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve used several women&#x27;s and mens brands over 25 years because I&#x27;ve never been happy long term with any of them.)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Reading magazines in the tub alerts me to all the personal care products I&#x27;d love to try.</li>
            <li> and it is the first four-blade razor to touch my legs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is such a close shave and the smootness lasts for 2 or more days.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It is important that one realizes that the cartridges need to be replaced more frequently when used on coarse hair</li>
            <li> exactly what i was expecting, thanks!</li>
            <li> These are much better than the basic ones.</li>
            <li> , they seem to prevent razor burn pretty well.</li>
            <li> I can tell you that it is absolutely a piece of junk!</li>
            <li> I have to go over the same area again and again, and it still doesn&#x27;t feel smooth!</li>
            <li> I use this regularly for many years.</li>
            <li> first time buying from the this vendor and i received it with no problem.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> But even still, I just use soap while shaving and I haven&#x27;t had any issues, so it glides pretty well.</li>
            <li> i am an experienced shaver who has had no problems with other razors, so i know that this is not due to error on my part.  </li>
            <li> Priced these all around grocery and drug stores during other shopping and this price ($18) was far better for more.  </li>
            <li> I love it so much that I&#x27;ve decided to only use them.</li>
            <li> This is pretty much all I&#x27;m willing to shell out for razor replacements, so you know.  </li>
            <li> And considering that I get major razor burn if my razor gets even SLIGHTLY dull, I go through a LOT of razor blades, so cheaper is a VERY GOOD THING.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor and blades because I couldn&#x27;t find my usual (and loved)</li>
            <li> The artistically designed fuchsia rubber grip on the metal handle (the weight is still light, but heavy enough to make it more stable) encourages precise control</li>
            <li> The blades are exactly as stated and purchase price couldn&#x27;t be beat, especially with the free shipping.</li>
            <li> I had to purchase a refill locally and it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand for years on my fine hair (thighs), my medium hair (legs, pits) and coarse hair (</li>
            <li> The price is a bit much for a blade I can only use three or four times, but at least while I am using it, it does a very good job.</li>
            <li> I do not even have to use shaving cream for these to trim comfortably, the blades also last much longer than Gillette for men.</li>
            <li> last comment is amazing coming from someone who is Italian and has course hair, I&#x27;ll tell you! &lt;</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I disagree entirely, but it hasn&#x27;t been a huge issue like I thought it might be.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> &quot; the whole \\&quot;girlie thing\\&quot; (eg.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really need to...</li>
            <li> I really like the shave I get with these.....</li>
            <li> This refill package is as stated on the add and was delivered really fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Schick Quattro razor for years, and find it performs very well.  </li>
            <li> This product goes with my fancy razor, I really like it a lot.  </li>
            <li> Such a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this razor since Venus Embrace is twice the price</li>
            <li> I get very close shave.</li>
            <li> I find they glide over my skin much easier</li>
            <li> These leave my legs silky smooth and last for quite awhile.</li>
            <li> I switched from a Gillette Venus to the Schick Quattro, and much prefer the Quattro.  </li>
            <li> Fast service.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I would use men&#x27;s razors to get a very close shave on my legs but these razors do as good of a job and at least it looks girly hanging in my shower.</li>
            <li> These things excel a hair removal, much better than other things like tweezers or tape.</li>
            <li> the schick quattro is such a popular razor (probably because it&#x27;s cheaper than many of the alternatives) that i can never find the refill cartridges in my local stores, and when i do they&#x27;re more expensive.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;Papaya and Pearl Complex&amp;#34; was gooey and almost completely gone by the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> On a recent beach trip, shaving daily caused me to have several bright red bumps, which isn&#x27;t unusual for me and these blades, but it also doesn&#x27;t mean these are sooooo great</li>
            <li> and I wasnt satisfied at all; everytime I shaved my legs in the shower I would knick myself and would have blood dripping down my leg.  </li>
            <li> Now I can get more for less money</li>
            <li> I did have to throw one cartridge out after using it less than a week, but when these cost $16 for a pack of 4 in drug stores, this is still a better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the razer that works with these cartridges for about a year and a half and love them.</li>
            <li> and it did a decent job for a Friday shave.</li>
            <li> Decent price for the razors.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone not just women.</li>
            <li> This razor glides across your skin like silk on satin and truly delivers on its high performance guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smooth lime moisture strip helps the blades to slide gracefully over your most delicate skin and there are four tiny strips of wire over the blades that create a protective environment.</li>
            <li> Definitely got my money&#x27;s worth...</li>
            <li> It is worth the extra dollars.</li>
            <li> I use these every few days, and I love them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is well worth it to buy online if you have problems like I do with the local stores locking them up and</li>
            <li> The last me several shaves without causing any problems, although the ultra-smooth layers wear out very quickly.</li>
            <li> and i would suggest for anyone looking for a new option</li>
            <li> it is time for a new one.</li>
            <li> The razors that came from the original package lasted a really long time and were super sharp.</li>
            <li> (I have very sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understand how these tiny pieces of sharpened metal and plastic can cost this much!  </li>
            <li> The product is the same, but the price is much nicer!</li>
            <li> my Venus, it&#x27;s much smaller and more flexible, but that doesn&#x27;t help any if the blades themself suck, which they do.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely not worth it.</li>
            <li> The extra blades really eliminates a lot of razor burn, though I use oil for shaving my legs because I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I had been using a gallette shaver since I was about thirteen years old</li>
            <li> The blades do last for a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> ( I do not have a lot of hair thanks to decades of shaving) , yet these refills do not even last a day.</li>
            <li> Slides over knees with ease and never irritates sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The Venus sensitive skin razor blades seem thinner</li>
            <li> The blades do have a pretty long lifespan too, which is another plus for the price.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> These really don&#x27;t seem to be the same heads that came with my razor.</li>
            <li> I tried the Schick Quattro, I threw out all my old razors and razor blades.</li>
            <li> also wouldn&#x27;t give these the highest praise in the world, because I still get razor burn if I shave without having warmed up my skin considerably</li>
            <li> but they still Grab my old Schick Quattro</li>
            <li> WOW, what a difference.  </li>
            <li> overall, this razor is a complete disaster!!!</li>
            <li> and although the cartridges are a little pricey, it is worth every penny you spend on them!</li>
            <li> The NEW Venus blade was less comfortable to use than my last Quattro blade was when I decided I needed to replace it.  </li>
            <li> It took several tries and two days for me to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li> My only beef is the width of the razor head, which is too small in my opinion and therefore requires more strokes to complete shaving.  </li>
            <li> I finally changed the first cartridge after what seemed like weeks after ordering the initial razor.</li>
            <li> Not sure it is any better than any other razor; and I am really not sure that 4 blades are better than one.</li>
            <li> i think there are two problems:  the little wires that cover the razors do not allow the razors to function efficiently, and the rubber part on the bottom sticks out farther than the razors so the razors can&#x27;t really even touch your skin unless you apply too much pressure.  </li>
            <li> I still had 1 new blade left for my Venus, so I decided to go ahead and use.  </li>
            <li> ago!i haven&#x27;t cut my self at all (knock on wood) and have enjoyed shaving more rather than thinking of it as sn annoying chore.</li>
            <li> I purchased an 8-pack and have been through  four refills; they are not sharp.</li>
            <li> i will say that my leg hair does grow in coarse enough to put most men to shame, but that hasn&#x27;t been a problem with other razors, including the single blade disposable BIC.  </li>
            <li> Seriously never going to another razor as long as this one stays around.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a very long time since I purchased a new razor and was surprised at the cost of the replacement blades.</li>
            <li> As far as razors go, these are the only ones that have ever not given me razor rash.  </li>
            <li> Barely lasted 2 shaves...</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> These are suppose to be exactly the same as what is sold in stores however these do not seem to be as sharp.</li>
            <li> Great product just a little expensive though</li>
            <li> , you really can skip a day here and there due to the supremely close shave.</li>
            <li> The smoothness really suprised me considering how ihave extremely course hair</li>
            <li> Other places, not so much.</li>
            <li> So far I have only knicked myself once and oddly enough</li>
            <li> I was first attracted to this razor because of the microfine wires around the blades, making it less likely to nick the skin.</li>
            <li> This brand, as long as the blade is fairly new, does not leave anything behind but smooth skin.</li>
            <li> It is possible that out of all orders, I received the only package with refills which are not sharp.</li>
            <li> Though it is a little bit cheaper than the stores, I still think it&#x27;s quite expensive for shaving cartridges :P</li>
            <li> The only comparable thing to this in Gillette, I have had three of as they all broke within a few months, this is still running strong and costs less.</li>
            <li> I only use this kind of razor and usually don&#x27;t have any issues, but these came and were already so dull.</li>
            <li> A few months ago I was at lady footlocker buying a pair of black toe shelled adidas with white stripe and some socks; if you bought something they would give you a free quatro for women shaver.</li>
            <li> these are expensive but if society expects me to shave my legs these are pretty much the only razors that dont give me an irritation.</li>
            <li> It stays sharp for considerably longer than the cheapo razors.</li>
            <li> There is no pain, no discomfort, no overly dry and tight feeling - very silky.</li>
            <li> I still have three cartridges left and they last so long.</li>
            <li> First off ill get right out and say it, I&#x27;m a male, and no I&#x27;m not playing for the other team either.</li>
            <li> The blades last a long time, since we all know no one changes them once a week, or even once a month, as recommended.  </li>
            <li> I feel like the glades don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Last a long time.</li>
            <li> one good thing about this is you won&#x27;t have to worry about your kids cutting themselves if they get a hold of it, it won&#x27;t even cut leg hair!  </li>
            <li> They last so long, one cartridge lasts about two weeks!</li>
            <li> my less frequently than with the Venus blades.</li>
            <li> I have to go over an area several times, my showers are literally doubled in time and all that extra time is spent shaving.</li>
            <li> They do not last long at all, seem dull very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> This particular razor was featured with a few other razors and sounded like the ultimate razor for women.</li>
            <li> Several of them had switched to the Schick Quattro for women due to similar issues.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if a razor blade can go bad when sitting in a sealed package, but based on my experience when I initially made the switch, and then the more recent experience trying my Venus again - I&#x27;m sticking with the Quattro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> long time</li>
            <li> A complete waste of time and money.  </li>
            <li> It dulls four times faster than a man&#x27;s razor of the same model.</li>
            <li> As such, I have a pink, nondisposable Schick Quattro razor that requires refill cartridges.  </li>
            <li> Each cartridge lasts a long time and works well.</li>
            <li> It will last literally 100 years and take up less land fill space when it finally wears out.</li>
            <li> I typically have three different types of razors, for different areas this blade can do it all.</li>
            <li> Last longer than the cheaper ones and aren&#x27;t super expensive.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with my wife always stealing my razor and using it on her legs and other areas and then putting it back.  </li>
            <li> but I do not find myself buying any other brand as these blades do take all my facial hair off, and believe me I have plenty.</li>
            <li> These blades cut my hair and compared with other blades are affordable which is what we needed, and the regular is in stock</li>
            <li> They are smaller and took me forever to shave--they just weren&#x27;t as sharp or something.</li>
            <li> Even though they are a little more expensive,</li>
            <li> and I have not looked back on any other brands.</li>
            <li> There it is as black as my head hair was when I was younger.</li>
            <li> The quatro or four blades ideas is easier to manage and less likely to cause injuries.</li>
            <li> It seemed no matter how new the blade was, it would still leave a visible stubble behind, especially where the jowl lines are on each side of my chin.</li>
            <li> I get a close shave with these with minimal to no cuts.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected and they work well.  </li>
            <li> Just what you&#x27;d expect, getting harder to find at stores in my area</li>
            <li> These can cut but not very well.</li>
            <li> All I know is that since using these, I have cut myself shaving multiple times (this doesn&#x27;t usually happen to me).</li>
            <li> (I shave every other day), so I get about a 2 month supply.</li>
            <li> I felt I had alot of \\&quot;control\\&quot; with the razor, an experience I never felt with any other before</li>
            <li> Before I did, I figured I&#x27;d try a couple other brands.</li>
            <li> The blades stay sharp through weeks of shaving.</li>
            <li> Blades weren&#x27;t sharp at all.</li>
            <li> They get the job done, they stay sharp, and they don&#x27;t leave me with nicks.</li>
            <li> I ordered these in hopes to save a bit of money, I use Venus razors which can get pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> A little rough, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> Hardly ever get razor burn and they seem to last for quite awhile.</li>
            <li> I saw several comments stating that the blades were dull out of the package, or dulled faster than store-bought.</li>
            <li> so you cannot possibly cut yourself, with that being said I have gotten nicked because the blade was dull.</li>
            <li> Frustrated by my constant razor burn (which is VERY evident on my extremely pale skin), I polled my friends.</li>
            <li> The wire strips that are supposed to help prevent nicking skin, just get clogged up with hair, making it impossible to clean out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;One of the additional comfort features is the aloe and vitamin E enriched strip at the top  and base.</li>
            <li> I use to say that I would never shop on line when it became all the rage,  but trust me the less time I can spend running around on weekends burning up my time and gas,</li>
            <li> With a little searching, I found these cheaper on Ebay.</li>
            <li> No more Wal-Mart for me when I can have them and other items delivered to my door.  </li>
            <li> No nicks and little shave bumps.</li>
            <li> just annoying unless you enjoy watching your blood mingle</li>
            <li> Buy a few.</li>
            <li> I have used them for a few years now</li>
            <li> I get maybe a few uses out of each blade before its too dull and I have to throw it out.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> The razors worked OKAY for my legs, but HORRIBLE for armpits.</li>
            <li> not much more to be said</li>
            <li> Way too expensive and make me want to try the non titanium next time.</li>
            <li> It preforms very poorly on areas that aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; like your upper thighs.</li>
            <li> and I have very few nicks and cuts.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to spend $25+ for a pack of razor heads...</li>
            <li> After suffering from horrible razor burn on both my legs for almost a SOLID WEEK, I decided to try the Schick razor and was really surprised by the results.</li>
            <li> Lasts at least two days.</li>
            <li> It had been at least a year since I&#x27;d made the switch, when I ran out of blades for my Quattro.  </li>
            <li> I ran out for a few weeks and tried a sample of a cheaper razor and managed to seriously nick myself dozens of times!</li>
            <li> I have always used disposable razors, but no more!  </li>
            <li> The refill cartridges are expensive but less so here on Amazon</li>
            <li> Just wish they were less expensive.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor on a trip recently and haven&#x27;t been disappointed with its performance.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding refills around my neck of the woods and when I do, they&#x27;re expensive.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I just really hate these razors.</li>
            <li> Not sure if these were bad quality, but they will dull.</li>
            <li> Looking at the product, I couldn&#x27;t tell you what&#x27;s wrong with it.</li>
            <li> a week or so later I had a terrible experience with the disposable razors I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a lot of choice in this matter for refillable razors anymore.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> That said, they are expensive.  </li>
            <li> so figured hey, couldn&#x27;t hurt to try, well it didn&#x27;t hurt, but these blades give my legs a lousy shave</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lame there is a required amount of words for reviews.</li>
            <li> Gets as close to the skin as possible without cutting yourself!!!</li>
            <li> The hassle of cutting yourself&lt;br</li>
            <li> just wish refills weren&#x27;t so darn expensive!</li>
            <li> I hate how expensive razor blades are.</li>
            <li> WRONG WRONG WRONG!!!  </li>
            <li> Did I get a bad batch of these?</li>
            <li> Some razors give me bad razor burn.</li>
            <li> This one does not give me bad razor burn at all.</li>
            <li> Was seriously disappointed in these.</li>
            <li> and I STILL had stubble because of the stupid wire strips across the blades, yes</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Great price for razors. These are often double the price at my local drug store.</li>
            <li> First off ill get right out and say it, I&#x27;m a male, and no I&#x27;m not playing for the other team either. I find that these are much more comfortable and convenient on my face than &amp;#34;Gillette&amp;#34; razors. I used Gillette for years and then my girlfriend wanted one of these, when I tried hers my mind was made up. I do not even have to use shaving cream for these to trim comfortably, the blades also last much longer than Gillette for men. The only comparable thing to this in Gillette, I have had three of as they all broke within a few months, this is still running strong and costs less. I highly recommend this to anyone not just women.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I can get them from the locla stores but would pay muich more for them if I did.</li>
            <li> better buy than shelling out all the money for Venus</li>
            <li> Best razer ever. I still have three cartridges left and they last so long. The quattro gets the job done my legs are always so smooth after a shave with this razer.</li>
            <li> Love these razors. They are totally worth the price. I ran out for a few weeks and tried a sample of a cheaper razor and managed to seriously nick myself dozens of times! Never going back to cheaper razors again!</li>
            <li> This product is what you would expect. I would recommend it to a friend and I will buy it again if needed.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase. The blades are exactly as stated and purchase price couldn&#x27;t be beat, especially with the free shipping.</li>
            <li> I was first attracted to this razor because of the microfine wires around the blades, making it less likely to nick the skin. After using it, I am so impressed with the closeness of the shave that the four blades give! I used to use the Schick Silk Effects (also with the microfine wires but only two blades), but the Quattro is much better. I also like the rubber pad in front of the blades--it makes the hairs stand up before the blades cut them. The handle is comfortably contoured and easy to grip. The metal and rubber construction gives a solid feel to the razor. My only beef is the width of the razor head, which is too small in my opinion and therefore requires more strokes to complete shaving.  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I only use this kind of razor and usually don&#x27;t have any issues, but these came and were already so dull. I couldn&#x27;t use each more than 4 times. The &amp;#34;Papaya and Pearl Complex&amp;#34; was gooey and almost completely gone by the first time I used it. Won&#x27;t be ordering these anymore. :/</li>
            <li> These razors work great. Hardly ever get razor burn and they seem to last for quite awhile. This was the best price I have found them for so far</li>
            <li> I bought this razor on a trip recently and haven&#x27;t been disappointed with its performance. It&#x27;s been a very long time since I purchased a new razor and was surprised at the cost of the replacement blades. With a little searching, I found these cheaper on Ebay.</li>
            <li> Hmmm, where do I start? First of all I have been using Schick Quattro products forever. They are great products providing a smooth shave every time. I took a gamble and ordered online to save some money. Looking at the product, I couldn&#x27;t tell you what&#x27;s wrong with it. All I know is that since using these, I have cut myself shaving multiple times (this doesn&#x27;t usually happen to me). I thought maybe it was just that one razor so I tried another one, and yet the end result was the same. Multiple cuts and bumpy skin! Did I get a bad batch of these? I will pay the extra money and buy them at the store like I&#x27;ve always done. So, if this is a coincidence then whatever. If not, you&#x27;ve been warned.</li>
            <li> I love the four blades. This comes with 8 cartridges, which is way more than you think it will be. Each one lasts me about a week (I shave every other day), so I get about a 2 month supply. I subscribed, so I can save on these!</li>
            <li> i recently bought this razor because it looked like a quality razor for the price.  boy, was i fooled!  after having to go over my legs three times with it, they still came out prickly.  shaving my armpits with it is a joke!  i might as well be using a butter knife!  i had to try to go over some spots so many times that i now have razor burn!  i am an experienced shaver who has had no problems with other razors, so i know that this is not due to error on my part.  i think there are two problems:  the little wires that cover the razors do not allow the razors to function efficiently, and the rubber part on the bottom sticks out farther than the razors so the razors can&#x27;t really even touch your skin unless you apply too much pressure.  i will say that my leg hair does grow in coarse enough to put most men to shame, but that hasn&#x27;t been a problem with other razors, including the single blade disposable BIC.  one good thing about this is you won&#x27;t have to worry about your kids cutting themselves if they get a hold of it, it won&#x27;t even cut leg hair!  you could probably even throw it the toy box because that&#x27;s all it&#x27;s good for!  overall, this razor is a complete disaster!!!</li>
            <li> I received this razor when I purchased my cap &amp; gown for graduation...it was a freebie thrown into the bag. I was honestly going to ignore it/toss it, because although I pay attention to personal grooming, I&#x27;ve never been the sort to really \\&quot;get into\\&quot; the whole \\&quot;girlie thing\\&quot; (eg. reading magazines on products \\&quot;You Have to Try!!!\\&quot;.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Maybe a week or so later I had a terrible experience with the disposable razors I&#x27;ve been using. (I&#x27;ve used several women&#x27;s and mens brands over 25 years because I&#x27;ve never been happy long term with any of them.) After suffering from horrible razor burn on both my legs for almost a SOLID WEEK, I decided to try the Schick razor and was really surprised by the results. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Like the other reviewers, I found the heft and balance pleasant and comfortable. I felt I had alot of \\&quot;control\\&quot; with the razor, an experience I never felt with any other before (and didn&#x27;t even know it was an issue until I tried this one). I never knew that you could shave and not have the experience just be tolorable. I had such a pleasant - no LUXORIOUS - experience on the first shave, that I have decided to continue using it.  There is no pain, no discomfort, no overly dry and tight feeling - very silky. I even look forward to shaving now and even do it even on days I don&#x27;t really need to...I know someone mentioned that you can skip a day and she was right. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That last comment is amazing coming from someone who is Italian and has course hair, I&#x27;ll tell you! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am happily purchasing replacement blades, changing them and am happy to recommend this product. Interesting comments coming from a \\&quot;non-girlie\\&quot; girl. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I had been using a gallette shaver since I was about thirteen years old and I wasnt satisfied at all; everytime I shaved my legs in the shower I would knick myself and would have blood dripping down my leg.  A few months ago I was at lady footlocker buying a pair of black toe shelled adidas with white stripe and some socks; if you bought something they would give you a free quatro for women shaver. I have loved it from the very beginning. So far I have only knicked myself once and oddly enough that was today. It removes the hairs very well, its very cute, I dont have to change the blade very often, and most importantly it doesnt knick me. I am very satisfied with this product and would recommend it to any female :)</li>
            <li> I really like the shave I get with these..... however, the price is getting out of control.  I can&#x27;t understand how these tiny pieces of sharpened metal and plastic can cost this much!  Unfortunately, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a lot of choice in this matter for refillable razors anymore.</li>
            <li> I tried this after years of using the schick intuition. I figured 4 blades, better shave... I was wrong. The razors worked OKAY for my legs, but HORRIBLE for armpits. It would leave hairs everytime... I would switch directions and go over and over. Finally had to resort to just using razor on legs and using a Venus on the armpits. Final answer, no I would not recommend or buy again.</li>
            <li> This is an exact replacement for the ones that originally came with the razzor.</li>
            <li> Good, but for the price should be better. The wire strips that are supposed to help prevent nicking skin, just get clogged up with hair, making it impossible to clean out. The blades do last for a reasonable amount of time. Schick Quattro For Women Ultra Smooth Cartridges is way better (no wire strips.)</li>
            <li> these are expensive but if society expects me to shave my legs these are pretty much the only razors that dont give me an irritation.</li>
            <li> I will never buy again. It is possible that out of all orders, I received the only package with refills which are not sharp. I purchased an 8-pack and have been through  four refills; they are not sharp. A razor will usually last me 6-8 months ( I do not have a lot of hair thanks to decades of shaving) , yet these refills do not even last a day. I had to purchase a refill locally and it seems to work fine. I have been using Quattro for over five years and this is the first time I am able to say, this one did not perform as it should.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I use these and order them regularly via AMazon. It&#x27;s great to have it automatically show up and we never run out of razors.  It took me a long time to find one that I liked and I&amp;#34;m happy with this one, finally..</li>
            <li> Not sure if these were bad quality, but they will dull. I get maybe a few uses out of each blade before its too dull and I have to throw it out.</li>
            <li> My order was correct, as described, and came quickly.  I would definitely use this vendor again.  I ordered with the auto renew so it was several dollars cheaper and I won&#x27;t have to remember to order again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Closest shave i&#x27;ve ever had.  The head moves around bones, etc so the risk of getting a razor cut is virtually nil.</li>
            <li> The only way to shave!  I have great success with these blades, so I try to stick with them even though they are a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> Great razor blade cartridges - super easy to use, and I hardly ever manage to cut myself.  Easy Easy Easy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for years. I love it so much that I&#x27;ve decided to only use them. This refill package is as stated on the add and was delivered really fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these before that came in the mail as a freebie, and once that one got gross and lost, I had to buy another one. Before I did, I figured I&#x27;d try a couple other brands. I shouldn&#x27;t have bothered. No other razor has been so consistently awesome as this one. I don&#x27;t get any cuts at all. Seriously never going to another razor as long as this one stays around.</li>
            <li> Definitely got my money&#x27;s worth...never again will I buy these in a store!</li>
            <li> These are the only blades I will buy for the only razor I will buy, The Quatro.  No irritation and works great!  It is worth the extra dollars.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with my wife always stealing my razor and using it on her legs and other areas and then putting it back.  Severe tire damage ensues.  I thought I&#x27;d get her back by using her girl razor.  WRONG WRONG WRONG!!!  ABORT ABORT ABORT!!!  Never use your wife&#x27;s razor, especially if she is just this side of sasquatch.  She must eat up five of these things per shower!!!  You can get the bleeding under control with the help of a trauma unit, though.  That&#x27;s the good news.</li>
            <li> I finally changed the first cartridge after what seemed like weeks after ordering the initial razor. These truly last&lt;br /&gt;a long time and they have conditioning strips and four blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reading magazines in the tub alerts me to all the personal care products I&#x27;d love to try. This particular razor was featured with a few other razors and sounded like the ultimate razor for women. Well, it honestly is superior to anything I&#x27;ve tried so far and it is the first four-blade razor to touch my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, you really can skip a day here and there due to the supremely close shave. The smooth lime moisture strip helps the blades to slide gracefully over your most delicate skin and there are four tiny strips of wire over the blades that create a protective environment. The artistically designed fuchsia rubber grip on the metal handle (the weight is still light, but heavy enough to make it more stable) encourages precise control and it doesn&#x27;t slip out of your hand. The shower hanger is a true bonus and attaches easily to the shower wall with a suction cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you order the razor there is one razor, one shower hanger and an extra blade. The shower hanger is great for keeping&lt;br /&gt;the razor out of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results: Smoother legs than ever before! Lasts at least two days. No cuts or razor irritation. No scraping feeling&lt;br /&gt;across your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comfort: Superior comfort while shaving. Slides over knees with ease and never irritates sensitive skin. This razor glides across your skin like silk on satin and truly delivers on its high performance guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A 100 Star Product. When you can shave and not cut&lt;br /&gt;your legs, it is a big deal! The hassle of cutting yourself&lt;br /&gt;is just annoying unless you enjoy watching your blood mingle&lt;br /&gt;with bath water in an artistic swirl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the additional comfort features is the aloe and vitamin E enriched strip at the top  and base. This prevents that&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;scratchy\\&quot; feeling while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definately the most luxurious razor for women I&#x27;ve tried. Also saves time because you don&#x27;t have to change the cartridges as often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca ReviewI&#x27;ve tried. Also saves time because you don&#x27;t have to change the cartridges as often.     ~The Rebecca Review</li>
            <li> I really love this razor because it&#x27;s very easy to use and doesn&#x27;t cut of nick you. It just glides on your skin and can be used multiple times.</li>
            <li> I hate how expensive razor blades are. I like this brand and type but holy crap they cost a lot of money. Cheaper at Sam&#x27;s Club if you want to pay for a membership... so maybe not cheaper in the end... but either way this is a good product but shop around for price!</li>
            <li> I used to use my husbands razor with the 4 blades. I love the schick quattro that is made for women and has four blades. Amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save definitely gives me the best price.</li>
            <li> I have always used disposable razors, but no more!  I love how close the shave is with these.  Love them.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite razors and the price is right for the subscribe and save offer by amazon. The guards on the blades help protect from nicks and scrapes. The blades stay sharp through weeks of shaving.</li>
            <li> I am brand loyal when it comes to razors and I was happy to find these at a cheaper price than my local Target.</li>
            <li> I had grown up using the Gillette two-blade razor for years.  Then one day I tried my then-boyfriend&#x27;s Quattro, and I&#x27;ve never looked back.  The extra blades really eliminates a lot of razor burn, though I use oil for shaving my legs because I have very sensitive skin.  The blades last a long time, since we all know no one changes them once a week, or even once a month, as recommended.  These are wonderful.</li>
            <li> Smooth shave, but it seems to start pulling quickly.  I have to change the blades almost every time I shave my legs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Schick Quattro razor for years, and find it performs very well.  The refill cartridges are expensive but less so here on Amazon and they can be purchased through Subscribe and Save for a discounted price and I don&#x27;t have to worry about running out.  Great performing razor cartridges.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and these are the best razor blades for my skin. The Venus sensitive skin razor blades seem thinner and I get way more cuts with those. I get a close shave with these with minimal to no cuts.</li>
            <li> As far as razors go, these are the only ones that have ever not given me razor rash.  That said, they are expensive.  Why oh why can&#x27;t i be brave enough to let it all grow out?  :)~</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for a while and although the cartridges are a little pricey, it is worth every penny you spend on them! I change my cartridges about once a week in order to prevent rusting and even take this with me when I travel.</li>
            <li> I started shaving about a year ago, before for about 5 years i switched off from nair to veet, which i got sick of! since then i  havr used the venus divine, breeze, embrace and gilette fusion. I never was completely satisfied with them. then my friend told me to try this razor and i fell in love with it! it is such a close shave and the smootness lasts for 2 or more days. I shave every four says, and  on that fourth day it looks like i shaved 2 days ago!i haven&#x27;t cut my self at all (knock on wood) and have enjoyed shaving more rather than thinking of it as sn annoying chore. The smoothness really suprised me considering how ihave extremely course hair *ugggghh  this razor is amazing, totally worth the price!!!</li>
            <li> the schick quattro is such a popular razor (probably because it&#x27;s cheaper than many of the alternatives) that i can never find the refill cartridges in my local stores, and when i do they&#x27;re more expensive. amazon&#x27;s the best place to get them. good reliable razor, blades last a decent amount of time. not much more to be said -- it does its job.</li>
            <li> This is a really good and cost effective way to get replacement blades for Women&#x27;s Shick Quattro razor.  The razor does a really good job.</li>
            <li> Good price. Work just fine.</li>
            <li> Rarely knicks.  Always smooth.  Lasts awhile.</li>
            <li> I love these razors, nothing works as well for me.  I think they are the best for shaving and i would suggest for anyone looking for a new option</li>
            <li> I bought this razor and blades because I couldn&#x27;t find my usual (and loved) Venus Embrace blades and had heard good things about these blades so figured hey, couldn&#x27;t hurt to try, well it didn&#x27;t hurt, but these blades give my legs a lousy shave, I had to go over my legs a good 3 times and I STILL had stubble because of the stupid wire strips across the blades, yes I know they&#x27;re there to prevent razor cuts. Good  news I didn&#x27;t cut myself and I didn&#x27;t have razor burn after all that hassle. They did do a good job on my arm pits too. The blades do have a pretty long lifespan too, which is another plus for the price.&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself, I like the control and the way the razor head moves better then my Venus, it&#x27;s much smaller and more flexible, but that doesn&#x27;t help any if the blades themself suck, which they do.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely not worth it.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite razors on the market. It stays sharp for considerably longer than the cheapo razors. It provides a smooth shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li> Barely lasted 2 shaves... Blades weren&#x27;t sharp at all. Was seriously disappointed in these.</li>
            <li> I feel like the glades don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I use these every few days, and I love them. i have been using these razors for years, and I will continue to use them. They get the job done, they stay sharp, and they don&#x27;t leave me with nicks.</li>
            <li> This product goes with my fancy razor, I really like it a lot.  It is easy to replace and works well.</li>
            <li> Love the quattro.  My husband and I both use this brand and type</li>
            <li> I may have only given them three stars but I do not find myself buying any other brand as these blades do take all my facial hair off, and believe me I have plenty. My brunette hair may be gray on my head, but not on my face. There it is as black as my head hair was when I was younger. It seemed no matter how new the blade was, it would still leave a visible stubble behind, especially where the jowl lines are on each side of my chin. This brand, as long as the blade is fairly new, does not leave anything behind but smooth skin. The price is a bit much for a blade I can only use three or four times, but at least while I am using it, it does a very good job.</li>
            <li> Pretty sweet. Wife uses this. Nice leg skin. Plus, I left my razor in my gym bag so used this on my man face and it did a decent job for a Friday shave. Quattragulations?</li>
            <li> Priced these all around grocery and drug stores during other shopping and this price ($18) was far better for more.  (I don&#x27;t have a Costco membership so I can&#x27;t compare that).  Exactly as expected and they work well.  I don&#x27;t love the razor itself as much as the one I was replacing (an old two blade from 15 years ago that I had purchased a ton of blades for) but everyone loves a fresh blade.</li>
            <li> These are some of my favorite razor heads. Last longer than the cheaper ones and aren&#x27;t super expensive. Will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> I ordered these in hopes to save a bit of money, I use Venus razors which can get pretty expensive. These razors just don&#x27;t do it for me. I have to go over an area several times, my showers are literally doubled in time and all that extra time is spent shaving. It preforms very poorly on areas that aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; like your upper thighs. Overall, I just really hate these razors. Sticking to my Venus.</li>
            <li> These work great...just wish refills weren&#x27;t so darn expensive! I ordered a years supply, though and like that I won&#x27;t have to worry about ordering for a while.</li>
            <li> Great product just a little expensive though</li>
            <li> Been using these for years, much better than disposable razors!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t fit all Schick brand handles. Had to buy a different razor than the one I had so I could use them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a razor, and it works.  Not sure it is any better than any other razor; and I am really not sure that 4 blades are better than one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to spend $25+ for a pack of razor heads... but when we found this razor we knew it would be worth it.  Then I found the refills on Amazon of about $18 for 8 of them!  SCORE!  Smooth shave and excellent price. Thanks!</li>
            <li> All I ever use...work great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these forever and I have never found a better brand at a better price. Love them and was glade to find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand for years on my fine hair (thighs), my medium hair (legs, pits) and coarse hair (bikini line, hubs&#x27; face).  It is important that one realizes that the cartridges need to be replaced more frequently when used on coarse hair - we replace almost after one full use (his face then my bikini line and toss it).  This item being available via subscribe and save makes it very competitively priced and I never have to remember once we&#x27;ve run out (I forget little inconsequential items with great frequency).</li>
            <li> I purchased the Quattro Razor and this package of 8 refill cartridges.  I didn&#x27;t get a close shave on my legs - after 1 day, I could feel the stubble. Perhaps these are \\&quot;seconds\\&quot; ???? A complete waste of time and money.  I have since switched to Gillette Venus - very satisfied with my choice.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding refills around my neck of the woods and when I do, they&#x27;re expensive.  Now I can get more for less money and I don&#x27;t have to leave the house!</li>
            <li> Same item, cheaper price than sold in my local store. And considering that I get major razor burn if my razor gets even SLIGHTLY dull, I go through a LOT of razor blades, so cheaper is a VERY GOOD THING.</li>
            <li> What can you say about razor blades?  They work!</li>
            <li> Original packaging.  Does the job.  Though it is a little bit cheaper than the stores, I still think it&#x27;s quite expensive for shaving cartridges :P</li>
            <li> Great product deserves more than 5 stars. This is the only brand of razor I like. nothing else compares to the quality. Would recommend this to everyone</li>
            <li> Love the Schick Quatro! They last so long, one cartridge lasts about two weeks! Very smooth, no razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;They almost never have coupons available, so I&#x27;m happy to be able to get them for less on amazon. :)</li>
            <li> exactly what i was expecting, thanks!</li>
            <li> Great price &amp; product</li>
            <li> I use to say that I would never shop on line when it became all the rage,  but trust me the less time I can spend running around on weekends burning up my time and gas, shopping on Amazon for these is the bee&#x27;s knees.  No more Wal-Mart for me when I can have them and other items delivered to my door.  Schick makes excellent shaving products and I would not buy any other brand.</li>
            <li> These are much better than the basic ones. Very happy with how moisturizing these are.</li>
            <li> I ordered the blades for my wife as replacement and she said that they are some of the best blade that you get if you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Way too expensive and make me want to try the non titanium next time.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s prices for razor blades almost always beats target or walmart.  The product is the same, but the price is much nicer!</li>
            <li> They do the job and works good!</li>
            <li> These are indeed refill cartridges!  I can&#x27;t say much more about them.  They work, I guess?  I like the moisturizing bars, they seem to prevent razor burn pretty well.</li>
            <li> These blades cut my hair and compared with other blades are affordable which is what we needed, and the regular is in stock</li>
            <li> These razors shave great. My legs feel so good after I shave.</li>
            <li> These really don&#x27;t seem to be the same heads that came with my razor. They are smaller and took me forever to shave--they just weren&#x27;t as sharp or something.</li>
            <li> Love these razors! Such a smooth shave. I have to admit that I would use men&#x27;s razors to get a very close shave on my legs but these razors do as good of a job and at least it looks girly hanging in my shower.</li>
            <li> I used to use Gillette razors/razor blades, but about 3-4 years ago, I started getting razor burn every time I shaved, no matter how often I changed the blades or what kind of &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; I used to shave with -- gel, soap, water, lotion, you name it, I tried it! Frustrated by my constant razor burn (which is VERY evident on my extremely pale skin), I polled my friends. Several of them had switched to the Schick Quattro for women due to similar issues.&lt;br /&gt;Once I tried the Schick Quattro, I threw out all my old razors and razor blades. I&#x27;ve not looked back once! I find that changing my blades out every 3-5 weeks (depending on how often I&#x27;ve had to shave) keeps me razor burn free.</li>
            <li> I used to have a woman&#x27;s schick quattro razor. I can tell you that it is absolutely a piece of junk! It dulls four times faster than a man&#x27;s razor of the same model. If you enjoy working harder for more money to buy junky things and to fill our land fills this is for you. I recomend just learning to hoan and get a good straight razor . It will last literally 100 years and take up less land fill space when it finally wears out.</li>
            <li> I bought these razor refills because I have the Schick Trimstyle (a great trimmer!) and I like the idea of having a razor and trimmer in one. However, the razor doesn&#x27;t give a close shave on my legs. I have to go over the same area again and again, and it still doesn&#x27;t feel smooth! This means it takes me a lot longer to shave. I don&#x27;t use shaving cream, but I get a great shave with the Venus Embrace without shaving cream, and in a lot less time. The Schick Quattro razor is very non-irritating and I never cut myself, and it does seem slightly better than the Venus Embrace on underarms in terms of irritation and getting stray hairs, but that does not make up for the dismal job it does on my legs. I really wanted to like this razor since Venus Embrace is twice the price and I have to keep a separate razor and trimmer, but it just doesn&#x27;t work well enough. I wish I could exchange this product for Venus Embrace refills.</li>
            <li> I used the Women Quattro to shave my (blank) area and I cut myself to pieces.  I ended up buying a (blank) load of bandages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00030IN0G Schick Quattro Midnight Razor, 1 Razor]]</li>
            <li> I do like the Schick razor it does a great job. has a good weight to it and you have good choices for blades. I have found that my favorite blade is the men&#x27;s with 5 blades and I think aloe ? it&#x27;s cheaper than the women&#x27;s blade, go figure, and does a better job. I typically have three different types of razors, for different areas this blade can do it all.</li>
            <li> Great price and great razors.  These things excel a hair removal, much better than other things like tweezers or tape.</li>
            <li> happy with my purchase. I use this regularly for many years. first time buying from the this vendor and i received it with no problem. Just started using the product . Ironically it had a Safeway sticker on it. I saved a ton of money ordering from this vendor.</li>
            <li> I saw several comments stating that the blades were dull out of the package, or dulled faster than store-bought. I can&#x27;t say I disagree entirely, but it hasn&#x27;t been a huge issue like I thought it might be. I did have to throw one cartridge out after using it less than a week, but when these cost $16 for a pack of 4 in drug stores, this is still a better deal.&lt;br /&gt;I also wouldn&#x27;t give these the highest praise in the world, because I still get razor burn if I shave without having warmed up my skin considerably (I have very sensitive skin). On a recent beach trip, shaving daily caused me to have several bright red bumps, which isn&#x27;t unusual for me and these blades, but it also doesn&#x27;t mean these are sooooo great they won&#x27;t give you bumps ever.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve bought these before, I imagine your experience will be about the same, maybe a tad less impressive. *shrug*</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for a good price on these blades.  I&#x27;ve tried generic, but they just never measure up to these.  I will likely do the subscribe and save option if my local coupons can&#x27;t beat this price.</li>
            <li> I like to have these extras on hand, and this price is the best I&#x27;ve found. The blades themselves are really quite nice, they moisturize a bit and never cut.</li>
            <li> Smooth clean shaved. Last a long time. Great deal compared to your big box store. Buy a few.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> prime deal well worth it</li>
            <li> These work great! The last me several shaves without causing any problems, although the ultra-smooth layers wear out very quickly. But even still, I just use soap while shaving and I haven&#x27;t had any issues, so it glides pretty well. If you use something thicker, like actual shaving cream, you definitely won&#x27;t have any problems.</li>
            <li> I used to buy these at the store. So, before I bought them, I knew these were the ones I preferred. The reason I bought these online is because the last three times I tried to buy them at the store, no one had a key to unlock the display case and I left the store without refills for my razor.  So I decided to buy them from Amazon, after repeated failures at bringing some home from our local Smith&#x27;s. To be honest, I will be buying them here from now on. No hassle, no worries about if someone can open the darn case, and even better, they are shipped right to my house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is well worth it to buy online if you have problems like I do with the local stores locking them up and no one ever seems to have a way to get you what you need.</li>
            <li> Some razors give me bad razor burn. This one does not give me bad razor burn at all. Sometimes I get nicked every once in while, but it is not bad.I would definitely recommend for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My favorite razors on the market. One lasts for several weeks. I get very close shave. I would definitely recommend for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Just opened this product and found that it only had 4 cartridges inside! Didn&#x27;t look like it had been opened either.</li>
            <li> These are great for my sensitive skin. I like them a lot more than the Venus razors. Even though they are a little more expensive,</li>
            <li> These razors are great. I have used them for a few years now and I have not looked back on any other brands. I like that they have the safety wires so you cannot possibly cut yourself, with that being said I have gotten nicked because the blade was dull. I like the close shave it gives me, since I have fine hair I have to go over and over and over the same place to get the little/short hairs but this one is great with the first swipe!</li>
            <li> Great for shaving bikini area, and a great price. It&#x27;s lame there is a required amount of words for reviews.</li>
            <li> Just what you&#x27;d expect, getting harder to find at stores in my area</li>
            <li> Wife a Daughter liked but they still Grab my old Schick Quattro</li>
            <li> Gets as close to the skin as possible without cutting yourself!!! It glides down your legs so nicely for such a good smooth leg shave!!</li>
            <li> This brand works well, and rarely causes cuts or nicks in the skin. The quatro or four blades ideas is easier to manage and less likely to cause injuries.</li>
            <li> Definitely not was I was expecting. It came with two razor handles when I thought that it was only going to come with refil cartridges. While I don&#x27;t want to complain because I did get the refill cartridges that I wanted, it should have been better written.</li>
            <li> I like it well enough.  This is pretty much all I&#x27;m willing to shell out for razor replacements, so you know.  A little rough, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> The razors leave a clean shave on my skin.  I have been using this product a many years, and would continue to use it for many more years to come.</li>
            <li> Every couple of months my wife tells me to order more of these for her, and I do. She loves them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate the price of these things, but I have no quibbles with the results.</li>
            <li> Great razor heads - they do a great job and leave my skin soft after. I would recommend these and the price was fair.</li>
            <li> Trying to be more green, I do my best not to buy disposal items.  As such, I have a pink, nondisposable Schick Quattro razor that requires refill cartridges.  I am thrilled with Amazon&#x27;s offered price and the convenient shipping.  Amazon remains my go-to, favorite, virtual store.</li>
            <li> I used the Women Quattro to shave my (blank) area and I cut myself to pieces. I ended up buying a (blank) load of bandages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Schick Quattro Midnight Razor, 1 Razor</li>
            <li> Horrible! The razors that came from the original package lasted a really long time and were super sharp. These can cut but not very well. It took several tries and two days for me to get a clean shave. I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t buy two packs to stock up!</li>
            <li> This is only razor I will use. Received as promised, packaging were perfect, and the price was cheaper than many venues I checked out.</li>
            <li> What is there to say?  It is what it is.  Did get a great price.</li>
            <li> doing the job I thought it would!</li>
            <li> Great price! Same packaging as in the store.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite women&#x27;s razor.  I have tried many kinds (like most women), but I always come back to the Schick Quattro.  I find they glide over my skin much easier and I have very few nicks and cuts.  These leave my legs silky smooth and last for quite awhile.</li>
            <li> Still making my way through this 8-pack. Great value for the money and the packaging is very nice too--it&#x27;s easy to grab new razors and store them in your shower.</li>
            <li> I switched from a Gillette Venus to the Schick Quattro, and much prefer the Quattro.  It had been at least a year since I&#x27;d made the switch, when I ran out of blades for my Quattro.  I still had 1 new blade left for my Venus, so I decided to go ahead and use.  WOW, what a difference.  The NEW Venus blade was less comfortable to use than my last Quattro blade was when I decided I needed to replace it.  I don&#x27;t know if a razor blade can go bad when sitting in a sealed package, but based on my experience when I initially made the switch, and then the more recent experience trying my Venus again - I&#x27;m sticking with the Quattro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Quattro delivers a nice close shave and never gives me razor burn.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite blades. I cut myself my less frequently than with the Venus blades. I love how smooth my legs feel too.</li>
            <li> Other places, not so much. Not the closest shave in the bikini area &amp; underarms...I&#x27;m still looking for a good alternative.</li>
            <li> The razors are good, but I only get one use out of shaving my legs. I can shave my arm pits many times, but once I use the razor for my legs it is time for a new one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Quattro razor for years. The blades are easy to remove from the razor and easy to put the new blade in. Gives me a smooth shave. Just wish they were less expensive. I always purchase from Amazon and appreciate the free shipping.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. These are suppose to be exactly the same as what is sold in stores however these do not seem to be as sharp. They do not last long at all, seem dull very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Will not order again</li>
            <li> I was excited to find these on Subscribe and Save. I have been using this razor for years and it works well and I have no desire to change. Finding these on Subscribe and Save just means I won&#x27;t have to worry about running out.</li>
            <li> Fast service. Great price.</li>
            <li> Great shave. I have never had a problem with Schick razor&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Love my schick quattro. Been buying refills for years. My husband used the men&#x27;s version as well and the men&#x27;s razor refills fit the women&#x27;s too.</li>
            <li> Really good price, same blades as always</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had to use the refills.  I have been using the blade that came with the razor and will probably not have to refill for another week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the razer that works with these cartridges for about a year and a half and love them. Each cartridge lasts a long time and works well. No nicks and little shave bumps.</li>
            <li> Decent price for the razors.</li>
