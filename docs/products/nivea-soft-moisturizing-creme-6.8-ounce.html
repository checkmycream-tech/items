            <li>just really love this cream.</li>
            <li>this works well as most nivea products do.</li>
            <li>Nivea is a respectable brand</li>
            <li>One of my favorite moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>I just love this cream.</li>
            <li>I love this cream</li>
            <li>In fact, I think it made the skin more</li>
            <li>NIVEA has a product specifically marketed for shaving that I haven&#x27;t tried but the cost is greater.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>And I love the size of the containers.</li>
            <li>Just love it.</li>
            <li>Love this cream.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>So I have been searching and using many creams and this one is the one that I am now sure I will use here on out for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li>I used many products before this and they seemed to help.  </li>
            <li>Every time I travel I buy more.  </li>
            <li>This lotion makes my skin feel baby smooth!</li>
            <li>It hydrates your skin, smells nice and is a light cream.  </li>
            <li>used before many times</li>
            <li>I also enjoy massaging it into the soles and heels of my feet for a nice sandal-attractive appeal.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>This is my all-time favorite hand/body/skin lotion.</li>
            <li>I love this version of Nivea.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I really recommend this product if you want a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I love the texture and smell.</li>
            <li>Nivea is definitely the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Repurchasing! :)</li>
            <li>I love the feel of the product, but would be better if it&#x27;s packaged in a tube form.</li>
            <li>Perfect cream for entire body.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for this cream everywhere and never had any luck til I found it here for a better price as well.</li>
            <li>I wish Nivea would put this creme in a pump-style container for easier use, but I&#x27;ll take what I can get :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light non-greasy lotion---very nice.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>Let some of skin breathe the air to it feel,  I don&#x27;t like the oily feel of many lotions and</li>
            <li>this one needs a better container.</li>
            <li>Like a pump dispenser for more easier application for sanitary reasons.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Love this Nivea cream.</li>
            <li>and i break out, decided to try it since one of the main ingredients (JoJoba Oil) is suppose to be great for helping with acne.</li>
            <li>It has to smell pretty good &amp; be gender neutral</li>
            <li>Everything from the way it glides on without leaving a residue,to the way it soothes dry skin is just perfect.</li>
            <li>The best moisturizer for really dry skin that I have ever found!</li>
            <li>Very good product using numerous times a day.</li>
            <li>my legs were so smooth i couldn&#x27;t stop touching them when i used this, i just couldn&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion I have used it for 10 years fantastic</li>
            <li>Light refreshing and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The soft-whipped cream glides on smoothly and is perfect for the normal-to-dry complexion and dry body skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried everything from top designer brands that cost  a fortune,to supermarkets own brand moisturisers.personally speaking,having recently purchased Nivea soft,I have found it to be the best moisturiser by far.</li>
            <li>It absorbs easily and it&#x27;s non greasy</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to do that in these practical tubs.</li>
            <li>The container is easy to use</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super cheap and easy to get anywhere, i recommend trying it out!</li>
            <li>Nivea cream is very soothing and good after a clean shave.</li>
            <li>Whole family love this!</li>
            <li>I love the clean feeling after application, the scent is light and clean and in no way overpowering.  </li>
            <li>It soaks in to your skin faster than any lotion I&#x27;ve ever used and makes your hands, face, legs, whatever it is, instantly smooth.</li>
            <li>I primarily use this during summer.  </li>
            <li>this lotion is so smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>The scent is so light that any remaining is not noticed.</li>
            <li>I recommend this creme for people who enjoy lotions which are not oily or overly scented.</li>
            <li>This creme is light and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>I liked using this product ever since I found out that it makes one&#x27;s skin soft and refreshing.</li>
            <li>Thanks Nivea!!!</li>
            <li>we use it regularly and love it!!</li>
            <li>Thanks, as usual, to Amazon, for carrying this great product at a great price.  </li>
            <li>This is not as oily as the eucerin&#x27;s redness relief cream or the original nivea cream.  </li>
            <li>Great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for dry skin.</li>
            <li>I get a great shave, but the process can dry the face.  </li>
            <li>Thus, I turned to this fabulous product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream absorbs quickly into the skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have a \\&quot;different\\&quot; smell to it - I don&#x27;t find it as offensive as others do, but it definitely isn&#x27;t an overly pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>It really leaves the skin very smooth, moisturized.</li>
            <li>I recommend this creme to anyone who&#x27;s just looking for a good moisturizer and especially for those who suffer from acne.</li>
            <li>It has a nice soft scent that allows you to apply your perfume over it without overpowering that scent.</li>
            <li>Nice soft fragrance too...</li>
            <li>We love it so much I have it on recurring delivery through Amazon.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about this product.  </li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>It seals in moisture and does a good job of it without having to constantly reapply.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good about this.</li>
            <li>Love, love this, so soft and creamy and goes as smooth and feels very refreshinging.</li>
            <li>This one came along and I gave it a try: just what I was hoping for, wonderfully soft, absorbed quickly and so very easy to smooth out on the skin.</li>
            <li>It absorbs so quickly and it is not sticky.  </li>
            <li>Mild scent, not greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>and it arrived quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li>Like others have said, it moisturizes without leaving any film on the skin and absorbs quickly but continues to hydrate all day.</li>
            <li>My favorite new moisturizing creme</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I have used the cream daily after showering and am extremely pleased with the results!</li>
            <li>I LOVE Nivea Soft!</li>
            <li>But a little goes a great distance.  </li>
            <li>it works great for my kid whose skin reacts to any other product!!</li>
            <li>This is a great cream, not too heavy, not greasy or sticky, absorbs well.  </li>
            <li>very good,and so cheap suggest to buy,everyday moisture,especially winter  and spring</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth, not sticky, not greasy, and dries fast.</li>
            <li>I prefer the smell of the \\&quot;white\\&quot; Nivea over the \\&quot;blue\\&quot; Nivea, though the blue one is nice too.  </li>
            <li>I use it all over after showering each morning, and my skin stays soft and smooth all day!</li>
            <li>However, I was pleasantly surprised and decided to buy more.</li>
            <li>I really like this crime, it has a nice comforting smell and leaves my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>really good especially if u dont want the really greasy nivea</li>
            <li>I started using Nivea Soft and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so gentle yet effective that I can even use it on my face without worrying about a breakout as I have sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really worth the price</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line - decent moisture but nothing special, unique smell, and not for acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>I have used nivea off and on for my whole life, my mother pretty much raised me on nivea :)</li>
            <li>The Nivea Refreshingly Soft Creme absorbs very quickly as well, which is a plus.</li>
            <li>Anyway, this product is not heavy and dries very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>It really takes care of dry skin and is odor free which I love.  </li>
            <li>I bought this creme about a week ago and the first day I used it</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been getting a lot better ever since I&#x27;ve been using it, and my acne scars have definitely reduced.</li>
            <li>First is the smell.  </li>
            <li>My skin has improved so much and is way softer!</li>
            <li>I wish my skin felt refreshed as well as soft and smooth, but it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>better offer looking for this at a local drugstore to see if it works for you.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Nivea!</li>
            <li>leaves my face smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Is not greasy and leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>When I put it on, it feels like I have on too much at first</li>
            <li>This product can also be used on your arms and legs after a hot bath.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>I went back and bought three more.  </li>
            <li>Bought it first in Europe.</li>
            <li>The four-pack makes it VERY affordable and worth having it delivered, rather than going to the drug store for it.</li>
            <li>My skin felt so smooth and soft and not greasy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for several years and have used up industrial sized tubs of it too many times to count.</li>
            <li>i love this creme it the only moisturizer that work for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not nearly as sticky, smells better, and does a better job overall.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is rich and thik and keeps my soft, not greasy.</li>
            <li>I love this Nivea product so much I use it under my facial color-correcting lotion.</li>
            <li>In UK, symptoms ranged from a rash of bright red tiny bumps to fluid filled lumps on the skin, blisters, itchy eyes and even a severely swollen face.</li>
            <li>Love to keep one at my desk, the soap at work seems to dry out my hands</li>
            <li>I love Nivea creme as I&#x27;ve moderately dry skin</li>
            <li>My skin is now super soft.</li>
            <li>Scrambling to find a good replacement, this was the only product that looked decent enough to work.  </li>
            <li>Skin experts in the UK and around the world have picked up a large number of allergic reactions they believe are caused by MI chemical.</li>
            <li>always nice and soft for a very long time.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and this is the only cream that doesnt give me pimples or make my face peel more.</li>
            <li>I use this for my face in the morning after my day time facial routine before putting on sunblock and I use it at night on my stretchmarks, I haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference</li>
            <li>My skin also feels a lot softer than ever and looks much healthier.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care how much they say they \\&quot;heal even the driest skin\\&quot; they.</li>
            <li>It works very well to prevent razor burn.  </li>
            <li>Nothing really worked, this cream did the job</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light enough that my skin does not feel greasy.  </li>
            <li>I do not smell much of a scent which I like</li>
            <li>and it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this.</li>
            <li>It absorbs much faster and is a lighter weight cream.</li>
            <li>Really like this product--I use it on my face, legs and arms.</li>
            <li>The Nivea soaks in well and tends to stay better than other moisturizing creams I have tried.</li>
            <li>My hands look pretty good after a tough winter.</li>
            <li>It is very light with a non-greasy feel and a slight fragrance.</li>
            <li>I send this to my Mom in India and she loves it because its dry out quick and its not sticky!</li>
            <li>I first tried this project on a trip to a dry local and the drugstore I stopped at didn&#x27;t have many options.</li>
            <li>If you like fresh, clean and non greasy daily moisturizer this one is definitely it.</li>
            <li>but I find it much less greasy than most of them.</li>
            <li>B000AMBF5W Nivea Soft Refreshingly Soft Moisturizing Creme with Jojoba Oil &amp; Vitamin E, 6.8 Ounces]](in the white tubs) is good for mild-to-moderately dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Tried many different options before settling on this and has worked like charm for several years now.</li>
            <li>Pack of 4 decent sized Nivea cream.</li>

            <li>Finally, my skin is super soft!  </li>
            <li>However, a savings in gas and shopping and worth the convenience of a multiple pack to ensure you don&#x27;t run out!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Packaging: The multi-pack seems to normally come in a 3-pack.</li>
            <li>This Nivea Soft Moisturizing Cream really makes my skin feel brand new.  </li>
            <li>Not an overly tremendously savings; a minor one.</li>

            <li>If you&#x27;re wondering about the difference between the two, the Nivea creme is much much thicker and much better suited for severely dry (i.e. as dry as it can get before you start need a prescription), whereas the Nivea Refreshingly Soft Moisturizing Creme [[ASIN:</li>

            <li>I am an avid user of the blue nivea creme.</li>
            <li>Soft creme works wonders!</li>
            <li>When applied several times during the day and at bedtime, it prevents my cuticles from becoming dry and hands soft.  </li>
            <li>I got the pair for four creams and two of them came with half open top seal.</li>
            <li>I imagine one container should last about a month, a little more depending</li>
            <li>Using this product is much better than the old fashioned hard nivea cream.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft and evens out my complexion.</li>

            <li>The one in the Dark Blue jar is a bit thick but is good for softening elbows and heels.</li>
            <li>(I just used the word \\&quot;copious\\&quot;, which must mean I&#x27;m very smart or very immature).  </li>

            <li>Unfortunately, it seems the product is becoming less available in my community.</li>
            <li>I  live at altitude where moisture does not stay with us long.  </li>

            <li>/&gt;The scent is light and gender-neutral, so it usually wears off within 20-30 minutes and doesn&#x27;t interfere with cologne or other fragrances.</li>
            <li>I have used Nivea for a long long time and with very good results but always found it to be a bit too thick, difficult to spread.</li>

            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> Let some of skin breathe the air to it feel,  I don&#x27;t like the oily feel of many lotions and</li>
            <li> this one needs a better container.</li>
            <li> Like a pump dispenser for more easier application for sanitary reasons.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Love this Nivea cream.</li>

            <li> This is not as oily as the eucerin&#x27;s redness relief cream or the original nivea cream.  </li>
            <li> Great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I get a great shave, but the process can dry the face.  </li>
            <li> Thus, I turned to this fabulous product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream absorbs quickly into the skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a \\&quot;different\\&quot; smell to it - I don&#x27;t find it as offensive as others do, but it definitely isn&#x27;t an overly pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> It really leaves the skin very smooth, moisturized.</li>
            <li> I recommend this creme to anyone who&#x27;s just looking for a good moisturizer and especially for those who suffer from acne.</li>
            <li> It has a nice soft scent that allows you to apply your perfume over it without overpowering that scent.</li>
            <li> Nice soft fragrance too...</li>
            <li> We love it so much I have it on recurring delivery through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this product.  </li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> It seals in moisture and does a good job of it without having to constantly reapply.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good about this.</li>
            <li> Love, love this, so soft and creamy and goes as smooth and feels very refreshinging.</li>
            <li> This one came along and I gave it a try: just what I was hoping for, wonderfully soft, absorbed quickly and so very easy to smooth out on the skin.</li>
            <li> It absorbs so quickly and it is not sticky.  </li>
            <li> Mild scent, not greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> and it arrived quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li> Like others have said, it moisturizes without leaving any film on the skin and absorbs quickly but continues to hydrate all day.</li>
            <li> My favorite new moisturizing creme</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I have used the cream daily after showering and am extremely pleased with the results!</li>
            <li> I LOVE Nivea Soft!</li>
            <li> But a little goes a great distance.  </li>
            <li> it works great for my kid whose skin reacts to any other product!!</li>
            <li> This is a great cream, not too heavy, not greasy or sticky, absorbs well.  </li>
            <li> very good,and so cheap suggest to buy,everyday moisture,especially winter  and spring</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth, not sticky, not greasy, and dries fast.</li>
            <li> I prefer the smell of the \\&quot;white\\&quot; Nivea over the \\&quot;blue\\&quot; Nivea, though the blue one is nice too.  </li>
            <li> I use it all over after showering each morning, and my skin stays soft and smooth all day!</li>
            <li> However, I was pleasantly surprised and decided to buy more.</li>
            <li> I really like this crime, it has a nice comforting smell and leaves my skin soft.  </li>
            <li> really good especially if u dont want the really greasy nivea</li>
            <li> I started using Nivea Soft and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so gentle yet effective that I can even use it on my face without worrying about a breakout as I have sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really worth the price</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line - decent moisture but nothing special, unique smell, and not for acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> I have used nivea off and on for my whole life, my mother pretty much raised me on nivea :)</li>
            <li> The Nivea Refreshingly Soft Creme absorbs very quickly as well, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> Anyway, this product is not heavy and dries very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Very reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> It really takes care of dry skin and is odor free which I love.  </li>
            <li> I bought this creme about a week ago and the first day I used it</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been getting a lot better ever since I&#x27;ve been using it, and my acne scars have definitely reduced.</li>
            <li> First is the smell.  </li>
            <li> My skin has improved so much and is way softer!</li>
            <li> I wish my skin felt refreshed as well as soft and smooth, but it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> better offer looking for this at a local drugstore to see if it works for you.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Nivea!</li>
            <li> leaves my face smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Is not greasy and leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> When I put it on, it feels like I have on too much at first</li>
            <li> This product can also be used on your arms and legs after a hot bath.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> I went back and bought three more.  </li>
            <li> Bought it first in Europe.</li>
            <li> The four-pack makes it VERY affordable and worth having it delivered, rather than going to the drug store for it.</li>
            <li> My skin felt so smooth and soft and not greasy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for several years and have used up industrial sized tubs of it too many times to count.</li>
            <li> i love this creme it the only moisturizer that work for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not nearly as sticky, smells better, and does a better job overall.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is rich and thik and keeps my soft, not greasy.</li>
            <li> I love this Nivea product so much I use it under my facial color-correcting lotion.</li>
            <li> In UK, symptoms ranged from a rash of bright red tiny bumps to fluid filled lumps on the skin, blisters, itchy eyes and even a severely swollen face.</li>
            <li> Love to keep one at my desk, the soap at work seems to dry out my hands</li>
            <li> I love Nivea creme as I&#x27;ve moderately dry skin</li>
            <li> My skin is now super soft.</li>
            <li> Scrambling to find a good replacement, this was the only product that looked decent enough to work.  </li>
            <li> Skin experts in the UK and around the world have picked up a large number of allergic reactions they believe are caused by MI chemical.</li>
            <li> always nice and soft for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and this is the only cream that doesnt give me pimples or make my face peel more.</li>
            <li> I use this for my face in the morning after my day time facial routine before putting on sunblock and I use it at night on my stretchmarks, I haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference</li>
            <li> My skin also feels a lot softer than ever and looks much healthier.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care how much they say they \\&quot;heal even the driest skin\\&quot; they.</li>
            <li> It works very well to prevent razor burn.  </li>
            <li> Nothing really worked, this cream did the job</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light enough that my skin does not feel greasy.  </li>
            <li> I do not smell much of a scent which I like</li>
            <li> and it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this.</li>
            <li> It absorbs much faster and is a lighter weight cream.</li>
            <li> Really like this product--I use it on my face, legs and arms.</li>
            <li> The Nivea soaks in well and tends to stay better than other moisturizing creams I have tried.</li>
            <li> My hands look pretty good after a tough winter.</li>
            <li> It is very light with a non-greasy feel and a slight fragrance.</li>
            <li> I send this to my Mom in India and she loves it because its dry out quick and its not sticky!</li>
            <li> I first tried this project on a trip to a dry local and the drugstore I stopped at didn&#x27;t have many options.</li>
            <li> If you like fresh, clean and non greasy daily moisturizer this one is definitely it.</li>
            <li> but I find it much less greasy than most of them.</li>
            <li> B000AMBF5W Nivea Soft Refreshingly Soft Moisturizing Creme with Jojoba Oil &amp; Vitamin E, 6.8 Ounces]](in the white tubs) is good for mild-to-moderately dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Tried many different options before settling on this and has worked like charm for several years now.</li>
            <li> Pack of 4 decent sized Nivea cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 31 and people never guess my age at older than 23.</li>
            <li> Has worked really well for my child who has had eczema at a very young age.</li>
            <li> I use it on my body, even my face (which is acne prone and very sensitive) and it has NEVER broken me out.</li>
            <li> use this after a shower and a shave- this stuff really does make your skin soft!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product with no reservations.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The creme makes my skin soft!!</li>
            <li> Finally, my skin is super soft!  </li>
            <li> However, a savings in gas and shopping and worth the convenience of a multiple pack to ensure you don&#x27;t run out!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Packaging: The multi-pack seems to normally come in a 3-pack.</li>
            <li> This Nivea Soft Moisturizing Cream really makes my skin feel brand new.  </li>
            <li> Not an overly tremendously savings; a minor one.</li>
            <li> I love it so much, I&#x27;m going to order a bunch because its hard to find where I live.</li>
            <li> This is a decent moisturizer, but honestly it isn&#x27;t much different than the other top moisturizers on the market.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re wondering about the difference between the two, the Nivea creme is much much thicker and much better suited for severely dry (i.e. as dry as it can get before you start need a prescription), whereas the Nivea Refreshingly Soft Moisturizing Creme [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I used coconut oil on my face thinking maybe it&#x27;d help my super dry</li>
            <li> Soft scent which actually disappears as it is absorbed.</li>
            <li> I hate anything greasy, so I have avoided hand creams, but this cream is so light yet very effective.</li>
            <li> love the smell, and this jar will last quite a while (over 3 month with  moderate daily use).</li>
            <li> I am an avid user of the blue nivea creme.</li>
            <li> Soft creme works wonders!</li>
            <li> When applied several times during the day and at bedtime, it prevents my cuticles from becoming dry and hands soft.  </li>
            <li> I got the pair for four creams and two of them came with half open top seal.</li>
            <li> I imagine one container should last about a month, a little more depending</li>
            <li> Using this product is much better than the old fashioned hard nivea cream.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft and evens out my complexion.</li>
            <li> This creme keeps my skin (not face--body) soft and supple without making me feel like I am drowning in oils that come off on everything.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think my skin has ever been this soft ever.  </li>
            <li> I uses this Nivea Soft under my foundation during the day and as a moisturizer at night.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> I was traveling when I discovered [[ASIN:B001FB5IMI Nivea Soft Refreshingly Soft Moisturizing Creme with Jojoba Oil and Vitamin E,</li>
            <li> 6.8-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 4)]]Nivea Soft.</li>
            <li> I put a dime-sized amount of Nivea Soft on my face immediately after shaving in the morning, and it keeps my face moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin - forget it.</li>
            <li> It goes on nicelly and helps keep your skin soft.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so soft and eliminates flakiness on my face as well as my legs.  </li>
            <li> I shave with an old school safety razor.  </li>
            <li> A few criteria that are important to me when I lotion: 1)</li>
            <li> Soaks in completely.</li>
            <li> soaks in well leaves your skin soft.</li>
            <li> I apply it to my hands and arms before bedtime and wake up to soft moisturized skin, without feeling sticky.</li>
            <li> I use Nivea Soft Refreshingly Soft Moisturizing Creme with Jojoba Oil and Vitamin E on my hands.  </li>
            <li> Most thick and moisturizing creme around.  </li>
            <li> I have super dry skin especially in the winter and this stuff rocks.  </li>
            <li> A real plus since his skin is so dry and he works outside so much.</li>
            <li> : I use this cream every morning and evening on my face - a small dab can take care of the job just fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and delicate with a subtle &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; scent and is refreshingly moisturizing.</li>
            <li> and I love this cream so much I&#x27;m using it instead of expensive face cream.  </li>
            <li> This cream is so soft and smooth, a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It is very soft moisturizing creme, you can use it on your entire body, even the face.</li>
            <li> It keeps skin soft and moisturized and it really does last a long time.</li>
            <li> and I could not find it in any of the major stores.  </li>
            <li> The one in the Dark Blue jar is a bit thick but is good for softening elbows and heels.</li>
            <li> (I just used the word \\&quot;copious\\&quot;, which must mean I&#x27;m very smart or very immature).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple, soft, and comforting.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive facial skin and this product seems to moisturize well without irritation or greasiness.  </li>
            <li> And the container is the perfect shape -- you will never have to awkwardly squeeze the last few bits of lotion out of a bottle or tube again.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it seems the product is becoming less available in my community.</li>
            <li> I  live at altitude where moisture does not stay with us long.  </li>
            <li> After many doctor visits and wrong diagnosis, I was finally advised to use a high quality moisturizing lotion.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that in ONE USE, just ONE, my incurably dry face was instantly soft!</li>
            <li> This creme is great, especially on dry, flaky skin caused by cold weather.</li>
            <li> The incision line is barely visible now several years following surgery.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on other &amp;#34;amazing promises&amp;#34; keep on drinking water, keep your face clean and apply this</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is light and gender-neutral, so it usually wears off within 20-30 minutes and doesn&#x27;t interfere with cologne or other fragrances.</li>
            <li> I have used Nivea for a long long time and with very good results but always found it to be a bit too thick, difficult to spread.</li>
            <li> It is a much better product than the traditional blue-labeled Nivea product that is very thick and harder to liquify, unless you have bone dry skin.</li>
            <li> But here&#x27;s the strange part, while the blue nivea, which is heavier and thicker, never ever broke me out, this one did.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend to anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> For winter use, I do not think it is oily enough for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin is extra dry, so it drinks this in.  </li>
            <li> I have the same problem as most people in a cold climate in the winter with a lack of humidity inside.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a quilter and rough feet to boot, Nivea Soft smooths all the rough spots with no greasy residue.</li>
            <li> The dry has gone, left behind by super \\&quot;soft\\&quot; moisturized skin.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other brands, a lot more expensive ones</li>
            <li> I picked this stuff up at my local walmart one day since my face gets very dry</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been searching for that for a long time in a drugstore brand.</li>
            <li> I am a Nivea customer for long time.</li>
            <li> There is not much oily afterfeel, and my dry skin definitely feels quenched afterwards.</li>
            <li> and I will buy other products from them in the future.</li>
            <li> Since I purchased a 4-pack, it contained the 3-pack (stacked in a plastic mold and shrink-wrapped) and a single other container placed in a simple zip-top bag.</li>
            <li> Relieves winter weather dry skin.</li>
            <li> Pond&#x27;s Dry Skin Cream?</li>
            <li> I had extremely dry cracking skin all over.</li>
            <li> In turn my hands get really dry to the point of the skin splitting.</li>
            <li> I also rub some in my beard as I get dry patches underneath</li>
            <li> skin gets dry.  </li>
            <li> When I bought it from Amazon, they didn&#x27;t offer just a single jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A single container lasts a couple months, so cost is not an issue.  </li>
            <li> Without this creme, my hands look like a logger&#x27;s hands--chapped and DRY!  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> The second issue with the product is that it feels a little greasy when it&#x27;s on my skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It didn&#x27;t make my dry skin any less dry.  </li>
            <li> Soft and delicate, does the job, doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I wish Nivea would make this in a larger size and in a pump bottle!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I cannot get it in a bigger tub!</li>
            <li> I expected no scent.</li>
            <li> This was money well spent</li>
            <li> Methylisothiazolinone (MI or MIT), is routinely added to moisturizers, sun creams, shampoos and wet wipes.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is very soft and subtle, so it doesn&#x27;t compete with your perfume.</li>
            <li> This is not very oily as other lotions could be</li>
            <li> Apply it to my face just like foam only using just a small amount before using a blade to shave.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but after a couple of days I immediately could see the difference.  </li>
            <li> HOWEVER, it is NOT a non-comedogenic product (in other words, it can cause acne).  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like Niveas other lotion versions.</li>
            <li> It has to work, even in the dry cold New England winters and even after daily swim practice where the chlorine wreaks havoc on any skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a mild bland unpleasant scent that lets everyone know are wearing nivea.</li>
            <li> It has a slight baby powdery smell to it which I&#x27;m not a fan of.  </li>
            <li> Less contamination.</li>
            <li> I used to Live in a cold climate (Michigan) and the weather caused my skin to be extremely dry and to develop flakes.  </li>
            <li> I started putting a little bit on my face after i washed it in the morning and then again at night before i go to bed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still a little upset that they make you buy 5 containers.  </li>
            <li> During the summer I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s sometimes a little heavy in my T-zone</li>
            <li> After being released from the burn center he was advised that he would need to apply lotion to the area 10 times a day for a year...and the recommended lotion was...Nivea!!!</li>
            <li> It is not important where any cream is made; any cream with Methylisothiazolinone (MI or MIT) is not an EU cream.</li>
            <li> Does not leave a heavy feel on your hands.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years, and hope they never stop making it.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer I had was greasy and left my skin dry after being out in the cold.</li>
            <li> Very little needs to be used.  </li>
            <li> I usually put this product on 30-60 minutes before I shower.</li>
            <li> I used it on my face, and had small break-outs after just two days.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if they came from Nivea or some duplicate company.</li>
            <li> No matter what expensive product I use, this always is layered on last.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> We have this shipped every 4 months and my wife loves it. I makes her skin feel so &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; just like the name. Great product.</li>
            <li> My husband recently received 2nd and 3rd degree burns. After being released from the burn center he was advised that he would need to apply lotion to the area 10 times a day for a year...and the recommended lotion was...Nivea!!! I must say it is wonderful, and I have even started using it, and what a difference it has made on my aging skin. Thanks Nivea!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually a bigger fan of the Nivea Creme  [[ASIN:B000KFX23M Nivea Creme, 6.8 Oz (192 G), (Pack Of 3)]] (which comes in a blue 6.8 oz jar).  If you&#x27;re wondering about the difference between the two, the Nivea creme is much much thicker and much better suited for severely dry (i.e. as dry as it can get before you start need a prescription), whereas the Nivea Refreshingly Soft Moisturizing Creme [[ASIN:B000AMBF5W Nivea Soft Refreshingly Soft Moisturizing Creme with Jojoba Oil &amp; Vitamin E, 6.8 Ounces]](in the white tubs) is good for mild-to-moderately dry skin.  I keep both in my medicine cabinet and use them both constantly.  I prefer the smell of the \\&quot;white\\&quot; Nivea over the \\&quot;blue\\&quot; Nivea, though the blue one is nice too.  The Nivea Refreshingly Soft Creme absorbs very quickly as well, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> I order this regularly and have a jar in almost every room of the house.  Use on my feet before I put on my socks; my legs, arms and hands as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually fan of all Nivea products, lotions, lip balms, creams... It really leaves the skin very smooth, moisturized. Using Nivea products for over 5 years, great products!</li>
            <li> Great product at a really great price.</li>
            <li> Soft and delicate, does the job, doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
            <li> this is my second order and I love this cream so much I&#x27;m using it instead of expensive face cream.  I&#x27;m 65 and it makes my skin feel wonderful.</li>
            <li> I use this lotion as a night cream, and it does wonders for my skin. It makes my skin so soft and evens out my complexion. Whenever I use this product, I get compliments on my skin and am told it \\&quot;glows\\&quot;. Definitely a wonderful product from Nivea!</li>
            <li> This creme is great, especially on dry, flaky skin caused by cold weather. I use it all over after showering each morning, and my skin stays soft and smooth all day! The fragrance is very soft and subtle, so it doesn&#x27;t compete with your perfume. I love that I can keep it on my shelf with subscribe and save!</li>
            <li> Has worked really well for my child who has had eczema at a very young age. Tried many different options before settling on this and has worked like charm for several years now.</li>
            <li> Love to keep one at my desk, the soap at work seems to dry out my hands so I make sure to always have a jar at my desk...</li>
            <li> I bought this creme about a week ago and the first day I used it I was extremely impressed. I have acne and it&#x27;s been getting a lot better ever since I&#x27;ve been using it, and my acne scars have definitely reduced. My skin also feels a lot softer than ever and looks much healthier. I put some on in the morning, after getting out of the shower, and before going to bed. I recommend this creme to anyone who&#x27;s just looking for a good moisturizer and especially for those who suffer from acne.</li>
            <li> Following hip replacement surgery my therapist suggested using a cream with vitamin E to rub on the scar to eliminate the build up of scar tissue. I have used the cream daily after showering and am extremely pleased with the results! The incision line is barely visible now several years following surgery.  It&#x27;s also wonderful in the winter to keep my skin lubricated and soft!  Unfortunately, it seems the product is becoming less available in my community.</li>
            <li> If you like fresh, clean and non greasy daily moisturizer this one is definitely it. I do not wear make-up and apply this twice a day- it is great! Don&#x27;t waste your money on other &amp;#34;amazing promises&amp;#34; keep on drinking water, keep your face clean and apply this and you will look and feel younger.</li>
            <li> Really love this stuff because it hydrates well without feeling greasy or oily. I use it on my arms and legs during the day and my face at night. I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizing cream I&#x27;ve ever used. I apply it in the morning and still feel moisturized at the end of the day. It is not greasy or overbearing. It has a nice soft scent that allows you to apply your perfume over it without overpowering that scent. Great for dry skin. In the winter, I occasionally use their heavier cream.</li>
            <li> Nothing but Nivea. I love Nivea creme as I&#x27;ve moderately dry skin and this is perfect for me. This is not very oily as other lotions could be</li>
            <li> I LOVE Nivea Soft! I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years. The texture is luxurious and it is fresh-feeling and not greasy at all. I use it mostly on my face.</li>
            <li> I  live at altitude where moisture does not stay with us long.  This creme keeps my skin (not face--body) soft and supple without making me feel like I am drowning in oils that come off on everything. Without this creme, my hands look like a logger&#x27;s hands--chapped and DRY!  I even use this sometimes on my lips in the winter...better than waxy sticks...and lasts!&lt;br /&gt;In the winter it is great to keep off the wind burn too.&lt;br /&gt;I like being able to buy this product in 4 packs and save some money.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It&#x27;s cheap and effective. I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more.</li>
            <li> Amazing product the smell is great and it provides wonderful moisture which absorbs so fast! Love it. I have used nivea off and on for my whole life, my mother pretty much raised me on nivea :) im 20 and still suffer from acne i havent tried it as a facial cream yet but i hear it works great for that too. Its a great cream at a great price!</li>
            <li> What can I say, this creme is just great. I use it for more than 20 years, even before I came to the USA. It is very soft moisturizing creme, you can use it on your entire body, even the face. I can only recommend this product. Big Thumbs Up!!!</li>
            <li> My favorite new moisturizing creme</li>
            <li> This is a great cream, not too heavy, not greasy or sticky, absorbs well.  Unscented, love that.  Very reasonably priced.  Relieves winter weather dry skin. I purchased one tub at CVS - I like it so well that I will buy the 4-pack here.  I will use this now instead of scented body creams from the body shops; it is a much better value.</li>
            <li> I have used Nivea for a long long time and with very good results but always found it to be a bit too thick, difficult to spread. This one came along and I gave it a try: just what I was hoping for, wonderfully soft, absorbed quickly and so very easy to smooth out on the skin. It is light but yet very effective as a moisturizer, a winner!</li>
            <li> use this after a shower and a shave- this stuff really does make your skin soft! i&#x27;ve been searching for that for a long time in a drugstore brand. my legs were so smooth i couldn&#x27;t stop touching them when i used this, i just couldn&#x27;t believe it. i bought this for about 5.50 at target</li>
            <li> This product works wonders.  I don&#x27;t think my skin has ever been this soft ever.  There are only two problems I have with the product.  First is the smell.  It has a slight baby powdery smell to it which I&#x27;m not a fan of.  The second issue with the product is that it feels a little greasy when it&#x27;s on my skin.  I usually put this product on 30-60 minutes before I shower.</li>
            <li> I discovered this product a couple of years ago.  It really takes care of dry skin and is odor free which I love.  Would definitely recommend to anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> This cream is so soft and smooth, a little bit goes a long way.  It helps my hands from painful cracking in the winter months.  Best cream I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Where do I start? I hate moisturizers. I don&#x27;t care how much they say they \\&quot;heal even the driest skin\\&quot; they. do. not. work for me. I used coconut oil on my face thinking maybe it&#x27;d help my super dry face-- nope. Homemade moisturizer? No. Pond&#x27;s Dry Skin Cream? Nada. I don&#x27;t care what it is, it doesn&#x27;t help my face. Well, except this stuff! I am soooo in love! I can&#x27;t believe that in ONE USE, just ONE, my incurably dry face was instantly soft! It soaks in to your skin faster than any lotion I&#x27;ve ever used and makes your hands, face, legs, whatever it is, instantly smooth. I urge you to buy this lotion! It is a miracle cream!</li>
            <li> I first tried this project on a trip to a dry local and the drugstore I stopped at didn&#x27;t have many options. However, I was pleasantly surprised and decided to buy more. I stash tubs of it in various places around the house and at work so I never have to do without! I use it both as a hand cream and body cream and works great as both.</li>
            <li> I picked this stuff up at my local walmart one day since my face gets very dry and i break out, decided to try it since one of the main ingredients (JoJoba Oil) is suppose to be great for helping with acne. I started putting a little bit on my face after i washed it in the morning and then again at night before i go to bed. My skin has improved so much and is way softer! It&#x27;s super cheap and easy to get anywhere, i recommend trying it out!</li>
            <li> We repurchase this every winter. It&#x27;s simple, soft, and comforting.  My entire family likes the smell.</li>
            <li> Did not care for fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this stuff. Use it to remove makeup at night and for my hands and feet. Perfect! Wish I had tried it years ago. This produce seems to have improved my skin texture and pores are tighter. Awesome!</li>
            <li> I use this wonderful cream for all over my body after my shower.  Nice soft fragrance too...not overpowering...just really love this cream.</li>
            <li> I liked using this product ever since I found out that it makes one&#x27;s skin soft and refreshing. And so it does.</li>
            <li> I uses this Nivea Soft under my foundation during the day and as a moisturizer at night.  The one in the Dark Blue jar is a bit thick but is good for softening elbows and heels.</li>
            <li> this works well as most nivea products do. I just don&#x27;t like the scent that seems to hang around forever on the skin and clothes. it&#x27;s a mild bland unpleasant scent that lets everyone know are wearing nivea. I expected no scent.</li>
            <li> This Nivea Soft Moisturizing Cream really makes my skin feel brand new.  It absorbs so quickly and it is not sticky.  I wish my skin felt refreshed as well as soft and smooth, but it doesn&#x27;t.  I highly recommend this product with no reservations.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nivea for over 10 years now and it just suits my skin texture. It leaves my skin well moisturized so I apply it twice a day. I recieved it on time and well packed and now I will continue to buy from amazon.</li>
            <li> Best and cheapest moisturizer I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I use this for my face in the morning after my day time facial routine before putting on sunblock and I use it at night on my stretchmarks, I haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference but I have felt the quality of my skin improve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell, and this jar will last quite a while (over 3 month with  moderate daily use). It absorbs easily and it&#x27;s non greasy ( I have oily skin). Nivea is a respectable brand and I will buy other products from them in the future.</li>
            <li> Basic facial creme.  This is not as oily as the eucerin&#x27;s redness relief cream or the original nivea cream.  I primarily use this during summer.  For winter use, I do not think it is oily enough for dry skin.  Anyway, this product is not heavy and dries very quickly.  Also, buying bulk in Amazon is cheaper than buying at Duane Reade stores.</li>
            <li> I really like this crime, it has a nice comforting smell and leaves my skin soft.  Well-priced and will not compete with your perfume.</li>
            <li> this lotion is so smooth and silky.  It is the only lotion my family uses now.  We love it so much I have it on recurring delivery through Amazon.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite moisturizers.  Mild scent, not greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I just love this cream. Its the only product that suits my skin type well.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried around 20+ face products but none did the job so well as this.&lt;br /&gt;Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love this cream and I use it daily. Great consistency and leaves my skin moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still a little upset that they make you buy 5 containers.  When I bought it from Amazon, they didn&#x27;t offer just a single jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t make my dry skin any less dry.  In fact, I think it made the skin more irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re better offer looking for this at a local drugstore to see if it works for you.  Because if it doesn&#x27;t, you won&#x27;t be stuck with 4 more useless jars.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years now as shaving cream.  Apply it to my face just like foam only using just a small amount before using a blade to shave.  It works very well to prevent razor burn.  As this is water soluble, any excess washes off cleaning from my face and the razor.  The scent is so light that any remaining is not noticed. A single container lasts a couple months, so cost is not an issue.  NIVEA has a product specifically marketed for shaving that I haven&#x27;t tried but the cost is greater.</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin especially in the winter and this stuff rocks.  I put it on before I go to sleep and when I wake up, a miracle has happened. The dry has gone, left behind by super \\&quot;soft\\&quot; moisturized skin.  Thanks Nivea!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product and being able to get it with a discounted price sweetens the pot. Definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Makes my skin feel so soft. And I love the size of the containers. This was money well spent and I will buy again in the future but I probably won&#x27;t need any for awhile because I received 4 containers. Great deal!</li>
            <li> very good,and so cheap suggest to buy,everyday moisture,especially winter  and spring,i like it!and i think you will like it also</li>
            <li> Using this product is much better than the old fashioned hard nivea cream.  it is a supper cream to use inbetween the Q10 cream.</li>
            <li> Feels very light on the skin and Absorbs fairly quick and scent is pleasant and not over board strong, which is great!</li>
            <li> Just love it. Been using this type of nivea for years!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> The lotion is fine, but the smells terrible. I cannot stand to have it on my face. It would be perfect if they would leave all fragrance out of the product.</li>
            <li> Pack of 4 decent sized Nivea cream. each can last months for me. I like this cream because it doesnt make my skin react. My skin is very sensitive and this is the only cream that doesnt give me pimples or make my face peel more. leaves my face smooth and soft. take into consideration that all skin reacts different and this comes in a pack of 4.</li>
            <li> I had extremely dry cracking skin all over. Nothing really worked, this cream did the job and it&#x27;s not greasy once you apply it.</li>
            <li> Nice softening creme. Cannot beat the price</li>
            <li> I purchased this creme in multiples and gave some away as gifts. Nivea is one of the best cremes there is for moisturizing. It is not greasy and leaves my hands feeling very smooth. My hands look pretty good after a tough winter.</li>
            <li> As a quilter and rough feet to boot, Nivea Soft smooths all the rough spots with no greasy residue.</li>
            <li> Love this cream. Use it morning and night.</li>
            <li> really good especially if u dont want the really greasy nivea</li>
            <li> Wonderful cream.  Soft scent which actually disappears as it is absorbed. Is not greasy and leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft.  Since the scent disappears my hubby likes it too.  A real plus since his skin is so dry and he works outside so much.</li>
            <li> grew up on nivea, and still loving it</li>
            <li> This cream smells nice and is great.  It&#x27;s light enough that my skin does not feel greasy.  When I put it on, it feels like I have on too much at first but then suddenly it disappears into my skin.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this moisturizer.  I love the clean feeling after application, the scent is light and clean and in no way overpowering.  Finally, my skin is super soft!  I cannot say enough good things about this product.  I have been using it for years and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> las cremas eran las esperadas..</li>
            <li> I was traveling when I discovered [[ASIN:B001FB5IMI Nivea Soft Refreshingly Soft Moisturizing Creme with Jojoba Oil and Vitamin E, 6.8-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 4)]]Nivea Soft. The moisturizer I had was greasy and left my skin dry after being out in the cold. I started using Nivea Soft and my skin has never looked better. It&#x27;s great for combo skin and for keeping hands and cuticles moisturized. I love it so much, I&#x27;m going to order a bunch because its hard to find where I live.</li>
            <li> I recommend this creme for people who enjoy lotions which are not oily or overly scented. The bonus is that this offer was at a great price!</li>
            <li> Nivea cream is very soothing and good after a clean shave. This product can also be used on your arms and legs after a hot bath. The cream is greaseless and does not leave a slippery feeling on your skin. It has a good smell great just before going to bed.</li>
            <li> This is best hand cream I have ever found.</li>
            <li> As a preschool teacher I wash my hands A LOT throughout the day. In turn my hands get really dry to the point of the skin splitting. So I have been searching and using many creams and this one is the one that I am now sure I will use here on out for the rest of my life. It keeps skin soft and moisturized and it really does last a long time. I cannot say enough good things about it. I just wish it came in a bigger tub!</li>
            <li> I have been using this Nivea moisturizer for over 8 years now and it is incredible.  Leaves your skin smooth and soft.  4 for $20 is a bargain, considering it is usually $7/$8 at the pharmacy or grocery store!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion I have used it for 10 years fantastic I buy it time and time again like the way it smells.</li>
            <li> My skin is now super soft.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t marketed as a post-shave product for men, so allow me to do that in this review. I put a dime-sized amount of Nivea Soft on my face immediately after shaving in the morning, and it keeps my face moisturized all day. This creme is light and not greasy at all. The one application I do in the morning lasts a good 24 hours. It also doesn&#x27;t leave my face with a \\&quot;shine\\&quot; like the moisturizer options from Gillette do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is light and gender-neutral, so it usually wears off within 20-30 minutes and doesn&#x27;t interfere with cologne or other fragrances. Well done!</li>
            <li> Cosmetics Europe, the European cosmetics trade association, has told its members to remove MI from products that are left on the skin after explosion in cases of allergic reactions and eczema. Methylisothiazolinone (MI or MIT), is routinely added to moisturizers, sun creams, shampoos and wet wipes. Skin experts in the UK and around the world have picked up a large number of allergic reactions they believe are caused by MI chemical. In UK, symptoms ranged from a rash of bright red tiny bumps to fluid filled lumps on the skin, blisters, itchy eyes and even a severely swollen face. It is not important where any cream is made; any cream with Methylisothiazolinone (MI or MIT) is not an EU cream. Now read the last ingredient of this cream... Methylisothiazolinone.</li>
            <li> I used to Live in a cold climate (Michigan) and the weather caused my skin to be extremely dry and to develop flakes.  After many doctor visits and wrong diagnosis, I was finally advised to use a high quality moisturizing lotion.  I used many products before this and they seemed to help.  Some were greasy though and I wasn&#x27;t happy.  About 3 years ago I was traveling abroad and my luggage was lost.  Scrambling to find a good replacement, this was the only product that looked decent enough to work.  I was skeptical at first, but after a couple of days I immediately could see the difference.  I went back and bought three more.  Every time I travel I buy more.  Recently I was running low and I could not find it in any of the major stores.  I was getting nervous.  I was very happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Prefer the German version without petroleum products. Bought it first in Europe.</li>
            <li> This is an extremely economical way to buy a very effective face and body cream. Jojoba oil has been the best for my skin over the years, and this brand includes Vitamin E as well. I have used it for years before I started buying it from Amazon. The four-pack makes it VERY affordable and worth having it delivered, rather than going to the drug store for it.</li>
            <li> I bought this after moving to Buffalo.  It smells like baby power.  I like how it feels after application.  It seals in moisture and does a good job of it without having to constantly reapply.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is a decent moisturizer, but honestly it isn&#x27;t much different than the other top moisturizers on the market.  It does its job well, and can be used over the entire body.  HOWEVER, it is NOT a non-comedogenic product (in other words, it can cause acne).  I used it on my face, and had small break-outs after just two days.  So if you have acne-prone skin, definitely don&#x27;t use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a \\&quot;different\\&quot; smell to it - I don&#x27;t find it as offensive as others do, but it definitely isn&#x27;t an overly pleasant smell.  I recommend smelling it before buying it to see if it is something that bothers you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - decent moisture but nothing special, unique smell, and not for acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive facial skin and this product seems to moisturize well without irritation or greasiness.  I got the four pack, which seems like it will last forever.  Good product and good value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for years and I am very happy with it! Inexpensive and yet, so good.</li>
            <li> Most thick and moisturizing creme around.  My skin is extra dry, so it drinks this in.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I am a Nivea customer for long time. I send this to my Mom in India and she loves it because its dry out quick and its not sticky!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff! I have used it for a couple years now, and I&#x27;d be VERY sad if I couldn&#x27;t find it. Good ol Amazon! I use it to the VERY last ans it&#x27;s easy to do that in these practical tubs. LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> This lotion makes my skin feel baby smooth! I use it almost every night. This creme is similar to a body butter but I find it much less greasy than most of them. I do not smell much of a scent which I like and it is very moisturizing. The price here is way better than what you find in any store! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> it works great for my kid whose skin reacts to any other product!! we use it regularly and love it!!</li>
            <li> Light refreshing and easy to use. Does not leave a heavy feel on your hands.  Pleasant scent. Very good product using numerous times a day.</li>
            <li> I like this cream, but the price in the US is rather expensive</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this. It smells like that ponds from Mexico. If you have sensitive skin - forget it.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I wish Nivea would make this in a larger size and in a pump bottle! This is the best body/face lotion with a nice soft fragrance that isn&#x27;t overwhelming. It&#x27;s so gentle yet effective that I can even use it on my face without worrying about a breakout as I have sensitive acne prone skin. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for dry skin. It hydrates your skin, smells nice and is a light cream.  It goes on nicelly and helps keep your skin soft.</li>
            <li> used before many times</li>
            <li> I love this Nivea product so much I use it under my facial color-correcting lotion. The soft-whipped cream glides on smoothly and is perfect for the normal-to-dry complexion and dry body skin. I also enjoy massaging it into the soles and heels of my feet for a nice sandal-attractive appeal. Not an overly tremendously savings; a minor one. However, a savings in gas and shopping and worth the convenience of a multiple pack to ensure you don&#x27;t run out! It is a much better product than the traditional blue-labeled Nivea product that is very thick and harder to liquify, unless you have bone dry skin. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> This is my all-time favorite hand/body/skin lotion. It&#x27;s smooth, not sticky, not greasy, and dries fast. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years, and hope they never stop making it.</li>
            <li> Very soft and smells great!  :)</li>
            <li> Love this creme! Best deal I have found so far and it arrived quickly and well packaged. It works great and the scent is not too strong. Would definitely recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I got the pair for four creams and two of them came with half open top seal. Not sure if they came from Nivea or some duplicate company. Trashed all of them.</li>
            <li> I love this version of Nivea.  It&#x27;s not nearly as sticky, smells better, and does a better job overall.</li>
            <li> One of the best skin care items I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Very good in its class.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Not too thick, not too thin, not greasy. Does a great job.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin. My hands crack and bleed in the winter. I was skeptical when I ordered this, but it is positively fantastic! It has a light, pleasant fragrance. Best of all, it is not at all oily add so many products are. I can use it and move on with life with out waiting for it to soak in to my skin. Can&#x27;t say enough good about this.</li>
            <li> Love, love this, so soft and creamy and goes as smooth and feels very refreshinging. No matter what expensive product I use, this always is layered on last.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It makes my skin feel so soft and eliminates flakiness on my face as well as my legs.  I use it after shaving my legs as well as my bikini line - eliminates those razor bumps.</li>
            <li> Moisturize your skin perfectly any season!</li>
            <li> I have tried everything from top designer brands that cost  a fortune,to supermarkets own brand moisturisers.personally speaking,having recently purchased Nivea soft,I have found it to be the best moisturiser by far. Everything from the way it glides on without leaving a residue,to the way it soothes dry skin is just perfect. At last I&#x27;ve found an affordable product which does what it&#x27;s meant to do.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  I first found it in the small tube and used it after swimming and lots of sun.  It was awesome.  My skin felt so smooth and soft and not greasy.  Thanks, as usual, to Amazon, for carrying this great product at a great price.  I really recommend this product if you want a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I am an avid user of the blue nivea creme. I&#x27;ve been using it for several years and have used up industrial sized tubs of it too many times to count. During the summer I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s sometimes a little heavy in my T-zone so I wanted to give this a shot. I love the texture and smell. It absorbs much faster and is a lighter weight cream. But here&#x27;s the strange part, while the blue nivea, which is heavier and thicker, never ever broke me out, this one did. Weird. It&#x27;s still a great moisturizer and I like to use it on my hands and such.</li>
            <li> I have Dermatitis on my face and this is the only stuff I can afford that does not burn when I put it on.&lt;br /&gt;It is rich and thik and keeps my soft, not greasy.</li>
            <li> I love this product; it absorbs without the greasy residue and it smells great. My only complaint is that I cannot get it in a bigger tub!</li>
            <li> Whole family love this!</li>
            <li> Nivea is definitely the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. I use it all the time. I use it on my body, even my face (which is acne prone and very sensitive) and it has NEVER broken me out. Amazing product. Repurchasing! :)</li>
            <li> I love the feel of the product, but would be better if it&#x27;s packaged in a tube form. Less contamination.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man&#x27;s man.  I shave with an old school safety razor.  I like to lather up using a shaving cream and a boar hair brush.  I get a great shave, but the process can dry the face.  Thus, I turned to this fabulous product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream absorbs quickly into the skin.  Very little needs to be used.  it can be greasy if you slather it on in copious amounts (I just used the word \\&quot;copious\\&quot;, which must mean I&#x27;m very smart or very immature).  But a little goes a great distance.  It somewhat soothes the skin and gives it a good sheen.  I&#x27;m sold.  I&#x27;m a man&#x27;s man and I use Nivea!</li>
            <li> Perfect cream for entire body. The cream doesn&#x27;t leave hands feeling greasy.  Nice scent which is not too strong.</li>
            <li> Three years ago, I discovered this body creme and I&#x27;ve never looked back. A few criteria that are important to me when I lotion: 1) The product cannot leave an oily residue, 2) It has to smell pretty good &amp; be gender neutral (i.e. I don&#x27;t want to smell like a man and I don&#x27;t want my boyfriend smelling like a woman), 3) It has to work, even in the dry cold New England winters and even after daily swim practice where the chlorine wreaks havoc on any skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nivea&#x27;s Soft creme works wonders! It&#x27;s light and delicate with a subtle &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; scent and is refreshingly moisturizing. It locks in my skin&#x27;s moisture post shower without being oily. And the container is the perfect shape -- you will never have to awkwardly squeeze the last few bits of lotion out of a bottle or tube again.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and this lotion keeps my face and hands always nice and soft for a very long time.  It&#x27;s still on my wishlist, so I can get it whenever I ran out of it again!</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer out there for your face.</li>
            <li> great value and quality</li>
            <li> Love it! I have been looking for this cream everywhere and never had any luck til I found it here for a better price as well.</li>
            <li> It knocks the dryness and the itchiness.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 31 and people never guess my age at older than 23. Between the Dove soap I use and this lotion, I know I will maintain that look. It is very light with a non-greasy feel and a slight fragrance. I wish Nivea would put this creme in a pump-style container for easier use, but I&#x27;ll take what I can get :)</li>
            <li> Very nice moisturizer. Soaks in completely.</li>
            <li> soaks in well leaves your skin soft.</li>
            <li> Works great, and lasts forever.  I use it to rub in after I&#x27;ve washed off my after shave.  Keeps skin in good condition.  I also rub some in my beard as I get dry patches underneath that are incredibly annoying.  After trying different things for about 10 years, this is the one I&#x27;ve settled on.</li>
            <li> Great seller and I love this creme!</li>
            <li> Really like this product--I use it on my face, legs and arms. It&#x27;s a light non-greasy lotion---very nice.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific product. I hate anything greasy, so I have avoided hand creams, but this cream is so light yet very effective. I apply it to my hands and arms before bedtime and wake up to soft moisturized skin, without feeling sticky.</li>
            <li> The creme makes my skin soft!! love it.</li>
            <li> This must be the best available creme on the market relative to price too. Like others have said, it moisturizes without leaving any film on the skin and absorbs quickly but continues to hydrate all day. I can wear foundation over it too without any problems. doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin unlike other expensive brands. I have tried other brands, a lot more expensive ones and I keep on coming back to this one. It&#x27;s really worth the price and I get compliments for my skin often.</li>
            <li> it really is the best cream. i tried the most expensive once , but always come back to Nivea</li>
            <li> I have the same problem as most people in a cold climate in the winter with a lack of humidity inside.&lt;br /&gt;My skin gets dry.  The Nivea soaks in well and tends to stay better than other moisturizing creams I have tried.</li>
            <li> i love this creme it the only moisturizer that work for me. the price was a excellent. i will recommended.</li>
            <li> Not over greasy feel to it. Let some of skin breathe the air to it feel,  I don&#x27;t like the oily feel of many lotions and this one needs a better container. Like a pump dispenser for more easier application for sanitary reasons. I refuse to share my lotion as I don&#x27;t want others germs in the container when trying the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise this is a good lotion all around I love it for my body, neck, arms, face. I don&#x27;t like Niveas other lotion versions.</li>
            <li> I use Nivea Soft Refreshingly Soft Moisturizing Creme with Jojoba Oil and Vitamin E on my hands.  When applied several times during the day and at bedtime, it prevents my cuticles from becoming dry and hands soft.  I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I love the incense of it!</li>
            <li> Been using this for years. The best moisturizer for really dry skin that I have ever found!</li>
            <li> Love this Nivea cream.</li>
            <li> Will never be without it! Perfect</li>
            <li> Good price and good product</li>
            <li> Product: I use this cream every morning and evening on my face - a small dab can take care of the job just fine. I also use it on my body. There is not much oily afterfeel, and my dry skin definitely feels quenched afterwards. The container is easy to use and I know that I can get every last bit of lotion before throwing it away. I imagine one container should last about a month, a little more depending how sparingly you use it/what body parts you use it for.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: The multi-pack seems to normally come in a 3-pack. Since I purchased a 4-pack, it contained the 3-pack (stacked in a plastic mold and shrink-wrapped) and a single other container placed in a simple zip-top bag.</li>
