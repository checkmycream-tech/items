            <li>&amp; I love it!</li>

            <li>so i bought her one has a night light too great for going to the bathroom at 2 a.m.</li>
            <li>have it look nice...</li>
            <li>Anyway, used these in hotels and decided to bring the system that works in the hotels home to my own place.  </li>

            <li>The tow speed also is really nice</li>
            <li>There is a good model, my wife love it.</li>

            <li>Quite nice.  </li>
            <li>but it is nice...</li>
            <li>This is a very reliable hair dryer and perfect for me by being wall mounted.</li>
            <li>Nice dryer.</li>
            <li>Looked nice.  </li>
            <li>Perfect replaced old one I was very pleased with.</li>
            <li>As handy as they are in hotels and motels, they are even more handy at home.</li>
            <li>I l also appreciate the night light feature its not to bright for a bathroom.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that the hairdryer has a place of its own (on the wall) instead of searching for it in the cabinet.  </li>
            <li>Heat settings are very good and installation was easy and fast</li>
            <li>My kid love it too.</li>
            <li>Love this dryer.</li>
            <li>We love it.</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t grab my hair as often as most hair dryers.  </li>
            <li>Have been using this for several days now and both my husband and I are real happy</li>
            <li>Make sure you can place close to the edge of your counter top.</li>
            <li>I have purchased 1 for myself and 2 more which have been given for gifts.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It has great power but can be gentle with the lower speed.</li>
            <li>and I am pleased with the service.</li>
            <li>I tried many many hairdryers, and they all stop working as soon as returning is not an option.</li>
            <li>Also I love the nightlight Janis</li>
            <li>HANGING ON THE WALL.Anyone would love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Thought I would give sunbeam one more try.  </li>
            <li>I never take a blowdryer with me when I travel because I just love these wall mounted ones by Sunbeam.</li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I got the first one good</li>
            <li>Night light is OK doesn&#x27;t affect my sleep.</li>
            <li>Great dryer to replace an old wall mounted one.</li>
            <li>Just got it and works great so far</li>
            <li>I mounted it near my mirror and the nightlight which I thought would not be a good thing, turns out to be so perfect in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li>I asked a maintenance man if these break easy or does he have to replace them a lot.</li>
            <li>Easy to install and works</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was easy to mount.  </li>
            <li>Lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy mounting instructions and the bonus nightlight are why I purchased this product.</li>
            <li>It has a night light and easy to mount on the wall too.</li>
            <li>1200 watt setting works just fine.  </li>
            <li>Light, easy to install and work well.</li>
            <li>Its easy to clean, and easy to change the wattage setting.</li>
            <li>It works so nice and does not take up much space.</li>
            <li>Thank you for making this product available to home owners as well as motels.</li>
            <li>But if I had known it was available without the night light I would have bought that instead.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Night light is a helpful feature as well.</li>
            <li>Night light functions admirably, an additional plus.  </li>
            <li>So happy I finally bought this dryer for my bathroom.  </li>
            <li>The light on the bottom was a surprise when I installed it</li>
            <li>Also has a night light built in.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product and A++ transaction.</li>
            <li>I would give the product 5 stars except you can&#x27;t turn off the night light.  </li>
            <li>If I wanted a night light, I would buy one.  </li>
            <li>night light is convenient.</li>
            <li>Fast, smooth and easy!  </li>
            <li>It is very powerful and super compact on my wall.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special for the price paid.</li>
            <li>It also clears up space on your bathroom counter, its not  clear in the description , but when you hang it up, it turns off by itself, I got one on amazon with a night light too good feature, if it does break</li>
            <li>It takes up a minimal amount of space and works great.  </li>
            <li>Decided to give a second chance because I loved how compact it is</li>
            <li>I am very well satisfied with my dryer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Get it, you&#x27;ll love it, really I promise.</li>
            <li>Good quality hair dryer with enough power to even satisfy my wife.  </li>
            <li>Dries hair quickly without frizz.</li>
            <li>Quick install</li>
            <li>Slender look, night light, two speeds, doesn&#x27;t seem to get hot.</li>
            <li>easy to mount, sturdy, dries hair fast</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted!  </li>
            <li>That company quickly replaced it and the replacement lasted for, that&#x27;s right, another 2 months.</li>
            <li>I ordered one that looked similar and attached over the old bracket.&lt;br /&gt;The new dryer is perfect!</li>
            <li>This is a great little hair dryer.</li>
            <li>The only thing that could be better is a tighter fit against the wall.</li>
            <li>Nice quality, fairly quiet, nice looking and not too big.  </li>
            <li>Just what I needed a powerful wall mount blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Compact and efficient and powerful.  </li>
            <li>This is so handy for my tiny bathroom.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;and was able to use the old wall mount</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always right there where I need it.  </li>
            <li>The temperature and speed is just right.  </li>
            <li>With so many studies showing that light disrupts healthy sleep, one would think that manufacturers would stop putting night lights on everything, or at least offer the option to turn it off.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get too hot.... temp is just right.</li>
            <li>I like the hairdryer very much, but would give it a 5 star rating if it had the &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; button.  </li>
            <li>We like it very much.</li>
            <li>I very much like the dual power and styling of this dryer.  </li>
            <li>There is no medium setting but so far the 2 options have been fine for us.</li>
            <li>Having two heat settings as far as inside the dryer to save electricity is great for those that want a softer not as hot two-setting dryer or those that are trying to save money among other things.</li>
            <li>Good hair dryer with subtle night light</li>
            <li>A nice little dryer that keeps your counter top clear.</li>
            <li>I wanted to like it, but the first time plugging it in and pressing the switch up, i heard a snap and the switch was no longer workin.</li>
            <li>got what I wanted... exactly.</li>
            <li>I first saw this model in a hotel room.</li>
            <li>I wanted to mount the dryer higher but the cord wouldn&#x27;t reach.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So many of the hand held hairdryers you get now are 1875 watts, big, and bulky.  </li>
            <li>I really like this hairdryer!  </li>
            <li>When this arrived first the hi-low setting didn’t work.</li>
            <li>and I love that I can remove it to take with me if I&#x27;m using a public shower.</li>
            <li>I first saw this in a motel.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t eager to start filling the holes and repainting the spot and maybe the whole bathroom if I couldn&#x27;t match the wall color.&lt;br /&gt;Yippee!  </li>
            <li>but then the first I got also worked but just after 1 year started to spark and smoke.  </li>
            <li>This is not my first wall-mount hairdryer</li>
            <li>I like having a wall mounted hairdryer in my bathroom for quick and easy access every morning when I&#x27;m blowing my hair dry.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have a very strong blower but seems to dry hair just as fast.</li>
            <li>BIG improvement over the last one which, along with the too bright night light lasted an entire 2 months before just quitting.</li>
            <li>Finally have a place the dryer Fits and is always easy to access when needed.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t even turn it on as it was too large for my space to hang it.  </li>
            <li>Works fine but very basic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very organized.</li>
            <li>when there really isn&#x27;t a way to do that is there???  </li>
            <li>The installation was very simple.&lt;br</li>
            <li>really like the simplicity of the dryer.  </li>
            <li>I am using the dryer in my vacation rental unit and it is a real winner for my renters.</li>
            <li>It was shipped and received very promptly</li>
            <li>(last one was like an interrogation light), two temps &amp; two speeds.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY EFFICIENT!</li>
            <li>I always felt 1875 watts was too much heat for my hair, so</li>
            <li>Much easier to use when you have hand problems and strength limits.</li>
            <li>30975/HD-10L 1600W Quiet Hangup Hair Dryer with Night Light.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really believe the tourmaline hype</li>
            <li>Really like these.</li>
            <li>After spending another vacation week in a Hilton using this wonderful dryer, I knew it would be disappointing to go home and not have one.</li>
            <li>It was really convenient.</li>
            <li>Nice weight--not too heavy for my extended drying times.</li>
            <li>Small, light in weight &amp; easy to use.</li>
            <li>Fit into the same bracket as the older model which I transferred to a guest bath room.</li>
            <li>but I really like this one and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Would be nice to be able to turn off light at base.</li>
            <li>This is a handy space saver in a small bathroom - no cords,</li>
            <li>Does make a difference in drying hair compared to the older models (without Tourmaline).  </li>
            <li>Really like that it has an interior track that you can wind any excess cord around before installing (depending on how far from the plug in you need to install it)!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this hair dryer</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The one that is used more broke after a few months at the switch.  </li>
            <li>Sure beats having to bring out a hair dryer from a drawer everyday.</li>
            <li>They are small, don&#x27;t take up too much wall space and leaves the counter top clear.  </li>
            <li>I live in an apartment.</li>
            <li>Frankly I had never heard of &amp;#34;tourmaline&amp;#34; until we started looking for a new hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I have had it for a couple of years and it still performs like a new one.</li>
            <li>The night light is a small but appreciated bonus!</li>
            <li>This is my third Sunbeam wall-mounted dryer since 1994 … so grateful for the consistent wall bracket.</li>
            <li>Have it on the 1200 watt setting which is plenty hot enough.</li>
            <li>only I could get the same dryer to fit the old bracket.  </li>
            <li>This is my second one (the first one overheated, melted one of the fan blades, and couldn&#x27;t be repaired.)  </li>
            <li>And the dryer has more power than my old one so it doesn&#x27;t take as long to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought that the light would be a negative</li>
            <li>Too loud and the kind of thick!</li>
            <li>But my old one never had this problem.</li>
            <li>but i was replacing a 7 or 8 year old like unit so i did not want to change unit or mounting system.</li>
            <li>I mounted near the wall electrical plug and had to tie up the excess electrical cord (from the unit to the plug),&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always ready at a second&#x27;s notice.</li>
            <li>I was replacing this unit with another Sunbeam wall mount that my wife had for nearly 10 years.</li>
            <li>The unit is relatively quiet, simple and works better than expected.</li>
            <li>I had my old GE wall type hair dryer for 13 years.  </li>
            <li>I had the old metal bracket on the wall and thought &amp;#34;if</li>
            <li>It is very powerful and also smaller than my old hair dryer and so handles very well for my small hands.  </li>
            <li>it may be a little less power if you have long thick hair but just fine for mr.  The convenience of a hanging dryer is great</li>
            <li>, it felt like decent quality, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to mount with only a few tools.</li>
            <li>I like the small amber night light in the bathroom at night.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why this dryer has a night light built in; I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>I have had a new one for 4 mos now and my 2nd one broke.</li>
            <li>Have only had this one for a month, but if it&#x27;s anything like the old one it will last for years.</li>
            <li>Small &amp; powerful.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Works great, mounted to the wall out of the way.</li>
            <li> but it works great as a night like when we have to get up at night.  </li>
            <li> When she is happy I am happy and that is speaks volumes for the product.</li>

            <li> Excellent design and easy to install.</li>
            <li> Its compact, perfect heat settings (2) and so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Sunbeam seemed the most popular and best.</li>
            <li> I thought it worked good for drying my hair</li>
            <li> Still working great and so nice to just hang it on the wall.</li>
            <li> Light is perfect brightness.  </li>
            <li> Loved the Sunbeam before this one and this one is really good too.</li>
            <li> My wife used one of these in a hotel we were staying at and loved it.</li>
            <li> good unit .</li>
            <li> It was a good choice for us.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this hair dryer model.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the features and the performance.  </li>
            <li> My wife is very satisfied with the gift that was purchased for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> There were cheaper models, but glad I bought this one since the light brightness and power of dryer are perfect!</li>
            <li> Love the night light and works great!!</li>
            <li> LOVE this!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I love my wall mounted blow dryer!</li>
            <li> And for the price I would expect more!</li>
            <li> &amp; I love it!</li>
            <li> Very handy mounted on wall and easy to install.</li>
            <li> so i bought her one has a night light too great for going to the bathroom at 2 a.m.</li>
            <li> have it look nice...</li>
            <li> Anyway, used these in hotels and decided to bring the system that works in the hotels home to my own place.  </li>
            <li> Looks nice on the wall.</li>
            <li> The tow speed also is really nice</li>
            <li> There is a good model, my wife love it.</li>
            <li> It dries to hair so nice.</li>
            <li> Quite nice.  </li>
            <li> but it is nice...</li>
            <li> This is a very reliable hair dryer and perfect for me by being wall mounted.</li>
            <li> Nice dryer.</li>
            <li> Looked nice.  </li>
            <li> Perfect replaced old one I was very pleased with.</li>
            <li> As handy as they are in hotels and motels, they are even more handy at home.</li>
            <li> I l also appreciate the night light feature its not to bright for a bathroom.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that the hairdryer has a place of its own (on the wall) instead of searching for it in the cabinet.  </li>
            <li> Heat settings are very good and installation was easy and fast</li>
            <li> My kid love it too.</li>
            <li> Love this dryer.</li>
            <li> We love it.</li>
            <li> ok.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t grab my hair as often as most hair dryers.  </li>
            <li> Have been using this for several days now and both my husband and I are real happy</li>
            <li> Make sure you can place close to the edge of your counter top.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 1 for myself and 2 more which have been given for gifts.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It has great power but can be gentle with the lower speed.</li>
            <li> and I am pleased with the service.</li>
            <li> I tried many many hairdryers, and they all stop working as soon as returning is not an option.</li>
            <li> Also I love the nightlight Janis</li>
            <li> HANGING ON THE WALL.Anyone would love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Thought I would give sunbeam one more try.  </li>
            <li> I never take a blowdryer with me when I travel because I just love these wall mounted ones by Sunbeam.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I got the first one good</li>
            <li> Night light is OK doesn&#x27;t affect my sleep.</li>
            <li> Great dryer to replace an old wall mounted one.</li>
            <li> Just got it and works great so far</li>
            <li> I mounted it near my mirror and the nightlight which I thought would not be a good thing, turns out to be so perfect in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li> I asked a maintenance man if these break easy or does he have to replace them a lot.</li>
            <li> Easy to install and works</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was easy to mount.  </li>
            <li> Lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy mounting instructions and the bonus nightlight are why I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> It has a night light and easy to mount on the wall too.</li>
            <li> 1200 watt setting works just fine.  </li>
            <li> Light, easy to install and work well.</li>
            <li> Its easy to clean, and easy to change the wattage setting.</li>
            <li> It works so nice and does not take up much space.</li>
            <li> Thank you for making this product available to home owners as well as motels.</li>
            <li> But if I had known it was available without the night light I would have bought that instead.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Night light is a helpful feature as well.</li>
            <li> Night light functions admirably, an additional plus.  </li>
            <li> So happy I finally bought this dryer for my bathroom.  </li>
            <li> The light on the bottom was a surprise when I installed it</li>
            <li> Also has a night light built in.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product and A++ transaction.</li>
            <li> I would give the product 5 stars except you can&#x27;t turn off the night light.  </li>
            <li> If I wanted a night light, I would buy one.  </li>
            <li> night light is convenient.</li>
            <li> Fast, smooth and easy!  </li>
            <li> It is very powerful and super compact on my wall.  </li>
            <li> Nothing special for the price paid.</li>
            <li> It also clears up space on your bathroom counter, its not  clear in the description , but when you hang it up, it turns off by itself, I got one on amazon with a night light too good feature, if it does break</li>
            <li> It takes up a minimal amount of space and works great.  </li>
            <li> Decided to give a second chance because I loved how compact it is</li>
            <li> I am very well satisfied with my dryer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Get it, you&#x27;ll love it, really I promise.</li>
            <li> Good quality hair dryer with enough power to even satisfy my wife.  </li>
            <li> Dries hair quickly without frizz.</li>
            <li> Quick install</li>
            <li> Slender look, night light, two speeds, doesn&#x27;t seem to get hot.</li>
            <li> easy to mount, sturdy, dries hair fast</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted!  </li>
            <li> That company quickly replaced it and the replacement lasted for, that&#x27;s right, another 2 months.</li>
            <li> I ordered one that looked similar and attached over the old bracket.&lt;br /&gt;The new dryer is perfect!</li>
            <li> This is a great little hair dryer.</li>
            <li> The only thing that could be better is a tighter fit against the wall.</li>
            <li> Nice quality, fairly quiet, nice looking and not too big.  </li>
            <li> Just what I needed a powerful wall mount blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Compact and efficient and powerful.  </li>
            <li> This is so handy for my tiny bathroom.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;and was able to use the old wall mount</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always right there where I need it.  </li>
            <li> The temperature and speed is just right.  </li>
            <li> With so many studies showing that light disrupts healthy sleep, one would think that manufacturers would stop putting night lights on everything, or at least offer the option to turn it off.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get too hot.... temp is just right.</li>
            <li> I like the hairdryer very much, but would give it a 5 star rating if it had the &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; button.  </li>
            <li> We like it very much.</li>
            <li> I very much like the dual power and styling of this dryer.  </li>
            <li> There is no medium setting but so far the 2 options have been fine for us.</li>
            <li> Having two heat settings as far as inside the dryer to save electricity is great for those that want a softer not as hot two-setting dryer or those that are trying to save money among other things.</li>
            <li> Good hair dryer with subtle night light</li>
            <li> A nice little dryer that keeps your counter top clear.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like it, but the first time plugging it in and pressing the switch up, i heard a snap and the switch was no longer workin.</li>
            <li> got what I wanted... exactly.</li>
            <li> I first saw this model in a hotel room.</li>
            <li> I wanted to mount the dryer higher but the cord wouldn&#x27;t reach.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So many of the hand held hairdryers you get now are 1875 watts, big, and bulky.  </li>
            <li> I really like this hairdryer!  </li>
            <li> When this arrived first the hi-low setting didn’t work.</li>
            <li> and I love that I can remove it to take with me if I&#x27;m using a public shower.</li>
            <li> I first saw this in a motel.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t eager to start filling the holes and repainting the spot and maybe the whole bathroom if I couldn&#x27;t match the wall color.&lt;br /&gt;Yippee!  </li>
            <li> but then the first I got also worked but just after 1 year started to spark and smoke.  </li>
            <li> This is not my first wall-mount hairdryer</li>
            <li> I like having a wall mounted hairdryer in my bathroom for quick and easy access every morning when I&#x27;m blowing my hair dry.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a very strong blower but seems to dry hair just as fast.</li>
            <li> BIG improvement over the last one which, along with the too bright night light lasted an entire 2 months before just quitting.</li>
            <li> Finally have a place the dryer Fits and is always easy to access when needed.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even turn it on as it was too large for my space to hang it.  </li>
            <li> Works fine but very basic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very organized.</li>
            <li> when there really isn&#x27;t a way to do that is there???  </li>
            <li> The installation was very simple.&lt;br</li>
            <li> really like the simplicity of the dryer.  </li>
            <li> I am using the dryer in my vacation rental unit and it is a real winner for my renters.</li>
            <li> It was shipped and received very promptly</li>
            <li> (last one was like an interrogation light), two temps &amp; two speeds.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY EFFICIENT!</li>
            <li> I always felt 1875 watts was too much heat for my hair, so</li>
            <li> Much easier to use when you have hand problems and strength limits.</li>
            <li> 30975/HD-10L 1600W Quiet Hangup Hair Dryer with Night Light.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really believe the tourmaline hype</li>
            <li> Really like these.</li>
            <li> After spending another vacation week in a Hilton using this wonderful dryer, I knew it would be disappointing to go home and not have one.</li>
            <li> It was really convenient.</li>
            <li> Nice weight--not too heavy for my extended drying times.</li>
            <li> Small, light in weight &amp; easy to use.</li>
            <li> Fit into the same bracket as the older model which I transferred to a guest bath room.</li>
            <li> but I really like this one and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Would be nice to be able to turn off light at base.</li>
            <li> This is a handy space saver in a small bathroom - no cords,</li>
            <li> Does make a difference in drying hair compared to the older models (without Tourmaline).  </li>
            <li> Really like that it has an interior track that you can wind any excess cord around before installing (depending on how far from the plug in you need to install it)!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this hair dryer</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The one that is used more broke after a few months at the switch.  </li>
            <li> Sure beats having to bring out a hair dryer from a drawer everyday.</li>
            <li> They are small, don&#x27;t take up too much wall space and leaves the counter top clear.  </li>
            <li> I live in an apartment.</li>
            <li> Frankly I had never heard of &amp;#34;tourmaline&amp;#34; until we started looking for a new hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I have had it for a couple of years and it still performs like a new one.</li>
            <li> The night light is a small but appreciated bonus!</li>
            <li> This is my third Sunbeam wall-mounted dryer since 1994 … so grateful for the consistent wall bracket.</li>
            <li> Have it on the 1200 watt setting which is plenty hot enough.</li>
            <li> only I could get the same dryer to fit the old bracket.  </li>
            <li> This is my second one (the first one overheated, melted one of the fan blades, and couldn&#x27;t be repaired.)  </li>
            <li> And the dryer has more power than my old one so it doesn&#x27;t take as long to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought that the light would be a negative</li>
            <li> Too loud and the kind of thick!</li>
            <li> But my old one never had this problem.</li>
            <li> but i was replacing a 7 or 8 year old like unit so i did not want to change unit or mounting system.</li>
            <li> I mounted near the wall electrical plug and had to tie up the excess electrical cord (from the unit to the plug),&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always ready at a second&#x27;s notice.</li>
            <li> I was replacing this unit with another Sunbeam wall mount that my wife had for nearly 10 years.</li>
            <li> The unit is relatively quiet, simple and works better than expected.</li>
            <li> I had my old GE wall type hair dryer for 13 years.  </li>
            <li> I had the old metal bracket on the wall and thought &amp;#34;if</li>
            <li> It is very powerful and also smaller than my old hair dryer and so handles very well for my small hands.  </li>
            <li> it may be a little less power if you have long thick hair but just fine for mr.  The convenience of a hanging dryer is great</li>
            <li> , it felt like decent quality, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to mount with only a few tools.</li>
            <li> I like the small amber night light in the bathroom at night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this dryer has a night light built in; I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I have had a new one for 4 mos now and my 2nd one broke.</li>
            <li> Have only had this one for a month, but if it&#x27;s anything like the old one it will last for years.</li>
            <li> Small &amp; powerful.</li>
            <li> He said they last a long time and are reliable.</li>
            <li> The low setting seems under powered for long hair.  </li>
            <li> The magnet in the end of the nozzle that holds it in place is pretty slick!</li>
            <li> (limited hair - male).</li>
            <li> Must be kept a distance away from long hair, uless you like tangled hair.  </li>
            <li> but this dryer does seem to make it easier to comb out long, tangled hair.  </li>
            <li> very quiet compared to other models.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.  </li>
            <li> I used it in the Hotel and it doesn&#x60;t dry out the hair , I had to have one.</li>
            <li> And the hair seems silkier when dry.  </li>
            <li> A few months later I saw this model again at a different hotel in another city.</li>
            <li> But I have to say I think it does actually cut down on the frizzy flyaways you can get when you dry your hair with an electric</li>
            <li> now I am out 2 dryers and spent over $70 -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what I expected.</li>
            <li> ; is that the mounting bracket has &amp;#34;play&amp;#34; and the unit does not feel solidly mounted even though the mounting bracket is very tightly screwed into the wall.  </li>
            <li> No more hair dryer lying next to the bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> Outlet is on one side of the hand towel rack; I had to mount it on the other side</li>
            <li> I also use the dryer to other parts of my body due to psoriasis which is aggravated by moisture and  </li>
            <li> purchased 9 month ago always shutting off due to overheating something broke off inside shorting out dryer</li>
            <li> The setting selection switch on the dryer could be easier to minipulate but other than that, no complaints.</li>
            <li> , I gave away my other dryer and never looked back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the on/off button are not on the handle but on the hanger.  </li>
            <li> but otherwise would have to put ugly black tape over the light.  </li>
            <li> We had our previous Sunbeam almost 20 years.</li>
            <li> That dryer broke after a year of use and had a disgusting bright green nightlight.  </li>
            <li> from previous wall mount dryer.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> The fan inside breaks apart and will scare you half to death.  </li>
            <li> It dries my hair with ease and I have thick and long</li>
            <li> a little pricey</li>
            <li> We have had this dryer for 3 years and both of us use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> No more trying to shove it somewhere or</li>
            <li> No more groping in the vanity looking for the hairdryer.</li>
            <li> In my small bathroom, space on the vanity counter is at a premium, this wall mounted unit works works well to take care of the problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> no more getting the hair dryer in &amp; out of the drawer or having it lie around on the counter.</li>
            <li> small &amp;#34;con&amp;#34</li>
            <li> The dryer sounds bad, as if it is not going to last very long.</li>
            <li> My wife saw it on a hotel, it is a hard service dryer.</li>
            <li> Also it isn’t hard wired</li>
            <li> So I returned it with no hassle and ordered the wall mount hard wire unit with three settings and no cord to tangle.</li>
            <li> Replaces and Conair that lasted for at least 14 years.  </li>
            <li> my feet which are prone to moisture related problems and the cord between the base and the dryer makes doing this awkward.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Out of the box, the high-low switch was broken.</li>
            <li> Electric cord was shorter than other hair dryers which was a nuisance, I had to move the screws in my wall, which I hate doing.</li>
            <li> Sadly it passed away.  </li>
            <li> Too bad.  </li>
            <li> Dryer still worked but it no longer stayed attached to the wall mounted base.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, as we didn&#x27;t realize that until it arrived.</li>
            <li> Terrible product</li>

            <li> Fits great ! Works great!</li>
            <li> we had another die on us...looks like maybe the plastic fan fins warp form the heat and then get caught in protective mesh...and fry motor? anyone else see this happening?</li>
            <li> I bought this. Broke. Decided to give a second chance because I loved how compact it is and it is off counter. I have had a new one for 4 mos now and my 2nd one broke. Says I cannot return so now I am out 2 dryers and spent over $70 - will never buy another one. Terrible product</li>
            <li> I got the first one good so I order the second one.I&#x27;m happy with it.It&#x27;s very organized.My kid love it too.</li>
            <li> LOVE this!  Finally have a place the dryer Fits and is always easy to access when needed.  No more trying to shove it somewhere or have it look nice...when there really isn&#x27;t a way to do that is there???  Anyway, used these in hotels and decided to bring the system that works in the hotels home to my own place.  So Glad I did!!!</li>
            <li> I wanted to like it, but the first time plugging it in and pressing the switch up, i heard a snap and the switch was no longer workin. Sent it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave it two stars for the benefit of the doubt: Sometimes these things just happen. That, and the item despite being lemon, it felt like decent quality, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Might try another one in the future, maybe there was a batch batch.</li>
            <li> No more hair dryer lying next to the bathroom sink. No more groping in the vanity looking for the hairdryer. It&#x27;s always right there where I need it.  As handy as they are in hotels and motels, they are even more handy at home. I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> It also clears up space on your bathroom counter, its not  clear in the description , but when you hang it up, it turns off by itself, I got one on amazon with a night light too good feature, if it does break I\\&quot;ll get another one</li>
            <li> The temperature and speed is just right.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.  I would highly recommend this hair dryer</li>
            <li> The installation was very simple.&lt;br /&gt;The product looked just like the one in our hotel room (which is what I wanted).&lt;br /&gt;Bright nightlight is great at 2AM.&lt;br /&gt;Plenty of airflow and heat.&lt;br /&gt;I got what I wanted... exactly.</li>
            <li> I love my wall mounted blow dryer! It puts out a great volume of air which I like and was looking for. It doesn&#x27;t get too hot.... temp is just right. I like the small amber night light in the bathroom at night. I would purchase this item again in a heart beat !</li>
            <li> It has plenty of power and dries my hair quite well. The problem is that it seems to short out and I have to reset the fuse constantly. Perhaps it is overloading my circuit. But my old one never had this problem.</li>
            <li> I first saw this model in a hotel room. I thought it worked good for drying my hair (limited hair - male). A few months later I saw this model again at a different hotel in another city. I asked a maintenance man if these break easy or does he have to replace them a lot. He said they last a long time and are reliable. Therefore, I bought one and it works great. It has a night light and easy to mount on the wall too.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is great. We use it all the time. Very handy mounted on wall and easy to install.</li>
            <li> We have had this dryer for 3 years and both of us use it everyday.  Still working great and so nice to just hang it on the wall.</li>
            <li> Performs great,  no problems.  Light is perfect brightness.  1200 watt setting works just fine.  Great space saver.  Used in hotels and great for kids bathrooms.</li>
            <li> Love this dryer. I&#x27;ve been using wall mount hair dryers for years. Actually only one before this one which was also a Sunbeam. Nothing lasts forever. Loved the Sunbeam before this one and this one is really good too. Slender look, night light, two speeds, doesn&#x27;t seem to get hot. Looks nice on the wall. Have only had this one for a month, but if it&#x27;s anything like the old one it will last for years.</li>
            <li> Too loud and the kind of thick! And for the price I would expect more!</li>
            <li> It works so nice and does not take up much space. We love it. The tow speed also is really nice</li>
            <li> Nothing special for the price paid. Works fine but very basic.</li>
            <li> My wife saw it on a hotel, it is a hard service dryer. Easy to install and works ok. There is a good model, my wife love it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t grab my hair as often as most hair dryers.  Electric cord was shorter than other hair dryers which was a nuisance, I had to move the screws in my wall, which I hate doing.</li>
            <li> Bought two.  The one that is used more broke after a few months at the switch.  It goes on but only one speed now.</li>
            <li> Excellent design and easy to install.</li>
            <li> This is my third Sunbeam wall-mounted dryer since 1994 … so grateful for the consistent wall bracket. Don&#x27;t ever change it! The only thing that could be better is a tighter fit against the wall. Nice weight--not too heavy for my extended drying times.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this hair dryer model. Thank you for making this product available to home owners as well as motels.</li>
            <li> We saw this in our hotel room and decided to purchase one for home and it worked out great for the guest bathroom.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for several days now and both my husband and I are real happy this this unit.  We bought two to have one in each bathroom.  My husband noticed one like this a hotel we stayed in, then asked me to see if I could find one online.</li>
            <li> Both my daughter and myself were looking for a dryer that didn&#x27;t go in the drawer.  I read all the reviews and choose this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the simplicity of the dryer.  It dries my hair with ease and I have thick and long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback to this dryer is the length of the cord.  Make sure you can place close to the edge of your counter top.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 1 for myself and 2 more which have been given for gifts. Love it. I have had mine a yr. I have short hair it may be a little less power if you have long thick hair but just fine for mr.  The convenience of a hanging dryer is great</li>
            <li> Excellent power and quality</li>
            <li> My wife used one of these in a hotel we were staying at and loved it. so i bought her one has a night light too great for going to the bathroom at 2 a.m.</li>
            <li> Nice quality, fairly quiet, nice looking and not too big.  I bought two.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed a powerful wall mount blow dryer. I l also appreciate the night light feature its not to bright for a bathroom.</li>
            <li> After spending some nights in motels with wall mounted hair dryers I wanted one. Sunbeam seemed the most popular and best. So I bought this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minor complaints:&lt;br /&gt;  *  Power cord to outlet is too short for my situation. I live in an apartment. Outlet is on one side of the hand towel rack; I had to mount it on the other side so the cord is flopping at a diagonal under the towels. I wanted to mount the dryer higher but the cord wouldn&#x27;t reach.&lt;br /&gt;  *  I also use the dryer to other parts of my body due to psoriasis which is aggravated by moisture and  my feet which are prone to moisture related problems and the cord between the base and the dryer makes doing this awkward.&lt;br /&gt;  *  Night light is OK doesn&#x27;t affect my sleep. But if I had known it was available without the night light I would have bought that instead.</li>
            <li> I used it in the Hotel and it doesn&#x60;t dry out the hair , I had to have one. It dries to hair so nice.</li>
            <li> I am using the dryer in my vacation rental unit and it is a real winner for my renters.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted!  I have always wanted one for my bathroom and so apply I finally ordered one.</li>
            <li> We had our previous Sunbeam almost 20 years. Dryer still worked but it no longer stayed attached to the wall mounted base. Frankly I had never heard of &amp;#34;tourmaline&amp;#34; until we started looking for a new hair dryer. But I have to say I think it does actually cut down on the frizzy flyaways you can get when you dry your hair with an electric dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Night light is a helpful feature as well. There is no medium setting but so far the 2 options have been fine for us.</li>
            <li> Quite nice.  Does make a difference in drying hair compared to the older models (without Tourmaline).  Night light functions admirably, an additional plus.  Fit into the same bracket as the older model which I transferred to a guest bath room.</li>
            <li> So happy I finally bought this dryer for my bathroom.  It has great power but can be gentle with the lower speed.</li>
            <li> purchased 9 month ago always shutting off due to overheating something broke off inside shorting out dryer 30 day warrenty could not return</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for... The light on the bottom was a surprise when I installed it but it is nice... Works great for me...</li>
            <li> good unit . a little pricey but i was replacing a 7 or 8 year old like unit so i did not want to change unit or mounting system.</li>
            <li> This is a great little hair dryer.Also has a night light built in.</li>
            <li> easy to mount, sturdy, dries hair fast</li>
            <li> I like having a wall mounted hairdryer in my bathroom for quick and easy access every morning when I&#x27;m blowing my hair dry.  I had one before this one that lasted 8 or 9 years before conking out.  I like the hairdryer very much, but would give it a 5 star rating if it had the &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; button.  It was shipped and received very promptly and I am pleased with the service.</li>
            <li> Have a rental house and people kept taking the hair dryers.  Mounted this to the wall and problem solved.</li>
            <li> this is our 4th or 5 th purchase of this style of hair dryer.  Perfect in our bathroom. Can&#x27;t tell if the tourmaline makes a difference or not, I&#x27;ll just have to take the descriptions word on that.</li>
            <li> until it stopped working (the nightlight still worked but the hair dryer would not turn on again) after a year of use. couldn&#x27;t get through to anyone on the phone. finally had to return it and try another brand...</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer. very quiet compared to other models.</li>
            <li> Good hair dryer with subtle night light (last one was like an interrogation light), two temps &amp; two speeds. BIG improvement over the last one which, along with the too bright night light lasted an entire 2 months before just quitting. That company quickly replaced it and the replacement lasted for, that&#x27;s right, another 2 months.</li>
            <li> The same hair dryer as the Conair it is replacing.  Very disappointed, as we didn&#x27;t realize that until it arrived. The Conair hair dryer started to burn.</li>
            <li> Small, light in weight &amp; easy to use. It does the job &amp; I love it!</li>
            <li> This is the only brand I trust. I tried many many hairdryers, and they all stop working as soon as returning is not an option. This hairdryer is the last one you will ever need. It has two settings high/low, and it just works.</li>
            <li> In my small bathroom, space on the vanity counter is at a premium, this wall mounted unit works works well to take care of the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was easy to mount.  I mounted near the wall electrical plug and had to tie up the excess electrical cord (from the unit to the plug),&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit has two heat settings and two speed settings.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY EFFICIENT! I am very well satisfied with my dryer.  It&#x27;s just what I expected. Compact and efficient and powerful.  Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that the hairdryer has a place of its own (on the wall) instead of searching for it in the cabinet.  Also I love the nightlight Janis</li>
            <li> Just as promised. Dries hair quickly without frizz. Lightweight and easy to use. Easy to mount with only a few tools. Like the curly cord that doesn&#x27;t drape all over the counter. Also, plug cord wraps around the back so you only need to leave enough exposed to plug it in.</li>
            <li> bought it for the wife and she seems to like it.</li>
            <li> Great dryer to replace an old wall mounted one. Heat settings are very good and installation was easy and fast</li>
            <li> Fantastic product and A++ transaction. I use mine evey day. Worth every penny.!!!!</li>
            <li> I have this hung in my bathroom and use it every day.  It takes up a minimal amount of space and works great.  I am very happy with this.  Sure beats having to bring out a hair dryer from a drawer everyday.</li>
            <li> So many of the hand held hairdryers you get now are 1875 watts, big, and bulky.  I always felt 1875 watts was too much heat for my hair, so when I used this hairdryer in a hotel room I stayed in, I knew I had to get one when I got back.  Very pleased with the features and the performance.  The magnet in the end of the nozzle that holds it in place is pretty slick!</li>
            <li> This is so handy for my tiny bathroom. Have it on the 1200 watt setting which is plenty hot enough.</li>
            <li> Must be kept a distance away from long hair, uless you like tangled hair.  The low setting seems under powered for long hair.  Otherwise it works well.</li>
            <li> This is a very reliable hair dryer and perfect for me by being wall mounted. Much easier to use when you have hand problems and strength limits.</li>
            <li> We bought two wall mount hairdryers to install at a vacation rental.  They work well and are attractive.  They are small, don&#x27;t take up too much wall space and leaves the counter top clear.  It was a good choice for us.</li>
            <li> It is very powerful and also smaller than my old hair dryer and so handles very well for my small hands.  It&#x27;s always ready at a second&#x27;s notice.</li>
            <li> I really like this hairdryer!  I bought it to replace my Andis 30975/HD-10L 1600W Quiet Hangup Hair Dryer with Night Light.  That dryer broke after a year of use and had a disgusting bright green nightlight.  This Sunbeam is wonderful!  It is very powerful and super compact on my wall.  The only complaint I have is that the on/off button are not on the handle but on the hanger.  I prefer it to be on the handle but that is just a personal preference.</li>
            <li> Nice dryer. The setting selection switch on the dryer could be easier to minipulate but other than that, no complaints.</li>
            <li> I was replacing this unit with another Sunbeam wall mount that my wife had for nearly 10 years. When this arrived first the hi-low setting didn’t work. Also it isn’t hard wired so you have a cord dangling off the wall. That was my fault I didn’t realize it when I ordered it. So I returned it with no hassle and ordered the wall mount hard wire unit with three settings and no cord to tangle. A happy wife is a happy LIFE.</li>
            <li> This took maybe 10 min to install..works great...nightlight is perfect brightness...no more getting the hair dryer in &amp; out of the drawer or having it lie around on the counter. Really like that it has an interior track that you can wind any excess cord around before installing (depending on how far from the plug in you need to install it)! There were cheaper models, but glad I bought this one since the light brightness and power of dryer are perfect!</li>
            <li> Would be nice to be able to turn off light at base.</li>
            <li> Love the night light and works great!!</li>
            <li> Great dryer. We like it very much.</li>
            <li> IT WORK GREAT UP OUT OF MY WAY .THE NIGHT LITE IS NOT TOO BRIGHT WHICH IS &#x27;PERFECT AT NIGHT HANGING ON THE WALL.Anyone would love it.</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife. Seems to work as advertised. Wife is happy.</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase. The unit is relatively quiet, simple and works better than expected. It is so convenient to use every day. The night light is a small but appreciated bonus!</li>
            <li> Fast, smooth and easy!  The wall mount saves time in the daily routine of drying hair.  I should buy one for each bathroom!</li>
            <li> everything I wanted. I mounted it in my motorhome and I love that I can remove it to take with me if I&#x27;m using a public shower. Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Everything I wanted in a hair dryer!  Power!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my wall mounted dryer that I bought for $5 at a yard sale 15 years ago which finally bit the dust.  I didn&#x27;t really believe the tourmaline hype but this dryer does seem to make it easier to comb out long, tangled hair.  And the hair seems silkier when dry.  I would give the product 5 stars except you can&#x27;t turn off the night light.  I&#x27;ve mounted it inside a cabinet where I can shut the door but otherwise would have to put ugly black tape over the light.  With so many studies showing that light disrupts healthy sleep, one would think that manufacturers would stop putting night lights on everything, or at least offer the option to turn it off.  If I wanted a night light, I would buy one.  I shouldn&#x27;t have to put up with one on a $50 hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Wall mount is out of the way. night light is convenient. I first saw this in a motel.</li>
            <li> Works great, mounted to the wall out of the way.</li>
            <li> I had my old GE wall type hair dryer for 13 years.  Sadly it passed away.  I had the old metal bracket on the wall and thought &amp;#34;if only I could get the same dryer to fit the old bracket.  I wasn&#x27;t eager to start filling the holes and repainting the spot and maybe the whole bathroom if I couldn&#x27;t match the wall color.&lt;br /&gt;Yippee!  I ordered one that looked similar and attached over the old bracket.&lt;br /&gt;The new dryer is perfect!</li>
            <li> Replaces and Conair that lasted for at least 14 years.  I&#x27;m not sure why this dryer has a night light built in; I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> This is my second hair dryer of this type. Really like these. Light, easy to install and work well.</li>
            <li> At first I thought that the light would be a negative but it works great as a night like when we have to get up at night.  And the dryer has more power than my old one so it doesn&#x27;t take as long to dry my hair.  Thank you for your prompt service.</li>
            <li> Out of the box, the high-low switch was broken. There is no low speed. The dryer sounds bad, as if it is not going to last very long.</li>
            <li> Just got it and works great so far but then the first I got also worked but just after 1 year started to spark and smoke.  Not a lot of use.  Thought I would give sunbeam one more try.  Will update later.</li>
            <li> Perfect replaced old one I was very pleased with.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Hairdryer works great! Quick install&lt;br /&gt;and was able to use the old wall mount&lt;br /&gt;bracket from previous wall mount dryer.&lt;br /&gt;Love the nightlight however wished you&lt;br /&gt;could turn it on and off with a switch instead&lt;br /&gt;of unplugging.</li>
            <li> After spending another vacation week in a Hilton using this wonderful dryer, I knew it would be disappointing to go home and not have one. Its compact, perfect heat settings (2) and so easy to use. The cord is the perfect length. I never take a blowdryer with me when I travel because I just love these wall mounted ones by Sunbeam. You have one button to push to turn it on and then when you&#x27;re done, just put the dryer back into its holder and it automatically turns off. Its easy to clean, and easy to change the wattage setting. I mounted it near my mirror and the nightlight which I thought would not be a good thing, turns out to be so perfect in the middle of the night. Having two heat settings as far as inside the dryer to save electricity is great for those that want a softer not as hot two-setting dryer or those that are trying to save money among other things. Its perfect, I gave away my other dryer and never looked back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get it, you&#x27;ll love it, really I promise.</li>
            <li> Excellent, perfect amount of air speed without blowing your hair everywhere like the newer high speed dryers. My second purchase.</li>
            <li> Small &amp; powerful. Perfect if you have a lot  of hair!</li>
            <li> Good quality hair dryer with enough power to even satisfy my wife.  You can feel the quality while using.</li>
            <li> My wife is very satisfied with the gift that was purchased for Christmas.  When she is happy I am happy and that is speaks volumes for the product.</li>
            <li> The product is wonderful, I never have to put it away! Easy mounting instructions and the bonus nightlight are why I purchased this product. It was delivered in a timely fashion. This is not my first wall-mount hairdryer but I really like this one and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer. I have had it for a couple of years and it still performs like a new one.</li>
            <li> I very much like the dual power and styling of this dryer.  The lint filter is very nice, too.  Since purchasing it about a month ago it has performed flawlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A small &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; is that the mounting bracket has &amp;#34;play&amp;#34; and the unit does not feel solidly mounted even though the mounting bracket is very tightly screwed into the wall.  To remedy this, I cut a Styrofoam cup into strips and wedged pieces between the dryer and the wall.  This tightened up the &amp;#34;play&amp;#34; to where the unit seems solidly mounted and the foam wedges do not show.</li>
            <li> This is my second one (the first one overheated, melted one of the fan blades, and couldn&#x27;t be repaired.)  Hopefully that was just a fluke.  This is a handy space saver in a small bathroom - no cords, no storage issues.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 12/18/15:&lt;br /&gt;Oops, the second one just blew up.  The fan inside breaks apart and will scare you half to death.  Too bad.  It was really convenient.</li>
            <li> Looked nice.  Didn&#x27;t even turn it on as it was too large for my space to hang it.  Need to have dimensions in description.</li>
            <li> A nice little dryer that keeps your counter top clear. Doesn&#x27;t have a very strong blower but seems to dry hair just as fast.</li>
