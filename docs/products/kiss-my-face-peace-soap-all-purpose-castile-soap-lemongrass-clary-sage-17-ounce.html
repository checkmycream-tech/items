    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Excellent.</li>
            <li>The soap was great - and rated well on EWG site for toxicity.  </li>
            <li>Great for the kitchen, though I use it in the guest powder room.</li>
            <li>Smells great and cleans well.</li>
            <li>It would work very nicely as a kitchen soap or a cleaner.</li>
            <li>Pleasant, not overpowering scent.  </li>
            <li>Pleasant aroma, and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>It has a great smell and lathers nicely.</li>
            <li>but still it smells so good.</li>
            <li>It does smell really really really good.</li>
            <li>Love that the ingredients are safer (had a good EWG rating).</li>
            <li>This product has a really nice smell and can be used all over the body.</li>
            <li>Nice soap.  </li>
            <li>This is a very strong, spicy smelling soap.</li>
            <li>The soap itself does not contain &#x27;controversial&#x27; ingredients.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for more of a sage herbal smell, but it is still a nice product.</li>
            <li>its perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>If you forget to check the pump every time you wash your hands, you end up with soap on the floor, on the counter, and most times on yourself or your guests visiting.  </li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive nose and the smell is fairly potent, but perfect for summer since lemongrass is a huge mosquito deterrent.  </li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>A portion of the proceeds go to make the world a better place.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I&#x27;m allergic to soy and most fragrances.</li>
            <li>We love this soap.  </li>
            <li>and I fell in love with a lot of them.  </li>
            <li>and I really love the scent of this one.  </li>
            <li>It cleans really well and feels great on the hands too.  </li>
            <li>this is my favorite liquid soap product for the bathroom.</li>
            <li>This is to oily to get a lather but ok for cleaning make up brushes.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this soap.</li>
            <li>now have tried different brand castile soap and this one isn&#x27;t the best.</li>
            <li>Now I use different brand, that thing is awesome.</li>
            <li>Pretty good in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I have free shipping from prime</li>
            <li>easily.</li>
            <li>Smells okay, and my hands are clean.</li>
            <li>but the aroma is a bit too strong for me.  </li>
            <li>Or use it in the bath if you like spiced, strong smelling soap/shampoo.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t my favorite scent for Kiss My Face products, but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>It is light and does soap up.  </li>
            <li>I love the soap, I love the company, I just wish the soap didn&#x27;t plug up the spout so much.</li>
            <li>The unique scents are fun and interesting.</li>
            <li>very fresh clean smell.</li>
            <li>The smell is rich and citrus while washing but mellow after it&#x27;s rinsed off.</li>
            <li>It should perform like a castile soap and clean</li>
            <li>skin clean!&lt;br /&gt;Smell is mild after rinsing</li>
            <li>It also dries quickly at the spout and if you forget to scrape it off each time you will squirt it everywhere.</li>
            <li>but if you stay aware you can keep it clean.</li>
            <li>So lemony fresh.  </li>
            <li>and I wash my hands pretty often.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>It cleans pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>was my first review after the first camping trip.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>I love this product, does not leave you feeling slimy like regular soap.</li>
            <li>It smells good and does the job without the harsh chemicals!</li>
            <li>but this is such an easy fix</li>
            <li>It smells mostly like lemongrass and not very much like sage.</li>
            <li>The only think I didn&#x27;t enjoy was that the nozzle gunks up after a week or so.</li>
            <li>Perhaps the formula can be adjusted so that it doesn&#x27;t build up so much.</li>
            <li>I really like.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I realized how much work I&#x27;ve been putting into rinsing after using this soap because it always leaves the feeling that I still have soap.</li>
            <li>I only wish they had a bigger size to use as a refill, since I have my own soap dispensers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend giving this a try for people with sensitive skin, or for those who just want a more natural product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Since this has gotten harder to find, I&#x27;ve switch to 7th Generation: Free and Clear</li>
            <li>The soap tends to clot and the soap sprayed our clothes - and actually sprayed my husband right in his eye!  </li>
            <li>Only drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t suds as much as the average body wash, so I feel like I need to use more on the loofah, but that&#x27;s castile soap for you.</li>
            <li>I tried different smell that was minty something, and that thing was pure garbage.</li>
            <li>I just pour them in the old bottles</li>
            <li>Not harsh on the hands.</li>
            <li>The soap works well enough to get the grime off me, even the sticky gunk from working on my bike, so being useful definitely gets it</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m not careful, the soap will shoot all over the bathroom if the spout is plugged.</li>
            <li>I have been trying to change over from dangerous chemicals in the house to safer ones and I have heard a lot of good things about castile soap.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;KMF - please redesign your pump to point down</li>
            <li> little spendy&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on a few dishes, and it has handled the dishes well also.</li>
            <li> Would give it five stars if it were a little less expensive.</li>
            <li> of 6 pumps have broken during shipping -</li>
            <li> but it arrives broken every time</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like the smell and ingredients but after a couple of days the pump got clogged up.  When I went to pump soap, it squirted soap on my hair and shirt.  If you forget to check the pump every time you wash your hands, you end up with soap on the floor, on the counter, and most times on yourself or your guests visiting.  I have now moved this to my sink only and am used to scraping the pump every time I use it.  I have purchased the lavender mandarin for the other rooms, and it has not had the same problem.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. It has a great smell and lathers nicely. Sometimes the pump output starts to clog but if you stay aware you can keep it clean. easily.</li>
            <li> I bought this during winter, but immediately set it aside for summer after smelling it. I have a sensitive nose and the smell is fairly potent, but perfect for summer since lemongrass is a huge mosquito deterrent.  Love that the ingredients are safer (had a good EWG rating).</li>
            <li> I love this soap. The unique scents are fun and interesting. The soap itself does not contain &#x27;controversial&#x27; ingredients. A portion of the proceeds go to make the world a better place. What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I&#x27;m allergic to soy and most fragrances. This is now the only soap I&#x27;ll buy because it doesn&#x27;t bother my skin and I wash my hands pretty often. The smell is rich and citrus while washing but mellow after it&#x27;s rinsed off. The smell is actually from sage and lemongrass so it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. The soap works well enough to get the grime off me, even the sticky gunk from working on my bike, so being useful definitely gets it the fifth star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Gets skin clean!&lt;br /&gt;Smell is mild after rinsing&lt;br /&gt;No soy - not even mixed tocopherols / Vitamin E&lt;br /&gt;No &amp;#34;fragrances&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Pump works well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;A little spendy&lt;br /&gt;2 of 6 pumps have broken during shipping - I just pour them in the old bottles so it doesn&#x27;t matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend giving this a try for people with sensitive skin, or for those who just want a more natural product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Since this has gotten harder to find, I&#x27;ve switch to 7th Generation: Free and Clear</li>
            <li> This product has a really nice smell and can be used all over the body. I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I only wish they had a bigger size to use as a refill, since I have my own soap dispensers.</li>
            <li> We love this soap.  It smells good and does the job without the harsh chemicals!</li>
            <li> I have been trying to change over from dangerous chemicals in the house to safer ones and I have heard a lot of good things about castile soap.  Decided to try this one along with other scents and I fell in love with a lot of them.  I use this one for hand soap and my boyfriend and I really love the scent of this one.  It cleans really well and feels great on the hands too.  Definitely suggest this over other products as a safer yet efficient cleaning product.</li>
            <li> Cleans well without drying hands.  Pleasant, not overpowering scent.  I&#x27;ve used it on a few dishes, and it has handled the dishes well also. Once in awhile the dispenser clogs a bit - I&#x27;ve watered it down just a tad and this has improved - still thick enough to not be  messy for my 4 year old to use.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of it&#x27;s very low toxicity rating by EWG.org but the aroma is a bit too strong for me.  It also dries quickly at the spout and if you forget to scrape it off each time you will squirt it everywhere.</li>
            <li> This is a very strong, spicy smelling soap. It smells mostly like lemongrass and not very much like sage. I was hoping for more of a sage herbal smell, but it is still a nice product. It would work very nicely as a kitchen soap or a cleaner. Or use it in the bath if you like spiced, strong smelling soap/shampoo. The scent definitely stays on your skin. This isn&#x27;t my favorite scent for Kiss My Face products, but it&#x27;s not bad. A quality castile soap.</li>
            <li> Not too crazy about the smell.  I buy these for my body wash because of lack of harmful chemicals. I prefer the pomegranate one over this smell.  It is light and does soap up.  Pretty good in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The soap was great - and rated well on EWG site for toxicity.  But beware the pump!!  The soap tends to clot and the soap sprayed our clothes - and actually sprayed my husband right in his eye!  OUCH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KMF - please redesign your pump to point down please</li>
            <li> its perfect for sensitive skin. very fresh clean smell. DONT get the lavender scent, its too perfume-ey. this is my favorite liquid soap product for the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Smells okay, and my hands are clean. The only think I didn&#x27;t enjoy was that the nozzle gunks up after a week or so. It builds up so much so that at times, the soap shoots out towards random locations. Perhaps the formula can be adjusted so that it doesn&#x27;t build up so much.</li>
            <li> I love the soap, I love the company, I just wish the soap didn&#x27;t plug up the spout so much. If I&#x27;m not careful, the soap will shoot all over the bathroom if the spout is plugged.</li>
            <li> Nice soap.  Exactly what I was looking for.  So lemony fresh.  Great for the kitchen, though I use it in the guest powder room.</li>
            <li> This is to oily to get a lather but ok for cleaning make up brushes. It should perform like a castile soap and clean well but it dosent.</li>
            <li> Smells great and cleans well. Only drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t suds as much as the average body wash, so I feel like I need to use more on the loofah, but that&#x27;s castile soap for you.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this soap. It&#x27;s not overpowering at all but still it smells so good. It cleans pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;I used it on my face, hands, dishes. Nothing to complain&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;That was my first review after the first camping trip.&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;ve changed my mind. It does smell really really really good. That&#x27;s one thing I really like.&lt;br /&gt;I now have tried different brand castile soap and this one isn&#x27;t the best. I realized how much work I&#x27;ve been putting into rinsing after using this soap because it always leaves the feeling that I still have soap. It doesn&#x27;t wash oily dishes well either. Now I use different brand, that thing is awesome. I don&#x27;t need to work since the soap is doing all the work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And another thing I noticed is that this kiss my face peace soap has different formula for different smell. I tried different smell that was minty something, and that thing was pure garbage. I would put some soap in my hand and I have to rub my hand under running water for next 3 minutes to get the soap off.</li>
            <li> I love this product, does not leave you feeling slimy like regular soap. I am only giving it one star because every time I order this they ship it in a plastic bag stuffed inside a padded envelope. I know this part will shock everyone...but it arrives broken every time and I have to send it back. I&#x27;m glad I have free shipping from prime but this is such an easy fix I don&#x27;t understand why it is shipped this way.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Pleasant aroma, and not overpowering. Not harsh on the hands. Would give it five stars if it were a little less expensive.</li>
