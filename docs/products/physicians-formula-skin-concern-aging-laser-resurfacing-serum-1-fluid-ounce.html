            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE this product and really do see results with it!</li>
            <li>Obviously, wasn&#x27;t good for my skin type.</li>
            <li>I love this serum, I just wish that it went on sale from time to time or larger quantities were available.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and love it.</li>

            <li>I bet you if you have not yet found something that you absolutely adore but have tried just about everything and feel like it&#x27;s all the same that you&#x27;ve been searching for a miracle product without realizing it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never broken out from this, in fact I noticed immediate results the first morning after I used it moisture-wise and it even helps cut down on my break outs, which I&#x27;ve always had problems with, especially around my mouth and on my chin.</li>
            <li>Believe me, when you have been married for a long time and your husband runs the back of his hand down your face to feel the softness, you sit up and take notice.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Its what I can afford to use freely.  Don&#x27;t remember a bad review of Physicians Formula Products.</li>
            <li> What is it women look for in moisturizers? Miracles. I bet you if you have not yet found something that you absolutely adore but have tried just about everything and feel like it&#x27;s all the same that you&#x27;ve been searching for a miracle product without realizing it. I didn&#x27;t know I was looking for one until I found this. I buy it in bulk, better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used. I have combination skin; Oily in my T zone and chin, normal on the rest of my face. It&#x27;s so hard to find a moisturizer for oily skin that isn&#x27;t TOO heavy and causes a break out. I&#x27;ve never broken out from this, in fact I noticed immediate results the first morning after I used it moisture-wise and it even helps cut down on my break outs, which I&#x27;ve always had problems with, especially around my mouth and on my chin. It even completely got rid of acne scars on it&#x27;s own in less than six months. This is my miracle moisturizer. Better than any Estee Lauder or expensive moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried that costs almost a car payment. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone. I even get compliments on my skin again which I haven&#x27;t had since before I was a teenager and my break outs started. Thank you Physicians Formula. You absolutely saved my skin.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel smooth and soft. Big fan of products from Physicians Formula.</li>
            <li> After 64 years of neglecting my skin, I FINALLY decided to start taking care of it.  My expectations were very low.  After all, how could I expect a product to improve my skin when I have taken it for granted for all these years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am here to say that miracles can happen in a small purple bottle.  I have been using this product for 2 weeks and can already see that my skin is firmer, pores are smaller and my fine lines are actually beginning to disappear.  I have taken pictures of me BEFORE because I do want to compare the AFTER in 4 weeks.  But I already know that I will see big changes.  My husband even noticed that my skin is noticeably smoother and brighter.  Believe me, when you have been married for a long time and your husband runs the back of his hand down your face to feel the softness, you sit up and take notice.  I also think that my deeper wrinkles are diminishing.  But that was after my husband&#x27;s positive comments, so I guess we should take that into account.  The AFTER pictures that I will take in 4 weeks will prove if I have imagined the improvement or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product.  I don&#x27;t wear makeup of any kind.  So having a product make my skin look good au naturale is perfect for me.</li>
