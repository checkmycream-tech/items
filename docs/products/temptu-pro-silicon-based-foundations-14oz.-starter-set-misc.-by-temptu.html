            <li> ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT......WITH A AWESOME FINISH. IF YOUR ARTIST KNOWS WHAT HE OR SHE IS DOING THE RESULTS WILL BE FLAWLESS. IT IS EASY TO USE AND IT LASTS A LONG TIME. I GIVE IT TWO THUMBS UP.....A GREAT STARTER KIT TO HAVE.</li>
            <li> These foundations work well with or without an airbrush machine. The coverage is flawless and the foundations also work well as concealers. Didn&#x27;t cover tatoos as well as I was expecting, but great \\&quot;natural\\&quot; make-up look!</li>
            <li> I have written 2 E-mails on this matter. I still have not received this item. I have sent 2 email with no response yet.  Can you please rectify this situation as soon as possible.  I will not recommend this company to anyone due to the fact that&lt;br /&gt;I have not received my purchase yet and due to the fact that I can not get anyone to respond to me!</li>
            <li> Great selection of colors. I purchased this pack of samples in the beginning of my airbrush journey. I wanted to get the perfect match and wanted to try all the products in the comfort of my own house for a cheap price. I would recommend this to anyone whos deciding on switching to airbrush. Its a great snag and highly recommended !!!</li>
            <li> Now, granted, these are my first airbrush foundations but I cannot stress enough how much I love them! I use them with an Iwata airbrush system and they are flawless. I will never go back to regular makeup again. My makeup looks incredible and I can wear it through sweating and swimming at the beach. Great investment and great products. I am looking forward to buying the blushes and highlights set next! P.S. A little goes a very long way with these and my clients love them too :)</li>
            <li> In LOVE with these foundations for airbrushing.  I&#x27;m a pro MUA and my clients love the finish and the fact that it feels like there is nothing on their face.  Just ordered full sized bottles from Temptu&#x27;s site.  This is great for trying them out and ships fast.</li>
            <li> While I wont use most of the shades, this kit really helped me determine which colors I need for regular use, so I didn&#x27;t waste money on full bottles of product I wont use. I also really love that the rarely used colors work as mixers for the perfect blend. High quality.</li>
            <li> Nice variety pack. Every shade in the human rainbow. Little bit goes a long ways. Can get multiple uses out of each bottle.</li>
            <li> Brides love this makeup and the look is so natural you have to keep using this product&lt;br /&gt;Colors are very close to skin tones</li>
            <li> Was delivered on time like it said and I love it</li>
            <li> The bottles are tiny, but it has worked out so I could try them and make a decision from there. Good coverage and nice finish.</li>
            <li> These are okay. Kind of small and pricey. The have good coverage but I don&#x27;t like the way it looks on me. The are silicon based instead of water based like most airbrush foundations. I think I prefer the water based. Water based dries faster and washes away faster yet stays on all day. These have staying power but take longer to dry and longer to wash off. I still use them when going Glam and I need extra coverage.</li>
            <li> I am a makeup artist &amp; use these on all my brides. You cannot go wrong with these. Silicon is perfect for brides because it doesn&#x27;t sweat off like water based. The only issue I have is that I constantly have to use a needle to unclog the holes. Other than that these are perfect.</li>
            <li> I have used Temptu products for years, they are easy to use, easy to store and move when needed. They look great on skin. I have used an airbrush as well as sponges or brushes at times to apply the makeup.</li>
            <li> Great Product! I would recommend to friends and co worker. Thanks for such a user friendly tool. It made my job easy, and my customer look great!!</li>
            <li> Have to add water. Foundation is very thick</li>
            <li> The make-up was old and has thickened so it wouldnt spray out and just clogged my machine taking a long time to clean. Works okay if you mix it with other make-up but too much work everytime.</li>
            <li> Got them and they were expired by 2 years!!</li>
            <li> best product ever!!!!! i loved it!!!!! i trust amazon soooo much i always buy my stuff here cause is the best place to get everything for the right price</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to start airbrushing or just looking for an option to put in your makeup kit, this is the product for you! You really dont need to use that much if you are airbrushing correctly so these little guys will go a long way, especially if you mix your colors. I keep several foundation lines in my kit and this is by far my favorite silicone base foundation!</li>
