    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>and I am definitely happy with the product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want my wax lady to think I don&#x27;t clean up!!!</li>
            <li>This cream was good.</li>
            <li>This product did not do a good job at numbing for me.</li>
            <li>it is awesome for real!!</li>
            <li>Awesome- made the waxing (especially in sensitive areas) a breeze!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>and i honestly didnt feel ANYTHING during my brazillian wax.</li>
            <li>If you can time it right this is great.</li>
            <li>It was just too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>I used the cream as suggested but my Brazilian was still the most pain I&#x27;ve ever felt.</li>
            <li>It works okay.</li>
            <li>Be sure to let it sit for the suggested amount of time so it can work its magic.</li>
            <li>It should be $10 at most.</li>
            <li>The amount of discomfort more than doubled on the un-creamed leg.  </li>
            <li>and I gave it as a goofy birthday gift, and it didn&#x27;t work for her either.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>And let me tell you what a HUGE difference it makes - there were spots I missed with the cream</li>
            <li>I always see a huge difference when I forget to use it.</li>
            <li>I was a HUGE skeptic and didn&#x27;t think it was going to work for me.</li>
            <li>Will continue to use this product, I left it on for the 45 minutes before my wax &amp; it worked great</li>
            <li>I got enough off that I&#x27;m happy with it</li>
            <li>It ended up kicking in most half way through my wax and made things more pleasant</li>
            <li>If you are going for a Brazilian, don&#x27;t go without putting this on first!!</li>
            <li>This cream really reduces the pain from waxing the bikini area!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing, make sure you follow their directions on how much time to allow it to work properly!!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li>My first was went well even though I freaked and didn&#x27;t finish.</li>
            <li>If buying, I think I&#x27;d recommend getting waxed as soon as it feels numb and not waiting for it to get better near the time they say gives best results.</li>
            <li>It really didnt hurt!</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy this cream again when I run out :-)</li>
            <li>I followed the directions but can&#x27;t say it really helped at all.  </li>
            <li>I epilate which may be why it does not work very well for me.</li>
            <li>it REALLY works.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Hope this helps and thanks for reading.</li>
            <li>Just a month ago, it took me a whole hour to get a brazilian wax, because I had to stop the technician and ask for recovery time.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first, but was extremely satisfied with this product!!    </li>
            <li>No it does not completely take the pain away but it made a huge difference when compared to having no numbing at all.</li>
            <li>I also forgot to take pain reliever before...which is something the salon highly recommends.</li>
            <li>For the purpose its supposed o be used for (ie waxing) it does not numb enough at all.</li>
            <li>With about $18 per tube, you can get a good 3 brazilians out of it, which makes your brazilian just $6 more expensive!!       </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very sensitive to pain and the No Scream Cream Relax and Wax minimized the discomfort of waxing.</li>
            <li>I left it on for the full 45 minutes allowing it to dry for 10 minutes before I put my underwear back on.</li>
            <li>I used this product for the first time before getting a brazilian, used it on my underarms and used a little around my ankles too.</li>
            <li>but I think paying this amount for a 1 ounce bottle is a little much.</li>

            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very sensitive to pain and the No Scream Cream Relax and Wax minimized the discomfort of waxing.</li>
            <li> I left it on for the full 45 minutes allowing it to dry for 10 minutes before I put my underwear back on.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time before getting a brazilian, used it on my underarms and used a little around my ankles too.</li>
            <li> but I think paying this amount for a 1 ounce bottle is a little much.</li>
            <li> I put it on a good half an hour before my waxing appointment and it did not make me numb at all.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to put a percentage on it, but 90% less sounds about right.</li>
            <li> It was also very messy &amp; interfered with the waxing process, even after I wiped it completely off.</li>
            <li> This product definitely lessened the pain and there was MUCH less irritation afterwards.</li>
            <li> How much this cream reduces the unpleasant sting was made apparent when I used it on only one leg.</li>
            <li> probably the most painful wax appointment I have ever had.  </li>
            <li> Once this tube is empty</li>
            <li> I applied it properly and with the required time according to the instructions, but I still felt everything the way I usually do.</li>
            <li> I was sooooooo skeptical but it really works!</li>
            <li> I waited 35 minutes to put clothes on, and there was still a thick layer left.</li>
            <li> I can tell a slight pain reduction but it still hurts so</li>
            <li> you can still feel it just slightly minimized.  </li>
            <li> Today, I had another brazilian, and the pain was SIGNIFICANTLY less.</li>
            <li> I would amount it to slight discomfort.</li>
            <li> It helped a little in some areas I can say but the pain is still there.</li>
            <li> I think it did help the hair to come out a little easier.</li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;ll just pop an advil and tough it out.</li>
            <li> I have had a few bikini waxes &amp; they do hurt</li>
            <li> The pulling of the hard wax doesn&#x27;t usually hurt me but when my waxxist plucks little hairs and pull out my ingrowns</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if it helped.</li>
            <li> I got this for my first ever Brazilian and was disappointed.</li>
            <li> So after researching I ran across this cream and decided why not - so this past weekend when I got my legs done</li>
            <li> I also took midol as usual before my wax.</li>
            <li> A waste of money, wish I could return it!</li>
            <li> When I got to my salon, my esthetician wiped it off, and when she went for my brazilian the pain was 85% less!!</li>
            <li> but the instructions say to apply and wait at least 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I took 2 advils and 1 tylenol an hour before, applied the scream in a thick layer an hour before my appointment, and wiped it off when I got to the waxing salon).</li>
            <li> This product completely numbs the area for a bikini wax - MUCH less painful process!  </li>
            <li> Using the cream about 40minutes before waxing / epilating makes the whole process less painful!!</li>
            <li> Waxing is just painful but the four times I used it, only seemed like two of those times helped.</li>
            <li> I read reviews on some other creams that supposedly really numb the area</li>
            <li> and I have to say it was a little painful.</li>
            <li> All you felt was the initial tug, which isn&#x27;t that bad at all!!</li>
            <li> unfortunately, this product did not ease the pain of getting a wax.</li>
            <li> I wrong-</li>
            <li> This is not going to make you feel numb or make the pain go away 100 percent be prepared.</li>
            <li> It does numb</li>
            <li> so so bad.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t nearly as bad as getting my arms done.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s how numb my bikini area was!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> If you are going for a Brazilian, don&#x27;t go without putting this on first!! It&#x27;s amazing, make sure you follow their directions on how much time to allow it to work properly!!</li>
            <li> I used the cream as suggested but my Brazilian was still the most pain I&#x27;ve ever felt. I&#x27;ve never had a Brazilian before &amp; I have a low pain tolerance so I&#x27;m not sure if it helped. I also forgot to take pain reliever before...which is something the salon highly recommends.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but was extremely satisfied with this product!!    I used this product for the first time before getting a brazilian, used it on my underarms and used a little around my ankles too. I waited 35 minutes to put clothes on, and there was still a thick layer left. But, the directions said you can get dressed n 30-45 and so I did. When I got to my salon, my esthetician wiped it off, and when she went for my brazilian the pain was 85% less!! All you felt was the initial tug, which isn&#x27;t that bad at all!! With about $18 per tube, you can get a good 3 brazilians out of it, which makes your brazilian just $6 more expensive!!       A definite MUST HAVE for brazilianers!!    (the lemon scrub that Relax and Wax makes is also a greatttt companion!)</li>
            <li> Tried this before getting a Brazilian sugaring.  I followed the directions but can&#x27;t say it really helped at all.  Next time I&#x27;ll just pop an advil and tough it out.</li>
            <li> Waxing is just painful but the four times I used it, only seemed like two of those times helped. Guess it depends on your pain tolerance.</li>
            <li> Awesome- made the waxing (especially in sensitive areas) a breeze!</li>
            <li> It works okay. I epilate which may be why it does not work very well for me. I can tell a slight pain reduction but it still hurts so so so bad.</li>
            <li> Bought this with No Trauma Momma. Don&#x27;t know how I got through a wax before this.... it REALLY works. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have had a few bikini waxes &amp; they do hurt so I thought I would try this. I love it! No it does not completely take the pain away but it made a huge difference when compared to having no numbing at all. Will continue to use this product, I left it on for the 45 minutes before my wax &amp; it worked great</li>
            <li> I used the cream 45 mins before my wax today. I have been getting waxes for about 3 years now and Im used to the pain but thought I would give this a try. It helped a little in some areas I can say but the pain is still there. This is not going to make you feel numb or make the pain go away 100 percent be prepared. I think it did help the hair to come out a little easier. Once this tube is empty Im just going to wing it like I did before!</li>
            <li> This cream was good. My first was went well even though I freaked and didn&#x27;t finish. I got enough off that I&#x27;m happy with it and I am definitely happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I got this for my first ever Brazilian and was disappointed. It does numb but the instructions say to apply and wait at least 10 minutes.  They recommended 30 to 45. Well, it noticeably numbed but by 30 minutes out wasn&#x27;t anymore. If buying, I think I&#x27;d recommend getting waxed as soon as it feels numb and not waiting for it to get better near the time they say gives best results.</li>
            <li> I had gotten my arms waxed without the cream and I have to say it was a little painful. But I like how it leaves my arms looking and how it feels. So I knew when I was going to have my legs waxed that I was going to have to do something - there was NO WAY I was going to make it through getting my legs waxed without some help. So after researching I ran across this cream and decided why not - so this past weekend when I got my legs done I tried out the cream. And let me tell you what a HUGE difference it makes - there were spots I missed with the cream and I definitely could tell - overall it wasn&#x27;t nearly as bad as getting my arms done. For any guys out there thinking about waxing GET THIS CREAM (AND FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS). Hope this helps and thanks for reading.</li>
            <li> It was just too good to be true.  It is a bit of an inconvenience to remember to do it 30 min before, and I feel subconsious when I go in to my waxing appointment because the cream leaves a white residue.  I don&#x27;t want my wax lady to think I don&#x27;t clean up!!!</li>
            <li> This cream really reduces the pain from waxing the bikini area!!! I would highly recommend it!!! it is awesome for real!!</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this product before waxing the bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very sensitive to pain and the No Scream Cream Relax and Wax minimized the discomfort of waxing. It&#x27;s easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Just follow the instructional video on Utube.</li>
            <li> For the purpose its supposed o be used for (ie waxing) it does not numb enough at all. its just like putting on mint lotion, its just tingley.</li>
            <li> This cream was so helpful. Be sure to let it sit for the suggested amount of time so it can work its magic.</li>
            <li> unfortunately, this product did not ease the pain of getting a wax. I applied it properly and with the required time according to the instructions, but I still felt everything the way I usually do.</li>
            <li> If you can time it right this is great. It ended up kicking in most half way through my wax and made things more pleasant</li>
            <li> I will always wax with this stuff. I went into my appointment and my waxist rubbed it off. I left it on for the full 45 minutes allowing it to dry for 10 minutes before I put my underwear back on. I also took midol as usual before my wax. It reduces the pain by 80%!!! The pulling of the hard wax doesn&#x27;t usually hurt me but when my waxxist plucks little hairs and pull out my ingrowns I always flinch in pain. I couldn&#x27;t even feel the plucking that&#x27;s how numb my bikini area was! Hope this was helpful!!! I would have given this 5 stars but I think paying this amount for a 1 ounce bottle is a little much. It should be $10 at most.</li>
            <li> This product definitely lessened the pain and there was MUCH less irritation afterwards. I will continue to use this product!</li>
            <li> How much this cream reduces the unpleasant sting was made apparent when I used it on only one leg. The amount of discomfort more than doubled on the un-creamed leg.  I would never wax without this again.</li>
            <li> This product completely numbs the area for a bikini wax - MUCH less painful process!  I always see a huge difference when I forget to use it.</li>
            <li> Followed the directions and it not make a difference at all . I still felt everything . Save your money !!</li>
            <li> It definitely eased the pain however it doesn&#x27;t make a bikini wax painless.. you can still feel it just slightly minimized.  I read reviews on some other creams that supposedly really numb the area I think that I will try those. This cream is over priced in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I was sooooooo skeptical but it really works! I have a very low pain tolerance and i honestly didnt feel ANYTHING during my brazillian wax. It really didnt hurt! I&#x27;m going to buy JARs of this product!!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, I tried it and I gave it as a goofy birthday gift, and it didn&#x27;t work for her either.  A waste of money, wish I could return it!</li>
            <li> This product does not work at all. I put it on a good half an hour before my waxing appointment and it did not make me numb at all.  I passed up the numbing spray that my wax person uses because I thought that this would take care of it.  Boy was I wrong- probably the most painful wax appointment I have ever had.  DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and applied it 45 minutes before my appointment.  You will still scream from the pain.  Product is not at all what it claims to be  The lady put baby powder on the area too.  There were some spots on fire from the waxing.</li>
            <li> Just a month ago, it took me a whole hour to get a brazilian wax, because I had to stop the technician and ask for recovery time. I was close to walking out the door. Then, a friend recommended No Scream Cream. I was a HUGE skeptic and didn&#x27;t think it was going to work for me. Today, I had another brazilian, and the pain was SIGNIFICANTLY less. It&#x27;s hard to put a percentage on it, but 90% less sounds about right. I would amount it to slight discomfort. I can finally see myself getting brazilians every month. I am a believer and will never again wax without this scream! (PS. I took 2 advils and 1 tylenol an hour before, applied the scream in a thick layer an hour before my appointment, and wiped it off when I got to the waxing salon).</li>
            <li> Using the cream about 40minutes before waxing / epilating makes the whole process less painful!! I will definitely buy this cream again when I run out :-)</li>
            <li> This product did not do a good job at numbing for me. It was also very messy &amp; interfered with the waxing process, even after I wiped it completely off.</li>
