            <li>A great value for the price</li>
            <li>Great protection.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gel formula and it smells really good.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise smells good and helps my sweating, although I am a waitress and some sweat is unavoidable.</li>
            <li>I am always in the hunt for a good deodorant.  </li>
            <li>so it always works amazingly well for me.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve found it to be the most effective deodorant on the market.</li>
            <li>Should have known it was to good to be true.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I had to mop most of it off my armpits with a tissue.</li>
            <li>My husband and  I have used Mitchum deodorant for many years.  </li>
            <li>Love that the product is from a cruelty-free company.</li>
            <li>A Perfect Order Experience for a Long Term Favorite Product I Use</li>
            <li>And most important, works like a charm.</li>
            <li>Even Men&#x27;s Mitchum too strong for me.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>Not too strong, can be used even after shaving with no skin irritation.</li>
            <li>;  Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Total win.</li>
            <li>Something about any powder scent doesn&#x27;t work with my chemistry but the Shower clean</li>
            <li>Replacement for my wife, this is the only one she will use-must be good.</li>
            <li>It is mild on my skin, no rash or irritation like the big-brand &amp;#34;Men&#x27;s&amp;#34; stuff.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>mild scent.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>The new packaging was not designed to improve the user experience but rather to get the user to use more deoderant.  </li>
            <li>The smell is fresh and doesn&#x27;t over power</li>
            <li>Old packaging was so much better.  </li>
            <li>Fresh scent is very subtle...smells like clean shampoo even at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>The Mitchum was priced right just what I needed</li>
            <li>THANKS GLAD TO ORDER ENOUGH</li>
            <li>Really, really well.</li>
            <li>Now, too much comes out even when you try to control it.  </li>
            <li>Product works well but who wants to feel sticky for hours.</li>
            <li>, I feel very cheated.</li>
            <li>Person I gave this as a present appears happy and have never complained or said anything good or bad.</li>
            <li>Anyways, I was opening up a brand new one of these and noticed an extremely large air bubble inside the deodorant.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s something I highly appreciate as do my patients when I&#x27;m leaning over them for whatever reason.</li>
            <li>I am a 6&amp;#34;2&amp;#34; and 250 lb, normally sweaty guy.  </li>
            <li>The prices on amazon can&#x27;t be beat, and I love always having a few extras in the house.</li>
            <li>Clear in the underarms, nothing on the clothes.  </li>
            <li>I also really like that it&#x27;s a clear gel, and there hasn&#x27;t been any flaking or white residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Getting a six pack on subscription made them far cheaper than I can get it in the store.</li>
            <li>I love this formula, it doesn&#x27;t stain my black shirts and it lasts me a long long time.  </li>
            <li>only complaint is that this takes a good 5 minutes to dry each morning, and if I put on my shirt or dress before it&#x27;s completely dry, it leaves a film on the clothes.  </li>
            <li>Because so much comes out you end up wet and sticky.  </li>
            <li>For some reason, this is the only deodorant that works for me; so, naturally, I&#x27;m grateful that it exists.</li>
            <li>Only thing that works with my wild hormones :0)</li>
            <li>I got half as much gel as I was supposed to get, and at $5 a pop</li>
            <li>One of the few brands that leaves me feeling fresh all day long, and doesn&#x27;t transfer onto my clothes.</li>

            <li> One of the few brands that leaves me feeling fresh all day long, and doesn&#x27;t transfer onto my clothes.</li>
            <li> These are a terrific value, and it does a great job at keeping my underarms dry -- plus it keeps away any unpleasant odors!  </li>
            <li> And I will say, even with gel only coming out of half of the holes, there is still way, WAY too much coming out, like other reviewers said.</li>
            <li> A lot of other female deodorants have only 20%.  </li>
            <li> and it being gross, wet gel</li>
            <li> Hate the new packaging which is designed to accelerate the use up rate so that we need to buy more sooner.  </li>
            <li> This deodorant goes on so wet and tales a long time to dry.</li>
            <li> Never have done a review before but saw this on sale for 3.99 for pack of 6 (yes, pack of 6 in bold print on the title page) was skeptical but ordered anyway</li>
            <li> The minimal &amp;#34;coating&amp;#34; washes off in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But as I twisted the wheel, gel only came out of half of the holes and the air bubble went straight to the bottom of the container.</li>
            <li> This has 25% of the active ingredient for deodorants</li>
            <li> I have to hide it with a little cologne.</li>
            <li> few reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> At least with solids, there&#x27;s no chance of this happening.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no better protection!  </li>
            <li> It could be it&#x27;s not a good mix with my body chemistry.</li>
            <li> I can work a 12 hour shift and not smell like a dirty armpit by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> oh god that was bad.</li>
            <li> Getting an 8-pk on Amazon.com is a no-brainer, because it&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re going to go bad.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used a variety of brands and always come back to this one since it undoubtedly lasts longer than others for me.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Great price and received on time</li>
            <li> Great deal for a quality product.</li>
            <li> One of the few brands that leaves me feeling fresh all day long, and doesn&#x27;t transfer onto my clothes. Also, you can&#x27;t beat the price buying 6 of these for $11.</li>
            <li> Never have done a review before but saw this on sale for 3.99 for pack of 6 (yes, pack of 6 in bold print on the title page) was skeptical but ordered anyway and only 1 was delivered. Should have known it was to good to be true.</li>
            <li> Works well &amp; good deal!</li>
            <li> I am a 6&amp;#34;2&amp;#34; and 250 lb, normally sweaty guy.  I have used this Women&#x27;s anti-perspirant &amp; deodorant for about 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;A few reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1) It works.  Really, really well. Especially on odor.&lt;br /&gt;2) It is mild on my skin, no rash or irritation like the big-brand &amp;#34;Men&#x27;s&amp;#34; stuff.&lt;br /&gt;3) Shower Fresh scent is very subtle...smells like clean shampoo even at the end of the day. Even Men&#x27;s Mitchum too strong for me.&lt;br /&gt;4) Leaves no chalky/sticky residue.  The minimal &amp;#34;coating&amp;#34; washes off in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Replacement for my wife, this is the only one she will use-must be good.</li>
            <li> A Perfect Order Experience for a Long Term Favorite Product I Use</li>
            <li> She had been using one of those crystal rock things...oh god that was bad. So finally she switched and I could not be happier.</li>
            <li> This has 25% of the active ingredient for deodorants so it always works amazingly well for me.  A lot of other female deodorants have only 20%.  I have used this for years.  Clear in the underarms, nothing on the clothes.  mild scent.  And most important, works like a charm.</li>
            <li> This is my fall back deodorant.  For some reason it always works, no matter what, for days on end.  It&#x27;s a gel formula and it smells really good.  I love this formula, it doesn&#x27;t stain my black shirts and it lasts me a long long time.  The smell is fresh and doesn&#x27;t over power any of my perfume or anything.</li>
            <li> I love it.  Mitchum is the ONLY deodorant that I have found that does the job for me without chafing my underarms or allowing body odor.</li>
            <li> Hate the new packaging which is designed to accelerate the use up rate so that we need to buy more sooner.  Now, too much comes out even when you try to control it.  Because so much comes out you end up wet and sticky.  Hours later it still feels sticky.  Old packaging was so much better.  Product works well but who wants to feel sticky for hours. The new packaging was not designed to improve the user experience but rather to get the user to use more deoderant.  Time to switch to a different brand that doesn&#x27;t disrespect the user.</li>
            <li> This deodorant goes on so wet and tales a long time to dry. Otherwise smells good and helps my sweating, although I am a waitress and some sweat is unavoidable.</li>
            <li> Great value! Just as described! Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> THANKS GLAD TO ORDER ENOUGH</li>
            <li> Excellent Purchase and great savings!!</li>
            <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t bought this item. A great value for the price but I&#x27;m not too keen on the aroma. I have to hide it with a little cologne. It could be it&#x27;s not a good mix with my body chemistry.</li>
            <li> The Mitchum was priced right just what I needed</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy one from Amazon, I bought one from Walmart. Don&#x27;t know if that makes any difference. Anyways, I was opening up a brand new one of these and noticed an extremely large air bubble inside the deodorant. I thought maybe some of the gel just got displaced while it was in my bag on the ride home. But as I twisted the wheel, gel only came out of half of the holes and the air bubble went straight to the bottom of the container. I got half as much gel as I was supposed to get, and at $5 a pop and it being gross, wet gel, I feel very cheated. At least with solids, there&#x27;s no chance of this happening. And I will say, even with gel only coming out of half of the holes, there is still way, WAY too much coming out, like other reviewers said. I had to mop most of it off my armpits with a tissue.</li>
            <li> UNFORUATELY PACKAGE SAID WOMANS BUT IT SAID MENS ON THE SIDE</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know about the 48 hours but I have loved this deodorant forever!!!</li>
            <li> I have used Mitchum for several years. The only one that works for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff works!  I have had issues with odor since puberty.  This works for me.  Something about any powder scent doesn&#x27;t work with my chemistry but the Shower clean is awesome.  Not too strong, can be used even after shaving with no skin irritation.</li>
            <li> My husband and  I have used Mitchum deodorant for many years.  We&#x27;ve found it to be the most effective deodorant on the market.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant for years.  There&#x27;s no better protection!  The prices on amazon can&#x27;t be beat, and I love always having a few extras in the house.</li>
            <li> For some reason, this is the only deodorant that works for me; so, naturally, I&#x27;m grateful that it exists. Getting an 8-pk on Amazon.com is a no-brainer, because it&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re going to go bad. I&#x27;ll always need them.</li>
            <li> One of the best on the market.</li>
            <li> I am always in the hunt for a good deodorant.  These are a terrific value, and it does a great job at keeping my underarms dry -- plus it keeps away any unpleasant odors!  I also really like that it&#x27;s a clear gel, and there hasn&#x27;t been any flaking or white residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that this takes a good 5 minutes to dry each morning, and if I put on my shirt or dress before it&#x27;s completely dry, it leaves a film on the clothes.  I have found that, when it comes to ladies&#x27; deodorant, you can&#x27;t &amp;#34;have it all.&amp;#34;  Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Item arrived timely. Was purchased as a gift. Person I gave this as a present appears happy and have never complained or said anything good or bad. I can&#x27;t give an opinion of the lasting or quality feature.</li>
            <li> Great protection. I can work a 12 hour shift and not smell like a dirty armpit by the end of the day. That&#x27;s something I highly appreciate as do my patients when I&#x27;m leaning over them for whatever reason. Getting a six pack on subscription made them far cheaper than I can get it in the store. Total win.</li>
            <li> I purchased these after purchasing another batch at an earlier date from Amazon.  These are smaller in quantity and both my husband and I (he uses the sport scent) feel that we got a knock off.  Mitchum has always worked for us, now we need to shower twice a day.  This did not stop perspiration.</li>
            <li> Yes, this is Mitchum, just spelled incorrectly. Love that the product is from a cruelty-free company.</li>
            <li> Only thing that works with my wild hormones :0)</li>
            <li> You hve to wait ubtil it dries and it is not so powerfull with odor.</li>
