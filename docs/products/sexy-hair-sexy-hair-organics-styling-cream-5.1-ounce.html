    <ol>
            <li>and my hair always looks great - no complaints.</li>
            <li>I bought this not because it is &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; but because I found a great deal on it price wise.  </li>
            <li>Smells good too.</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>This is light, non sticky and gives a very nice flexible hold.  </li>
            <li>Ok product for the price.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>With that said, yes this product has a bit more of a gel product affect on your hair as opposed to cream.</li>
            <li>I received my sexy hair organic styling cream in record time</li>
            <li>and I really love it and will order it again</li>
            <li>The next time, I used about a dime size, perfect!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and it gives a more polished look.</li>
            <li>This stuff just gives me more control and body, without leaving any feeling of &#x27;product&#x27; on your hair.</li>
            <li>LOVE.</li>
            <li>I fell in love.</li>
            <li>Texture was fine, and it does what I need it to do, but the smell is really strong and perfumy!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and absolutely LOVE this styling cream.</li>
            <li>I am equally comfortable with but has a much better smell.  </li>
            <li>Great almost all natural product without a lot of chemicals in it.</li>
            <li>Full list of ingredients include many harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>This is the best product I have ever found to give body to my fine hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light weight</li>
            <li>You should try this out if your looking for a good hair cream alternative so far I&#x27;m pretty satisfied</li>
            <li>Made my hair super greasy.</li>
            <li>While doing my hair at my sister&#x27;s house I seen this product in her bathroom tested on a quick braid out</li>
            <li>Very light hold, just as I like, so that my hair looks natural.</li>
            <li>, so far I see that my hair loves sexy organics</li>
            <li>I completed my whole head with this product and combined it with water and eucalyptus oil, I am excited to see what my hair looks like in the am.</li>
            <li>After loosing my favorite Redken #3 volumizing styling product, and many returned purchases in the search for a comparabile product, I stumbled upon this little gem at my stylist&#x27;s salon - she had received it as a sample and gave it to me.</li>
            <li>A new search brought me to Andalou Naturals Smooth Hold Styling Cream  which</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I put about a quarter size amount in my hair...</li>
            <li>and I instantly fell in love...</li>
            <li>I bought my first bottle of this at Ross to try it and see how it worked.</li>
            <li>Since it has been discontinued in most places, I know I will have to find something to replace it sooner or later.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t have much of a hold</li>
            <li>Great product after I figured a little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li>Not only did it make my soft and way easier to detangle, it added body and a natural sheen to my hair that I am in love with.</li>
            <li>I normally use distilled water, castor oil, a little dax, and essential oils, which is good...</li>
            <li>Ahhh, both my husband (thick, wirey straight hair) and I (thick, soft straight hair) have found the perfect hair product for both of us!</li>
            <li>Initially I had given this a higher rating but while my primary focus is on natural products, I simply could not get use to the smell and ended up tossing the last bottle out.</li>
            <li>Gel is too hard, mousse is too flakey, most styling creams are too greasy and ineffective.</li>
            <li>I buy a lot of natural products and understand that the more natural the more the chance that it can go bad.</li>
            <li>I was looking a for a hair product that was white or clear that wouldn&#x27;t turn my silver hair yellow like their Short Sexy Hair line did after regular use.</li>
            <li>The hold is ok, but not great even when used with a diffuser.</li>
            <li>You only need a little bit of this product to style, too much and its going to look like you put gel in your hair.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> You only need a little bit of this product to style, too much and its going to look like you put gel in your hair.  </li>
            <li> so itʻs hard for me to find the right product.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and gives average hold for my natural curl.  </li>
            <li> Itʻs lightweight enough that it doesnʻt weigh down my curls but also tough enough that it helps them keep shape and also helps smooth my hair if I straighten it and tames the fizz.</li>
            <li> I blow dry my short, straight, hard to manage hair daily.</li>
            <li> Not a scent I expected from this brand.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I am looking forward to buying this as well as other products from this line.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t have that perfumy smell like other hair gels and creams that&#x27;s how you know what&#x27;s organic and what isn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> This product provides the volume/lift I desire for the crown without weighing my hair down.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very curly and very thin</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair that I set to be wavy.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little watery</li>
            <li> After your hair dries sometimes there are a few flyaways</li>
            <li> you only need a little bit for you hair smells weird</li>
            <li> Found out the hard way.</li>
            <li> I just bought it cause i was looking for an organic type of gel because all those years of using crazy hair products have been making my hair fall</li>
            <li> and it was already bad.</li>
            <li> I guess if you like that fragrance, it wouldn&#x27;t be so bad, but I can&#x27;t stand it.</li>
            <li> The smell was making me sick.</li>
            <li> Too bad!</li>
            <li> It was just terrible.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Lightweight and gives average hold for my natural curl.  No fragrance.  Ok product for the price.  Will try a different product next time.</li>
            <li> Ahhh, both my husband (thick, wirey straight hair) and I (thick, soft straight hair) have found the perfect hair product for both of us! This is light, non sticky and gives a very nice flexible hold.  Also non-toxic- yippee!</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever found to give body to my fine hair without weighing it down. It makes styling a breeze.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It adds shine, eliminates frizz and adds body and volume. Very light hold, just as I like, so that my hair looks natural. I have curly/wavy frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this not because it is &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; but because I found a great deal on it price wise.  You only need a little bit of this product to style, too much and its going to look like you put gel in your hair.  With that said, yes this product has a bit more of a gel product affect on your hair as opposed to cream.</li>
            <li> I buy a lot of natural products and understand that the more natural the more the chance that it can go bad. I unfortunatly bought this and it was already bad. The hold is ok, but not great even when used with a diffuser.</li>
            <li> Initially I had given this a higher rating but while my primary focus is on natural products, I simply could not get use to the smell and ended up tossing the last bottle out. It was just terrible. A new search brought me to Andalou Naturals Smooth Hold Styling Cream  which I am equally comfortable with but has a much better smell.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0052P1D68?psc&#x3D;1&amp;redirect&#x3D;true&amp;ref_&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00</li>
            <li> Great almost all natural product without a lot of chemicals in it. Will buy this product again in the future.</li>
            <li> I received my sexy hair organic styling cream in record time and I really love it and will order it again thank you.</li>
            <li> Texture was fine, and it does what I need it to do, but the smell is really strong and perfumy! I guess if you like that fragrance, it wouldn&#x27;t be so bad, but I can&#x27;t stand it. Not a scent I expected from this brand.</li>
            <li> Ingredients listed on Amazon for this product are not all the ingredients. Found out the hard way. Full list of ingredients include many harmful chemicals. Definitely not organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;water/aqua/eau, corn starch modified, tapioca starch, glycerin, caprylic/capric triglyceride, hydroxypropyl guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride, cetrimonium chloride, cetearyl alcohol, cetearyl glucoside, cocoglycerides, hydrogenated soybean oil, phenoxyethanol, fragrance (parfum), aloe barbadensis leaf juice, cocos nucifera (coconut) oil, persea gratissima (avocado) oil, unsaponifiables, hydrogenated olive oil, hydroxypropylcellulose, cocos nucifera (coconut) seed butter, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) oil, dimethicone peg-8 meadowfoamate, hydrogenated jojoba oil, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, sesamum indicum (sesame) seed butter, citric acid, lycium barbarum fruit extract, persea gratissima (avocado) fruit extract, methylisothiazolinone, tocopheryl acetate, phytosterols.&lt;br /&gt;Ingredient Attributes: moisture, frizz control, anti-humectant</li>
            <li> Great product after I figured a little bit goes a long way! The first time I used it, I put about a quarter size amount in my hair...YIKES! Made my hair super greasy. The next time, I used about a dime size, perfect! Gives body and texture, and it&#x27;s organic. Love this product!</li>
            <li> especially for curly hair.  I love this stuff. it holds, it&#x27;s light weight and my hair always looks great - no complaints.</li>
            <li> I have 4a/b type hair and I struggle with retaining moisture especially because I have a dye in my hair. While doing my hair at my sister&#x27;s house I seen this product in her bathroom tested on a quick braid out and I instantly fell in love... Not only did it make my soft and way easier to detangle, it added body and a natural sheen to my hair that I am in love with. I completed my whole head with this product and combined it with water and eucalyptus oil, I am excited to see what my hair looks like in the am. I normally use distilled water, castor oil, a little dax, and essential oils, which is good... but sometimes I do not mix them well and my hair looks homemade, so far I see that my hair loves sexy organics and it gives a more polished look. I am looking forward to buying this as well as other products from this line.</li>
            <li> After loosing my favorite Redken #3 volumizing styling product, and many returned purchases in the search for a comparabile product, I stumbled upon this little gem at my stylist&#x27;s salon - she had received it as a sample and gave it to me. I blow dry my short, straight, hard to manage hair daily. This product provides the volume/lift I desire for the crown without weighing my hair down.  A little goes a long way.  I also use it occasionally after drying for final styling.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair that I set to be wavy. Gel is too hard, mousse is too flakey, most styling creams are too greasy and ineffective. This stuff just gives me more control and body, without leaving any feeling of &#x27;product&#x27; on your hair. LOVE.</li>
            <li> My hair is very curly and very thin so itʻs hard for me to find the right product. I bought my first bottle of this at Ross to try it and see how it worked. I fell in love. Itʻs lightweight enough that it doesnʻt weigh down my curls but also tough enough that it helps them keep shape and also helps smooth my hair if I straighten it and tames the fizz. After your hair dries sometimes there are a few flyaways so I would also have a spray on hand as a finisher.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on the effectiveness of this styling cream because as soon as I put it on my hair I had to rewash it&lt;br /&gt;immediately.  The smell was making me sick.</li>
            <li> Nice product. I was looking a for a hair product that was white or clear that wouldn&#x27;t turn my silver hair yellow like their Short Sexy Hair line did after regular use. Smells good too.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and absolutely LOVE this styling cream. Since it has been discontinued in most places, I know I will have to find something to replace it sooner or later. Too bad!</li>
            <li> I just bought it cause i was looking for an organic type of gel because all those years of using crazy hair products have been making my hair fall and I been wearing it doesn&#x27;t have much of a hold but it gives your hair volume or something it&#x27;s a little watery you only need a little bit for you hair smells weird but that&#x27;s how you know it&#x27;s organic it doesn&#x27;t have that perfumy smell like other hair gels and creams that&#x27;s how you know what&#x27;s organic and what isn&#x27;t..You should try this out if your looking for a good hair cream alternative so far I&#x27;m pretty satisfied</li>
            <li> Rancid smell and runny texture suggest it&#x27;s way beyond the expiration date. The problem is either with the product itself or with the seller.</li>
