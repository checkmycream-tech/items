    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The 8160 SpeedXL is the best of the Norelco shavers I have used.</li>
            <li>The Norelco 8140XL is the best that you are going to get from an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>Awesome shaver.  </li>
            <li>My fiance has had the razor for over 2 years now, and it&#x27;s still working great!</li>
            <li>This Norelco is the best yet</li>
            <li>This is an excellent shaver kit.</li>
            <li>This is really an excellent deal.</li>
            <li>It is best to remove it from the cleaner at the end of the cycle and store it in the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li>the service was excellent.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed with the closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic is also very good.</li>
            <li>It is simply a great razor giving me the best shave of any electric shaver I have used.   </li>
            <li>You made me look good!</li>
            <li>The shaver itself is great.  </li>
            <li>the razor shaves great, one of the closest I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t do as they say, do as I say and you&#x27;ll be as happy as I am with it.    </li>
            <li>Otherwise a great shaver and Amazon with its rebate offer makes the shaver a great deal.</li>
            <li>then you use it, you will get a great shave.  </li>
            <li>and everything i think its a great buy.....</li>
            <li>the item is great.</li>
            <li>They love it!!</li>
            <li>Anyway, I would recommend this shaver as one of the best available.  </li>
            <li>Good luck folks, Danny</li>
            <li>I found this replacement just in time and for a good price.</li>
            <li>This a vey good product...</li>
            <li>, it was a good shave and not so close that I got ingrown hairs on my face.  </li>
            <li>Loved the razor, but would not get the cleaning system again.</li>
            <li>i am very happy with this product and it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>Got it refurbished for my husband and he was very pleased by the shorter charging time and longer battery charge.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the product and with the purchasing process.</li>
            <li>This product works amazingly well for the price.</li>
            <li>My wife kindly bought this as a gift, but it&#x27;s so-so.  </li>
            <li>The ability to rinse the razor under water is a nice feature.  </li>
            <li>The nice thing about the tank is you can pull it out to check it.</li>
            <li>The shave eventually gets to be quite nice but give your skin time to adjust.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it works perfectly, but it works really well.  </li>
            <li>My Braun shaver kicked out and I thought of trying the Norelco because I liked the features and was hoping to get a closer shave.  </li>
            <li>will say the reservoir is easy to clean and use, and is perfectly matched to the bottle of solution.  </li>
            <li>However, it does provide a nice close shave.  </li>
            <li>it has its own station to get charged and it brings the cleaning solution....</li>
            <li>I own the Braun 1775 and the Panasonic 8077s.</li>
            <li>makes life very easy.</li>
            <li>The razor worked fine and did a good job.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had four Norelco razors in my lifetime and this is BY FAR the best!</li>
            <li>This is my 4th and by far the best.</li>
            <li>The Norelco gives a good clean, close shave.  </li>
            <li>It gives a fairly good dry shave, but is very good when his skin or razor head are moistened.</li>
            <li>It might charge ok most of the time, but the buttons never worked when it was time to start the cleaning cycle.  </li>
            <li>and I really love it</li>
            <li>I have used a Norelco shaver for many years.</li>
            <li>With all the shavers out there, I&#x27;m pleased with my choice of the 8160XLCC.</li>
            <li>For best performance and battery life you have to watch the cleaning station, and when the razor has dunked for the final time, you need to unplug the station and remove the razor.  </li>
            <li>It shaved OK, but the quality is just not there.</li>
            <li>I have found that soap works better.  </li>
            <li>The charger / cleaner is ok.  </li>
            <li>The shave delivered is OK.</li>
            <li>No biggie but a better design is needed.</li>
            <li>I have been using Norelco products for many years.  </li>
            <li>So in a nutshell, the shave itself isn&#x27;t all that much better or faster than lower models, but it&#x27;s more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice smooth shave</li>
            <li>Love the shaver for its close shave.  </li>
            <li>You can also buy a silcone spray which lubricates the heads to have them wear better.  </li>
            <li>Once Norelco thinks you need to change the blades (and they tend to think you should spend the $36  more often than you will want), the shaver disables itself.</li>
            <li>OK here is the deal.</li>
            <li>This was top rated for Rotary Shavers.</li>
            <li>The shave is ok</li>
            <li>I have been a Norelco user for more than 35 years.  </li>
            <li>The charge lasted more than 3 weeks    </li>
            <li>All in all this is a very good razor, it gives me a good shave, the charge lasts a long time and it&#x27;s very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that you can just rinse it under the sink to clean it and the battery indicator is a nice feature that most lower priced models don&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li>I have had this razor for over a year now and it has worked pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I have always used Norelco Shavers and this one I truly enjoyed what a amooth comfortable shave</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also more comfortable to hold than the foil shaver.  </li>
            <li>The shaver is good, but it is too much stuff to put in the bathroom sink.</li>
            <li>First I would like to say that this is the best Norelco I&#x27;ve used, and I have been using many of them over the last 30 years.</li>
            <li>I love the idea that it can clean itself</li>
            <li>The cleaning solution seems use up very quickly.</li>
            <li>It does okay cleaning, but you do not want to recharge every time you needc to clean.  </li>
            <li>Razor is also very easy to keep clean even without the Jet Clean.</li>
            <li>The first day I used it I got a nice, close shave with no</li>
            <li>The shaver works fine with or without a charge.</li>
            <li>The shave I get with this is fine, but be warned: The Norelco SpeedXL series has a built in blade life.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t irritate my face and it felt fine - no adjustment for me.  </li>
            <li>Got this awhile back for my son and he still uses it and loves it was a great buy.</li>
            <li>This newer model is light weight</li>
            <li>I also got a free promotion from Phillips to stay at any of the Inns in USA for one night free stay.</li>
            <li>This shaver does a great job overall.</li>
            <li>the &#x27;change the blades&#x27; light comes on.</li>
            <li>I had one that was a step lower and is no longer available.</li>
            <li>I got another cheap Norelco.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a basic shave with no frills extras this is a great razor.</li>
            <li>*(5 stars) - Good old multi-blade razor and shave cream</li>
            <li>My protocol is to rinse the shaver under water right after shaving, to get rid of most of the hairs.  </li>
            <li>does do a pretty good job (that is nice), but you&#x27;re going to need to buy a lot of the cleaner fluid, which ain&#x27;t chap</li>
            <li>Also, the self cleaning reservoir is quick and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Until you do this the light stays on, effectively killing the battery life until you buy new blades.</li>
            <li>Feels great, doesn&#x27;t take long to get used to at all.</li>
            <li>he likes the jet clean system because the heads are always clean and he feels this helps it shave closer.  </li>
            <li>Guess I am rather dense but cannot get razor clean unless disassemble like cheaper razors.</li>
            <li>after the 21 days of skin adjustment, as stateed in the directions, i have a clean shaved face with no bumps.</li>
            <li>i clean the razor once a week using the solution.</li>
            <li>, it glides super smooth</li>
            <li>In fact, run it under the sink before you clean it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other advantages are the fact that you can rinse the razor clean -</li>
            <li>The jet clean shaving system included in the package with this shaver is oversold.</li>
            <li>just bought the Norleco 8160XLCC jet clean system.  </li>
            <li>I wish the system would just go to standby vice charge after a clean cycle</li>
            <li>The model I had also had this jet clean system, and I do not recommend it.</li>
            <li>To that end, Norelco ships this razor with a motorized stand to clean the razor heads.  </li>
            <li>also very quiet (nice to be able to talk over the razor).</li>
            <li>The razor Jet Clean is luxury.   </li>
            <li>If you rinse it on occassion, it will clean it too</li>
            <li>-- it gives me a quick, close, comfortable shave, it&#x27;s quiet and has good battery life, and you can clean it by running it under the tap without taking anything apart.  </li>
            <li>Its comfortable, the cleaning system is fair, the wet/dry feature is nice but its definately harder to get a close shave with a wet face and its nicely designed.</li>
            <li>It shaves nice and close, for that soft baby skin feeling.</li>
            <li>Went back to my Quadra and once again get a really good shave.</li>
            <li>This shaver is ok, just don&#x27;t think it has the power to cut hair in a fast pace.</li>
            <li>This one has much more rounded edges on the blade guuards and the pivoting and motion of the heads is much lighter and smoother.  </li>
            <li>The good point is that the razor is definitely very quiet, but it does not cut close at all.</li>
            <li>Short and to the point - Good shavers.    </li>
            <li>hte cool part for me</li>
            <li>The biggest weakness is that it is not a \\&quot;smart\\&quot; charger, and does not stop charging when full.</li>
            <li>Ok, I&#x27;ll admit right off that this is not the exact model I had.</li>
            <li>The structure if the shaver head is such that it can be easily cleaned with warm water immediately after use, so there appears to be no additional cleaning required.</li>
            <li>The cleaner liquid itself is super.</li>
            <li>I have the older model, witch is 1/2 pound heavier !!!  </li>
            <li>the color its great ( as a girl i like the aspect its very masculine but also very modern it doesnt look like an old machine ....</li>
            <li>This product works very well and is smooth.  </li>
            <li>Also, the fluid MUST be full for the cleaning to begin, so each time I have to add more liquid to an almost full bowl.    </li>
            <li>Overall, this product is a nice upgrade from my Remington R9170.</li>
            <li>a wet shave isn&#x27;t a good shave with this product.</li>
            <li>Like many reviewers have already said, however, all Norelco razors are nearly identical.</li>
            <li>It does an excellent job of cleaning the razor, and then the fluid bath is only really needed to condition the heads.  </li>
            <li>satisfied with all marked perchases.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this early on.</li>
            <li>Not to mention, economical.  </li>
            <li>I used this against 3 days worth of growth.  </li>
            <li>In general it gives a clean, close shave and I am enjoying it very much.</li>
            <li>Although the shaver looks like most of the others out there, the big difference is the unique cleaning system that cleans and sanitizes the shaver.</li>
            <li>He has several other razors and this one is the best.</li>
            <li>The razor worked better than expected, you get a clean, close and smooth shave.</li>
            <li>The razor is always clean and works well, it would just be more convenient if you could put it in the cleaning station, push the button and forget it until next usage.</li>
            <li>As yet, this particular model seems to strike the best balance (at least for me) between performance and price.  </li>
            <li>It never worked right and is just a piece of junk.  </li>
            <li>right?  </li>
            <li>I received this in great time and my 19 year old son loves it from the one day he has had it so far anyway,would need to have it longer to do a better review,it is only one day after xmas right now,so has not had it long enough to do a good review,but looks good and sounds quiet.</li>
            <li>It shaves faster, and is much easier to clean.  </li>
            <li>the self cleaning also works very well, even when i thought it was clean</li>
            <li>I especiailly like the jet clean system as it really works.  </li>
            <li>I have tried most of the major brands.  </li>
            <li>And the long trial period suggests the manufacturer&#x27;s own confidence in its product.</li>
            <li>Does not give quite as close a shave as my old Norelco Quadratrack, but does give a quick, easy, very decent shave.</li>
            <li>When I first got the Razor, the Jet Cleaner didn&#x27;t work right out of the box.  </li>
            <li>However, if you want a close shave, from a quiet mechanism, which is relatively easy to clean, I recommend this Norelco.  </li>
            <li>Interesting, the brochure recommends just a clean, dry face.  </li>
            <li>The razor provides a fairly comfortable and close shave, but it lacks a sensitive skin setting which was available in older models.</li>
            <li>Also, battery life, at least so far, has been excellent</li>
            <li>I liked the Braun but it is a bit uncomfortable, however it provides a good shave for about $35.00.</li>
            <li>He really like this razor because it is convenient, quick and non-irritating.  </li>
            <li>he highly recommends the jet clean norelco</li>
            <li>It shaves very smooth, feels closer to the skin while shaving and extremely quiet as well.</li>
            <li>At first he thought it had not fully charged - but it had.  </li>
            <li>The Norelco provides a much better shave on the neck especially, where the hair can be longer, and is also quicker &amp; quieter than the Braun.</li>
            <li>Thanks Norelco!</li>
            <li>The rotary energy here more efficiently and quietly goes to shaving the beard.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many types of facial hair removal, but i cannot get rid of ingrown hairs without sacrificing a close shave.</li>
            <li>I bought the Norelco as I was interested in the self cleaning aspect.  </li>
            <li>I had skin irritation for the first 2 days, and I don&#x27;t feel the irritation after that.</li>
            <li>they use the old type that require all these proceedures to avoid \\&quot;memory\\&quot; then this is indeed a CHEAP product.</li>
            <li>This time I&#x27;ll just rinse it under hot water and save $60 a year on the jetclean.</li>
            <li>Only clean it in the Jet Clean when your battery level is at the bottom bar.</li>
            <li>I wasted my money, the Jet Clean lubrication works that good, even only using it between full battery charges.    </li>
            <li>Much closer cut that the regular electric (cheap) norellco i had before!    </li>
            <li>This shaver can be cleaned very well just with hot water.  </li>
            <li>One huge improvement over my prior Norelcos is the ability to rinse the razor throroughly with hot water.  </li>
            <li>It charges quickly &amp; shaves relatively long, clean up is a breeze.</li>
            <li>it is a smart charger</li>
            <li>This new model of Norelco has larger blades, and better shape, allowing for a closer and faster shave.  </li>
            <li>The new Norelco is beyond my expectations and is much better than my prior Braun.</li>
            <li>I still had my old one, so I threw this one away and have been using the old one (which I have had for over 8 years)which is still going strong.  </li>
            <li>Since I don&#x27;t have to shave much, I didn&#x27;t want to spend much on a shaver, so I tried a Braun 1775</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>He enjoys a smooth quiet close shave, loves the trimmer, and design.</li>
            <li>This shaver works very well</li>
            <li>sometimes I don&#x27;t feel like it could really be working.  </li>
            <li>Phillips really screwed up on this one.</li>
            <li>I expected a lot more from a brand like Norelco.  </li>
            <li>Like all electric razors, in my case, it does not shave my neck area very well</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t fault this model too much.</li>
            <li>The 8160 shaves very close and can handle a two day growth.  </li>
            <li>And this LED uses so much power that it drains the batteries in just over one day.</li>
            <li>he wants not over the sink if he chooses too...  </li>
            <li>Gives very close shave</li>
            <li>My last one was not very good, although the first two were great.  </li>
            <li>In a perfect world, I would&#x27;ve given this a 5 star rating, but the razer burn is leaving me a little raw....</li>
            <li>The charge lasts a long time and is easy to monitor.</li>
            <li>That alone, in theory, makes it waay better than the other brands.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple to keep clean too.</li>
            <li>He especially likes that he can run it under water to clean the blades.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much quieter than lower models and the power seems to remain more constant over the life of the charge vs. cheaper ones seem to get significantly slower at a half charge.  </li>
            <li>Probably a bit better than average.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li>This gives a better experience when using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say, I have to go over areas twice - once to cut them down, then again to get the smoothest shave.  </li>
            <li>I love my new razor and hope that it gives me a long life as well as my old one did.</li>
            <li>Says it is fine for a teenage boy in his first year of shaving, or for someone that loves to spend 30 mins looking at his face in the morning while going over and over the same area to catch the whiskers.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a previous Panasonic model for over a year that gives me a closer, better shave than this razor.</li>
            <li>Provides a close, quick &amp; quiet shave.  </li>
            <li>So save some money but make sure the razor you buy is washable and water tight.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the razor itself.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t actually used the cleaning system yet, because you can run the entire razor under hot water and clean it out no problem.  </li>
            <li>My older one still shaves smoother but not quite as close as this new model.  </li>
            <li>With the Norelco, the unit is clean but you have to let (wait)for the unit dry before using.  </li>
            <li>I usually clean at night and leave it on the counter to dry overnight.  </li>
            <li>When you wet your face or razor everything changes - it is smooth and shaves close.  </li>
            <li>Of course, the important question is how close a shave it gives, and the answer - not very.  </li>
            <li>, it definitely worth the extra money for the upgrade.</li>
            <li>it was time for a new one.  </li>
            <li>Also, I don&#x27;t know why the new one comes with all that cleaning equipment, when the refurbished model I got says to just rinse it with water and came with no cleaning unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, although most shavers remain pretty much the same over the years, this Norelco is a giant step improved above prior models.  </li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s about empty, clean the tray and refill the tank.</li>
            <li>When turning on my old Braun, my entire hand was vibrating the motor was so powerful.  </li>
            <li>You clean the cutting blades by opening the top and holding it under running water - done!  </li>
            <li>It was easy to use without making a mess.  </li>
            <li>It is quieter than his previous Norelco razors, and cleans up quickly and completely with hot, running tap water.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m experimenting with making my own cleaning fluid, which as far as I can tell is distilled water with a small amount of glycerine and a bit of an additive such as photo-flo which breaks the surface tension of the water so it will drain right off.         </li>
            <li>After two years, I bought new blades and there was NO DIFFERENCE to the old ones I replaced just because of their age.</li>
            <li>it shaves very close &amp; does this quickly with few passes.</li>
            <li>The cleaning system actually works well and the head flips open for quick dumping of trimmings.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is actually a lithium  battery, which means run it all the way down after it&#x27;s first full charge, then keep it topped off, like a laptop.</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable and it had the features I wanted, especially the charge level indicator lights.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used the cleaning system, doesn&#x27;t really seem necessary.</li>
            <li>(my old skin can&#x27;t take blades anymore)  </li>
            <li>Although it needs to be changed out occasionally (every couple of weeks or so), it works very well.</li>
            <li>The whole unit is designed as an attracting and functional personal care appliance.</li>
            <li>(I used to have to wear ear plugs with the Braun to keep out the loud hum of the shaver.)  </li>
            <li>It feels soft and does not feel like it is pulling the hairs from my face (when used with one day of growth).  </li>
            <li>Also, it is much quieter than the back and forth models.  </li>
            <li>I really like this razor compared to the last \\&quot;entry</li>
            <li>His old Norelco&#x27;s charger wires were always hanging in the sink basin, now his shaver sits neatly in the station, no fuss no muss.</li>
            <li>So far I have not learned how to use the Jet Cleaner system.  </li>
            <li>The Norelco far exceeds my expectations.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel any difference from my old Norelco.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little difficult to get a clean shave around the side burns which is where the Braun was good</li>
            <li>One may think its weak, but its very strong.</li>
            <li>Love the shaver, but I wasn&#x27;t prepared for the three weeks of rough, yet sensitive skin due to razer burn.  </li>
            <li>Just rinse under hot water and let dry.</li>
            <li>$30 for new blades or $30 for new razor entirely...</li>
            <li>My very first shaver was a Norelco -- since then I&#x27;ve tried razors (not worth the effort or cuts) and foil shavers (not a close shave</li>
            <li>The Jet Clean system is a waste of time and space.  </li>
            <li>In the past, I preferred the Remington because it is powerful and fast.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a Quadra Action 7866XL for several years and it worked  well, but decided to upgrade to this new model.</li>
            <li>When the new models came out, I actually saw no need to upgrade.</li>
            <li>Plus, the foil head is too delicate and gets damaged easily</li>
            <li>Your cleaning solution will last a very long time and you&#x27;ll only need to clean the solution tray once when you change the fluid.</li>
            <li>Get this one you will have no regrets</li>
            <li>at first i was freaking out cause i thought it would leave a mess</li>
            <li>This shaver shaves just as close as my old and more expensive 9160 with the adjustable height/contour system.  </li>
            <li>The other reason I didn&#x27;t clean it every day was that if left in the jetclean device, I found the razor was still wet with solution the next morning.  </li>
            <li>I just wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money ($215) on the Braun in the first place.</li>
            <li>The unit is also much lighter than previous models I have used.</li>
            <li>I purchased this shaver to replace a Braun 360 complete that was less than a year old.    </li>
            <li>The cheap crap made in china, is easy to pick out.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> The 8160 SpeedXL is the best of the Norelco shavers I have used.</li>
            <li> The Norelco 8140XL is the best that you are going to get from an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> Awesome shaver.  </li>
            <li> My fiance has had the razor for over 2 years now, and it&#x27;s still working great!</li>
            <li> This Norelco is the best yet</li>
            <li> This is an excellent shaver kit.</li>
            <li> This is really an excellent deal.</li>
            <li> It is best to remove it from the cleaner at the end of the cycle and store it in the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> the service was excellent.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with the closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic is also very good.</li>
            <li> It is simply a great razor giving me the best shave of any electric shaver I have used.   </li>
            <li> You made me look good!</li>
            <li> The shaver itself is great.  </li>
            <li> the razor shaves great, one of the closest I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t do as they say, do as I say and you&#x27;ll be as happy as I am with it.    </li>
            <li> Otherwise a great shaver and Amazon with its rebate offer makes the shaver a great deal.</li>
            <li> then you use it, you will get a great shave.  </li>
            <li> and everything i think its a great buy.....</li>
            <li> the item is great.</li>
            <li> They love it!!</li>
            <li> Anyway, I would recommend this shaver as one of the best available.  </li>
            <li> Good luck folks, Danny</li>
            <li> I found this replacement just in time and for a good price.</li>
            <li> This a vey good product...</li>
            <li> , it was a good shave and not so close that I got ingrown hairs on my face.  </li>
            <li> Loved the razor, but would not get the cleaning system again.</li>
            <li> i am very happy with this product and it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Got it refurbished for my husband and he was very pleased by the shorter charging time and longer battery charge.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the product and with the purchasing process.</li>
            <li> This product works amazingly well for the price.</li>
            <li> My wife kindly bought this as a gift, but it&#x27;s so-so.  </li>
            <li> The ability to rinse the razor under water is a nice feature.  </li>
            <li> The nice thing about the tank is you can pull it out to check it.</li>
            <li> The shave eventually gets to be quite nice but give your skin time to adjust.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it works perfectly, but it works really well.  </li>
            <li> My Braun shaver kicked out and I thought of trying the Norelco because I liked the features and was hoping to get a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> will say the reservoir is easy to clean and use, and is perfectly matched to the bottle of solution.  </li>
            <li> However, it does provide a nice close shave.  </li>
            <li> it has its own station to get charged and it brings the cleaning solution....</li>
            <li> I own the Braun 1775 and the Panasonic 8077s.</li>
            <li> makes life very easy.</li>
            <li> The razor worked fine and did a good job.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had four Norelco razors in my lifetime and this is BY FAR the best!</li>
            <li> This is my 4th and by far the best.</li>
            <li> The Norelco gives a good clean, close shave.  </li>
            <li> It gives a fairly good dry shave, but is very good when his skin or razor head are moistened.</li>
            <li> It might charge ok most of the time, but the buttons never worked when it was time to start the cleaning cycle.  </li>
            <li> and I really love it</li>
            <li> I have used a Norelco shaver for many years.</li>
            <li> With all the shavers out there, I&#x27;m pleased with my choice of the 8160XLCC.</li>
            <li> For best performance and battery life you have to watch the cleaning station, and when the razor has dunked for the final time, you need to unplug the station and remove the razor.  </li>
            <li> It shaved OK, but the quality is just not there.</li>
            <li> I have found that soap works better.  </li>
            <li> The charger / cleaner is ok.  </li>
            <li> The shave delivered is OK.</li>
            <li> No biggie but a better design is needed.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco products for many years.  </li>
            <li> So in a nutshell, the shave itself isn&#x27;t all that much better or faster than lower models, but it&#x27;s more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice smooth shave</li>
            <li> Love the shaver for its close shave.  </li>
            <li> You can also buy a silcone spray which lubricates the heads to have them wear better.  </li>
            <li> Once Norelco thinks you need to change the blades (and they tend to think you should spend the $36  more often than you will want), the shaver disables itself.</li>
            <li> OK here is the deal.</li>
            <li> This was top rated for Rotary Shavers.</li>
            <li> The shave is ok</li>
            <li> I have been a Norelco user for more than 35 years.  </li>
            <li> The charge lasted more than 3 weeks    </li>
            <li> All in all this is a very good razor, it gives me a good shave, the charge lasts a long time and it&#x27;s very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that you can just rinse it under the sink to clean it and the battery indicator is a nice feature that most lower priced models don&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for over a year now and it has worked pretty good.  </li>
            <li> I have always used Norelco Shavers and this one I truly enjoyed what a amooth comfortable shave</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also more comfortable to hold than the foil shaver.  </li>
            <li> The shaver is good, but it is too much stuff to put in the bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> First I would like to say that this is the best Norelco I&#x27;ve used, and I have been using many of them over the last 30 years.</li>
            <li> I love the idea that it can clean itself</li>
            <li> The cleaning solution seems use up very quickly.</li>
            <li> It does okay cleaning, but you do not want to recharge every time you needc to clean.  </li>
            <li> Razor is also very easy to keep clean even without the Jet Clean.</li>
            <li> The first day I used it I got a nice, close shave with no</li>
            <li> The shaver works fine with or without a charge.</li>
            <li> The shave I get with this is fine, but be warned: The Norelco SpeedXL series has a built in blade life.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t irritate my face and it felt fine - no adjustment for me.  </li>
            <li> Got this awhile back for my son and he still uses it and loves it was a great buy.</li>
            <li> This newer model is light weight</li>
            <li> I also got a free promotion from Phillips to stay at any of the Inns in USA for one night free stay.</li>
            <li> This shaver does a great job overall.</li>
            <li> the &#x27;change the blades&#x27; light comes on.</li>
            <li> I had one that was a step lower and is no longer available.</li>
            <li> I got another cheap Norelco.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a basic shave with no frills extras this is a great razor.</li>
            <li> *(5 stars) - Good old multi-blade razor and shave cream</li>
            <li> My protocol is to rinse the shaver under water right after shaving, to get rid of most of the hairs.  </li>
            <li> does do a pretty good job (that is nice), but you&#x27;re going to need to buy a lot of the cleaner fluid, which ain&#x27;t chap</li>
            <li> Also, the self cleaning reservoir is quick and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Until you do this the light stays on, effectively killing the battery life until you buy new blades.</li>
            <li> Feels great, doesn&#x27;t take long to get used to at all.</li>
            <li> he likes the jet clean system because the heads are always clean and he feels this helps it shave closer.  </li>
            <li> Guess I am rather dense but cannot get razor clean unless disassemble like cheaper razors.</li>
            <li> after the 21 days of skin adjustment, as stateed in the directions, i have a clean shaved face with no bumps.</li>
            <li> i clean the razor once a week using the solution.</li>
            <li> , it glides super smooth</li>
            <li> In fact, run it under the sink before you clean it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other advantages are the fact that you can rinse the razor clean -</li>
            <li> The jet clean shaving system included in the package with this shaver is oversold.</li>
            <li> just bought the Norleco 8160XLCC jet clean system.  </li>
            <li> I wish the system would just go to standby vice charge after a clean cycle</li>
            <li> The model I had also had this jet clean system, and I do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> To that end, Norelco ships this razor with a motorized stand to clean the razor heads.  </li>
            <li> also very quiet (nice to be able to talk over the razor).</li>
            <li> The razor Jet Clean is luxury.   </li>
            <li> If you rinse it on occassion, it will clean it too</li>
            <li> -- it gives me a quick, close, comfortable shave, it&#x27;s quiet and has good battery life, and you can clean it by running it under the tap without taking anything apart.  </li>
            <li> Its comfortable, the cleaning system is fair, the wet/dry feature is nice but its definately harder to get a close shave with a wet face and its nicely designed.</li>
            <li> It shaves nice and close, for that soft baby skin feeling.</li>
            <li> Went back to my Quadra and once again get a really good shave.</li>
            <li> This shaver is ok, just don&#x27;t think it has the power to cut hair in a fast pace.</li>
            <li> This one has much more rounded edges on the blade guuards and the pivoting and motion of the heads is much lighter and smoother.  </li>
            <li> The good point is that the razor is definitely very quiet, but it does not cut close at all.</li>
            <li> Short and to the point - Good shavers.    </li>
            <li> hte cool part for me</li>
            <li> The biggest weakness is that it is not a \\&quot;smart\\&quot; charger, and does not stop charging when full.</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;ll admit right off that this is not the exact model I had.</li>
            <li> The structure if the shaver head is such that it can be easily cleaned with warm water immediately after use, so there appears to be no additional cleaning required.</li>
            <li> The cleaner liquid itself is super.</li>
            <li> I have the older model, witch is 1/2 pound heavier !!!  </li>
            <li> the color its great ( as a girl i like the aspect its very masculine but also very modern it doesnt look like an old machine ....</li>
            <li> This product works very well and is smooth.  </li>
            <li> Also, the fluid MUST be full for the cleaning to begin, so each time I have to add more liquid to an almost full bowl.    </li>
            <li> Overall, this product is a nice upgrade from my Remington R9170.</li>
            <li> a wet shave isn&#x27;t a good shave with this product.</li>
            <li> Like many reviewers have already said, however, all Norelco razors are nearly identical.</li>
            <li> It does an excellent job of cleaning the razor, and then the fluid bath is only really needed to condition the heads.  </li>
            <li> satisfied with all marked perchases.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this early on.</li>
            <li> Not to mention, economical.  </li>
            <li> I used this against 3 days worth of growth.  </li>
            <li> In general it gives a clean, close shave and I am enjoying it very much.</li>
            <li> Although the shaver looks like most of the others out there, the big difference is the unique cleaning system that cleans and sanitizes the shaver.</li>
            <li> He has several other razors and this one is the best.</li>
            <li> The razor worked better than expected, you get a clean, close and smooth shave.</li>
            <li> The razor is always clean and works well, it would just be more convenient if you could put it in the cleaning station, push the button and forget it until next usage.</li>
            <li> As yet, this particular model seems to strike the best balance (at least for me) between performance and price.  </li>
            <li> It never worked right and is just a piece of junk.  </li>
            <li> right?  </li>
            <li> I received this in great time and my 19 year old son loves it from the one day he has had it so far anyway,would need to have it longer to do a better review,it is only one day after xmas right now,so has not had it long enough to do a good review,but looks good and sounds quiet.</li>
            <li> It shaves faster, and is much easier to clean.  </li>
            <li> the self cleaning also works very well, even when i thought it was clean</li>
            <li> I especiailly like the jet clean system as it really works.  </li>
            <li> I have tried most of the major brands.  </li>
            <li> And the long trial period suggests the manufacturer&#x27;s own confidence in its product.</li>
            <li> Does not give quite as close a shave as my old Norelco Quadratrack, but does give a quick, easy, very decent shave.</li>
            <li> When I first got the Razor, the Jet Cleaner didn&#x27;t work right out of the box.  </li>
            <li> However, if you want a close shave, from a quiet mechanism, which is relatively easy to clean, I recommend this Norelco.  </li>
            <li> Interesting, the brochure recommends just a clean, dry face.  </li>
            <li> The razor provides a fairly comfortable and close shave, but it lacks a sensitive skin setting which was available in older models.</li>
            <li> Also, battery life, at least so far, has been excellent</li>
            <li> I liked the Braun but it is a bit uncomfortable, however it provides a good shave for about $35.00.</li>
            <li> He really like this razor because it is convenient, quick and non-irritating.  </li>
            <li> he highly recommends the jet clean norelco</li>
            <li> It shaves very smooth, feels closer to the skin while shaving and extremely quiet as well.</li>
            <li> At first he thought it had not fully charged - but it had.  </li>
            <li> The Norelco provides a much better shave on the neck especially, where the hair can be longer, and is also quicker &amp; quieter than the Braun.</li>
            <li> Thanks Norelco!</li>
            <li> The rotary energy here more efficiently and quietly goes to shaving the beard.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many types of facial hair removal, but i cannot get rid of ingrown hairs without sacrificing a close shave.</li>
            <li> I bought the Norelco as I was interested in the self cleaning aspect.  </li>
            <li> I had skin irritation for the first 2 days, and I don&#x27;t feel the irritation after that.</li>
            <li> they use the old type that require all these proceedures to avoid \\&quot;memory\\&quot; then this is indeed a CHEAP product.</li>
            <li> This time I&#x27;ll just rinse it under hot water and save $60 a year on the jetclean.</li>
            <li> Only clean it in the Jet Clean when your battery level is at the bottom bar.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money, the Jet Clean lubrication works that good, even only using it between full battery charges.    </li>
            <li> Much closer cut that the regular electric (cheap) norellco i had before!    </li>
            <li> This shaver can be cleaned very well just with hot water.  </li>
            <li> One huge improvement over my prior Norelcos is the ability to rinse the razor throroughly with hot water.  </li>
            <li> It charges quickly &amp; shaves relatively long, clean up is a breeze.</li>
            <li> it is a smart charger</li>
            <li> This new model of Norelco has larger blades, and better shape, allowing for a closer and faster shave.  </li>
            <li> The new Norelco is beyond my expectations and is much better than my prior Braun.</li>
            <li> I still had my old one, so I threw this one away and have been using the old one (which I have had for over 8 years)which is still going strong.  </li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t have to shave much, I didn&#x27;t want to spend much on a shaver, so I tried a Braun 1775</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> He enjoys a smooth quiet close shave, loves the trimmer, and design.</li>
            <li> This shaver works very well</li>
            <li> sometimes I don&#x27;t feel like it could really be working.  </li>
            <li> Phillips really screwed up on this one.</li>
            <li> I expected a lot more from a brand like Norelco.  </li>
            <li> Like all electric razors, in my case, it does not shave my neck area very well</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t fault this model too much.</li>
            <li> The 8160 shaves very close and can handle a two day growth.  </li>
            <li> And this LED uses so much power that it drains the batteries in just over one day.</li>
            <li> he wants not over the sink if he chooses too...  </li>
            <li> Gives very close shave</li>
            <li> My last one was not very good, although the first two were great.  </li>
            <li> In a perfect world, I would&#x27;ve given this a 5 star rating, but the razer burn is leaving me a little raw....</li>
            <li> The charge lasts a long time and is easy to monitor.</li>
            <li> That alone, in theory, makes it waay better than the other brands.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple to keep clean too.</li>
            <li> He especially likes that he can run it under water to clean the blades.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much quieter than lower models and the power seems to remain more constant over the life of the charge vs. cheaper ones seem to get significantly slower at a half charge.  </li>
            <li> Probably a bit better than average.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li> This gives a better experience when using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say, I have to go over areas twice - once to cut them down, then again to get the smoothest shave.  </li>
            <li> I love my new razor and hope that it gives me a long life as well as my old one did.</li>
            <li> Says it is fine for a teenage boy in his first year of shaving, or for someone that loves to spend 30 mins looking at his face in the morning while going over and over the same area to catch the whiskers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a previous Panasonic model for over a year that gives me a closer, better shave than this razor.</li>
            <li> Provides a close, quick &amp; quiet shave.  </li>
            <li> So save some money but make sure the razor you buy is washable and water tight.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend the razor itself.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t actually used the cleaning system yet, because you can run the entire razor under hot water and clean it out no problem.  </li>
            <li> My older one still shaves smoother but not quite as close as this new model.  </li>
            <li> With the Norelco, the unit is clean but you have to let (wait)for the unit dry before using.  </li>
            <li> I usually clean at night and leave it on the counter to dry overnight.  </li>
            <li> When you wet your face or razor everything changes - it is smooth and shaves close.  </li>
            <li> Of course, the important question is how close a shave it gives, and the answer - not very.  </li>
            <li> , it definitely worth the extra money for the upgrade.</li>
            <li> it was time for a new one.  </li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t know why the new one comes with all that cleaning equipment, when the refurbished model I got says to just rinse it with water and came with no cleaning unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, although most shavers remain pretty much the same over the years, this Norelco is a giant step improved above prior models.  </li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s about empty, clean the tray and refill the tank.</li>
            <li> When turning on my old Braun, my entire hand was vibrating the motor was so powerful.  </li>
            <li> You clean the cutting blades by opening the top and holding it under running water - done!  </li>
            <li> It was easy to use without making a mess.  </li>
            <li> It is quieter than his previous Norelco razors, and cleans up quickly and completely with hot, running tap water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m experimenting with making my own cleaning fluid, which as far as I can tell is distilled water with a small amount of glycerine and a bit of an additive such as photo-flo which breaks the surface tension of the water so it will drain right off.         </li>
            <li> After two years, I bought new blades and there was NO DIFFERENCE to the old ones I replaced just because of their age.</li>
            <li> it shaves very close &amp; does this quickly with few passes.</li>
            <li> The cleaning system actually works well and the head flips open for quick dumping of trimmings.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is actually a lithium  battery, which means run it all the way down after it&#x27;s first full charge, then keep it topped off, like a laptop.</li>
            <li> The price was reasonable and it had the features I wanted, especially the charge level indicator lights.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used the cleaning system, doesn&#x27;t really seem necessary.</li>
            <li> (my old skin can&#x27;t take blades anymore)  </li>
            <li> Although it needs to be changed out occasionally (every couple of weeks or so), it works very well.</li>
            <li> The whole unit is designed as an attracting and functional personal care appliance.</li>
            <li> (I used to have to wear ear plugs with the Braun to keep out the loud hum of the shaver.)  </li>
            <li> It feels soft and does not feel like it is pulling the hairs from my face (when used with one day of growth).  </li>
            <li> Also, it is much quieter than the back and forth models.  </li>
            <li> I really like this razor compared to the last \\&quot;entry</li>
            <li> His old Norelco&#x27;s charger wires were always hanging in the sink basin, now his shaver sits neatly in the station, no fuss no muss.</li>
            <li> So far I have not learned how to use the Jet Cleaner system.  </li>
            <li> The Norelco far exceeds my expectations.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel any difference from my old Norelco.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little difficult to get a clean shave around the side burns which is where the Braun was good</li>
            <li> One may think its weak, but its very strong.</li>
            <li> Love the shaver, but I wasn&#x27;t prepared for the three weeks of rough, yet sensitive skin due to razer burn.  </li>
            <li> Just rinse under hot water and let dry.</li>
            <li> $30 for new blades or $30 for new razor entirely...</li>
            <li> My very first shaver was a Norelco -- since then I&#x27;ve tried razors (not worth the effort or cuts) and foil shavers (not a close shave</li>
            <li> The Jet Clean system is a waste of time and space.  </li>
            <li> In the past, I preferred the Remington because it is powerful and fast.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Quadra Action 7866XL for several years and it worked  well, but decided to upgrade to this new model.</li>
            <li> When the new models came out, I actually saw no need to upgrade.</li>
            <li> Plus, the foil head is too delicate and gets damaged easily</li>
            <li> Your cleaning solution will last a very long time and you&#x27;ll only need to clean the solution tray once when you change the fluid.</li>
            <li> Get this one you will have no regrets</li>
            <li> at first i was freaking out cause i thought it would leave a mess</li>
            <li> This shaver shaves just as close as my old and more expensive 9160 with the adjustable height/contour system.  </li>
            <li> The other reason I didn&#x27;t clean it every day was that if left in the jetclean device, I found the razor was still wet with solution the next morning.  </li>
            <li> I just wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money ($215) on the Braun in the first place.</li>
            <li> The unit is also much lighter than previous models I have used.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver to replace a Braun 360 complete that was less than a year old.    </li>
            <li> The cheap crap made in china, is easy to pick out.</li>
            <li> Norelco was unresponsive to my inquiries about why it bogs down just doing a normal shave.</li>
            <li> The old Norelco was difficult to clean.  </li>
            <li> How long an electric razor stays sharp is very related to how clean it is kept, as hair in the heads will dull the blades faster.  </li>
            <li> I hardly use the cleaning system because just hot water works so well, using soap as a lubricant.  </li>
            <li> The only caveat I have is the same one others have noted, after your razor self cleans you need to remove it from the cleaner and let it dry overnight...</li>
            <li> Since I get ready before my wife, I usually didn&#x27;t run it so it wouldn&#x27;t wake her up.  </li>
            <li> It does have a long lasting battery, though.</li>
            <li> If you do, give it two days to dry out before you plug it in again or the cleaner will be quite erratic in it&#x27;s operation and could quite possibly burn out.    </li>
            <li> Just rinse with water instead and then leave it open to dry.</li>
            <li> It does not give a close shave and has trouble with the old and stiff hairs, particularly on the mustache area.  </li>
            <li> This razor doesn&#x27;t have all of the bells and whistles that some other more expensive models have.  </li>
            <li> only complaint would be that like most other people (and all other electric razors that I know about) it doesn&#x27;t get all of those hard to get hairs on my neck without several passes, and the trimmer doesn&#x27;t get close enough to my sideburns.  </li>
            <li> First let me say I don&#x27;t have thick facial hair and can almost get away with shaving every other day.  </li>
            <li> It is also produces the cleanest shave I have ever received with few facial areas that you need to go back a second time to shave.</li>
            <li> Customer Service said to send in for repair, no estimate of how long I&#x27;d be without a razor.</li>
            <li> He has a heavy beard and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The shaver is quite similar to earlier models of the same type, so very little difference in the quality of the shave has been noted.</li>
            <li> The cleaning is a little more complicated.</li>
            <li> After about a year, my razor needed new blades [were getting dull, then one fell out and into the toilet].</li>
            <li> It takes a very long time to cycle and is twice to 3x as noisy as using the shaver itself.  </li>
            <li> Besides, the blades won&#x27;t dry out there anyway.    </li>
            <li> I just leave it on the counter to dry until I come home from work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can submerge the razor in fluid yourself and turn it on and off a few times to do the same thing, and not have to worry about having space to store the stand.  </li>
            <li> But it wasn&#x27;t an upgrade and was very disappointing; it does not shave nearly as closely or effectively as my old Quadra action razor, so I bought new heads for the 7866 XL and continue to use that.</li>
            <li> single charge lasts me a couple of weeks, so even though I&#x27;ve brought the charger with me when traveling</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure the razor is slow since he does everything super sonically.</li>
            <li> Not worth the extra cash, just get the shaver if you have to replace it.</li>
            <li> The instructions about battery charging goes back to the dark ages of rechargable batteries.  </li>
            <li> The shave is extremely close, comfortable and gets those difficult areas with ease.</li>
            <li> The first thing that was a huge disappointment is learning how weak the motor is on the Norelco.  </li>
            <li> As expected, I had to replace the blades after about a year.  </li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T EVER get the cleaner/ charger circuitry wet.</li>
            <li> If you store it in the cleaner, it will still be wet when you go to use the razor in the morning.</li>
            <li> If you leave the razor in the cleaning unit and it is still wet</li>
            <li> Also, you&#x27;re supposed to empty the used liquid weekly.  </li>
            <li> This is my 4th Norelco, going back quite a few years.  </li>
            <li> , I just keep a disposable razor in the shower and touch up---just a few seconds with no lather so not a big deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used this for a few days, and I&#x27;m not willing to \\&quot;allow 30 days for my skin to adjust\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very quiet, half the time he thinks the battery is dead</li>
            <li> The shaver works as well as all other Norelcos and the cleaner</li>
            <li> Think of the inefficiency of ramming the blades of an ordinary shaver back and forth.  </li>
            <li> I can still feel stubble when done, but it&#x27;s comparable to any other results I&#x27;ve gotten with an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> First one failed after 7 months, would not hold charge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been wary of electric razors, but I have to say this one works pretty well for me.  </li>
            <li> Then I dip it briefly into a small container with the cleaning solution, then rinse it again.</li>
            <li> As I have aged, my beard has become less dense.  </li>
            <li> It did a poor job of shaving, was VERY loud and made a mess of my bathroom when I cleaned it.  </li>
            <li> a clean like this would be impossible to do manually</li>
            <li> The only complaint (trivial)</li>
            <li> only complaint is with the cleaner.</li>
            <li> I had previously used the Norelco Rotary, perhaps 15 years ago, but it was too slow and not close enough.  </li>
            <li> It even bogs down in the mustache.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate me like some previous razors.</li>
            <li> After less than 3 months of purchasing this product, it stopped working.</li>
            <li> The Braun is less powerful and less irritating, but still irritating.  </li>
            <li> His only small complaint is that the shave is a little slow for his ultimate dream.</li>
            <li> &quot; this razor (in the past it was hell to try to get through a couple of weeks with other kinds).  </li>
            <li> I thought the cleaning system was a little \\&quot;cheesy.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> With the Braun when the unit was cleaned it was also dried.  </li>
            <li> A waste of a $100.</li>
            <li> For the money, this one was a waste.</li>
            <li> I tried different soapy water and alcohol solutions and all of them resulted in worse shaves.          </li>
            <li> i have used norelco for quite a few years.</li>
            <li> The base in mine had shorted out, and by cleaning the razor everyday, I was also charging it everyday, making battery life less than stellar.</li>
            <li> Occassionaly a hair or two will need a few brush overs to get, but that&#x27;s hardly an inconvience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I just got tired of the noise, vibration, and rough shave.  </li>
            <li> Still unable to find shaver that my b/f can use on his face that will last over 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> I recommend just using ordinary soap.)  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s a small issue to deal with.</li>
            <li> Mine was finally starting to fail.</li>
            <li> I just pour some of the cleaning solution in a shallow dish and run the razor in it for a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> I bought a Braun Pulsonic 9595 last May and was so unhappy with it</li>
            <li> It continues to shave slowly and not close.</li>
            <li> Worse yet, the shaver will not operate unless the battery is charged, so this results in a dead shaver until you replace the blades.</li>
            <li> The small amount of solution in the reservoir does the job!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because of the weak motor or bad design, after 10 minutes of skin-stretching and going over the same parts of my beard, I still had plenty of whisers showing.  </li>
            <li> If you have a tough beard, and a thick beard, you may prefer an alternative.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed, especially for the money.  </li>
            <li> I have no idea what was wrong with it.  </li>
            <li> This razor gives a close shave but is uncomfortable when shaving.  </li>
            <li> About 1.5 years into use, the charging pins that connect to the power cord corroded and pulled out of the unit making the jetclean useless.  </li>
            <li> It was replaced under warranty; the replacement failed after 8 months, again, would not hold charge.</li>
            <li> but you need to pass the difficult spots(neck) a couple of times to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> I was wrong about the shaver</li>
            <li> This razor was disappointing for me.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the only fault I can find with the shaver is that once you have used the automatic cleaner one must remember to either unplug the cleaner base or move the shaver (disconnect the point of contact between the base and the shaver)otherwise the shaver base goes from cleaning mode to charge mode.</li>
            <li> I bought this model refurbished for about $70 and I&#x27;m highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have is the charging/cleaning base</li>
            <li> I tried a Remington foil shaver and it was horrible.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased this shaver to replace a Braun 360 complete that was less than a year old.    The Norelco gives a good clean, close shave.  The reason I did not give this unit five stars is the cleaning system.  With the Braun when the unit was cleaned it was also dried.  With the Norelco, the unit is clean but you have to let (wait)for the unit dry before using.  I usually clean at night and leave it on the counter to dry overnight.  Also, the fluid MUST be full for the cleaning to begin, so each time I have to add more liquid to an almost full bowl.    The shaver itself is great.  I like the shave.  I have not had to replace the blades yet.    Would I but it again.  YES</li>
            <li> I have always used Norelco Shavers and this one I truly enjoyed what a amooth comfortable shave I get with this razor.  I love the idea that it can clean itself makes life very easy. I would truly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for over a year now and it has worked pretty good.  As expected, I had to replace the blades after about a year.  The cleaning/charging station was another story.  It never worked right and is just a piece of junk.  It might charge ok most of the time, but the buttons never worked when it was time to start the cleaning cycle.  I just pour some of the cleaning solution in a shallow dish and run the razor in it for a few seconds.  I wish I had saved some money by not getting it with the cleaning station.</li>
            <li> my husband has been using a norelco for 11 years and decided to up grade.  he says this razor shaves closer, and quicker.  he likes the jet clean system because the heads are always clean and he feels this helps it shave closer.  he highly recommends the jet clean norelco</li>
            <li> First let me say I don&#x27;t have thick facial hair and can almost get away with shaving every other day.  My very first shaver was a Norelco -- since then I&#x27;ve tried razors (not worth the effort or cuts) and foil shavers (not a close shave and I have to go over areas, especially under the chin, over and over again).  Since I don&#x27;t have to shave much, I didn&#x27;t want to spend much on a shaver, so I tried a Braun 1775 and I just got tired of the noise, vibration, and rough shave.  Plus, the foil head is too delicate and gets damaged easily (I went through 2).  I decided to go back to a Norelco, did some research and found the 8160XLCC.  The price was reasonable and it had the features I wanted, especially the charge level indicator lights.  I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months now and I really love it -- it gives me a quick, close, comfortable shave, it&#x27;s quiet and has good battery life, and you can clean it by running it under the tap without taking anything apart.  It&#x27;s also more comfortable to hold than the foil shaver.  Also, the rotary heads are indestructible compared to foil shavers.  Haven&#x27;t used the cleaning system, doesn&#x27;t really seem necessary.</li>
            <li> Overall, this product is a nice upgrade from my Remington R9170. The only caveat I have is the same one others have noted, after your razor self cleans you need to remove it from the cleaner and let it dry overnight...a wet shave isn&#x27;t a good shave with this product. This razor provides a closer shave than my Remington ever did. Occassionaly a hair or two will need a few brush overs to get, but that&#x27;s hardly an inconvience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Product.</li>
            <li> I have used a Norelco shaver for many years. The 8160 SpeedXL is the best of the Norelco shavers I have used. It provides a close shave in a short amount of time. The unit is also much lighter than previous models I have used. Some of the reviews I read prior to the purchase did cause me to question whether I would like this model, but my concerns vanished when I actually used the shaver.</li>
            <li> The Norelco 8140XL is the best that you are going to get from an electric shaver.  I tried a Remington foil shaver and it was horrible.  It did a poor job of shaving, was VERY loud and made a mess of my bathroom when I cleaned it.  I returned it and bought the 8160XL because it was the same price as the 8140XL on Amazon.  The Jet Clean system is a waste of time and space.  You clean the cutting blades by opening the top and holding it under running water - done!  I don&#x27;t see any reason to use the cleaning system.  If you can&#x27;t use a multi-blade razor and need to go electric then I recommend the Norelco 8140XL.  My rating system:  *****(5 stars) - Good old multi-blade razor and shave cream (my old skin can&#x27;t take blades anymore)  ****(4 stars) - Norelco 8140XL  ***(3 stars) - Norelco 8160XL  * (1 star) - Remington foil type shaver</li>
            <li> Bought the 8270XLCC \\&quot;Jet Clean\\&quot; for Hubbie.  He has owned 4 Norleco rotory shavers over the years.  He took this one back.  It is WAY underpowered. At first he thought it had not fully charged - but it had.  Says it is fine for a teenage boy in his first year of shaving, or for someone that loves to spend 30 mins looking at his face in the morning while going over and over the same area to catch the whiskers.  Having to unplug the charging / cleaning station is another design flaw.</li>
            <li> I received this in great time and my 19 year old son loves it from the one day he has had it so far anyway,would need to have it longer to do a better review,it is only one day after xmas right now,so has not had it long enough to do a good review,but looks good and sounds quiet.Thanks</li>
            <li> Although the shaver looks like most of the others out there, the big difference is the unique cleaning system that cleans and sanitizes the shaver. The small amount of solution in the reservoir does the job! Although it needs to be changed out occasionally (every couple of weeks or so), it works very well. The whole unit is designed as an attracting and functional personal care appliance. Daily rinsing of the shaver (just flip it open and run water through it to flush out whiskers) works well between using the charging/sanitizing stand. Yes, it&#x27;s waterproof so you can just do that. With all the shavers out there, I&#x27;m pleased with my choice of the 8160XLCC.</li>
            <li> Guess I am rather dense but cannot get razor clean unless disassemble like cheaper razors.</li>
            <li> My wife kindly bought this as a gift, but it&#x27;s so-so.  The shaver works as well as all other Norelcos and the cleaner does do a pretty good job (that is nice), but you&#x27;re going to need to buy a lot of the cleaner fluid, which ain&#x27;t chap - so do the price research before you buy.</li>
            <li> Awesome shaver.  Provides a close, quick &amp; quiet shave.  I bought a Braun Pulsonic 9595 last May and was so unhappy with it, I decided to try the Norelco 8160XLCC.  The Norelco provides a much better shave on the neck especially, where the hair can be longer, and is also quicker &amp; quieter than the Braun. (I used to have to wear ear plugs with the Braun to keep out the loud hum of the shaver.)  I just wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money ($215) on the Braun in the first place.</li>
            <li> My fiance has had the razor for over 2 years now, and it&#x27;s still working great! It&#x27;s very quiet, half the time he thinks the battery is dead it&#x27;s so quiet. It&#x27;s simple to keep clean too. It shaves nice and close, for that soft baby skin feeling.</li>
            <li> Puchased this about six months ago and have tried to get it accustomed to my beard. It continues to shave slowly and not close. It even bogs down in the mustache. Went back to my Quadra and once again get a really good shave. A waste of a $100. Norelco was unresponsive to my inquiries about why it bogs down just doing a normal shave.</li>
            <li> This product works very well and is smooth.  It feels soft and does not feel like it is pulling the hairs from my face (when used with one day of growth).  The ability to rinse the razor under water is a nice feature.  The cleaning solution seems use up very quickly.</li>
            <li> My friend has used this razor for two months and he LOVES it. He enjoys a smooth quiet close shave, loves the trimmer, and design. His only small complaint is that the shave is a little slow for his ultimate dream. However, he is hyper and a Type A personality so I&#x27;m not sure the razor is slow since he does everything super sonically. Thanks Norelco! You made me look good!</li>
            <li> the razor shaves great, one of the closest I&#x27;ve had.  The cleaning is a little more complicated. The reservoir needs topped off every 2 weeks, and you can&#x27;t just leave the razor in the cleaning station and go. For best performance and battery life you have to watch the cleaning station, and when the razor has dunked for the final time, you need to unplug the station and remove the razor.  The razor is always clean and works well, it would just be more convenient if you could put it in the cleaning station, push the button and forget it until next usage.</li>
            <li> Bought this razor for my son and he loves it. He has several other razors and this one is the best.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver just over 2 years ago. In that time, it went in for service twice for a battery that would not hold a charge. Now, after the warranty just expired, all the lights went on and I could not shut it off. When the battery finaly died, it would not charge up again. I&#x27;m just going to junk it and get a Braun.  It shaved OK, but the quality is just not there.</li>
            <li> This Norelco is the best yet and I have owned 3 others over the years!</li>
            <li> Still unable to find shaver that my b/f can use on his face that will last over 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> I have been using various shavers for over 40 years.  I have tried most of the major brands.  In the past, I preferred the Remington because it is powerful and fast.  But the Remington irritates my skin.  The Braun is less powerful and less irritating, but still irritating.  I had previously used the Norelco Rotary, perhaps 15 years ago, but it was too slow and not close enough.  However, although most shavers remain pretty much the same over the years, this Norelco is a giant step improved above prior models.  It shaves faster, and is much easier to clean.  The old Norelco was difficult to clean.  This shaver can be cleaned very well just with hot water.  However, I use soap as the lubricant.  (If you use oily stuff, marketed as various pre-shaves, which basically puts a film of oil on your face, there will be a tendency for the gunk to accumulate under the blades.  I recommend just using ordinary soap.)  This new model of Norelco has larger blades, and better shape, allowing for a closer and faster shave.  Also, it is much quieter than the back and forth models.  Think of the inefficiency of ramming the blades of an ordinary shaver back and forth.  The rotary energy here more efficiently and quietly goes to shaving the beard.  As I have aged, my beard has become less dense.  If you have a tough beard, and a thick beard, you may prefer an alternative.  However, if you want a close shave, from a quiet mechanism, which is relatively easy to clean, I recommend this Norelco.  You may not need the well designed cleaning bay, and may prefer just the shaver and charger.  I hardly use the cleaning system because just hot water works so well, using soap as a lubricant.  Interesting, the brochure recommends just a clean, dry face.  I have found that soap works better.  Anyway, I would recommend this shaver as one of the best available.  And the long trial period suggests the manufacturer&#x27;s own confidence in its product.</li>
            <li> Got this awhile back for my son and he still uses it and loves it was a great buy.</li>
            <li> I have tried many types of facial hair removal, but i cannot get rid of ingrown hairs without sacrificing a close shave. after the 21 days of skin adjustment, as stateed in the directions, i have a clean shaved face with no bumps. i clean the razor once a week using the solution. i brush the head after every use. i am very happy with this product and it is worth the money. But i did not get a close shave until a couple of weeks after use. So hang in there and follow directions.</li>
            <li> This shaver works very well, it glides super smooth it shaves very close &amp; does this quickly with few passes. It doesn&#x27;t irritate me like some previous razors. It charges quickly &amp; shaves relatively long, clean up is a breeze. Get this one you will have no regrets</li>
            <li> I have the older model, witch is 1/2 pound heavier !!!  This newer model is light weight and you can tell in the power of the motor, cutters. The cheap crap made in china, is easy to pick out. This shaver is ok, just don&#x27;t think it has the power to cut hair in a fast pace. The charger / cleaner is ok.  Not worth the extra cash, just get the shaver if you have to replace it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for four years now. Don&#x27;t do as they say, do as I say and you&#x27;ll be as happy as I am with it.    Don&#x27;t charge/clean it every day. If you want your battery to last, do what I do! Only clean it in the Jet Clean when your battery level is at the bottom bar. Tap out cuttings once in the middle of the cycle and once just before cleaning. In fact, run it under the sink before you clean it. Your cleaning solution will last a very long time and you&#x27;ll only need to clean the solution tray once when you change the fluid. The nice thing about the tank is you can pull it out to check it. When it&#x27;s about empty, clean the tray and refill the tank. I&#x27;ve only used 6 bottles of cleaning fluid in 4 years.    The cleaning solution also lubricates the blades and it works! After two years, I bought new blades and there was NO DIFFERENCE to the old ones I replaced just because of their age. I wasted my money, the Jet Clean lubrication works that good, even only using it between full battery charges.    Also, after four years, my battery life is still around two weeks. You won&#x27;t get this type of battery life if you charge this thing in the cleaner every day. Obviously, don&#x27;t EVER just leave this thing in the charger as it will ruin the batteries. Besides, the blades won&#x27;t dry out there anyway.    Also, don&#x27;t, and I repeat DON&#x27;T EVER get the cleaner/ charger circuitry wet. If you do, give it two days to dry out before you plug it in again or the cleaner will be quite erratic in it&#x27;s operation and could quite possibly burn out.    I&#x27;ve had four Norelco razors in my lifetime and this is BY FAR the best! When the new models came out, I actually saw no need to upgrade. For me? That&#x27;s saying something!    Good luck folks, Danny</li>
            <li> I had been use to foil razors but after 4 years w/ my Braun it was time for a new one.  I bought the Norelco as I was interested in the self cleaning aspect.  Overall it&#x27;s not bad but as they say in the manual - it does take time for your skin to adjust.  It is a solid unit and does last quite a bit of time on a charge.  The shave eventually gets to be quite nice but give your skin time to adjust.  It&#x27;s a little difficult to get a clean shave around the side burns which is where the Braun was good but that&#x27;s a small issue to deal with.</li>
            <li> This razor was disappointing for me. It does not give a close shave and has trouble with the old and stiff hairs, particularly on the mustache area.  It does have a long lasting battery, though.</li>
            <li> Got it refurbished for my husband and he was very pleased by the shorter charging time and longer battery charge. It is quieter than his previous Norelco razors, and cleans up quickly and completely with hot, running tap water. It gives a fairly good dry shave, but is very good when his skin or razor head are moistened. The shave is faster and smoother. He has owned Norelco rotary-head shavers for 30+ years and would definitely recommend it to a relative or friend.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent shaver kit. I also got a free promotion from Phillips to stay at any of the Inns in USA for one night free stay. This is really an excellent deal.</li>
            <li> This razor is so quiet sometimes I don&#x27;t feel like it could really be working.  However, it does trim the whiskers away.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it works perfectly, but it works really well.  The cleaning system actually works well and the head flips open for quick dumping of trimmings.  The charge lasts a long time and is easy to monitor.</li>
            <li> I bought this production at amazon.com for $75 during their goldbox deals. This product works amazingly well for the price. I bought this as a replacement to the Braun shaver that died after 2 years. This shaver does a great job overall. It shaves very smooth, feels closer to the skin while shaving and extremely quiet as well. I had skin irritation for the first 2 days, and I don&#x27;t feel the irritation after that. I like the option of simply cleaning the product with water although it has the jet cleaning system built in. It seems to hold the charge quite well. I also like the battery indicator. The only complaint (trivial) I have is the charging/cleaning base looks bulky ..not a big deal! I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Have had a Norelco XL for about 14 years. Mine was finally starting to fail. I found this replacement just in time and for a good price. I love my new razor and hope that it gives me a long life as well as my old one did.</li>
            <li> The razor worked fine and did a good job.  After about two years it just died.  I have no idea what was wrong with it.  It would not charge.  It would not work with the cord pluged in.  No idication what the problem was.  I still had my old one, so I threw this one away and have been using the old one (which I have had for over 8 years)which is still going strong.  For the money, this one was a waste.</li>
            <li> The shave delivered is OK. Probably a bit better than average. After a period of time (the unit decides this and not you) the &#x27;change the blades&#x27; light comes on. Until you do this the light stays on, effectively killing the battery life until you buy new blades. When I called Phillips on this they expressed &#x27;surprise&#x27; and replaced my razor, but how can this be when others in this review process report the same thing? Phillips really screwed up on this one. Do NOT buy this unit!</li>
            <li> Just purchased and have been using this shaver for one week. I was caused to change shavers when a Braun 7500 series died just beyond the warranty period. The new Norelco is beyond my expectations and is much better than my prior Braun. The Noelco is the quitest shaver I have ever used in over thirty years of shaving. It is also produces the cleanest shave I have ever received with few facial areas that you need to go back a second time to shave. Perhaps the only fault I can find with the shaver is that once you have used the automatic cleaner one must remember to either unplug the cleaner base or move the shaver (disconnect the point of contact between the base and the shaver)otherwise the shaver base goes from cleaning mode to charge mode. Otherwise a great shaver and Amazon with its rebate offer makes the shaver a great deal.</li>
            <li> After less than 3 months of purchasing this product, it stopped working. The unit no longer holds its charge and connecting the shaver to the mains supply doesn&#x27;t help either. &lt;br /&gt;BTW - For anything purchased longer than 30 days ago Amazon&#x27;s return policy leaves a lot to be desired too. It has put me off buying anything electronic from this site in the future.</li>
            <li> Have been using Norelco&#x27;s for years. This is my 4th and by far the best. I only used my electric when I traveled. Since picking up the 8160, I use it every day home and away. It is simply a great razor giving me the best shave of any electric shaver I have used.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is with the cleaner. If you store it in the cleaner, it will still be wet when you go to use the razor in the morning. It is best to remove it from the cleaner at the end of the cycle and store it in the medicine cabinet. No biggie but a better design is needed.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco products for many years.  This razor gives a close shave but is uncomfortable when shaving.  My older one still shaves smoother but not quite as close as this new model.  When you wet your face or razor everything changes - it is smooth and shaves close.  If you leave the razor in the cleaning unit and it is still wet then you use it, you will get a great shave.  The instructions about battery charging goes back to the dark ages of rechargable batteries.  It they use the old type that require all these proceedures to avoid \\&quot;memory\\&quot; then this is indeed a CHEAP product.</li>
            <li> My Braun shaver kicked out and I thought of trying the Norelco because I liked the features and was hoping to get a closer shave.  The first thing that was a huge disappointment is learning how weak the motor is on the Norelco.  When turning on my old Braun, my entire hand was vibrating the motor was so powerful.  Of course, the important question is how close a shave it gives, and the answer - not very.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because of the weak motor or bad design, after 10 minutes of skin-stretching and going over the same parts of my beard, I still had plenty of whisers showing.  Very disappointed, especially for the money.  I expected a lot more from a brand like Norelco.  It is going back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for about 2 years now.  I really like this razor compared to the last \\&quot;entry level\\&quot; norelco I used to have.  This one has much more rounded edges on the blade guuards and the pivoting and motion of the heads is much lighter and smoother.  This gives a better experience when using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say, I have to go over areas twice - once to cut them down, then again to get the smoothest shave.  I can still feel stubble when done, but it&#x27;s comparable to any other results I&#x27;ve gotten with an electric razor.  So in a nutshell, the shave itself isn&#x27;t all that much better or faster than lower models, but it&#x27;s more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other advantages are the fact that you can rinse the razor clean - that&#x27;s a big plus for me.  Also, you can use it corded or cordless.  It&#x27;s much quieter than lower models and the power seems to remain more constant over the life of the charge vs. cheaper ones seem to get significantly slower at a half charge.  The LED lets you see when you&#x27;re running low, which is needed b/c as I said, the noise and power is fairly constant up until the last 1 or 2 lights of the charge meter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest dissapointment was the jetclean system.  It takes a very long time to cycle and is twice to 3x as noisy as using the shaver itself.  Since I get ready before my wife, I usually didn&#x27;t run it so it wouldn&#x27;t wake her up.  About 1.5 years into use, the charging pins that connect to the power cord corroded and pulled out of the unit making the jetclean useless.  Also, you&#x27;re supposed to empty the used liquid weekly.  So if you don&#x27;t use it every day, you&#x27;re either keeping the shavings in the solution longer than reccomended or you&#x27;re throwing away a lot of solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say the reservoir is easy to clean and use, and is perfectly matched to the bottle of solution.  It was easy to use without making a mess.  The other reason I didn&#x27;t clean it every day was that if left in the jetclean device, I found the razor was still wet with solution the next morning.  It was also recommended to rinse the razor with water after using jetclean, which to me defeated part of the purpose of cleaning with an an-ionic solution to help prevent mineral buildup on the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recco is to buy the razor but skip the jetclean.  Just rinse with water instead and then leave it open to dry.n the next morning.  It was also recommended to rinse the razor with water after using jetclean, which to me defeated part of the purpose of cleaning with an an-ionic solution to help prevent mineral buildup on the razor.

            <li> Feels great, doesn&#x27;t take long to get used to at all. Much closer cut that the regular electric (cheap) norellco i had before!    the self cleaning also works very well, even when i thought it was clean i would run self cleaner and you can see all the stuff that comes off of it! a clean like this would be impossible to do manually, it definitely worth the extra money for the upgrade.</li>
            <li> I bought this model refurbished for about $70 and I&#x27;m highly disappointed. The good point is that the razor is definitely very quiet, but it does not cut close at all. Also, I don&#x27;t know why the new one comes with all that cleaning equipment, when the refurbished model I got says to just rinse it with water and came with no cleaning unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used this for a few days, and I&#x27;m not willing to \\&quot;allow 30 days for my skin to adjust\\&quot; because my return policy will expire. So I&#x27;m returning it. I&#x27;ve been using a previous Panasonic model for over a year that gives me a closer, better shave than this razor.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband&#x27;s birthday.  He didn&#x27;t want me to, now he loves it and uses it daily.  He especially likes that he can run it under water to clean the blades.  The charger/cleaner is neat too.  His old Norelco&#x27;s charger wires were always hanging in the sink basin, now his shaver sits neatly in the station, no fuss no muss.</li>
            <li> Love the shaver, but I wasn&#x27;t prepared for the three weeks of rough, yet sensitive skin due to razer burn.  THis shaver doesn&#x27;t get as close as my disposable razer, but that&#x27;s a given with shavers, right?  I am wondering if my face will toughen up over time, or perhaps I&#x27;ll have to just slap on some aftershave and take it like a man.  In a perfect world, I would&#x27;ve given this a 5 star rating, but the razer burn is leaving me a little raw....</li>
            <li> The razor worked better than expected, you get a clean, close and smooth shave. I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> The razor provides a fairly comfortable and close shave, but it lacks a sensitive skin setting which was available in older models.</li>
            <li> My husband and my son both have this razor. They love it!! Nice smooth shave ( as I can attest too!)</li>
            <li> The jet clean shaving system included in the package with this shaver is oversold. The structure if the shaver head is such that it can be easily cleaned with warm water immediately after use, so there appears to be no additional cleaning required. The shaver is quite similar to earlier models of the same type, so very little difference in the quality of the shave has been noted. Placing the battery charging hardware in a plug-in module so that only low voltage is present on the shaver cord is a safety improvement.</li>
            <li> Would rate at no stars if possible. First one failed after 7 months, would not hold charge. It was replaced under warranty; the replacement failed after 8 months, again, would not hold charge. Customer Service said to send in for repair, no estimate of how long I&#x27;d be without a razor. My response is \\&quot;forget it.\\&quot; Braun, here I come.</li>
            <li> just bought the Norleco 8160XLCC jet clean system.  Love the shaver for its close shave.  This shaver shaves just as close as my old and more expensive 9160 with the adjustable height/contour system.  I especiailly like the jet clean system as it really works.  The only downside is that after the cleaning cycle ends, the system goes into charge mode which will degrade the batteries if the system is repeatedly charged when not needed.  I wish the system would just go to standby vice charge after a clean cycle</li>
            <li> So far I have not learned how to use the Jet Cleaner system.  It seems to be intimidating to me.  The shaver works fine with or without a charge.</li>
            <li> All in all this is a very good razor, it gives me a good shave, the charge lasts a long time and it&#x27;s very easy to clean. Like all electric razors, in my case, it does not shave my neck area very well and I have to just \\&quot;neaten\\&quot; the area with a regular blade. I have yet to find an electric razor that can do this however so I can&#x27;t fault this model too much. In general it gives a clean, close shave and I am enjoying it very much. I love the fact that you can just rinse it under the sink to clean it and the battery indicator is a nice feature that most lower priced models don&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li> This razor doesn&#x27;t have all of the bells and whistles that some other more expensive models have.  However, it does provide a nice close shave.  Over the years I&#x27;ve bought cheaper razors and one more expensive one.  As yet, this particular model seems to strike the best balance (at least for me) between performance and price.  Also, battery life, at least so far, has been excellent</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;ll admit right off that this is not the exact model I had. I had one that was a step lower and is no longer available. Like many reviewers have already said, however, all Norelco razors are nearly identical. The model I had also had this jet clean system, and I do not recommend it. The base in mine had shorted out, and by cleaning the razor everyday, I was also charging it everyday, making battery life less than stellar. If I went to my gf&#x27;s for the wknd, I had to bring the charger. After about a year, my razor needed new blades [were getting dull, then one fell out and into the toilet]. $30 for new blades or $30 for new razor entirely... I got another cheap Norelco. This time I&#x27;ll just rinse it under hot water and save $60 a year on the jetclean.</li>
            <li> Short and to the point - Good shavers.    NEVER, EVER Register with them.     Especially NEVER, NEVER, NEVER give them an e-mail address!!!!!!!    They will spam you FOREVER!!!</li>
            <li> This is my 4th Norelco, going back quite a few years.  My last one was not very good, although the first two were great.  The 8160 shaves very close and can handle a two day growth.  How long an electric razor stays sharp is very related to how clean it is kept, as hair in the heads will dull the blades faster.  To that end, Norelco ships this razor with a motorized stand to clean the razor heads.  Basically what it does is submerge the razor in the cleaning fluid and turn it on and off occasionally.  So you need not buy the XLCC, just buy the 8160 XL.  You can submerge the razor in fluid yourself and turn it on and off a few times to do the same thing, and not have to worry about having space to store the stand.  I&#x27;m experimenting with making my own cleaning fluid, which as far as I can tell is distilled water with a small amount of glycerine and a bit of an additive such as photo-flo which breaks the surface tension of the water so it will drain right off.         One huge improvement over my prior Norelcos is the ability to rinse the razor throroughly with hot water.  It does an excellent job of cleaning the razor, and then the fluid bath is only really needed to condition the heads.  You can also buy a silcone spray which lubricates the heads to have them wear better.  So save some money but make sure the razor you buy is washable and water tight.  I highly recommend the razor itself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Quadra Action 7866XL for several years and it worked  well, but decided to upgrade to this new model. But it wasn&#x27;t an upgrade and was very disappointing; it does not shave nearly as closely or effectively as my old Quadra action razor, so I bought new heads for the 7866 XL and continue to use that.</li>
            <li> Whisper quiet. Does not give quite as close a shave as my old Norelco Quadratrack, but does give a quick, easy, very decent shave. I like it!     Jim in Denio</li>
            <li> satisfied with all marked perchases. Brakes has not used.</li>
            <li> The shave I get with this is fine, but be warned: The Norelco SpeedXL series has a built in blade life. Once Norelco thinks you need to change the blades (and they tend to think you should spend the $36  more often than you will want), the shaver disables itself. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The way it does this is that it turns on the \\&quot;change blade\\&quot; warning LED. And this LED uses so much power that it drains the batteries in just over one day. Worse yet, the shaver will not operate unless the battery is charged, so this results in a dead shaver until you replace the blades. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Way to go Norelco. I used to be a big fan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been wary of electric razors, but I have to say this one works pretty well for me.  It took no time for my face to get \\&quot;used to\\&quot; this razor (in the past it was hell to try to get through a couple of weeks with other kinds).  The first day I used it I got a nice, close shave with no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A single charge lasts me a couple of weeks, so even though I&#x27;ve brought the charger with me when traveling I&#x27;ve never had to use it (I&#x27;ll be leaving it home the next time).  I haven&#x27;t actually used the cleaning system yet, because you can run the entire razor under hot water and clean it out no problem.  I just leave it on the counter to dry until I come home from work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint would be that like most other people (and all other electric razors that I know about) it doesn&#x27;t get all of those hard to get hairs on my neck without several passes, and the trimmer doesn&#x27;t get close enough to my sideburns.  Not a problem though, I just keep a disposable razor in the shower and touch up---just a few seconds with no lather so not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone looking to make the switch.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the product and with the purchasing process.</li>
            <li> This a vey good product... i have been a user of the norelco brand (female) and had this purchased for my husband as a gift...and he loves it ..i like it too it has its own station to get charged and it brings the cleaning solution....you can set it up and it cleans by itself...  the color its great ( as a girl i like the aspect its very masculine but also very modern it doesnt look like an old machine .... hte cool part for me its that it traps all the hair in it... at first i was freaking out cause i thought it would leave a mess but he can shave anywhere he wants not over the sink if he chooses too...  so for the price and everything i think its a great buy.....</li>
            <li> OK here is the deal. I purchased this razor based on a review that Consumer Reports had in a recent issue on electric shavers. This was top rated for Rotary Shavers. I own the Braun 1775 and the Panasonic 8077s. I liked the Braun but it is a bit uncomfortable, however it provides a good shave for about $35.00. If you are looking for a basic shave with no frills extras this is a great razor. I use this at work in an emergency. The Panasonic is also very good. Using this for some time, proved only to be a 4 star shaver at best(I rated it 5 when purchased). The shave is ok but you need to pass the difficult spots(neck) a couple of times to get a close shave. Its comfortable, the cleaning system is fair, the wet/dry feature is nice but its definately harder to get a close shave with a wet face and its nicely designed. The Norelco far exceeds my expectations. The motor is very quiet. One may think its weak, but its very strong. The shave is extremely close, comfortable and gets those difficult areas with ease. I fell in love with this early on. I do not believe in the cleaning system in any razor,so I will not comment on this feature. Just rinse under hot water and let dry. Gentleman I would highly recommend this razor. I think each persons beard is different, but I will tell you this rotary works for me. Hope this helps in your descision.</li>
            <li> First I would like to say that this is the best Norelco I&#x27;ve used, and I have been using many of them over the last 30 years. However, the cleaning device is poorly conceived and cheaply executed. The biggest weakness is that it is not a \\&quot;smart\\&quot; charger, and does not stop charging when full. This shaver is actually a lithium  battery, which means run it all the way down after it&#x27;s first full charge, then keep it topped off, like a laptop. The cleaner liquid itself is super. I tried different soapy water and alcohol solutions and all of them resulted in worse shaves.          My protocol is to rinse the shaver under water right after shaving, to get rid of most of the hairs.  Then I dip it briefly into a small container with the cleaning solution, then rinse it again. Works like a charm, and the cleaner device went to the trash. BTW, this is now a clearance item, so shop around.    Update: I was wrong about the shaver it is a smart charger and so you can leave it plugged in all the time.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000UJZIEY Philips Norelco 8060X Moisturizing Shaving System]] the item is great. i have used norelco for quite a few years. would buy from amazon.com again the service was excellent.</li>
            <li> I have been a Norelco user for more than 35 years.  When I got this razor I was amazed at how quiet it was and how closely it shaved.  Even my wife noticed the difference.  There are no comfort settings, but I did not need any, it was a good shave and not so close that I got ingrown hairs on my face.  The charge lasted more than 3 weeks    I thought the cleaning system was a little \\&quot;cheesy.\\&quot;  It does okay cleaning, but you do not want to recharge every time you needc to clean.  Loved the razor, but would not get the cleaning system again.</li>
            <li> Gives very close shave also very quiet (nice to be able to talk over the razor). Razor is also very easy to keep clean even without the Jet Clean.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my son who doesn&#x27;t like to take the time to shave.  He has a heavy beard and sensitive skin. He really like this razor because it is convenient, quick and non-irritating.  Also, the self cleaning reservoir is quick and easy to use.  Not to mention, economical.  The cost of premium razors today is astronomical over time.</li>
            <li> The shaver is good, but it is too much stuff to put in the bathroom sink. And gave me some allergy.</li>
            <li> What I like is what all Norelco&#x27;s have...it&#x27;s the triple circles that increases the surface area to cut with.  That alone, in theory, makes it waay better than the other brands.  But all Norelcos are about the same.  I don&#x27;t feel any difference from my old Norelco.  It&#x27;s a solid razor, but you don&#x27;t need to spend all that money to get the same affect.  The razor Jet Clean is luxury.   If you rinse it on occassion, it will clean it too</li>
            <li> I used this against 3 days worth of growth.  It cut though effortlessly.  It didn&#x27;t irritate my face and it felt fine - no adjustment for me.  I was very impressed with the closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li> When I first got the Razor, the Jet Cleaner didn&#x27;t work right out of the box.  After contacting Customer Service they never did anything to either replace or repair the Jet Cleaner.  The Razor itself works well, however, they do not honor their warrenty and there is no Customer Support to speak of.  I suppose thats what you get from third world manufacturing.</li>
