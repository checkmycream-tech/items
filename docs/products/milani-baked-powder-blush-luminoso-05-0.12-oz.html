            <li>This is a good color for all skin shades and will be great for summer or winter</li>
            <li>Milani blush (Luminoso) on Amazon :P (</li>
            <li>The most perfect blush ever made and I&#x27;ve used probably 100 over the years!</li>
            <li>The product itself was perfect just could have been packaged better.</li>
            <li>A warm glow on cheeks!</li>
            <li>Love this brand, happy to find it on Amazon!</li>
            <li>Not the best packaging, but it doesn&#x27;t make a difference to me.&lt;br /&gt;-It will shatter easily.</li>
            <li>i really love it very good</li>
            <li>my husband even made a comment about how bright it was and he never comments on my makeup.  </li>
            <li>I am blond and fair</li>
            <li>Gorgeous color.</li>
            <li>Looks great with a nice tan.</li>
            <li>I am an experienced make up user, and in my own collection this is a must.</li>
            <li>but it is absolutely gorgeous.</li>
            <li>Perfect shade, non shimmery, and smooth application.</li>
            <li>The texture of the blush is good for layering.</li>
            <li>Good formula.</li>
            <li>It will still look gorgeous on</li>
            <li>This is a good thing.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t fathom a skin tone that wouldn&#x27;t look good in this color.</li>
            <li>put good scores.</li>
            <li>good quality.</li>
            <li>With both purchases I thought there was a good chance of me looking like a clown.</li>
            <li>Its gorgeous.</li>
            <li>It is perfect and worth the price(though compared to the alternative, it is a STEAL!)</li>
            <li>great color, perfect condition and exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad i did because it truly is beautiful.</li>
            <li>the most beautiful color</li>
            <li>If you have very fair skin, use a light hand and if you over do it, use whatever you use to apply foundation (I prefer the beauty blender) and run over the area with it to decrease the intensity.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>This color is ideal for light skin.</li>
            <li>great blush with super great price..</li>
            <li>Great pigmentation and beautiful color selection just make sure to use a light hand because they are pigmented.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect shade to go with most light skin tones.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this blush, but we forewarned!</li>
            <li>I love this blush!</li>
            <li>Love this color!</li>
            <li>Love this color!</li>
            <li>The color is ok!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Milani blushes!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Frankly, I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li>Love this blush!</li>
            <li>This blush is ok!</li>

            <li>Love these blushes!</li>
            <li>These blushes are amazing.</li>
            <li>amazing colorÔºÅ</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the glitter that is in the Orgasm which I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of so that makes me happy.</li>
            <li>This color is truly amazing.</li>
            <li>Great dupe of Nars Orgasm w/out the huge investment.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll want to use your own brush to apply it, but the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing value and the price is just the icing on the cake.</li>
            <li>The color is amazing.</li>
            <li>Great color payoff considering how light it does look on me.</li>
            <li>Nice,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s  of nice quality</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s so popular.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin look warm and glowing.</li>
            <li>Thanks awesome inexpensive Milani Luminoso!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own mirror and blush brush.</li>
            <li>I own brushes for blush anyways.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read great reviews on this blush but haven&#x27;t fallen in love with it as so many others have.</li>
            <li>I was inspired to purchase this blush because it is a popular dupe for Nars Orgasm.</li>
            <li>Every girl should own this blush.</li>
            <li>It is nice goes on well</li>
            <li>The color is beautiful, goes on so smoothly and is buildable if you want more color.  </li>
            <li>I love the peachy tones and the light shimmer, this is a great makeup product that stays put all day.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous and cheap blush.</li>
            <li>Looks so natural and flawless.</li>
            <li>It still looks good on light to medium toned skin.</li>
            <li>Loved it, it&#x27;s a beautiful soft colour, I&#x27;d recommend this blush to anyone</li>
            <li>This is a review not for the blush itself (as the color looks beautiful and I&#x27;ve only heard great things about it) but for the condition I received it in.</li>
            <li>I love this blush because it looks so natural and comes at a great price!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gorgeous, I&#x27;m of medium skin tone and it does look a bit more like a light bronzer on me</li>
            <li>The color is beautiful and it&#x27;s very pigmented.</li>
            <li>Beautiful color &amp; very convenient to use.  </li>
            <li>Milani&#x27;s shimmer is very, very fine and more peachy.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be a very light shade and would be so shiny that I can use it as highlight.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-The packaging is very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>My mother had always drilled into my head that good skincare isn&#x27;t cheap, and cheap makeup is full of chemicals that won&#x27;t be good for my skin.</li>
            <li>I am placing this review under every Milani blush I have tried, as it doesn&#x27;t seem as though these products are getting the love they deserve.</li>
            <li>However with darker skin, it would probably work more as a highlighter.</li>
            <li>Luminoso would be ok if you want to stay somewhat in the Orgasm FAMILY, but a dupe it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li>love Nars blush, at $28 a pan</li>
            <li>packaging is kind of dicey and cheap.</li>
            <li>packaging is kind of dicey and cheap.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite blush.  </li>
            <li>I guess I should have known better...</li>
            <li>Omg love it, and I will order one more time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lovely shade</li>
            <li>I love milani products.</li>
            <li>I love the way it highlights my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I just love it</li>
            <li>I‚Äôm in love with this blush.</li>
            <li>I looked around online and saw that many people recommend that as a knock off</li>
            <li>but I think I like the more pink/flushed look of Orgasm.</li>
            <li>im so in love with this blush</li>
            <li>Just repurchased... :)</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>In love with the highlight it gives to your skin</li>
            <li>I know who I&#x27;ve recommended this to absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s such a beautiful color!</li>
            <li>Love üòç</li>
            <li>I love that it comes with</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with it.</li>
            <li>I was expecting more.</li>
            <li>Best blush for such a cheap price!</li>
            <li>Not sparkly, like many blushes.</li>
            <li>This is a lovely shade that goes with anything.  </li>
            <li>I saw it on a friend, noticing how her skin kind of looked like it had a fresh kind of glow/blush.</li>
            <li>This blush is absolutely stunning.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is just me, but after you apply it, it seems to stand out more after a couple a minutes.</li>
            <li>Could see this shade working for most skin tones.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this blush.</li>
            <li>It is shimmery so if you prefer matte blushes this many not be your cup of tea.</li>
            <li>I love this blush</li>
            <li>I love the formula and this color would work well on any complexion.</li>
            <li>I love love this blush...</li>
            <li>I like the quality of Nars more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, many brands/shades of blush.</li>
            <li>This blush is a darker coral-peach that provides a healthy looking glow when applied.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this color...</li>
            <li>why pay so much more for a name?  </li>
            <li>I love drugstore makeup and this is a quality product.</li>
            <li>so be sure to build up the color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a coral color.</li>
            <li>Nice cheap blush.</li>
            <li>I heard about these Milani baked blushed from many of the makeup gurus I watch on YouTube.</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>This was recommended as a dupe for Nars Orgasm and so far so good!</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a great peachy shade which is always my favorite!</li>
            <li>Nice product, good feel, you get a lot of blush for the price (nice big size) ...</li>
            <li>I am very light as far as skin tone, and this blush looks great.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take a lot but is easily buildable if you like more color.</li>
            <li>and I thought I would be best with pink.</li>
            <li>I love the blush itself, but the packaging is cheap.</li>
            <li>They have amazing long wear and great color</li>
            <li>If you use a light hand and use it has a highlight you can get the most flattering peachy glow.</li>
            <li>I am pretty fair but with brown hair and light brown eyes.</li>
            <li>I have always heard about how nice Milani blushes are and they were right.</li>
            <li>It is great if you are going for a summer glow or a light natural look!</li>
            <li>Beautiful color, very unusual a great blend of pink and peach!!</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t even have to hurt the wallet to have such a gorgeous color!</li>
            <li>They are true to color of what you see on the sight!</li>
            <li>Easy to blend out and easy to build up.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to build the color.&lt;br /&gt;-You</li>
            <li>Color is Gorg, and goes on easily.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find it easy to apply and it had a shimmer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Invest in some good brushes (I prefer Sigma or Real Techniques) and use a light hand.</li>
            <li>I purchased this after reading countless reviews in how beautiful this blush is and how it&#x27;s comparable to a well know</li>
            <li>It looks good on a naked face face, for that fresh look, but with full makeup on the look is out of this world!!!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- goes on smoothly and easily</li>
            <li>This has quickly become my favorite blush.</li>
            <li>I kept adding more and more, but the color stopped deepening at a certain point.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too light</li>
            <li>so i cant wear it for day light</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a really complimentary blush that would suit most skin colours</li>
            <li>I have olive (light to medium) skin</li>
            <li>It is a light peach, but not too coral or orangy.</li>
            <li>I have light to medium skin</li>
            <li>So I apply it lightly and it works well.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for an everyday look.</li>
            <li>but instead I got smooth skin bronzing face powder</li>
            <li>Looks fabulous on any skin tone.  </li>
            <li>All in all, it has a nice shimmer, but just a glow, not too much.</li>
            <li>color is shimmery and goes on light.</li>
            <li>It is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It has just the right amount of pink/peach/coral tones to compliment my fair skin without making it look like I have too much blush on.</li>
            <li>this is a beautiful blush and it lasts very long.</li>
            <li>Luminoso gives me a very fresh faced look.</li>
            <li>Luminoso and Dolce pink are gorgeous!</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s a color, people), but it is flattering on my cool toned, light skin paired with light eyes and blond hair.</li>
            <li>My new favorite blush and shade!</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t own any, I highly suggest buying a blush brush or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice color, easy to apply, gives a natural glow to the skin.....</li>
            <li>have to say - I&#x27;m not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>is worth it!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try it on</li>
            <li>The pigmentation is rich, and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Im pretty sure I didn&#x27;t order that I ordered milani baked blush luminoso</li>
            <li>Love this Color - makes me feel pretty -</li>
            <li>would caution fair skinned individuals that a light application is necessary.</li>
            <li>I am very pale, and this color was perfect on me.</li>
            <li>Such a pretty shade and good pigment payoff :)</li>
            <li>Once it dries it&#x27;ll be good as new, it won&#x27;t look as pretty as it used to in the packaging, but it won&#x27;t change the way it looks on your skin.</li>
            <li>Looks great for day and evening, but in the evening I add a bronzer right under my cheekbones for extra depth.</li>
            <li>This blush is so easy to blend, I&#x27;ve tried many wonderful blushes that have been a bit difficult to blend</li>
            <li>I also think the other shades of Milani blushes are gorgeous and I will purchase more.</li>
            <li>Just right for me!</li>
            <li>This blush is top notch for a gal who loves her high end products!</li>
            <li>This is very comparable to my Tarte blush, and I would even say that this product is better than that.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t think it was super special looking.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t feel like it will run out quickly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a loyal NARS Orgasm wearer for years.</li>
            <li>Luckily that works out well with my fair/olive complexion</li>
            <li>I have to apply it pretty lightly though.</li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>I have the sort of skin tone that requires any company&#x27;s lightest shade and found that it helped to first apply a light powder to my cheeks followed by the blush.</li>
            <li>I have three of them and all of them are very pretty.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous and lasts decently long on the skin.</li>
            <li>quickly comes really worth.</li>
            <li>Got it in Luminoso and it&#x27;s so pretty!</li>
            <li>why is this one so high!!!</li>
            <li>This blush is Orgasm only 5x better!  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite by far!</li>
            <li>Record highly!!!</li>
            <li>It comes in a nice little case and the brush is OK.  </li>
            <li>This is a great year round blush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like to play with colors in the eyeshadow department and this is a great everyday, neutral blush to go along with those looks.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>It most likely won&#x27;t show up on very tan (or ethnic) skin, is more suited for paler skin types.</li>
            <li>I love the color of this blush, especially with my skin tone (light).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a good experience with Milani blushes overall, and if you&#x27;re looking for more I would recommend the shade &#x27;Red Vino.&#x27;</li>
            <li>I have a golden olive undertone and this looks peachy on me.</li>
            <li>I love the texture of this blush, goes on very evenly and is very buildable.  </li>
            <li>The perfect cross between pink and peach!</li>
            <li>I love this shade of blush!&lt;br /&gt;- very natural pink-ish coral shade of blush, gives that extra boost of color to my face without looking unnatural (I have very light ivory skin)&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is just the right shade.  </li>
            <li>I saw reviews saying this shade worked with any skin tone and hoped they were right....</li>
            <li>The color is just right &amp; the compact size.</li>
            <li>The blush color is just right.</li>
            <li>Blends very easily, and does last quite awhile.</li>
            <li>Heard so much about this blush and it didnt dissapoint love it , glides on and looks so natural fresh and femininr</li>
            <li>The effect is like you are slightly flushed (like after a great workout *wink wink*), looks very natural and super flattering.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast, it came unbroken and in good condition, not much else to say.</li>
            <li>Has great lasting power, enough sheen, and earns compliments every time I wear it.</li>
            <li>Very Pretty Blush -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very please with my Milani Blush.  </li>
            <li>the picture posted shows it as being much more rosy/coral than it actually is.  </li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t wear any makeup save for eyeliner/shadow, but sometimes when I want a bit more glow to my face, I brush a bit of this on my cheekbones and it&#x27;s truly like a natural blush.</li>
            <li>This peachy tone works for all of us sisters giving a pretty touch.</li>
            <li>but I feel its mostly shimmer and not enough pigment.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t tell you enough how much I love this blush</li>
            <li>I like luminoso enough to want to continue to try more shades though.</li>
            <li>It is somewhat sheer but has a beautiful peachy pink color to it.</li>
            <li>This is an exact duplicate for Nars Orgasm blush.</li>
            <li>I love the color of this blush, it&#x27;s not too dark and not too light.  </li>
            <li>Go to the Milani site for the real pricing!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I thought it would be</li>
            <li>The color is really pretty</li>
            <li>I love the color, I will totally buy it again.</li>
            <li>In fact, I feel kinda bummed out because I didn&#x27;t look or feel down right amazing after applying it.</li>
            <li>This shade would look amazing on dark or olive skin tones.</li>
            <li>For so long I had dumped loads of money on the all time favorite NARS Orgasm.  </li>
            <li>Awesome color comparable to nars orgasm blush for less then half price</li>
            <li>I have pretty fair skin and do not apply heavily, and it looks natural.</li>
            <li>The product itself is great, but I would recommend you to purchase it for half the price at your local drugstore (Ex. CVS, Walmart etc.).</li>
            <li>comes with a nice little</li>
            <li>True to color, blends like a dream and not at all sparkly, just gives a nice subtle glow.</li>
            <li>that is a crack habit I can&#x27;t support very often.</li>
            <li>I use the Real Techniques brushes and my Smashbox contour brush, depending on how much color and where I want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use the Real Techniques brushes and my Smashbox contour brush, depending on how much color and where I want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i would also like to point out that this doesn&#x27;t really look like the color in the picture</li>
            <li>I was expecting more of a pink tone.  </li>
            <li>but I was looking for a blush with more pink tone(s).</li>
            <li>This is very orangey.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very glittery, which I didn&#x27;t expect</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very flattering on my skin tone.</li>
            <li>I had to try this blush after LeighAnnSays raved about it so much on her YT</li>
            <li>I think I prefer more pink based blushes than this peachy type.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m now wearing a lancome one which is much nicer.  </li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t need to use that much either.</li>
            <li>It has a bit of sparkle, but not too much to be &amp;#34;glittery&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I really like this one just as well</li>
            <li>A lil light for me but could use it as a daily glow!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It works well with my paper white skin along with my light tan</li>
            <li>I really like this blush although it is shimmery.</li>
            <li>I really like the color of this but flakes off</li>
            <li>In fact, even when I found it I really thought twice before I decided on it.</li>
            <li>At CVS it seemed really like apricot.</li>
            <li>I REALLY hope they don&#x27;t stop making Luminoso colored blush.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using it as a part of my daily beauty routine.</li>
            <li>I really like this blush</li>
            <li>It looks natural and cute, also it is not as shiny as I thought it would be, expecially relatively matte compare to my slimmer finishing powder.</li>
            <li>The clear plastic in the middle of the top keeps coming off.</li>
            <li>The color is gorgeous, but there&#x27;s just a bit too much shimmer for every day wear (at least for me).  </li>
            <li>The color melts right into your skin and becomes part of your face, naturally.  </li>
            <li>I tone it down with a bit of loose translucent powder on my blush brush &amp; it&#x27;s perfect, especially for sunny (Summery) weather</li>
            <li>While the product itself looks light, it&#x27;s highly pigmented when it is actually used.</li>
            <li>I thought of all the make-up artists I&#x27;ve heard in the past talking about apricot being such a great color, or peach.</li>
            <li>Luminoso in particular is so pigmented -- more pigmented than I expected!</li>
            <li>but this is a good second choice if you want to spend less money.</li>
            <li>but I can always buy a new blush that&#x27;s more pink!</li>
            <li>I purchased this one and the bright pink Delizioso Pink.</li>
            <li>really love the color, but the fact that half the product fell out is dissapointing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I was finally scrapping out the inside and cringing at paying $30 for some more which I had to order because there is no where local that carries it.</li>
            <li>Overall a good substitute for everyday wear and at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>It is an almost (but better imo) dupe for the higher end one (not sure if I can say the name here but look it up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I dare you to compare this blush to any high end blush product....</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend picking it up, it&#x27;s about 7 dollars at the drugstore</li>
            <li>The compact is extremely high quality</li>
            <li>high end blush for a fraction of cost.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Love the color and also has a little shimmer to it</li>
            <li>This appears to be a little more peachy in my opinion.</li>
            <li>and it is very similar and pretty!</li>
            <li>and maybe I will learn to love it, but for me this blush is just a little too shimmery.</li>
            <li>However, since I am on the fair side, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s luminous and a universally flattering golden peach.</li>
            <li>Turns out the color is highly pigmented and just right for non-tan Asian skin tone.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, it is what I have been wearing every single day now.  </li>
            <li>My new go-to.</li>
            <li>I mean, you could use it in a pinch, but I always use a soft, small blush brush by Eco Tools for the best finish.</li>
            <li>I finally stumbled upon a huge collection of Mlilani products in my local Wal Mart and they had all the baked blush colors including this one.</li>
            <li>For that reason it appears more natural for everyday wear.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft both in color and in feel.  </li>
            <li>The color looks very natural &amp; lasts for quite awhile without being re-applied.</li>
            <li>Give off that very natural glow.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the exact same shade though.</li>
            <li>I have tried other shades like Coralina which I thought had too many massive flecks of glitter.</li>
            <li>Ill never buy another kind!</li>
            <li>Especially when I want a more toned down blush.</li>
            <li>Just a little sheen and fine for me, and I&#x27;m 64.</li>
            <li>and it fell all over my sink and clothes, making a huge mess.</li>
            <li>The bits fell out all over my sink and made a huge mess.</li>
            <li>It has just the right amount of peach and pink, so it looks very natural.</li>
            <li>The plastic clear section fell off on mine.</li>
            <li>I have acne-prone skin that is clear unless I stop treating it or if I use a product it doesn&#x27;t like, and this blush has never made me break out.</li>
            <li>This color is NOWHERE near a match for Orgasm, by the way.</li>
            <li>it gives you a natural glow</li>
            <li>but if you blend it out enough, they won&#x27;t show up as much in the face.</li>
            <li>The color is natural looking (</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to apply much and it seems to last.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>It has all these different tones and colors to it that really should compliment just about any skin tone.</li>
            <li>It makes you look like you just have this natural glow which I have never, ever had.</li>
            <li>Go heavy or light handed it</li>
            <li>if as much, but as soon as summer comes I&#x27;ll be using it regularly again.</li>
            <li>This gives a natural look.</li>
            <li>It was complete when I opened it</li>
            <li>I had recently tried a \\&quot;bouncy blush\\&quot; by mabelline that looked really peachy in the package.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how pigmented this way and luminous.</li>
            <li>This adds a peachy soft glow to my skin, and the color compliments the color of my bronzer</li>
            <li>Never cakes, looks natural and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I loved the color of the blush itself, but the compact came with all the blush completely broken up!</li>
            <li>When I first put it on, I did not see it that well, so I put a little more on and the color seemed to pop up a little too much all of a sudden.</li>
            <li>The only other brand I value more is Flormar ( above Mac, Nars, Napoleon, Dior etc)  UPDATE</li>
            <li>The blush was delivered very much damaged, with the clear outside portion dislodged and cracked, and with the actual blush</li>
            <li>but, contrary to what other people have said about all shades working on all skin tones, this one does not work for my pale, rose undertones.  </li>
            <li>On my mom, who has noticeably darker skin, this gives a subtle, peachy, healthy glow.</li>
            <li>I pretty much use this blush everyday over a BB cream.</li>
            <li>I ordered it thinking of using it as a highlighting blush, but on my skin it is much more of a bronzing blush since I am very pale!</li>
            <li>it is more peachy and less pink.</li>
            <li>and I thought I picked a pretty frosted pink blush, but</li>
            <li>I wish it was a little more pink</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a pale peach color with a hint of pink.</li>
            <li>These are sold at major retailers but are sold out all over Colorado.</li>
            <li>Like many blushes, it comes with a dumb brush.</li>
            <li>Hard to control, one minute too light to see,</li>
            <li>This product is much &amp;#34;peachyer&amp;#34; then expected.  </li>
            <li>The powder-first approach helped the blush blend better and be less harsh looking.</li>
            <li>pretty color with a little gold shimmer.  </li>
            <li>I am pretty pale and have a cooler skin tone</li>
            <li>I purposely overapplied this and made it look clownish, and THEN you could see a little flash, but with light handed everyday use it&#x27;s not going to be obvious.</li>

            <li> Milani blush (Luminoso) on Amazon :P (</li>
            <li> The most perfect blush ever made and I&#x27;ve used probably 100 over the years!</li>
            <li> The product itself was perfect just could have been packaged better.</li>
            <li> A warm glow on cheeks!</li>
            <li> Love this brand, happy to find it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Not the best packaging, but it doesn&#x27;t make a difference to me.&lt;br /&gt;-It will shatter easily.</li>
            <li> i really love it very good</li>
            <li> my husband even made a comment about how bright it was and he never comments on my makeup.  </li>
            <li> I am blond and fair</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color.</li>
            <li> Looks great with a nice tan.</li>
            <li> I am an experienced make up user, and in my own collection this is a must.</li>
            <li> but it is absolutely gorgeous.</li>
            <li> Perfect shade, non shimmery, and smooth application.</li>
            <li> The texture of the blush is good for layering.</li>
            <li> Good formula.</li>
            <li> It will still look gorgeous on</li>
            <li> This is a good thing.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t fathom a skin tone that wouldn&#x27;t look good in this color.</li>
            <li> put good scores.</li>
            <li> good quality.</li>
            <li> With both purchases I thought there was a good chance of me looking like a clown.</li>
            <li> Its gorgeous.</li>
            <li> It is perfect and worth the price(though compared to the alternative, it is a STEAL!)</li>
            <li> great color, perfect condition and exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad i did because it truly is beautiful.</li>
            <li> the most beautiful color</li>
            <li> If you have very fair skin, use a light hand and if you over do it, use whatever you use to apply foundation (I prefer the beauty blender) and run over the area with it to decrease the intensity.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> This color is ideal for light skin.</li>
            <li> great blush with super great price..</li>
            <li> Great pigmentation and beautiful color selection just make sure to use a light hand because they are pigmented.</li>
            <li> It is the perfect shade to go with most light skin tones.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this blush, but we forewarned!</li>
            <li> I love this blush!</li>
            <li> Love this color!</li>
            <li> Love this color!</li>
            <li> The color is ok!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Milani blushes!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Frankly, I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li> Love this blush!</li>
            <li> This blush is ok!</li>
            <li> Lovely color!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love these blushes!</li>
            <li> These blushes are amazing.</li>
            <li> amazing colorÔºÅ</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the glitter that is in the Orgasm which I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of so that makes me happy.</li>
            <li> This color is truly amazing.</li>
            <li> Great dupe of Nars Orgasm w/out the huge investment.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll want to use your own brush to apply it, but the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing value and the price is just the icing on the cake.</li>
            <li> The color is amazing.</li>
            <li> Great color payoff considering how light it does look on me.</li>
            <li> Nice,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  of nice quality</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s so popular.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin look warm and glowing.</li>
            <li> Thanks awesome inexpensive Milani Luminoso!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own mirror and blush brush.</li>
            <li> I own brushes for blush anyways.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read great reviews on this blush but haven&#x27;t fallen in love with it as so many others have.</li>
            <li> I was inspired to purchase this blush because it is a popular dupe for Nars Orgasm.</li>
            <li> Every girl should own this blush.</li>
            <li> It is nice goes on well</li>
            <li> The color is beautiful, goes on so smoothly and is buildable if you want more color.  </li>
            <li> I love the peachy tones and the light shimmer, this is a great makeup product that stays put all day.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous and cheap blush.</li>
            <li> Looks so natural and flawless.</li>
            <li> It still looks good on light to medium toned skin.</li>
            <li> Loved it, it&#x27;s a beautiful soft colour, I&#x27;d recommend this blush to anyone</li>
            <li> This is a review not for the blush itself (as the color looks beautiful and I&#x27;ve only heard great things about it) but for the condition I received it in.</li>
            <li> I love this blush because it looks so natural and comes at a great price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gorgeous, I&#x27;m of medium skin tone and it does look a bit more like a light bronzer on me</li>
            <li> The color is beautiful and it&#x27;s very pigmented.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color &amp; very convenient to use.  </li>
            <li> Milani&#x27;s shimmer is very, very fine and more peachy.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a very light shade and would be so shiny that I can use it as highlight.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-The packaging is very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> My mother had always drilled into my head that good skincare isn&#x27;t cheap, and cheap makeup is full of chemicals that won&#x27;t be good for my skin.</li>
            <li> I am placing this review under every Milani blush I have tried, as it doesn&#x27;t seem as though these products are getting the love they deserve.</li>
            <li> However with darker skin, it would probably work more as a highlighter.</li>
            <li> Luminoso would be ok if you want to stay somewhat in the Orgasm FAMILY, but a dupe it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> love Nars blush, at $28 a pan</li>
            <li> packaging is kind of dicey and cheap.</li>
            <li> packaging is kind of dicey and cheap.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite blush.  </li>
            <li> I guess I should have known better...</li>
            <li> Omg love it, and I will order one more time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lovely shade</li>
            <li> I love milani products.</li>
            <li> I love the way it highlights my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I just love it</li>
            <li> I‚Äôm in love with this blush.</li>
            <li> I looked around online and saw that many people recommend that as a knock off</li>
            <li> but I think I like the more pink/flushed look of Orgasm.</li>
            <li> im so in love with this blush</li>
            <li> Just repurchased... :)</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> In love with the highlight it gives to your skin</li>
            <li> I know who I&#x27;ve recommended this to absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s such a beautiful color!</li>
            <li> Love üòç</li>
            <li> I love that it comes with</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with it.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more.</li>
            <li> Best blush for such a cheap price!</li>
            <li> Not sparkly, like many blushes.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely shade that goes with anything.  </li>
            <li> I saw it on a friend, noticing how her skin kind of looked like it had a fresh kind of glow/blush.</li>
            <li> This blush is absolutely stunning.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is just me, but after you apply it, it seems to stand out more after a couple a minutes.</li>
            <li> Could see this shade working for most skin tones.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this blush.</li>
            <li> It is shimmery so if you prefer matte blushes this many not be your cup of tea.</li>
            <li> I love this blush</li>
            <li> I love the formula and this color would work well on any complexion.</li>
            <li> I love love this blush...</li>
            <li> I like the quality of Nars more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, many brands/shades of blush.</li>
            <li> This blush is a darker coral-peach that provides a healthy looking glow when applied.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love this color...</li>
            <li> why pay so much more for a name?  </li>
            <li> I love drugstore makeup and this is a quality product.</li>
            <li> so be sure to build up the color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a coral color.</li>
            <li> Nice cheap blush.</li>
            <li> I heard about these Milani baked blushed from many of the makeup gurus I watch on YouTube.</li>
            <li> but I love it.</li>
            <li> This was recommended as a dupe for Nars Orgasm and so far so good!</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a great peachy shade which is always my favorite!</li>
            <li> Nice product, good feel, you get a lot of blush for the price (nice big size) ...</li>
            <li> I am very light as far as skin tone, and this blush looks great.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take a lot but is easily buildable if you like more color.</li>
            <li> and I thought I would be best with pink.</li>
            <li> I love the blush itself, but the packaging is cheap.</li>
            <li> They have amazing long wear and great color</li>
            <li> If you use a light hand and use it has a highlight you can get the most flattering peachy glow.</li>
            <li> I am pretty fair but with brown hair and light brown eyes.</li>
            <li> I have always heard about how nice Milani blushes are and they were right.</li>
            <li> It is great if you are going for a summer glow or a light natural look!</li>
            <li> Beautiful color, very unusual a great blend of pink and peach!!</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t even have to hurt the wallet to have such a gorgeous color!</li>
            <li> They are true to color of what you see on the sight!</li>
            <li> Easy to blend out and easy to build up.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to build the color.&lt;br /&gt;-You</li>
            <li> Color is Gorg, and goes on easily.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find it easy to apply and it had a shimmer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Invest in some good brushes (I prefer Sigma or Real Techniques) and use a light hand.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading countless reviews in how beautiful this blush is and how it&#x27;s comparable to a well know</li>
            <li> It looks good on a naked face face, for that fresh look, but with full makeup on the look is out of this world!!!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- goes on smoothly and easily</li>
            <li> This has quickly become my favorite blush.</li>
            <li> I kept adding more and more, but the color stopped deepening at a certain point.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too light</li>
            <li> so i cant wear it for day light</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a really complimentary blush that would suit most skin colours</li>
            <li> I have olive (light to medium) skin</li>
            <li> It is a light peach, but not too coral or orangy.</li>
            <li> I have light to medium skin</li>
            <li> So I apply it lightly and it works well.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for an everyday look.</li>
            <li> but instead I got smooth skin bronzing face powder</li>
            <li> Looks fabulous on any skin tone.  </li>
            <li> All in all, it has a nice shimmer, but just a glow, not too much.</li>
            <li> color is shimmery and goes on light.</li>
            <li> It is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It has just the right amount of pink/peach/coral tones to compliment my fair skin without making it look like I have too much blush on.</li>
            <li> this is a beautiful blush and it lasts very long.</li>
            <li> Luminoso gives me a very fresh faced look.</li>
            <li> Luminoso and Dolce pink are gorgeous!</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s a color, people), but it is flattering on my cool toned, light skin paired with light eyes and blond hair.</li>
            <li> My new favorite blush and shade!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t own any, I highly suggest buying a blush brush or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice color, easy to apply, gives a natural glow to the skin.....</li>
            <li> have to say - I&#x27;m not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> is worth it!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try it on</li>
            <li> The pigmentation is rich, and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Im pretty sure I didn&#x27;t order that I ordered milani baked blush luminoso</li>
            <li> Love this Color - makes me feel pretty -</li>
            <li> would caution fair skinned individuals that a light application is necessary.</li>
            <li> I am very pale, and this color was perfect on me.</li>
            <li> Such a pretty shade and good pigment payoff :)</li>
            <li> Once it dries it&#x27;ll be good as new, it won&#x27;t look as pretty as it used to in the packaging, but it won&#x27;t change the way it looks on your skin.</li>
            <li> Looks great for day and evening, but in the evening I add a bronzer right under my cheekbones for extra depth.</li>
            <li> This blush is so easy to blend, I&#x27;ve tried many wonderful blushes that have been a bit difficult to blend</li>
            <li> I also think the other shades of Milani blushes are gorgeous and I will purchase more.</li>
            <li> Just right for me!</li>
            <li> This blush is top notch for a gal who loves her high end products!</li>
            <li> This is very comparable to my Tarte blush, and I would even say that this product is better than that.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t think it was super special looking.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t feel like it will run out quickly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal NARS Orgasm wearer for years.</li>
            <li> Luckily that works out well with my fair/olive complexion</li>
            <li> I have to apply it pretty lightly though.</li>
            <li> Very pretty.</li>
            <li> I have the sort of skin tone that requires any company&#x27;s lightest shade and found that it helped to first apply a light powder to my cheeks followed by the blush.</li>
            <li> I have three of them and all of them are very pretty.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous and lasts decently long on the skin.</li>
            <li> quickly comes really worth.</li>
            <li> Got it in Luminoso and it&#x27;s so pretty!</li>
            <li> why is this one so high!!!</li>
            <li> This blush is Orgasm only 5x better!  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite by far!</li>
            <li> Record highly!!!</li>
            <li> It comes in a nice little case and the brush is OK.  </li>
            <li> This is a great year round blush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like to play with colors in the eyeshadow department and this is a great everyday, neutral blush to go along with those looks.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> It most likely won&#x27;t show up on very tan (or ethnic) skin, is more suited for paler skin types.</li>
            <li> I love the color of this blush, especially with my skin tone (light).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a good experience with Milani blushes overall, and if you&#x27;re looking for more I would recommend the shade &#x27;Red Vino.&#x27;</li>
            <li> I have a golden olive undertone and this looks peachy on me.</li>
            <li> I love the texture of this blush, goes on very evenly and is very buildable.  </li>
            <li> The perfect cross between pink and peach!</li>
            <li> I love this shade of blush!&lt;br /&gt;- very natural pink-ish coral shade of blush, gives that extra boost of color to my face without looking unnatural (I have very light ivory skin)&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is just the right shade.  </li>
            <li> I saw reviews saying this shade worked with any skin tone and hoped they were right....</li>
            <li> The color is just right &amp; the compact size.</li>
            <li> The blush color is just right.</li>
            <li> Blends very easily, and does last quite awhile.</li>
            <li> Heard so much about this blush and it didnt dissapoint love it , glides on and looks so natural fresh and femininr</li>
            <li> The effect is like you are slightly flushed (like after a great workout *wink wink*), looks very natural and super flattering.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast, it came unbroken and in good condition, not much else to say.</li>
            <li> Has great lasting power, enough sheen, and earns compliments every time I wear it.</li>
            <li> Very Pretty Blush -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very please with my Milani Blush.  </li>
            <li> the picture posted shows it as being much more rosy/coral than it actually is.  </li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t wear any makeup save for eyeliner/shadow, but sometimes when I want a bit more glow to my face, I brush a bit of this on my cheekbones and it&#x27;s truly like a natural blush.</li>
            <li> This peachy tone works for all of us sisters giving a pretty touch.</li>
            <li> but I feel its mostly shimmer and not enough pigment.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell you enough how much I love this blush</li>
            <li> I like luminoso enough to want to continue to try more shades though.</li>
            <li> It is somewhat sheer but has a beautiful peachy pink color to it.</li>
            <li> This is an exact duplicate for Nars Orgasm blush.</li>
            <li> I love the color of this blush, it&#x27;s not too dark and not too light.  </li>
            <li> Go to the Milani site for the real pricing!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I thought it would be</li>
            <li> The color is really pretty</li>
            <li> I love the color, I will totally buy it again.</li>
            <li> In fact, I feel kinda bummed out because I didn&#x27;t look or feel down right amazing after applying it.</li>
            <li> This shade would look amazing on dark or olive skin tones.</li>
            <li> For so long I had dumped loads of money on the all time favorite NARS Orgasm.  </li>
            <li> Awesome color comparable to nars orgasm blush for less then half price</li>
            <li> I have pretty fair skin and do not apply heavily, and it looks natural.</li>
            <li> The product itself is great, but I would recommend you to purchase it for half the price at your local drugstore (Ex. CVS, Walmart etc.).</li>
            <li> comes with a nice little</li>
            <li> True to color, blends like a dream and not at all sparkly, just gives a nice subtle glow.</li>
            <li> that is a crack habit I can&#x27;t support very often.</li>
            <li> I use the Real Techniques brushes and my Smashbox contour brush, depending on how much color and where I want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use the Real Techniques brushes and my Smashbox contour brush, depending on how much color and where I want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i would also like to point out that this doesn&#x27;t really look like the color in the picture</li>
            <li> I was expecting more of a pink tone.  </li>
            <li> but I was looking for a blush with more pink tone(s).</li>
            <li> This is very orangey.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very glittery, which I didn&#x27;t expect</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very flattering on my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I had to try this blush after LeighAnnSays raved about it so much on her YT</li>
            <li> I think I prefer more pink based blushes than this peachy type.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m now wearing a lancome one which is much nicer.  </li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t need to use that much either.</li>
            <li> It has a bit of sparkle, but not too much to be &amp;#34;glittery&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I really like this one just as well</li>
            <li> A lil light for me but could use it as a daily glow!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It works well with my paper white skin along with my light tan</li>
            <li> I really like this blush although it is shimmery.</li>
            <li> I really like the color of this but flakes off</li>
            <li> In fact, even when I found it I really thought twice before I decided on it.</li>
            <li> At CVS it seemed really like apricot.</li>
            <li> I REALLY hope they don&#x27;t stop making Luminoso colored blush.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using it as a part of my daily beauty routine.</li>
            <li> I really like this blush</li>
            <li> It looks natural and cute, also it is not as shiny as I thought it would be, expecially relatively matte compare to my slimmer finishing powder.</li>
            <li> The clear plastic in the middle of the top keeps coming off.</li>
            <li> The color is gorgeous, but there&#x27;s just a bit too much shimmer for every day wear (at least for me).  </li>
            <li> The color melts right into your skin and becomes part of your face, naturally.  </li>
            <li> I tone it down with a bit of loose translucent powder on my blush brush &amp; it&#x27;s perfect, especially for sunny (Summery) weather</li>
            <li> While the product itself looks light, it&#x27;s highly pigmented when it is actually used.</li>
            <li> I thought of all the make-up artists I&#x27;ve heard in the past talking about apricot being such a great color, or peach.</li>
            <li> Luminoso in particular is so pigmented -- more pigmented than I expected!</li>
            <li> but this is a good second choice if you want to spend less money.</li>
            <li> but I can always buy a new blush that&#x27;s more pink!</li>
            <li> I purchased this one and the bright pink Delizioso Pink.</li>
            <li> really love the color, but the fact that half the product fell out is dissapointing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I was finally scrapping out the inside and cringing at paying $30 for some more which I had to order because there is no where local that carries it.</li>
            <li> Overall a good substitute for everyday wear and at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> It is an almost (but better imo) dupe for the higher end one (not sure if I can say the name here but look it up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I dare you to compare this blush to any high end blush product....</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend picking it up, it&#x27;s about 7 dollars at the drugstore</li>
            <li> The compact is extremely high quality</li>
            <li> high end blush for a fraction of cost.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love the color and also has a little shimmer to it</li>
            <li> This appears to be a little more peachy in my opinion.</li>
            <li> and it is very similar and pretty!</li>
            <li> and maybe I will learn to love it, but for me this blush is just a little too shimmery.</li>
            <li> However, since I am on the fair side, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s luminous and a universally flattering golden peach.</li>
            <li> Turns out the color is highly pigmented and just right for non-tan Asian skin tone.</li>
            <li> Sure enough, it is what I have been wearing every single day now.  </li>
            <li> My new go-to.</li>
            <li> I mean, you could use it in a pinch, but I always use a soft, small blush brush by Eco Tools for the best finish.</li>
            <li> I finally stumbled upon a huge collection of Mlilani products in my local Wal Mart and they had all the baked blush colors including this one.</li>
            <li> For that reason it appears more natural for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft both in color and in feel.  </li>
            <li> The color looks very natural &amp; lasts for quite awhile without being re-applied.</li>
            <li> Give off that very natural glow.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the exact same shade though.</li>
            <li> I have tried other shades like Coralina which I thought had too many massive flecks of glitter.</li>
            <li> Ill never buy another kind!</li>
            <li> Especially when I want a more toned down blush.</li>
            <li> Just a little sheen and fine for me, and I&#x27;m 64.</li>
            <li> and it fell all over my sink and clothes, making a huge mess.</li>
            <li> The bits fell out all over my sink and made a huge mess.</li>
            <li> It has just the right amount of peach and pink, so it looks very natural.</li>
            <li> The plastic clear section fell off on mine.</li>
            <li> I have acne-prone skin that is clear unless I stop treating it or if I use a product it doesn&#x27;t like, and this blush has never made me break out.</li>
            <li> This color is NOWHERE near a match for Orgasm, by the way.</li>
            <li> it gives you a natural glow</li>
            <li> but if you blend it out enough, they won&#x27;t show up as much in the face.</li>
            <li> The color is natural looking (</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to apply much and it seems to last.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> It has all these different tones and colors to it that really should compliment just about any skin tone.</li>
            <li> It makes you look like you just have this natural glow which I have never, ever had.</li>
            <li> Go heavy or light handed it</li>
            <li> if as much, but as soon as summer comes I&#x27;ll be using it regularly again.</li>
            <li> This gives a natural look.</li>
            <li> It was complete when I opened it</li>
            <li> I had recently tried a \\&quot;bouncy blush\\&quot; by mabelline that looked really peachy in the package.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how pigmented this way and luminous.</li>
            <li> This adds a peachy soft glow to my skin, and the color compliments the color of my bronzer</li>
            <li> Never cakes, looks natural and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I loved the color of the blush itself, but the compact came with all the blush completely broken up!</li>
            <li> When I first put it on, I did not see it that well, so I put a little more on and the color seemed to pop up a little too much all of a sudden.</li>
            <li> The only other brand I value more is Flormar ( above Mac, Nars, Napoleon, Dior etc)  UPDATE</li>
            <li> The blush was delivered very much damaged, with the clear outside portion dislodged and cracked, and with the actual blush</li>
            <li> but, contrary to what other people have said about all shades working on all skin tones, this one does not work for my pale, rose undertones.  </li>
            <li> On my mom, who has noticeably darker skin, this gives a subtle, peachy, healthy glow.</li>
            <li> I pretty much use this blush everyday over a BB cream.</li>
            <li> I ordered it thinking of using it as a highlighting blush, but on my skin it is much more of a bronzing blush since I am very pale!</li>
            <li> it is more peachy and less pink.</li>
            <li> and I thought I picked a pretty frosted pink blush, but</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little more pink</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a pale peach color with a hint of pink.</li>
            <li> These are sold at major retailers but are sold out all over Colorado.</li>
            <li> Like many blushes, it comes with a dumb brush.</li>
            <li> Hard to control, one minute too light to see,</li>
            <li> This product is much &amp;#34;peachyer&amp;#34; then expected.  </li>
            <li> The powder-first approach helped the blush blend better and be less harsh looking.</li>
            <li> pretty color with a little gold shimmer.  </li>
            <li> I am pretty pale and have a cooler skin tone</li>
            <li> I purposely overapplied this and made it look clownish, and THEN you could see a little flash, but with light handed everyday use it&#x27;s not going to be obvious.</li>
            <li> The only dislike that I have is the brush; it is too stiff and rubs the blush out of the container (even if used gently).</li>
            <li> If you put Orgasm on one cheek and Luminoso on the other, you would clearly see how alike they are NOT.</li>
            <li> At 1/3 the price of the other blushes I have, I was genuinely surprised.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t last as long when applied.</li>
            <li> it was very hard to apply, it didn&#x27;t come off on my professional blush brush very well</li>
            <li> It is very pale and almost looks like a light bronzer, pale blush.</li>
            <li> &amp; I know that this blush will last a very long time</li>
            <li> Especially if you start with a good foundation base.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll last a long long time!</li>
            <li> I ignored the reviews for a long time but...seriously go for it.  </li>
            <li> it stay long time</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and does not break my face out (which often happens with blush).</li>
            <li> LONG.</li>
            <li> , however i bought this online and later realized it sells at my local cvs for half the price</li>
            <li> EVERY SINGLE COLOR has worked with my coloring, whether it is pink, peach, purple, red...</li>
            <li> During the winter/spring months I&#x27;m pretty pale with dark reddish brown hair and during summer I tend to get just a *little* tan and my hair lightens a bit as well.</li>
            <li> Wow, this product looks so ordinary in the pan</li>
            <li> The color is very similar to Nars &amp;#34;orgasim&amp;#34; but it doesn&#x27;t go on as dark.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a tiny bit less pigmented than I&#x27;d like, which is why I knocked off one star.</li>
            <li> After numerous You Tube clips, I opted out to purchase this affordable little gem</li>
            <li> I like the color of it and it only takes a little but every time I use it</li>
            <li> When I saw how light the blush was, I was afraid that it wouldn&#x27;t show up on my skin tone, so I packed on a lot to my brush.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as pink as it appears online.</li>
            <li> Not really the blushes&#x27; fault but</li>
            <li> You can always build, but it&#x27;s harder to take off.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t given up the pink based blush, but</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s really no way I can use this.</li>
            <li> I have light/medium yellow-toned skin, and Luminoso looks sort of peachy pink on me.</li>
            <li> Be careful if you purchase this product.</li>
            <li> The color isn&#x27;t as pink as it appears in the picture, though.</li>
            <li> Nice subtle color that isn&#x27;t crazy glittery or anything like that.</li>
            <li> meaning a little will go a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this brand.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve got to check out other products from this company.</li>
            <li> Ordered this as a gift for someone and was disappointed to find out that instead of the makeup being in once solid piece as its supposed to be it was shattered and most of it fell out when the recipient opened the container unaware that the makeup inside was broken into little pieces.</li>
            <li> Note though that the color will become one solid color mix and not the delicately veined color that it was before it smashed to bits.</li>

            <li> If I had a complaint, it would be the packaging, it&#x27;s not sturdy and a bit of a pain to open.</li>
            <li> It had to have been sent that way because it looked like it had been slammed down on the ground.</li>
            <li> Hands Down.</li>
            <li> (it has a slight hint of gold metallic tone).</li>

            <li> you.&lt;br /&gt;-The brush is pretty much useless, but that&#x27;s usually the case with all makeup that includes brushes like that.</li>
            <li> Not true.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just going to have to look for it in stores because this was not worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a little bit shimmery/</li>
            <li> the packging is a little pour</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed because I was extremely excited to try on this product.</li>
            <li> I kept seeing this little guy on YouTube</li>
            <li> I did a little test and applied it heavily to one cheek.</li>
            <li> But you can collect the broken contents, mix with enough 99% alcohol to make a paste, and re-press this into another container if you need to.</li>

            <li> Only Complaint is when it arrived it came broken.</li>
            <li> Unlike some cheaper alternatives that come with very little product, this come with a lot of product.</li>
            <li> brush!&lt;br /&gt;- small, compact case but</li>
            <li> so it may be difficult to find in your local drug store.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what a \\&quot;baked\\&quot; blush is.</li>
            <li> But even getting past that, I didn&#x27;t care for the application and</li>
            <li> Or at least few on Amazon are saying so!</li>
            <li> It applies well and evenly, which I find is sometimes hard to find in a blush.  </li>
            <li> Hardly a dent in the blush with about a month of use.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s hard to overdo it with Luminoso.</li>
            <li> this peach blush I&#x27;ve been using alot lately.</li>
            <li> And I do mean &amp;#34;peach&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Item arrived sealed and as I opened it clearly seemed that it was used ....kind of gross ...very disappointed :(</li>
            <li> I HATE glitter, and this is definitely not that.</li>
            <li> and as I unpackaged it I saw that the powder was completely broken.</li>
            <li> Since this blush is raised up like a mountain, there is no where for the broken blush pieces to go except to fall out all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have freckles and reddish hair and usually have a very difficult time finding blush that does not look &amp;#34;clownish&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I hate buying blush, the color is always wrong, probably due to my skill in picking it.</li>
            <li> Maybe if someone is vaguely color blind.</li>
            <li> Looks just like the expensive orgasm blush</li>
            <li> sorry girls)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was reviewed elsewhere as being a dupe for the expensive Nars blush that I like.</li>
            <li> Was a weird &#x27;orangey&#x27; color.</li>
            <li> I was definitely wrong.</li>
            <li> the color was weird looking on me.  </li>
            <li> Seriously?!!</li>
            <li> To its credit, the blush has staying power, at least with the combination of base and powder that I used it with.</li>
            <li> Still don&#x27;t get utubers obession with but, but for the price &amp; quality ain&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> : however, I have just stumbled across this: [...]</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that I could not find them sold anymore.</li>
            <li> brush included with it is worthless.</li>
            <li> Everyone said it would be, but I was doubtful.</li>
            <li> and this looks terrible on me.</li>
            <li> and I looked awful.  </li>
            <li> The way the packaging is designed is awful!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The product itself is great, but I would recommend you to purchase it for half the price at your local drugstore (Ex. CVS, Walmart etc.). The blush was delivered very much damaged, with the clear outside portion dislodged and cracked, and with the actual blush broken.&lt;br /&gt;In hindsight, I would have happily picked it up at CVS.</li>
            <li> Love the color and also has a little shimmer to it</li>
            <li> Looks great! I am blond and fair and I thought I would be best with pink. This has a tad bit of a coral look on me and I was told by my friend I looked great! Just a little sheen and fine for me, and I&#x27;m 64.</li>
            <li> I love the blush itself, but the packaging is cheap.</li>
            <li> I am placing this review under every Milani blush I have tried, as it doesn&#x27;t seem as though these products are getting the love they deserve. Or at least few on Amazon are saying so! With the Milani blush, don&#x27;t look at a color and say, \\&quot;I can&#x27;t wear that because of my coloring\\&quot;. YES YOU CAN. These blushes are amazing. EVERY SINGLE COLOR has worked with my coloring, whether it is pink, peach, purple, red...anyone can wear these. I think even darker skin tones could wear these even as highlighters if nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is for the color LUMINOSO. I am very pale, and this color was perfect on me. It is a flushed peach color with an understated gold tone; it is NOT shimmery. However with darker skin, it would probably work more as a highlighter. Don&#x27;t let the gold veining turn you off, you don&#x27;t see this on your face. I purposely overapplied this and made it look clownish, and THEN you could see a little flash, but with light handed everyday use it&#x27;s not going to be obvious. I HATE glitter, and this is definitely not that. Some people compare this to NARS Orgasm. (However, Orgasm is the glitterbomb from h*ll on me, this one is not) This color is NOWHERE near a match for Orgasm, by the way. None of Milani&#x27;s blushes are even close. Maybe if someone is vaguely color blind. If you put Orgasm on one cheek and Luminoso on the other, you would clearly see how alike they are NOT. Orgasm is pinker and has larger shimmer particles. Milani&#x27;s shimmer is very, very fine and more peachy. Luminoso would be ok if you want to stay somewhat in the Orgasm FAMILY, but a dupe it&#x27;s not. (Try Flirt&#x27;s Heartthrob, it&#x27;s closer)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Nars blush, at $28 a pan that is a crack habit I can&#x27;t support very often. I picked up these Milani blushes in every color. I dare you to compare this blush to any high end blush product....ANY. They have amazing long wear and great color payoff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The brush included with it is worthless. Unless you *LIKE* your blush to look like stripes of war paint!

            <li> This is my favorite blush.  I ignored the reviews for a long time but...seriously go for it.  It&#x27;s very soft both in color and in feel.  It&#x27;s just a little bit shimmery/velvety and goes well on a lot of skintones.  This is comparable to Nars blushes, truly it is.  I would highly recommend picking it up, it&#x27;s about 7 dollars at the drugstore and it&#x27;s worth every penny.  It&#x27;ll last a long long time!</li>
            <li> this is a beautiful blush and it lasts very long. other blushes i put on within 15 min you can&#x27;t even tell i applied it. this one is different after i would say 3-4 hours you can still see it there but its not as pigmented but it is still pigmented. ***** i would also like to point out that this doesn&#x27;t really look like the color in the picture it is more peachy and less pink. i probably wouldn&#x27;t of bought it if i knew that but I&#x27;m glad i did because it truly is beautiful. it gives you a natural glow**** i use this product every day. it makes my face look brightened and glowy but no sparkles!</li>
            <li> I love this shade of blush!&lt;br /&gt;- very natural pink-ish coral shade of blush, gives that extra boost of color to my face without looking unnatural (I have very light ivory skin)&lt;br /&gt;- goes on smoothly and easily&lt;br /&gt;- comes with a nice little brush!&lt;br /&gt;- small, compact case but doesn&#x27;t feel like it will run out quickly</li>
            <li> The best blush ever!!! You would think this was a mac blush.</li>
            <li> Looks just like the expensive orgasm blush</li>
            <li> Its a Beautiful  color!</li>
            <li> Nice product, good feel, you get a lot of blush for the price (nice big size) ... but this looks orange on my skin.  I would buy this again but in a lighter or way different color.  I was expecting more of a pink tone.  Who has orange cheeks?</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this blush, but we forewarned! It isn&#x27;t as pink as it appears online. It&#x27;s more of a pale peach color with a hint of pink. I guess I should have known better...hehe! The compact is extremely high quality &amp; I know that this blush will last a very long time (it&#x27;s compressed like pressed powder). The color? Nice, but I was looking for a blush with more pink tone(s). The color itself is \\&quot;dense\\&quot;...meaning a little will go a long way. I tone it down with a bit of loose translucent powder on my blush brush &amp; it&#x27;s perfect, especially for sunny (Summery) weather (it has a slight hint of gold metallic tone). It most likely won&#x27;t show up on very tan (or ethnic) skin, is more suited for paler skin types.</li>
            <li> Omg love it, and I will order one more time.</li>
            <li> Not really the blushes&#x27; fault but the picture posted shows it as being much more rosy/coral than it actually is.  In reality, it is peach.  And I do mean &amp;#34;peach&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s a lovely shade but, contrary to what other people have said about all shades working on all skin tones, this one does not work for my pale, rose undertones.  To its credit, the blush has staying power, at least with the combination of base and powder that I used it with. I tried it once and it lasted for the entire day.  It&#x27;s  of nice quality so I will likely give it to a friend.</li>
            <li> I love milani products. The color is beautiful and it&#x27;s very pigmented. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Very Pretty Blush -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very please with my Milani Blush.  It isn&#x27;t too light it is just the right shade.  I love the way it highlights my eyes.  I am very happy that I made this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;F.E. Manuel</li>
            <li> I saw this on Pinterest and people were raving about it. I saw reviews saying this shade worked with any skin tone and hoped they were right.... Not true. This is very orangey. I am pretty pale and have a cooler skin tone and this looks terrible on me. This shade would look amazing on dark or olive skin tones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this blush!  It adds a beautiful color to my cheeks.  If I had a complaint, it would be the packaging, it&#x27;s not sturdy and a bit of a pain to open.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color. I normally don&#x27;t wear any makeup save for eyeliner/shadow, but sometimes when I want a bit more glow to my face, I brush a bit of this on my cheekbones and it&#x27;s truly like a natural blush. My skin is a fair-medium beige, for comparison.</li>
            <li> amazing colorÔºÅ I just love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very glittery, which I didn&#x27;t expect but if you blend it out enough, they won&#x27;t show up as much in the face. Overall it&#x27;s a great peachy shade which is always my favorite!</li>
            <li> Just as the title states, this is a great dupe for the NARS Orgasm that&#x27;s so popular. It&#x27;s making the rounds around the beauty communities so it may be difficult to find in your local drug store. It&#x27;s very flattering on my skin tone. During the winter/spring months I&#x27;m pretty pale with dark reddish brown hair and during summer I tend to get just a *little* tan and my hair lightens a bit as well. This is a great year round blush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Invest in some good brushes (I prefer Sigma or Real Techniques) and use a light hand. You can always build, but it&#x27;s harder to take off. Great color payoff and great staying power. Especially if you start with a good foundation base.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a very light shade and would be so shiny that I can use it as highlight. Turns out the color is highly pigmented and just right for non-tan Asian skin tone. It looks natural and cute, also it is not as shiny as I thought it would be, expecially relatively matte compare to my slimmer finishing powder.</li>
            <li> I‚Äôm in love with this blush. This peachy tone works for all of us sisters giving a pretty touch.</li>
            <li> This has quickly become my favorite blush. However, since I am on the fair side, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Awesome color comparable to nars orgasm blush for less then half price</li>
            <li> I had to try this blush after LeighAnnSays raved about it so much on her YT channel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say - I&#x27;m not disappointed.  I love the color of this blush, especially with my skin tone (light). It applies well and evenly, which I find is sometimes hard to find in a blush.  The color is natural looking (no clown makeup here!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this blush!!!</li>
            <li> This is a very good Nars Orgasm dupe.  Similar color and has the same shimmer.  Packaging is a bit flimsy though.  The plastic clear section fell off on mine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal NARS Orgasm wearer for years. NARS last forever but I was finally scrapping out the inside and cringing at paying $30 for some more which I had to order because there is no where local that carries it. I looked around online and saw that many people recommend that as a knock off so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try for a third of the price. I&#x27;m happy I did. It doesn&#x27;t have the glitter that is in the Orgasm which I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of so that makes me happy. For that reason it appears more natural for everyday wear. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the exact same shade though. This appears to be a little more peachy in my opinion. Luckily that works out well with my fair/olive complexion but I think I like the more pink/flushed look of Orgasm. Milani seems to be well pigmented. I don&#x27;t need to apply much and it seems to last. Overall a good substitute for everyday wear and at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> im so in love with this blush and I didn&#x27;t even have to hurt the wallet to have such a gorgeous color!</li>
            <li> Got it in Luminoso and it&#x27;s so pretty! Looks great with a nice tan. Makes my skin look warm and glowing. It doesn&#x27;t take a lot but is easily buildable if you like more color.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading countless reviews in how beautiful this blush is and how it&#x27;s comparable to a well know high end blush for a fraction of cost. I wore it today but I didn&#x27;t think it was super special looking. In fact, I feel kinda bummed out because I didn&#x27;t look or feel down right amazing after applying it. Sniff. I think you should test out product and see for yourself. I think I prefer more pink based blushes than this peachy type. That&#x27;s just me though...UPDATE: I&#x27;m bumping up this product 1 star. Why, you might ask? The peachiness  just grew on me. I haven&#x27;t given up the pink based blush, but this peach blush I&#x27;ve been using alot lately. Still don&#x27;t get utubers obession with but, but for the price &amp; quality ain&#x27;t too bad. Just repurchased... :)</li>
            <li> GORGEOUS color!!  I love this blush!</li>
            <li> I am an experienced make up user, and in my own collection this is a must. After numerous You Tube clips, I opted out to purchase this affordable little gem and I love it. The only other brand I value more is Flormar ( above Mac, Nars, Napoleon, Dior etc)  UPDATE: however, I have just stumbled across this: [...]</li>
            <li> Beautiful color &amp; very convenient to use.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The color looks very natural &amp; lasts for quite awhile without being re-applied.</li>
            <li> Ordered this as a gift for someone and was disappointed to find out that instead of the makeup being in once solid piece as its supposed to be it was shattered and most of it fell out when the recipient opened the container unaware that the makeup inside was broken into little pieces.</li>
            <li> This blush is AMAZING! I have medium skin or like a sandy-beigy-neutral skin tone and it&#x27;s the best blush I&#x27;ve had to date. It has all these different tones and colors to it that really should compliment just about any skin tone. Such a fan! It makes you look like you just have this natural glow which I have never, ever had. Thanks awesome inexpensive Milani Luminoso! You are awesome!</li>
            <li> great color, perfect condition and exactly as described.  This is a good color for all skin shades and will be great for summer or winter</li>
            <li> This blush was a recommended buy, it is the perfect color. So beautiful when worn. It is the perfect color blush.</li>
            <li> I like the color but I feel its mostly shimmer and not enough pigment. I use Tarte Amazonian Clay blush in Blissful and this is just a tad peachier</li>
            <li> I like the color of it and it only takes a little but every time I use it I get a pimple. No matter where I use it and I usually only get a blemish on my chin every now and I.</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS BLUSH!!! For all you fair skinned girls out there like me..this is your match made in heaven!!! Go heavy or light handed it just looks so gorgeous!</li>
            <li> I love this product. The color is beautiful and looks great on. The only problem is that it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t last as long when applied.</li>
            <li> This color is truly amazing. Easy to blend out and easy to build up.</li>
            <li> i really love it very good it stay long time it is too shimmery so i cant wear it for day light allot</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast, it came unbroken and in good condition, not much else to say. I&#x27;ve had a good experience with Milani blushes overall, and if you&#x27;re looking for more I would recommend the shade &#x27;Red Vino.&#x27;</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell you enough how much I love this blush</li>
            <li> In love with the highlight it gives to your skin</li>
            <li> Wow, this product looks so ordinary in the pan but it is absolutely gorgeous. If you use a light hand and use it has a highlight you can get the most flattering peachy glow. All the friends I know who I&#x27;ve recommended this to absolutely love it. If I ever find out the Milani is discontinuing this then I am buying up this shade. I have tried other shades like Coralina which I thought had too many massive flecks of glitter. I was not a fan of that shade. I like luminoso enough to want to continue to try more shades though.</li>
            <li> Love this color! I have a golden olive undertone and this looks peachy on me.</li>
            <li> Great for lighter skinned tones! Blends very easily, and does last quite awhile. Looks slightly pinker in person though. Still beautiful though!</li>
            <li> great blush with super great price.. the packging is a little pour but the product is amazing! is worth it!</li>
            <li> I love this blush!! It is underrated! Stays on all day and it&#x27;s such a beautiful color!</li>
            <li> Loved it, it&#x27;s a beautiful soft colour, I&#x27;d recommend this blush to anyone it&#x27;s a really complimentary blush that would suit most skin colours</li>
            <li> Love this color! It is great if you are going for a summer glow or a light natural look! I have olive (light to medium) skin and I think the color looks great! I will say that if I don&#x27;t have a tan or if I don&#x27;t use bronzer with it, I look washed out.. It is somewhat sheer but has a beautiful peachy pink color to it. It looks beautiful when paired with a highlight! My go to color!</li>
            <li> Heard so much about this blush and it didnt dissapoint love it , glides on and looks so natural fresh and femininr</li>
            <li> This is an exact duplicate for Nars Orgasm blush. It is perfect and worth the price(though compared to the alternative, it is a STEAL!)</li>
            <li> I disagree for the reviewer that said anyone can wear it.  **raises hand**  I can&#x27;t wear it.  I got the luminoso I have very white skin and hazel eyes.  it was very hard to apply, it didn&#x27;t come off on my professional blush brush very well and once I got it on, as the day wore on it turned orange and I looked awful.  I can&#x27;t/don&#x27;t wear peach or coral and I thought I picked a pretty frosted pink blush, but no sireebob!  my husband even made a comment about how bright it was and he never comments on my makeup.  i&#x27;m now wearing a lancome one which is much nicer.  DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li> I like this . ..  pretty color with a little gold shimmer.  Gorgeous!</li>
            <li> the most beautiful color</li>
            <li> Beautiful glow!  Love üòç</li>
            <li> This is comparable to MAC&#x27;s blush. I love that it comes with it&#x27;s own mirror and blush brush. You really don&#x27;t need to use that much either. These are sold at major retailers but are sold out all over Colorado. It is the perfect shade to go with most light skin tones. It is a light peach, but not too coral or orangy. It has just the right amount of pink/peach/coral tones to compliment my fair skin without making it look like I have too much blush on. It has a bit of sparkle, but not too much to be &amp;#34;glittery&amp;#34;. It would look great on tanned and darker skin as well.</li>
            <li> I think I bought the last 2  Milani blush (Luminoso) on Amazon :P (sorry girls)&lt;br /&gt;It is perfect color, even if you are brunete or blond. I&#x27;m in love with it.</li>
            <li> The color is ok! I was expecting more.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was reviewed elsewhere as being a dupe for the expensive Nars blush that I like. I really like this one just as well and it is very similar and pretty!</li>
            <li> Best blush for such a cheap price! Great color, stays on well. Very happy with the product!</li>
            <li> This is a review not for the blush itself (as the color looks beautiful and I&#x27;ve only heard great things about it) but for the condition I received it in. I was so excited to try it on and as I unpackaged it I saw that the powder was completely broken. I opened it to check if any if I could save some of it and manage to use it and it fell all over my sink and clothes, making a huge mess. There&#x27;s really no way I can use this. I can&#x27;t even open it because a lot of the powder is piled up close to the opening/front. It&#x27;s as if someone had picked it up and thrown it harshly across the ground.  I&#x27;m really disappointed because I was extremely excited to try on this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I will use others of that same line.</li>
            <li> I love the color of this blush, it&#x27;s not too dark and not too light.  A little goes a long way with this brand.</li>
            <li> Great dupe of Nars Orgasm w/out the huge investment.</li>
            <li> Great inexpensive blush. Close dupe for Nars Orgasm</li>
            <li> I have freckles and reddish hair and usually have a very difficult time finding blush that does not look &amp;#34;clownish&amp;#34;. Luminoso is perfect. It has just the right amount of peach and pink, so it looks very natural. Not sparkly, like many blushes. It lasts a long time and does not break my face out (which often happens with blush). The only dislike that I have is the brush; it is too stiff and rubs the blush out of the container (even if used gently). I will buy this again and again.</li>
            <li> Great color but I find that I have to reapply several times throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I found this blush! Perfect shade, non shimmery, and smooth application.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely shade that goes with anything.  It comes in a nice little case and the brush is OK.  The texture of the blush is good for layering. I&#x27;ll buy this again.</li>
            <li> How is it I&#x27;ve only heard of this stuff recently? I&#x27;ve never read about it in the magazines or seen it on line. I saw it on a friend, noticing how her skin kind of looked like it had a fresh kind of glow/blush. I checked it out and now here it is on Amazon! You&#x27;ll want to use your own brush to apply it, but the results are amazing. I&#x27;ve got to check out other products from this company. Woo-Hoo!! Definitely recommended!!</li>
            <li> This blush is absolutely stunning. Gorgeous and lasts decently long on the skin.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color, very unusual a great blend of pink and peach!!</li>
            <li> The most perfect blush ever made and I&#x27;ve used probably 100 over the years! It is an almost (but better imo) dupe for the higher end one (not sure if I can say the name here but look it up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fair skin but friends of all skin tones swear by this blush. The effect is like you are slightly flushed (like after a great workout *wink wink*), looks very natural and super flattering.</li>
            <li> This blush compliments me perfectly! I have light to medium skin and I swear this blush goes with everything. I would not however pay $11 for this. I bought mine for about 5. Go to the Milani site for the real pricing!</li>
            <li> A lil light for me but could use it as a daily glow!</li>
            <li> Seriously?!! Why did I not know about this sooner! This blush is top notch for a gal who loves her high end products! It reminds me of Nars and you get more too!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Milani blushes! The colors and sheen are beautiful!  They are true to color of what you see on the sight! Great product!</li>
            <li> I love this blush because it looks so natural and comes at a great price!</li>
            <li> the color is perfect for me</li>
            <li> I am very light as far as skin tone, and this blush looks great. I have to apply it pretty lightly though. When I first put it on, I did not see it that well, so I put a little more on and the color seemed to pop up a little too much all of a sudden. I don&#x27;t know if it is just me, but after you apply it, it seems to stand out more after a couple a minutes. So I apply it lightly and it works well. Very nice quality in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Good formula. Very pretty. Could see this shade working for most skin tones.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I thought it would be and it&#x27;s a perfect shade!</li>
            <li> best drugstore blush ever, however i bought this online and later realized it sells at my local cvs for half the price so i wouldn&#x27;t buy it here. but its the perfect peachy shade.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this blush. It is so pigmented and beautiful. It is shimmery so if you prefer matte blushes this many not be your cup of tea. It is an incredible blush for the price. As the title for my review indicates, it is my dupe for Nars Orgasm. Here are my Pros and Cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;-This blush runs for about $9 and Nars Orgasm is around $30. That&#x27;s a $21 difference.&lt;br /&gt;-Super pigmented. It&#x27;s not chalky or streaky at all. The color is beautiful and goes on like butter.&lt;br /&gt;-Easily blend-able. This blush is so easy to blend, I&#x27;ve tried many wonderful blushes that have been a bit difficult to blend and this one does not have that problem whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;-The color is build-able. This color is ideal for light skin. If you have very fair skin, use a light hand and if you over do it, use whatever you use to apply foundation (I prefer the beauty blender) and run over the area with it to decrease the intensity. If you have medium-dark skin it&#x27;s easy to build the color.&lt;br /&gt;-You get a lot of product for the price. Unlike some cheaper alternatives that come with very little product, this come with a lot of product. It&#x27;s an amazing value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;-The packaging is very cheaply made. Not the best packaging, but it doesn&#x27;t make a difference to me.&lt;br /&gt;-It will shatter easily. Don&#x27;t fret, pour alcohol on it and re-shape it. Once it dries it&#x27;ll be good as new, it won&#x27;t look as pretty as it used to in the packaging, but it won&#x27;t change the way it looks on your skin. It will still look gorgeous on you.&lt;br /&gt;-The brush is pretty much useless, but that&#x27;s usually the case with all makeup that includes brushes like that. I own brushes for blush anyways. If you don&#x27;t own any, I highly suggest buying a blush brush or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great blush. It&#x27;s an amazing value and the price is just the icing on the cake. I definitely recommend buying it. I love this blush and I use it all the time. Now that we&#x27;re heading into the fall I won&#x27;tuse if as much, but as soon as summer comes I&#x27;ll be using it regularly again.</li>
            <li> I had reservations about trying a drugstore blush. My mother had always drilled into my head that good skincare isn&#x27;t cheap, and cheap makeup is full of chemicals that won&#x27;t be good for my skin. But I kept passing the Milani blushes in CVS and finally caved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, I&#x27;m in love! Luminoso in particular is so pigmented -- more pigmented than I expected! I figured I&#x27;d have to struggle to see any color on my cheeks, but instead this lasted ALL. DAY. LONG. At 1/3 the price of the other blushes I have, I was genuinely surprised. Love this blush!</li>
            <li> The color is amazing. The pigmentation is rich, and it lasts all day. Very very happy! I immediately went out and bought another for backup. I have an ominous feeling I am going to start hoarding this for fear it is discontinued! Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is perfect for an everyday look. I am yellow toned hispanic and tanned looking. This gives a natural look. Only Complaint is when it arrived it came broken. The clear plastic in the middle of the top keeps coming off. The product itself was perfect just could have been packaged better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read great reviews on this blush but haven&#x27;t fallen in love with it as so many others have. The color is really pretty and maybe I will learn to love it, but for me this blush is just a little too shimmery.</li>
            <li> I ordered this blush but instead I got smooth skin bronzing face powder Im pretty sure I didn&#x27;t order that I ordered milani baked blush luminoso</li>
            <li> This blush is just awesome. Its just enough color that can be buildable. The color pay off is awesome and give a nice glow to your face. I pretty much use this blush everyday over a BB cream.</li>
            <li> Milani products are great! I love the formula and this color would work well on any complexion.</li>
            <li> The color is just right &amp; the compact size.</li>
            <li> Was going to buy this but Walmart has it for under $7 why is this one so high!!! Rip off</li>
            <li> Gorgeous and cheap blush. My new go-to. I have pretty fair skin and do not apply heavily, and it looks natural. Hardly a dent in the blush with about a month of use. The hype on this blush is well-deserved.</li>
            <li> True to color, blends like a dream and not at all sparkly, just gives a nice subtle glow. The perfect cross between pink and peach!</li>
            <li> This blush is ok! I wish it was a little more pink but I can always buy a new blush that&#x27;s more pink! It works great for every day use!</li>
            <li> Love this Color - makes me feel pretty - BUT wish I bought it at the store instead. I got it for about $11, and I&#x27;ve been seeing it at Target and walgreens for only 6.99 or 7.99.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;womp womp.</li>
            <li> I love love this blush... you have to be applying it because It dose fade.</li>
            <li> I love the color, I will totally buy it again.</li>
            <li> This blush is beautiful! It&#x27;s luminous and a universally flattering golden peach. It&#x27;s just a tiny bit less pigmented than I&#x27;d like, which is why I knocked off one star.</li>
            <li> I love the texture of this blush, goes on very evenly and is very buildable.  The color is gorgeous, but there&#x27;s just a bit too much shimmer for every day wear (at least for me).  Great for evenings out, though.</li>
            <li> Bought this at Walmart, I don&#x27;t even where blush, but it is a great blush.</li>
            <li> I adore this blush. I&#x27;ve never used the one by NARS that people compare this to, but it doesn&#x27;t matter. This stuff is GORGE. It looks shimmery in the pan, but on my cheeks it&#x27;s just ever-so-slightly luminescent, not sparkly at all. I have light/medium yellow-toned skin, and Luminoso looks sort of peachy pink on me. On my mom, who has noticeably darker skin, this gives a subtle, peachy, healthy glow. It has excellent color payoff, and I can adjust the richness, but to an extent. I did a little test and applied it heavily to one cheek. I kept adding more and more, but the color stopped deepening at a certain point. This is a good thing. I think it&#x27;s hard to overdo it with Luminoso. Looks great for day and evening, but in the evening I add a bronzer right under my cheekbones for extra depth. I have acne-prone skin that is clear unless I stop treating it or if I use a product it doesn&#x27;t like, and this blush has never made me break out. Also, the stuff lasts forever, both on your face and in the pan.&lt;br /&gt;Try it!&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Like many blushes, it comes with a dumb brush. I mean, you could use it in a pinch, but I always use a soft, small blush brush by Eco Tools for the best finish.</li>
            <li> The color is very similar to Nars &amp;#34;orgasim&amp;#34; but it doesn&#x27;t go on as dark. I like the quality of Nars more but this is a good second choice if you want to spend less money.</li>
            <li> This blush is indescribable!  For so long I had dumped loads of money on the all time favorite NARS Orgasm.  This blush is Orgasm only 5x better!  The color is beautiful, goes on so smoothly and is buildable if you want more color.  The color melts right into your skin and becomes part of your face, naturally.  Looks fabulous on any skin tone.  I wouldn&#x27;t trade this for a compact of NARS ever!</li>
            <li> Lovely color! This was recommended as a dupe for Nars Orgasm and so far so good! Has great lasting power, enough sheen, and earns compliments every time I wear it.</li>
            <li> Nice color, easy to apply, gives a natural glow to the skin.....</li>
            <li> Item arrived sealed and as I opened it clearly seemed that it was used ....kind of gross ...very disappointed :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, many brands/shades of blush. This is my favorite by far! For the price, it cannot be beat! Looks so natural and flawless.</li>
            <li> Was a weird &#x27;orangey&#x27; color. Yuck!</li>
            <li> This blush is a darker coral-peach that provides a healthy looking glow when applied.&lt;br /&gt;I would caution fair skinned individuals that a light application is necessary. I have the sort of skin tone that requires any company&#x27;s lightest shade and found that it helped to first apply a light powder to my cheeks followed by the blush. The powder-first approach helped the blush blend better and be less harsh looking.</li>
            <li> I loved the color of the blush itself, but the compact came with all the blush completely broken up! It had to have been sent that way because it looked like it had been slammed down on the ground. The bits fell out all over my sink and made a huge mess. Next time I want this blush I&#x27;m just going to have to look for it in stores because this was not worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> Beautiful. Just right for me! A warm glow on cheeks!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it mimics Orgasm, which is why I bought it (it&#x27;s a color, people), but it is flattering on my cool toned, light skin paired with light eyes and blond hair.</li>
            <li> This product is much &amp;#34;peachyer&amp;#34; then expected.  I looked like a clown and I have medium skin.  Be careful if you purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I hate buying blush, the color is always wrong, probably due to my skill in picking it. This stuff is AWESOME, its luminous without being sparkly, its the perfect color. Ill never buy another kind! It works well with my paper white skin along with my light tan I get in the summer.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot. I use with Too Faced Milk Chocolate Bronzer.</li>
            <li> The blush color is just right. It was complete when I opened it</li>
            <li> Color is Gorg, and goes on easily.  A little goes a long way.  It looks good on a naked face face, for that fresh look, but with full makeup on the look is out of this world!!!  I love this color...dupe.  why pay so much more for a name?  Not this lady!!!  Record highly!!!</li>
            <li> Just like everyone else........I LOVE THIS BLUSH!!! Seriously, best blush ever. Everyone said it would be, but I was doubtful. Sure enough, it is what I have been wearing every single day now.  I can&#x27;t fathom a skin tone that wouldn&#x27;t look good in this color.</li>
            <li> I love it! Every girl should have it in her make up bag!!!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this blush from CVS for a similar price. I was inspired to purchase this blush because it is a popular dupe for Nars Orgasm. I really like this blush although it is shimmery. I am not sure what a \\&quot;baked\\&quot; blush is. I do use it often.  I also think the other shades of Milani blushes are gorgeous and I will purchase more. I love drugstore makeup and this is a quality product.</li>
            <li> put good scores. all is well. I will still take. I like. good quality. quickly comes really worth. love this!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I really like the color of this but flakes off (that&#x27;s the best word i could think of) when taking it and putting on a brush, there is a lot of fall out and it doesn&#x27;t stay well on my face.</li>
            <li> Love this blush!! Such a pretty shade and good pigment payoff :)</li>
            <li> I would never have bought this blush if not for the reviews. In fact, even when I found it I really thought twice before I decided on it. At CVS it seemed really like apricot. I thought of all the make-up artists I&#x27;ve heard in the past talking about apricot being such a great color, or peach. I am pretty fair but with brown hair and light brown eyes. I had recently tried a \\&quot;bouncy blush\\&quot; by mabelline that looked really peachy in the package. With both purchases I thought there was a good chance of me looking like a clown. Suffice it to say they were both equally beautiful. I REALLY hope they don&#x27;t stop making Luminoso colored blush.</li>
            <li> I love the peachy tones and the light shimmer, this is a great makeup product that stays put all day. I really enjoy using it as a part of my daily beauty routine.</li>
            <li> My new favorite blush and shade! I have always heard about how nice Milani blushes are and they were right. Great pigmentation and beautiful color selection just make sure to use a light hand because they are pigmented. Luminoso and Dolce pink are gorgeous!</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how pigmented this way and luminous. Its gorgeous. Highly recommend. A little goes a long way so be sure to build up the color.</li>
            <li> I purchased this blush because I am such a fan of the Milani lipliners and glosses. I thought I&#x27;d give their blusher a try. All in all, it has a nice shimmer, but just a glow, not too much. The color isn&#x27;t as pink as it appears in the picture, though. It&#x27;s more of a coral color. It still looks good on light to medium toned skin.</li>
            <li> Use this product in moderation. When I saw how light the blush was, I was afraid that it wouldn&#x27;t show up on my skin tone, so I packed on a lot to my brush. I was definitely wrong. While the product itself looks light, it&#x27;s highly pigmented when it is actually used. This adds a peachy soft glow to my skin, and the color compliments the color of my bronzer well. This is very comparable to my Tarte blush, and I would even say that this product is better than that.</li>
            <li> The way the packaging is designed is awful!  I dropped mine and the blush broke to pieces.  Since this blush is raised up like a mountain, there is no where for the broken blush pieces to go except to fall out all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love the color, but the fact that half the product fell out is dissapointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is shimmery and goes on light.</li>
            <li> Every girl should own this blush. Hands Down.</li>
            <li> It is nice goes on well</li>
            <li> Nice cheap blush. Nice subtle color that isn&#x27;t crazy glittery or anything like that.</li>
            <li> Love these blushes! I have three of them and all of them are very pretty. Luminoso gives me a very fresh faced look.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t repurchase.  I didn&#x27;t find it easy to apply and it had a shimmer.  That was my mistake.  After all it was called &amp;#34;luminoso&amp;#34;!  But even getting past that, I didn&#x27;t care for the application and the color was weird looking on me.  Hard to control, one minute too light to see, and then if you applied another stroke, it was clown city.  Threw it away in my semi annual makeup purge.</li>
            <li> I heard about these Milani baked blushed from many of the makeup gurus I watch on YouTube. I was disappointed that I could not find them sold anymore. This one on Amazon is double the retail price of 6.99. I finally stumbled upon a huge collection of Mlilani products in my local Wal Mart and they had all the baked blush colors including this one. I purchased this one and the bright pink Delizioso Pink. I just tried the Luminoso this morning and from the package I was hesitant. It is very pale and almost looks like a light bronzer, pale blush. When you put it on you just glow. It is fantastic. I can see how this would be great on any skin tone.</li>
            <li> This is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; everyday blush. Never cakes, looks natural and lasts all day. Plus, a great price! Love this brand, happy to find it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Great blush, but don&#x27;t like the sparkle.</li>
            <li> I really like this blush and it introduced me to the Milani brand.  I ordered it thinking of using it as a highlighting blush, but on my skin it is much more of a bronzing blush since I am very pale!</li>
            <li> I kept seeing this little guy on YouTube and i had to have it. It&#x27;s gorgeous, I&#x27;m of medium skin tone and it does look a bit more like a light bronzer on me but I love it. Give off that very natural glow. Especially when I want a more toned down blush. I like to play with colors in the eyeshadow department and this is a great everyday, neutral blush to go along with those looks. Great color payoff considering how light it does look on me.</li>
