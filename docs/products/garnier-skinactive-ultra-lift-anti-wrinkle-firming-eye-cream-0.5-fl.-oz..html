            <li>I want to say that I&#x27;ve tried a lot of eye creams, and this one is the best if you want a gentle retinoid for the eye area.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been putting aloe Vera the kind for sunburn &amp; it&#x27;s been a lifesaver.</li>
            <li>Purchase at your own risk.</li>

            <li>think it feels quite nice around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I use this product for many years and see a good result on my skin.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I tried it, I love this!</li>
            <li>The stuff was great in the first place</li>
            <li>I have used it for several years with no problems, excellent product, if you do not react to it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve googled it and what you see most is people relating their allergic reactions to this product.</li>
            <li>I thought I would try the cream again to make sure that is what I was allergic to.  </li>
            <li>Just use this Garnier better.</li>
            <li>love it, like everything of garnier</li>
            <li>I purchased this product (Garnier Ultra-Lift Anti Wrinkle Eye Cream) and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Tried it one more night, still burned.</li>
            <li>and my skin still looks pretty good</li>
            <li>like the container and easy to carry when travelling.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was fine until I took an afternoon shower and ate dinner and sat for a while.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great value despite the obvious unknowns.</li>
            <li>and so far so good.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel a real firming action but others might it just feels real nice on</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve only had good things happen.  </li>
            <li>Very nice product, really no complaints.</li>
            <li>Like so many others, my wife developed a sore/raw rash around her eyes.  </li>
            <li>I use it every day and it never burns even if it gets right into my eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using eye creams from last 7 years and tried many eye creams available at drug stores, i bought 2 from a local store and everything was ok for the first month.</li>
            <li>Great for upper &amp; lower eyes in achieving a younger look.  </li>
            <li>It is not irritating as so many cosmetic creams are, not harsh on the face/neck.</li>
            <li>Run away as fast as you can from this - and complain to the company, as this product is not merely ineffective, it&#x27;s harmful!</li>
            <li>I think I lost most of my eyelashes prying them open.  </li>
            <li>AND it was the first day</li>
            <li>I wish I knewwhat exact ingredient(s)</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t suspect it at first.  </li>
            <li>I bought this at Kroger and the first concern was that it was unsealed.</li>
            <li>I called today and reported, and this was the first report.  </li>
            <li>Realizing that it was probably the eye cream, I went immediately to CVS to get a different product (Olay 7 - just lovely).</li>
            <li>Reviews on line show many people with the same issues after using the product.</li>
            <li>This product should be taken off the shelf as many people have had the same experience.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m eighteen and have under eye bags since I was about fourteen, mostly from hereditary genes, lack of sleep over the years, and me generally not caring about my eyes.</li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t see for the first 24+ hours.  </li>
            <li>the product is fine not like everyone elses comment about swelling and such.</li>
            <li>I used it for over a month, and then one day I woke up with huge puffy and saggy red bags under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>so bloodshot nor have I ever had so much eye snot come out of my eyes for over 48 hours straight.  </li>
            <li>is causing this reaction because I am so afraid to buy any more eye cream!!!!</li>
            <li>just search fda medwatch form, if you don&#x27;t feel comfortable following a stranger&#x27;s link!</li>
            <li>I quit using it for a week thinking that maybe I just drank too much the night before.</li>
            <li>I wanted to add to the list, as Garnier really needs to take this product off the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes in a very pretty package, and the price for it is pretty nice, cheaper than a general store, although I could have found other products about the same price, just lower</li>
            <li>Both eyes got super red &amp; started discharging.  </li>
            <li>I have tried more expensive brands of eye creams and like this much better.</li>
            <li>mainly purchase this as my travel item and not for my every day eye cream.</li>
            <li>Instead of posting comments here, I highly suggest anyone who has suffered go to the FDA website and fill out a medwatch form.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to my friends</li>
            <li>Product is really great, but rather expensive.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using for a short time but it has really helped my dry skin and incipient fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li>so I packed my new bottle of eye</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and this cream leaves that area feeling moist.  </li>
            <li>The skin around my eyes was scaly and red, and very much hurt.</li>
            <li>In only three days, the shipping was very, very fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tossed the rest of the jar and my advice is to stay far away from this eye cream!</li>
            <li>and I awoke with a rash the first day I put it back on.  </li>
            <li>As in all such preparations, consistent use is required.</li>
            <li>As good a product as the more expensive wrinkle nostrums I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li>almost whole day,i was trying a new eyeliner at the same time</li>
            <li>While it is truly impossible to know if anti-aging stuff really works, I will say that this stuff is great in terms of its gentleness.</li>
            <li>Back to Clinique who has been perfect for me for over 20 years---I was trying new products because Clinique prices have crept up over the years, and now they are as expensive as Lancome or any of the other high-end brands.</li>
            <li>I also used Benedryl cream on the skin around my eyes plus I used Clear Eyes allergy drops which helped with the severe blood shot eyes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve developed allergic conjunctivitis because of this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not someone who has extremely sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>I applied below my eyes and on crow&#x27;s feet, and I do not put it near my tear ducts.</li>
            <li>I was surprised.</li>
            <li>and they were completely bloodshot and had strings of goop coming out of them.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what was in this that made me react, but I do not have sensitive skin and this product was like poison.</li>
            <li>It immediately started soothing and healing my eyes, but after another 3 days, I still have residual puffiness, though the skin is soft again.</li>
            <li>There is a class action law suit with Garnier&#x27;s Nutritioniste products as one of the products under review.</li>
            <li>I am 40 years old and have never been allergic nor had an allergic reaction to anything.  </li>
            <li>I have been wearing Neosporin the last few night trying to make it better.</li>
            <li>I tried different kinds of eye cream, some are high ends</li>
            <li>She had to treat it with antibiotic cream for days just to get back to normal.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know at first it was due to the cream</li>
            <li>I went to the doctor and spent hundreds of dollars on visits and prescriptions, believing I had severe allergic conjunctivitis and like many others finally narrowed down the culprit to this</li>
            <li>So, I used it yesterday morning because I haven&#x27;t had any problems for a while and had switched back to Clinique but thought I&#x27;d try it again because the jar is half full.  </li>
            <li>Just went off of medication for the second time to clear up the infection.</li>
            <li>I used a wet swab with EVOO and gently exfoliated lots of skin.</li>
            <li>and I can barely see.  </li>
            <li>My eyes got swollen and puffy and a red, bumpy rash that itches and burns developed.</li>
            <li>and you can barely see them.</li>
            <li>After using this product I developed a rash under my eyes that was very red and burned.</li>
            <li>At least I figured out what the culprit was to my reaction immediately unlike many other</li>
            <li>The first few weeks, I thought it was doing nothing, but you really can&#x27;t expect any results in less than 3-6 months, IMO.</li>
            <li>I noticed a few weeks into my first jar that I had tiny particles of skin that needed to be exfoliated.</li>

            <li> and you can barely see them.</li>

            <li> I tried other eye creams and found that area drier the next morning.  </li>
            <li> The next morning, my eyes were swollen and oozing and extremely blood-shot.  </li>
            <li> Two days later the bags began to go away, along with all of the other symptoms.  </li>
            <li> so much it was ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> I also got scaly dry skin around eye area.</li>
            <li> It looks like pink-eye and the skin around the eyes became severely dry and flakey.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d Wake up with red puffy eyesand with so much discharge they were difficult to open.  </li>
            <li> The swelling has gone down, but now they are red and look burnt.</li>
            <li> i finished 1st and the 2nd one was almost half when i started to feel my eyes burning and watery</li>
            <li> The only problem I had is it seems like the jar was half empty when I got it.</li>
            <li> So use that if you&#x27;ve fallen victim to this stuff!</li>
            <li> cant believe this product has so many bad reviews</li>
            <li> I used this for at least a month with no reaction but when I bought my second jar, one Saturday morning I woke up with red, swollen eyes.  </li>
            <li> The whites of my eyes were completely red and looked like I had been crying for days.  </li>
            <li> They are just the same, so why waste money.</li>
            <li> Guess I&#x27;m not alone... Used it and woke up with what looked like pink eye.</li>
            <li> I just spent the last 12 hours crying.  </li>
            <li> I put it away for a month and forgetfully used this cream the other night.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks I finally narrowed it down to this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used eye cream (different brands) for the past 10 years and never had anything like this.</li>
            <li> My eyes were bloodshot and itchy - the whole picture was creepy.</li>
            <li> I turned off our water softener, threw away poinsettias, took down Christmas decorations, quit burning candles, got rid of bedding, eliminated all makeup .. all to find out it was this cream.  </li>
            <li> , hopefully the swelling will go down soon.</li>
            <li> I bought through Amazon since the cost is less than store prices.</li>
            <li> I too went thru ridiculous lengths trying to identify the culprit that caused  severely swollen, red, itchy eyelids; peeling patches of skin; peeling, itchy lips -- 2 trips to the dermatologist,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a softness and less wrinkles around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> From then on, I&#x27;ve done that every few weeks, and I have never had skin turn-over around my eyes like this.</li>
            <li> Wow, what a scary product.  </li>
            <li> I did not purchase this via Amazon.com, but after having a really awful experience with it, I looked for reviews and found out how many other women had posted ones on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I should go to the doctor or not.</li>
            <li> Just put it on that night as usual.</li>
            <li> It was hard to see because my under the eyes was so puffed up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised by the bad reviews.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s apparently extremely common.</li>
            <li> At least I got it cleared up in 3-4 days.  </li>
            <li> Duh, it dawned on me to stop using the eye cream.  </li>
            <li> 24 hours I couldn&#x27;t see because of the thick coating on my eyes.  </li>
            <li> My eyes aren&#x27;t so swollen anymore &amp; redness is slowly disappearing.</li>
            <li> In the interim I discontinued using the cream and the redness slowly subsided.  </li>
            <li> And yes, I sit here typing this through eyes creating a ridiculous amount of goop</li>
            <li> I guess I could get a second job to pay for face cream. :-(</li>
            <li> The perplexing thing is that even after I discontinue use, the symptoms will worsen for a few days!!!  </li>
            <li> I thought I was tired</li>
            <li> The expensive silver lining is at least now</li>
            <li> it makes your skin look worse!</li>
            <li> I was afraid to put it around my eye area.</li>
            <li> I have purchased eye creams from Garnier before but this one gave me a crazy allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li> I do not know if they changed the formula or it is a bad batch</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also smelled bad.  </li>
            <li> so I reached up to rub my eyes and they hurt so bad.  </li>
            <li> After reading all the bad reviews now I&#x27;m scared I may get a reaction</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so disappointed and have been trying to find a number to call and report this.</li>
            <li> I stupidly continued to use the eye cream, while the bags, puffiness, &amp; redness continued to worsen.  </li>
            <li> Hate it when they do that.</li>
            <li> This stuff is horrible</li>
            <li> This stuff is terrible.</li>
            <li> The amount of eye snot that continuously oozed from my eyes was disgusting.  </li>
            <li> I think the worst part was</li>
            <li> AWFUL product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;After 3 days of use, I woke up with my eyes almost swollen shut, with a yellowish discharge (disgusting) leaking from them.</li>
            <li> Beware of the worst eye cream ever!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff is horrible it makes your skin look worse! Its given people allergic reactions and vision problems.Plus Retinol isn&#x27;t always good for your skin. You can look it up on the internet I avoid products with retinol.</li>
            <li> Since I only used this product about once a week, it took me a while to figure out what what&#x27;s going on. I&#x27;d Wake up with red puffy eyesand with so much discharge they were difficult to open.  The whites of my eyes were completely red and looked like I had been crying for days.  After a few weeks I finally narrowed it down to this product.  I would not recommend thia product.</li>
            <li> I have used it for several years with no problems, excellent product, if you do not react to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve developed allergic conjunctivitis because of this product. I&#x27;ve googled it and what you see most is people relating their allergic reactions to this product.</li>
            <li> Great for upper &amp; lower eyes in achieving a younger look.  I bought through Amazon since the cost is less than store prices.</li>
            <li> I truly cannot believe this is still on the market. I do not know if they changed the formula or it is a bad batch but I could barely open my eyes this morning. I purchased this 2 weeks ago in NYC at a CVS and my eyelids were SO SWOLLEN this morning. The swelling has gone down, but now they are red and look burnt. AND HURT. they are also flakey looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so disappointed and have been trying to find a number to call and report this.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this twice at target, although the price here rocks, so I may have to get it here next time. I want to say that I&#x27;ve tried a lot of eye creams, and this one is the best if you want a gentle retinoid for the eye area. The first few weeks, I thought it was doing nothing, but you really can&#x27;t expect any results in less than 3-6 months, IMO. I noticed a few weeks into my first jar that I had tiny particles of skin that needed to be exfoliated. I used a wet swab with EVOO and gently exfoliated lots of skin. From then on, I&#x27;ve done that every few weeks, and I have never had skin turn-over around my eyes like this. I am on my 2nd jar, and I will continue to use this one. I also use this on my neck.</li>
            <li> When I opened the jar, the product appeared slimey and runny.&lt;br /&gt;It also smelled bad.  I have used this product before, so I knew what the consistency should be, and I knew what&lt;br /&gt;it should smell like.  I was afraid to put it around my eye area.</li>
            <li> the product is fine not like everyone elses comment about swelling and such. The only problem I had is it seems like the jar was half empty when I got it.</li>
            <li> Great find much better price than at the store.</li>
            <li> Like so many others, my wife developed a sore/raw rash around her eyes.  She had to treat it with antibiotic cream for days just to get back to normal.</li>
            <li> This stuff is terrible. After using it for 2 days, my eyes are red, itchy, stinging and now scaly red patches are developing on the skin around my eyes. I went online to search to see if anyone else had a similar issue and it&#x27;s apparently extremely common. I&#x27;m not someone who has extremely sensitive eyes and I&#x27;ve never had a reaction like this to any product. I&#x27;ve tossed the rest of the jar and my advice is to stay far away from this eye cream!</li>
            <li> I wish I read all of the reviews of this product before buying it.  I have purchased eye creams from Garnier before but this one gave me a crazy allergic reaction.  I used it at night before I went to bed.  When I woke up I couldn&#x27;t open my eyes because they were crusted shut.  I think I lost most of my eyelashes prying them open.  At least I figured out what the culprit was to my reaction immediately unlike many other people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For 24 hours I couldn&#x27;t see because of the thick coating on my eyes.  My lower lids were swollen so much it was ridiculous.  The amount of eye snot that continuously oozed from my eyes was disgusting.  AND it was the first day I was away from home on vacation.  My existing eye cream (another brand) was running low so I packed my new bottle of eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I managed to have it all cleared up in 3 days.  I took Benedryl orally.  I also used Benedryl cream on the skin around my eyes plus I used Clear Eyes allergy drops which helped with the severe blood shot eyes.  I have never in my life had my eyes so bloodshot nor have I ever had so much eye snot come out of my eyes for over 48 hours straight.  I think the worst part was I really couldn&#x27;t see for the first 24+ hours.  I was seeing family members I hadn&#x27;t seen in years and I couldn&#x27;t even SEE them because of the goop in my eyes.  I looked like I just spent the last 12 hours crying.  I looked like a total freak of nature!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a nightmare.  At least I got it cleared up in 3-4 days.  I hadn&#x27;t used the product in 2 weeks.  Now that I am home again I thought I would try the cream again to make sure that is what I was allergic to.  And yes, I sit here typing this through eyes creating a ridiculous amount of goop and I can barely see.  So now I have another 3 days of this again before it clears up.  I washed it off after only wearing it for 2 hours so here is hoping my reaction doesn&#x27;t last as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And why is this product still on the shelves?  I wish I knewwhat exact ingredient(s) is causing this reaction because I am so afraid to buy any more eye cream!!!!</li>
            <li> While it is truly impossible to know if anti-aging stuff really works, I will say that this stuff is great in terms of its gentleness. I use it every day and it never burns even if it gets right into my eyes. I use it as a pick-me-up, too, during the day. It&#x27;s a great value despite the obvious unknowns.</li>
            <li> I too went thru ridiculous lengths trying to identify the culprit that caused  severely swollen, red, itchy eyelids; peeling patches of skin; peeling, itchy lips -- 2 trips to the dermatologist, 2 to my GP and one to an allergist.  I turned off our water softener, threw away poinsettias, took down Christmas decorations, quit burning candles, got rid of bedding, eliminated all makeup .. all to find out it was this cream.  It happened with my 2nd jar of it so I didn&#x27;t suspect it at first.  Then the fact that the rash showed up places where I DON&#x27;T put the cream... eyelids, lips.  I finally realized it after I started reintroducing things to my makeup routine and I awoke with a rash the first day I put it back on.  The perplexing thing is that even after I discontinue use, the symptoms will worsen for a few days!!!  (again, this threw me off the trail)  Currently, I am trying to find the ingredient list for this product but the Garnier website runs you in circles and has pages that cannot be found -- coincidence or not???</li>
            <li> I bought this at Kroger and the first concern was that it was unsealed. Not tamper-proof in any way. I have a Garnier Fructis face cream that I like, so I used this eye cream---once. I applied below my eyes and on crow&#x27;s feet, and I do not put it near my tear ducts. I am not allergy-prone, so when my eyes starting stinging and watering within 30 minutes of application I was surprised. I washed it off and out of my eyes immediately. Back to Clinique who has been perfect for me for over 20 years---I was trying new products because Clinique prices have crept up over the years, and now they are as expensive as Lancome or any of the other high-end brands. I guess I could get a second job to pay for face cream. :-(</li>
            <li> Used for 2 days &amp; woke up with red,poofy,slimy eyes!! I looked like Rocky after a fight! It was hard to see because my under the eyes was so puffed up. Please do not buy!! I also got scaly dry skin around eye area. I&#x27;ve been putting aloe Vera the kind for sunburn &amp; it&#x27;s been a lifesaver. My eyes aren&#x27;t so swollen anymore &amp; redness is slowly disappearing. So use that if you&#x27;ve fallen victim to this stuff!</li>
            <li> This is the eye cream that I will always use from now on. I tried different kinds of eye cream, some are high ends and I compare to&lt;br /&gt;this one. They are just the same, so why waste money. Just use this Garnier better.</li>
            <li> This product has caused severe allergic reactions in countless users.  I went to the doctor and spent hundreds of dollars on visits and prescriptions, believing I had severe allergic conjunctivitis and like many others finally narrowed down the culprit to this AWFUL product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason that it is still on the market is that no one has reported to the FDA!!! I called today and reported, and this was the first report.  Instead of posting comments here, I highly suggest anyone who has suffered go to the FDA website and fill out a medwatch form.  That is what the fda representative suggested.  The form can be found here: https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/medwatch/index.cfm&lt;br /&gt;or just search fda medwatch form, if you don&#x27;t feel comfortable following a stranger&#x27;s link!</li>
            <li> Ive tried both roc and olay eye cream and they both irrated my skin cant believe this product has so many bad reviews</li>
            <li> love it, like everything of garnier</li>
            <li> I used this for at least a month with no reaction but when I bought my second jar, one Saturday morning I woke up with red, swollen eyes.  I quit using it for a week thinking that maybe I just drank too much the night before. Then I started using it again.  Again, I woke up on a Saturday morning with red, swollen eyes.  It looks like pink-eye and the skin around the eyes became severely dry and flakey.  So, I used it yesterday morning because I haven&#x27;t had any problems for a while and had switched back to Clinique but thought I&#x27;d try it again because the jar is half full.  I was fine until I took an afternoon shower and ate dinner and sat for a while. My eyes were aching. I thought I was tired so I reached up to rub my eyes and they hurt so bad.  I got up and looked in the mirror and they were completely bloodshot and had strings of goop coming out of them.  This morning I woke up with big boogers and crusty stuff in my eyes.  I am going to quit using it again and I threw it away.  Not sure if I should go to the doctor or not.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t  know what was in the container, but it&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t the product I&#x27;m used to buying at the store.</li>
            <li> Buy this product a lot just feels so good on the face.</li>
            <li> Product is really great, but rather expensive.  Might be cheaper in the stores.</li>
            <li> I too had an allergic reaction from this eye cream. My eyes got swollen and puffy and a red, bumpy rash that itches and burns developed. I&#x27;ve used eye cream (different brands) for the past 10 years and never had anything like this. I don&#x27;t know what was in this that made me react, but I do not have sensitive skin and this product was like poison.</li>
            <li> Guess I&#x27;m not alone... Used it and woke up with what looked like pink eye. Puffy, red, goopy eyes. Threw it in the trash. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for my eyes and have found it to be great.  I have very sensitive skin and this cream leaves that area feeling moist.  I tried other eye creams and found that area drier the next morning.  I used this day and night.</li>
            <li> Wish I could give it no stars.  I had used this for several months, then one day woke up with teary eyes with bags under my eyes and dry scaly patches on the eyelids.  I put it away for a month and forgetfully used this cream the other night.  The next morning, my eyes were swollen and oozing and extremely blood-shot.  I have the same bags and scaly skin as the last time.  I am now walking around looking like a monster. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!</li>
            <li> I did not purchase this via Amazon.com, but after having a really awful experience with it, I looked for reviews and found out how many other women had posted ones on Amazon. I wanted to add to the list, as Garnier really needs to take this product off the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 3 days of use, I woke up with my eyes almost swollen shut, with a yellowish discharge (disgusting) leaking from them. The skin around my eyes was scaly and red, and very much hurt. My eyes were bloodshot and itchy - the whole picture was creepy. Realizing that it was probably the eye cream, I went immediately to CVS to get a different product (Olay 7 - just lovely). It immediately started soothing and healing my eyes, but after another 3 days, I still have residual puffiness, though the skin is soft again. There is a class action law suit with Garnier&#x27;s Nutritioniste products as one of the products under review. Run away as fast as you can from this - and complain to the company, as this product is not merely ineffective, it&#x27;s harmful!</li>
            <li> I had to go to the Doctor&#x27;s after using!!  Both eyes got super red &amp; started discharging.  The condition lasted for about 5 days.  Should be pulled off the market immediately.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product (Garnier Ultra-Lift Anti Wrinkle Eye Cream) and I love it.  I&#x27;m surprised by the bad reviews.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now and I&#x27;ve only had good things happen.  I&#x27;ve noticed a softness and less wrinkles around my eyes.  I used this twice a day, in the morning and evening.  I&#x27;m very happy with it and will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a short time but it has really helped my dry skin and incipient fine wrinkles. It is not irritating as so many cosmetic creams are, not harsh on the face/neck. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I did not purchase this product from Amazon.  I purchased it from a local drug store.  I used it for over a month, and then one day I woke up with huge puffy and saggy red bags under my eyes.  I stupidly continued to use the eye cream, while the bags, puffiness, &amp; redness continued to worsen.  The bags stayed and spread into a scaly red rash around them and on my eyelids.  Duh, it dawned on me to stop using the eye cream.  Two days later the bags began to go away, along with all of the other symptoms.  I am 40 years old and have never been allergic nor had an allergic reaction to anything.  Wow, what a scary product.  If I could give it a zero, I would.  Purchase at your own risk.</li>
            <li> After reading all the bad reviews now I&#x27;m scared I may get a reaction but I bought this product from target a week ago and so far so good. I like it. Moisturizes nicely and isn&#x27;t greasy. I use it in the morning and at night routinely.</li>
            <li> allergic reaction like mentioned by many others - never has happened before!  Thank God I only used it for 2 days, hopefully the swelling will go down soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using eye creams from last 7 years and tried many eye creams available at drug stores, i bought 2 from a local store and everything was ok for the first month. i finished 1st and the 2nd one was almost half when i started to feel my eyes burning and watery almost whole day,i was trying a new eyeliner at the same time so, i thought its that eyeliner and continue to use the cream until one morning i woke up with puffy and swollen eyelids and blurred vision, rash on my face, searched for some reviews about that product and find that i was not alone,threw it in the garbage…..please don&#x27;t use it or stop using if you feel any burning in the eyes or eyelids.</li>
            <li> Style: 8/10&lt;br /&gt;Usefulness: 8/10&lt;br /&gt;Shipping: 10/10&lt;br /&gt;Price: 8/10&lt;br /&gt;Feel: 8/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall Score: 42/50 (8.4/10)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the Garnier Ultra-lift Anti Wrinkle Firming Eye Cream December 28th, 2012 and got it December 31st, 2012. It&#x27;s estimated shipping time was between January 4th-January 9th. In only three days, the shipping was very, very fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m eighteen and have under eye bags since I was about fourteen, mostly from hereditary genes, lack of sleep over the years, and me generally not caring about my eyes. I think it works quite well- it doesn&#x27;t cover everything up, but I use make up cover up and you can barely see them. My eyes look brighter and I am quite pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a very pretty package, and the price for it is pretty nice, cheaper than a general store, although I could have found other products about the same price, just lower quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it feels quite nice around my eyes. I have no allergies toward make up or anything, and I haven&#x27;t had any reactions to it besides it clearing away my under eye bags. Very nice product, really no complaints.</li>
            <li> I have worn this for 10 years, night and day, and loved loved loved it. Raved about it to everyone. Then, I saw they changed the jar in the last 6 months when I went to buy it at Target. Didn&#x27;t think anything of it. Just put it on that night as usual. Well, when I woke up the next morning my upper and lower eyelids were red, puffy, and burning. My eyes were red too. Tried it one more night, still burned. Called Garnier and they told me they changed the formula. They are sending me a refund. The stuff was great in the first place so why did they change it?! Hate it when they do that. I have been wearing Neosporin the last few night trying to make it better. Wish me luck!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I tried it, I love this!</li>
            <li> The product infected my eyes and eyelids. Doctor told me to never use it again. Just went off of medication for the second time to clear up the infection. Reviews on line show many people with the same issues after using the product.</li>
            <li> Beware of the worst eye cream ever!  Gave me puffy eyelids and a rash around my eyes and face.  I didn&#x27;t know at first it was due to the cream so I went to an allergist for testing.  In the interim I discontinued using the cream and the redness slowly subsided.  The expensive silver lining is at least now I know what I&#x27;m allergic to.</li>
            <li> After using this product I developed a rash under my eyes that was very red and burned. This product should be taken off the shelf as many people have had the same experience.</li>
            <li> I like this as an eye cream it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes and feels good on my skin. I feel it&#x27;s doing what it supposed to do but it is not a miracle cream. I have tried more expensive brands of eye creams and like this much better. I have not had anyone come up to me raving that I look so good, but everyone says I look good for my age(people that no me anyway, so they may just be being nice) but I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and my skin still looks pretty good and I&#x27;m a tanner and in the sun a lot. I don&#x27;t feel a real firming action but others might it just feels real nice on and it does look like there is a improvement. I&#x27;ve been using it about 3 weeks so I&#x27;ll come back if it stops working and let you know</li>
            <li> Good product.&lt;br /&gt;I like the container and easy to carry when travelling.&lt;br /&gt;I mainly purchase this as my travel item and not for my every day eye cream.</li>
            <li> I use this product for many years and see a good result on my skin. Highly recommend to my friends</li>
            <li> This product did nothing.  It did cake on my lashes.  Would not recommend Garnier Ultra-lift-Anti Wrinkle Firming Eye Cream.</li>
            <li> As good a product as the more expensive wrinkle nostrums I&#x27;ve used in the past.  As in all such preparations, consistent use is required.</li>
    </ol>
