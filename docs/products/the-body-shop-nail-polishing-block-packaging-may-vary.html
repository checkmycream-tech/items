            <li>some change to qualify for free two day shipping, but it turned out to be one of the best - if not THE best - nail purchases I have ever made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>but it was a pleasant surprise.</li>

            <li>It seemed like a good block</li>
            <li>This product is good, but it does not hold up.</li>

            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I really love the result!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like getting manicures, they always hurt more than they soothe me!</li>
            <li>Love these things!</li>
            <li>My nails look great and it&#x27;s really easy to use.  </li>
            <li>They will let me bring own polish &amp; top coat!  </li>
            <li>The value you get for the price is amazing.</li>
            <li>This works really well and shines your nails beautifully!</li>
            <li>The shine part rly does make my nails shine which is nice.</li>

            <li>This is really a nice nail buffer, and it lasts a lot longer then</li>
            <li>fast shipping and arrived in great condition!</li>
            <li>Shines nails nicely and files them too.</li>
            <li>Does a good job, so I bought two more.</li>
            <li>I do my own nails and my girlfriends as well.  </li>
            <li>the beach &amp; our nail places get insulted when we bring out own tools.</li>
            <li>I love they way they look when they&#x27;ve been nicely shaped and buffed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My nails are beautifully buffed and shiny, and this tool has really helped to eliminate some of the unsightly ridges.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better looking, I suppose.</li>
            <li>Okay for the price.</li>
            <li>Love this buffer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many products like this.  </li>
            <li>BUT I wanted a product I could use so that I didn&#x27;t NEED polish, that my nails would look shiny and healthy just buffing and at this price</li>
            <li>elaborate</li>
            <li>I have ordered a lot more</li>
            <li>and I fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>This is an okay nail block.</li>
            <li>Definately have used better buffers.</li>
            <li>Perfect strangers compliment me almost on a daily basis.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I hope you give it a try and are equally pleased with the outcome as I have been.  </li>
            <li>I hope you give it a try and are equally pleased with the outcome as I have been.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I guess I was expecting more for something so pricey.</li>
            <li>I love the no-polish shine.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I received a complementary nail block a couple of years ago and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>This is a much more aggressive sanding buffer than others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Love this buffer and all the sides it has</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love the shiny look</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better nail blocks.</li>
            <li>Most buffers get the job done, so I assumed this would be just another buffer.</li>
            <li>nail block was very easy to use and worked very quickly also.</li>
            <li>i agree with others that the filing side would have been more useful as another grade of buffing, but it is a good product, works very well and is fairly priced.</li>
            <li>Polishing side (#4) is awesome and will make your nail super shiny like as if you put a clear coat of polish on your nails.</li>
            <li>Sometimes, bare is beautiful and my bare nails become beautiful because of this fantastic charm of a buffer!</li>
            <li>My nails are smooth and sleek now :).  </li>
            <li>It is light weight (which most are) but not with the boxes</li>
            <li>This is more soundly constructed and doesn&#x27;t pull apart or have corners curl up on you.  </li>
            <li>Handy and useful.</li>
            <li>I have had other nail blocks like this before, but The Body Shop nail block is the best I have used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands, but this is the best I have found.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s an easy way to save on manicure costs.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to hold in the hand.</li>
            <li>The bar is easy to use and easy to store.</li>
            <li>The 4 sides are numbered and labeled to make use easy.</li>
            <li>, I used the roughest side and everything was fine at this point.</li>
            <li>Seems to work fine.  </li>
            <li>and you should be fine</li>
            <li>However, this particular buffer seems to get the job done exceptionally well.</li>
            <li>Eh, it&#x27;s fine, but it&#x27;s just cheap foam and</li>
            <li>This little tool is awesome!  </li>
            <li>This is a HUGE factor for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m done with cheap buffing blocks.</li>
            <li>And you cannot beat the price + free shipping.</li>
            <li>And then I acquired, by adding a product - The Body Shop Nail Block - to my cart in order to receive free shipping.  </li>
            <li>It has 4 sides to progressively file, smooth, and polish your nails.</li>
            <li>I keep this one in my bathroom and after I bathe or shower and buff my nails and smooth the edges.</li>
            <li>My nails are so smooth and shiny they look like glass.</li>
            <li>I purchased this as an add-on to get my 2-day free shipping.</li>
            <li>File, smooth, buff to shine.</li>
            <li>It is softer on your nail beds (which is important for me as I do not wish to damage my nail beds, keeping them strong and healthy for more natural durable nails.  </li>
            <li>The block is simply, quick, and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Keep my nails clean, and buffed.  </li>
            <li>strongly suggest this product to anyone who wants a natural nail with a gorgeous shine.  </li>
            <li>strongly suggest this product to anyone who wants a natural nail with a gorgeous shine.  </li>
            <li>Basically this block when used correctly will take the surface of your finger/toenails down to a perfect smooth surface which can then be buffed to a high glossy shine.  </li>
            <li>but so far it has worked amazingly.  </li>
            <li>Good to have all surfaces on one nail block, but the sides&lt;br /&gt;are not discernibly different.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t come off and it actually does a good job polishing.</li>
            <li>Awesome block, with different sides that have different functions.</li>
            <li>I guess I wasn&#x27;t lucky with this one item I got...</li>
            <li>Highly, highly recommended for smooth and shiny nails!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The second side has a fairly fine texture and I use it to smooth out the top of my nails.</li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I find this great little block WELL worth it to get the clean nails</li>
            <li>So if you want great looking nails with little effort on your part give these a try!&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li>Using a flash block like this will allow you to give yourself (or someone else) a great looking shiny set of nails with little effort.  </li>
            <li>My sister likes to give our cousins these nail treatments while I give facials when we have our at-home spa days for fun.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how useful each function is, but it gets the job done</li>
            <li>This product is handy when you need something a bit chunkier for a larger finger.</li>
            <li>The shine stays long and gives the nails a very healthy look.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still worth it.</li>
            <li>Nice nail block,  Four sides for different uses and the block appears to keep its shape and sharpness/polishing areas longer than some cheaper blocks.</li>
            <li>I sometimes use the first side for the top of my nails as well.&lt;br /&gt;The third and fourth sides will buff your nails and give them a really good shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But the price is right and it does the job.</li>
            <li>This is all right.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, but I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s any better than the standard, cheap purple ones.</li>
            <li>Roughest grit is vastly more rough than the smooth level.</li>
            <li>Good product but the polishing side looked slightly used upon arrival.</li>
            <li>I do my nails at home often, but I don&#x27;t wear nail polish very much.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t find it superior to other products.</li>
            <li>Still, it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what the I wanted to.</li>
            <li>After one use, it looks pretty beat up already.</li>
            <li>Does a great job on my nails but won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>All I was looking for was a longer lasting block, but I got much more.  </li>
            <li>This block will pay for itself the first time you use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an avid do-it-yourself manicure junkie.  </li>
            <li>It is similar in construction to the rectangular Multi-colored 4 step buffers you can purchase at most any store EXCEPT it actually works phenomenally.  </li>
            <li>I have no clue what the components are that make this block so much better and different, but it is.  </li>
            <li>The process of going through the four steps is exactly the same yet it yields faster and better results, and by faster</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will never go back to another product unless by some miracle a better product is created within my budget/capability/ease/length of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will never go back to another product unless by some miracle a better product is created within my budget/capability/ease/length of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I finally learned how to use each side and my nails have never looked better.</li>
            <li>I found a &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; type at the drugstore for a dollar, and I&#x27;m much more likely to reach for that because of the shape.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I was happy to find them on Amazon and save myself a trip to the mall!</li>
            <li>My nails definitely look better and are more shiny after the last two steps.</li>
            <li>I wish Body Shop would substitute the emery board type surface (which I never use since I have better emery boards) with a second buffing surface.</li>
            <li>It had good reviews, but I was unsure if it was any different than the $2.99 shine/buff blocks I can purchase at my local beauty supply/drug store.  </li>
            <li>Many of the aforementioned buffers tend to strip too much of your nail surface.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like to have to take polish off, seeing chipping, I just want clean, fresh-looking nails, and this little block does that better than others.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first side has a texture much like an emery board</li>
            <li>I loved the Revlon shine block I have purchased in the past, and will again.</li>
            <li>I use only 2 sides, since the other sides don&#x27;t seem to be very effective.</li>
            <li>/&gt;LIKES:  this block is far superior to any other shine/buff product I&#x27;ve used in 15+ years!</li>
            <li>The instruction on the block was fine, but the middle steps don&#x27;t make sense for what they&#x27;re really for.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the shape as it is hard to hold on too, but it works good.</li>
            <li>Most blocks start collapsing in the center after just a couple of uses and the grit wears away</li>
            <li>works very well to buff, polish, etc.</li>
            <li>I want much quicker.</li>
            <li>My nails are so much healthier 2 weeks after purchasing this and periodically treating to buffing out.</li>
            <li>The price is very affordable, as well.</li>
            <li>it really works...</li>
            <li>This nail block works very well.  </li>
            <li>The 4th buffing step takes shine to a whole separate level.  </li>
            <li>This polishing block works really well- my nails shine like the heavens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works very well for the price.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>its really neat.</li>
            <li>It works really well on all four sides designed for filing, smoothing, and then buffing.</li>
            <li>This works very well and gives my nails that very polished look.  </li>
            <li>So really don&#x27;t know how to rate it...</li>
            <li>the nail block is the shine--it really shines, but that, too, fades after about a month&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li>This is honestly the ONLY buffer that I&#x27;ve ever tried that actually works!&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>Other than that, it really makes nails look healthy and shiny if you use all four sides.</li>
            <li>This nail block works better than any other nail block that I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li>This may be due to the length of time the shine lasts or better construction, or a combo of both.  </li>
            <li>Now I can have nice looking nails that last a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve amassed quite a bit of manicure products with the ultimate goal always being: a gorgeous natural looking nail, with as limited amount of work /polish</li>
            <li>It could use one side that is a little stronger for buffing; the soft part is great for the final shine.  </li>
            <li>this little block is great, doesn&#x27;t last very long but still so worth it</li>
            <li>Purchased this item to bring a shine to my dull nails, works great, bring a shine that last and will purchase again.</li>
            <li>The adhesive that is generally present on those blocks seem to separate quickly from the buffer or become sticky or tacky.  </li>
            <li>My local nail shop has similar products that are much more affordable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several different nail buffers and the Body Shop nail buffer made my nails more shiny than any I&#x27;ve used - plus the shine lasted.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I love it but find it a little pricy.  </li>
            <li>and I get really shiny nails after without having to apply clear nail polish.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice for deep ridges, but if you don&#x27;t have serious ridges and/or want something for more frequent use, I&#x27;d go a different route.</li>
            <li>The smooth surfaces smooths really well and the buffing surface makes my nails nearly twice as shiny as any other buffing block I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>It takes only a few minutes, and is super easy to use.</li>
            <li>Would have liked this nail block to be a little bigger in size, but it works well.</li>
            <li>New , came in about a week.</li>
            <li>You then have a new surface.</li>
            <li>I live @</li>
            <li>The shine I&#x27;ve received on the third side of the block (2nd to last buffing step) is so much better than the final shine side results on the lesser type products I&#x27;ve used, and again, I&#x27;ve easily tried 50+.</li>
            <li>The shiny smooth nails only last maybe about 3 days for me</li>
            <li>They were as shiny as a high gloss clear polish is.  </li>
            <li>The former is probably the more likely case; I&#x27;ve had tons of blocks like this and use them all for the same amount of time and this has never happened before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I easily get double digit uses out of it, but once I hit 9 or so, the quLity does decrease a little, but is still more proficient than the other</li>
            <li>to well, it&#x27;s easy to buff your nails shiny in just a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>I use it, my nails shine like they have been painted with clear polish.</li>
            <li>it looks like i have a clear coat of polish on.</li>
            <li>My nails look as if they have clear nail polish on them.  </li>
            <li>I even put clear polish over it</li>
            <li>By the end my nails looked like they had a coat of clear polish because they were so shiny.</li>
            <li>and you dont even have to use clear nail polish.  </li>
            <li>It makes your nails look as though you have a clear, shiny polish on.</li>
            <li>The shine lasts for days and it looks like I&#x27;m wearing clear polish.</li>
            <li>It worked really well, but only for about 3 uses.</li>
            <li>so you have to replace them frequently</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the shine it gave my nails.  </li>
            <li>The file side is the only step that really works.</li>
            <li>My hands are busy hands.</li>
            <li>, wow...</li>
            <li>just WOW.</li>
            <li>This is by far the nicest nail block I have owned.  </li>
            <li>and I have turned several friends onto this product (each with equal success even though one had what you would call damaged nails from years of using acrylics).  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love having to toss this into the landfill after just a few uses, so I&#x27;m subtracting a star since this product has short longevity.</li>
            <li>Other blocks I have bought have been made very cheaply, and only last for a couple uses.</li>
            <li>The numbers on the sides (telling you what to do first, second, etc.) are really hard to see, but the product itself works fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to hold and use and it&#x27;s small size means it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of drawer space between uses.</li>
            <li>It gets dirty easily, and the filing side is easily worn.</li>
            <li>I dont spend a lot of time on my nails, but this helps me when Im in a hurry and need a quick file down.</li>
            <li>I think it wears down alittle quickly but order 2</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how (maybe magic), but it actually made the tips of my nails whiter.  </li>
            <li>that could make your nails perfectly smooth and glossy, with very little effort and no damage.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d give this brand a try because the other wasn&#x27;t lasting very long and am I ever glad I ordered them.  </li>
            <li>Hands down, this buffer is better than any other I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>The white, final stage side gets torn up fast.  </li>
            <li>so, the quLity does decrease a little, but is still more proficient than the other</li>
            <li>The surfaces (all 4) are soft and gentle, not leaving those unsightly scratches or grooves which can happen with other sub-standard products.&lt;br /&gt;4.  </li>
            <li>In reality though you are getting a better, longer lasting product, in my opinion, so I personally am saving money as opposed to 3.99 for a Revelon shine buffer which has less uses in it and the results are not nearly as stunning.&lt;br</li>

            <li>I like how each side is marked and tells you the order to properly use it.</li>
            <li>While 5 dollars may sound a lot for what you can seemingly purchase for a few bucks less at CVS, I assure you, you are purchasing less and spending more money in the long run for a smaller return as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s Super small for the price</li>
            <li>I read the other reviews and after using it I can say I highly recommended this product!</li>
            <li>The shine lasts MUCH longer than the other products.  </li>
            <li>My nails aren&#x27;t made thinner by this process as some other blocks are capable of doing.  </li>
            <li>Although its not as high quality as I expected.</li>
            <li>This was a bit more expensive than other buffing blocks, but I will willingly spend the extra money!  </li>
            <li>The ridge removing side loses its roughness rather quickly, although the shining sides continue working.</li>

            <li> great, very good, I love it</li>
            <li> but it was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was wonderful having them delivered right to my door, but the best part is how nice my hands look.  </li>
            <li> Very attractive and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It seemed like a good block</li>
            <li> This product is good, but it does not hold up.</li>
            <li> the nail block gives a luster that leaves my nail looking naturally beautiful and healthy.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased.  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I really love the result!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like getting manicures, they always hurt more than they soothe me!</li>
            <li> Love these things!</li>
            <li> My nails look great and it&#x27;s really easy to use.  </li>

            <li> The value you get for the price is amazing.</li>
            <li> This works really well and shines your nails beautifully!</li>
            <li> The shine part rly does make my nails shine which is nice.</li>
            <li> Our &amp;#34;clients&amp;#34; say it feels really nice to get their nails polished by this thing.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to look nice</li>
            <li> The price was nice</li>
            <li> This is really a nice nail buffer, and it lasts a lot longer then</li>
            <li> fast shipping and arrived in great condition!</li>
            <li> Shines nails nicely and files them too.</li>
            <li> Does a good job, so I bought two more.</li>
            <li> I do my own nails and my girlfriends as well.  </li>
            <li> the beach &amp; our nail places get insulted when we bring out own tools.</li>
            <li> I love they way they look when they&#x27;ve been nicely shaped and buffed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My nails are beautifully buffed and shiny, and this tool has really helped to eliminate some of the unsightly ridges.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better looking, I suppose.</li>
            <li> Okay for the price.</li>
            <li> Love this buffer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many products like this.  </li>
            <li> BUT I wanted a product I could use so that I didn&#x27;t NEED polish, that my nails would look shiny and healthy just buffing and at this price</li>
            <li> elaborate</li>
            <li> I have ordered a lot more</li>
            <li> and I fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li> This is an okay nail block.</li>
            <li> Definately have used better buffers.</li>
            <li> Perfect strangers compliment me almost on a daily basis.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hope you give it a try and are equally pleased with the outcome as I have been.  </li>
            <li> I hope you give it a try and are equally pleased with the outcome as I have been.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I guess I was expecting more for something so pricey.</li>
            <li> I love the no-polish shine.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I received a complementary nail block a couple of years ago and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> This is a much more aggressive sanding buffer than others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Love this buffer and all the sides it has</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love the shiny look</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better nail blocks.</li>
            <li> Most buffers get the job done, so I assumed this would be just another buffer.</li>
            <li> nail block was very easy to use and worked very quickly also.</li>
            <li> i agree with others that the filing side would have been more useful as another grade of buffing, but it is a good product, works very well and is fairly priced.</li>
            <li> Polishing side (#4) is awesome and will make your nail super shiny like as if you put a clear coat of polish on your nails.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, bare is beautiful and my bare nails become beautiful because of this fantastic charm of a buffer!</li>
            <li> My nails are smooth and sleek now :).  </li>
            <li> It is light weight (which most are) but not with the boxes</li>
            <li> This is more soundly constructed and doesn&#x27;t pull apart or have corners curl up on you.  </li>
            <li> Handy and useful.</li>
            <li> I have had other nail blocks like this before, but The Body Shop nail block is the best I have used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands, but this is the best I have found.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s an easy way to save on manicure costs.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to hold in the hand.</li>
            <li> The bar is easy to use and easy to store.</li>
            <li> The 4 sides are numbered and labeled to make use easy.</li>
            <li> , I used the roughest side and everything was fine at this point.</li>
            <li> Seems to work fine.  </li>
            <li> and you should be fine</li>
            <li> However, this particular buffer seems to get the job done exceptionally well.</li>
            <li> Eh, it&#x27;s fine, but it&#x27;s just cheap foam and</li>
            <li> This little tool is awesome!  </li>
            <li> This is a HUGE factor for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m done with cheap buffing blocks.</li>
            <li> And you cannot beat the price + free shipping.</li>
            <li> And then I acquired, by adding a product - The Body Shop Nail Block - to my cart in order to receive free shipping.  </li>
            <li> It has 4 sides to progressively file, smooth, and polish your nails.</li>
            <li> I keep this one in my bathroom and after I bathe or shower and buff my nails and smooth the edges.</li>
            <li> My nails are so smooth and shiny they look like glass.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as an add-on to get my 2-day free shipping.</li>
            <li> File, smooth, buff to shine.</li>
            <li> It is softer on your nail beds (which is important for me as I do not wish to damage my nail beds, keeping them strong and healthy for more natural durable nails.  </li>
            <li> The block is simply, quick, and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Keep my nails clean, and buffed.  </li>
            <li> strongly suggest this product to anyone who wants a natural nail with a gorgeous shine.  </li>
            <li> strongly suggest this product to anyone who wants a natural nail with a gorgeous shine.  </li>
            <li> Basically this block when used correctly will take the surface of your finger/toenails down to a perfect smooth surface which can then be buffed to a high glossy shine.  </li>
            <li> but so far it has worked amazingly.  </li>
            <li> Good to have all surfaces on one nail block, but the sides&lt;br /&gt;are not discernibly different.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t come off and it actually does a good job polishing.</li>
            <li> Awesome block, with different sides that have different functions.</li>
            <li> I guess I wasn&#x27;t lucky with this one item I got...</li>
            <li> Highly, highly recommended for smooth and shiny nails!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The second side has a fairly fine texture and I use it to smooth out the top of my nails.</li>
            <li> Very reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I find this great little block WELL worth it to get the clean nails</li>
            <li> So if you want great looking nails with little effort on your part give these a try!&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> Using a flash block like this will allow you to give yourself (or someone else) a great looking shiny set of nails with little effort.  </li>
            <li> My sister likes to give our cousins these nail treatments while I give facials when we have our at-home spa days for fun.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how useful each function is, but it gets the job done</li>
            <li> This product is handy when you need something a bit chunkier for a larger finger.</li>
            <li> The shine stays long and gives the nails a very healthy look.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s still worth it.</li>
            <li> Nice nail block,  Four sides for different uses and the block appears to keep its shape and sharpness/polishing areas longer than some cheaper blocks.</li>
            <li> I sometimes use the first side for the top of my nails as well.&lt;br /&gt;The third and fourth sides will buff your nails and give them a really good shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But the price is right and it does the job.</li>
            <li> This is all right.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s any better than the standard, cheap purple ones.</li>
            <li> Roughest grit is vastly more rough than the smooth level.</li>
            <li> Good product but the polishing side looked slightly used upon arrival.</li>
            <li> I do my nails at home often, but I don&#x27;t wear nail polish very much.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t find it superior to other products.</li>
            <li> Still, it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what the I wanted to.</li>
            <li> After one use, it looks pretty beat up already.</li>
            <li> Does a great job on my nails but won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> All I was looking for was a longer lasting block, but I got much more.  </li>
            <li> This block will pay for itself the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an avid do-it-yourself manicure junkie.  </li>
            <li> It is similar in construction to the rectangular Multi-colored 4 step buffers you can purchase at most any store EXCEPT it actually works phenomenally.  </li>
            <li> I have no clue what the components are that make this block so much better and different, but it is.  </li>
            <li> The process of going through the four steps is exactly the same yet it yields faster and better results, and by faster</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will never go back to another product unless by some miracle a better product is created within my budget/capability/ease/length of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will never go back to another product unless by some miracle a better product is created within my budget/capability/ease/length of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I finally learned how to use each side and my nails have never looked better.</li>
            <li> I found a &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; type at the drugstore for a dollar, and I&#x27;m much more likely to reach for that because of the shape.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was happy to find them on Amazon and save myself a trip to the mall!</li>
            <li> My nails definitely look better and are more shiny after the last two steps.</li>
            <li> I wish Body Shop would substitute the emery board type surface (which I never use since I have better emery boards) with a second buffing surface.</li>
            <li> It had good reviews, but I was unsure if it was any different than the $2.99 shine/buff blocks I can purchase at my local beauty supply/drug store.  </li>
            <li> Many of the aforementioned buffers tend to strip too much of your nail surface.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to have to take polish off, seeing chipping, I just want clean, fresh-looking nails, and this little block does that better than others.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first side has a texture much like an emery board</li>
            <li> I loved the Revlon shine block I have purchased in the past, and will again.</li>
            <li> I use only 2 sides, since the other sides don&#x27;t seem to be very effective.</li>
            <li> /&gt;LIKES:  this block is far superior to any other shine/buff product I&#x27;ve used in 15+ years!</li>
            <li> The instruction on the block was fine, but the middle steps don&#x27;t make sense for what they&#x27;re really for.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the shape as it is hard to hold on too, but it works good.</li>
            <li> Most blocks start collapsing in the center after just a couple of uses and the grit wears away</li>
            <li> works very well to buff, polish, etc.</li>
            <li> I want much quicker.</li>
            <li> My nails are so much healthier 2 weeks after purchasing this and periodically treating to buffing out.</li>
            <li> The price is very affordable, as well.</li>
            <li> it really works...</li>
            <li> This nail block works very well.  </li>
            <li> The 4th buffing step takes shine to a whole separate level.  </li>
            <li> This polishing block works really well- my nails shine like the heavens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works very well for the price.</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> its really neat.</li>
            <li> It works really well on all four sides designed for filing, smoothing, and then buffing.</li>
            <li> This works very well and gives my nails that very polished look.  </li>
            <li> So really don&#x27;t know how to rate it...</li>
            <li> the nail block is the shine--it really shines, but that, too, fades after about a month&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> This is honestly the ONLY buffer that I&#x27;ve ever tried that actually works!&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> Other than that, it really makes nails look healthy and shiny if you use all four sides.</li>
            <li> This nail block works better than any other nail block that I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li> This may be due to the length of time the shine lasts or better construction, or a combo of both.  </li>
            <li> Now I can have nice looking nails that last a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve amassed quite a bit of manicure products with the ultimate goal always being: a gorgeous natural looking nail, with as limited amount of work /polish</li>
            <li> It could use one side that is a little stronger for buffing; the soft part is great for the final shine.  </li>
            <li> this little block is great, doesn&#x27;t last very long but still so worth it</li>
            <li> Purchased this item to bring a shine to my dull nails, works great, bring a shine that last and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> The adhesive that is generally present on those blocks seem to separate quickly from the buffer or become sticky or tacky.  </li>
            <li> My local nail shop has similar products that are much more affordable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different nail buffers and the Body Shop nail buffer made my nails more shiny than any I&#x27;ve used - plus the shine lasted.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love it but find it a little pricy.  </li>
            <li> and I get really shiny nails after without having to apply clear nail polish.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice for deep ridges, but if you don&#x27;t have serious ridges and/or want something for more frequent use, I&#x27;d go a different route.</li>
            <li> The smooth surfaces smooths really well and the buffing surface makes my nails nearly twice as shiny as any other buffing block I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> It takes only a few minutes, and is super easy to use.</li>
            <li> Would have liked this nail block to be a little bigger in size, but it works well.</li>
            <li> New , came in about a week.</li>
            <li> You then have a new surface.</li>
            <li> I live @</li>
            <li> The shine I&#x27;ve received on the third side of the block (2nd to last buffing step) is so much better than the final shine side results on the lesser type products I&#x27;ve used, and again, I&#x27;ve easily tried 50+.</li>
            <li> The shiny smooth nails only last maybe about 3 days for me</li>
            <li> They were as shiny as a high gloss clear polish is.  </li>
            <li> The former is probably the more likely case; I&#x27;ve had tons of blocks like this and use them all for the same amount of time and this has never happened before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I easily get double digit uses out of it, but once I hit 9 or so, the quLity does decrease a little, but is still more proficient than the other</li>
            <li> to well, it&#x27;s easy to buff your nails shiny in just a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> I use it, my nails shine like they have been painted with clear polish.</li>
            <li> it looks like i have a clear coat of polish on.</li>
            <li> My nails look as if they have clear nail polish on them.  </li>
            <li> I even put clear polish over it</li>
            <li> By the end my nails looked like they had a coat of clear polish because they were so shiny.</li>
            <li> and you dont even have to use clear nail polish.  </li>
            <li> It makes your nails look as though you have a clear, shiny polish on.</li>
            <li> The shine lasts for days and it looks like I&#x27;m wearing clear polish.</li>
            <li> It worked really well, but only for about 3 uses.</li>
            <li> so you have to replace them frequently</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the shine it gave my nails.  </li>
            <li> The file side is the only step that really works.</li>
            <li> My hands are busy hands.</li>
            <li> , wow...</li>
            <li> just WOW.</li>
            <li> This is by far the nicest nail block I have owned.  </li>
            <li> and I have turned several friends onto this product (each with equal success even though one had what you would call damaged nails from years of using acrylics).  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love having to toss this into the landfill after just a few uses, so I&#x27;m subtracting a star since this product has short longevity.</li>
            <li> Other blocks I have bought have been made very cheaply, and only last for a couple uses.</li>
            <li> The numbers on the sides (telling you what to do first, second, etc.) are really hard to see, but the product itself works fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to hold and use and it&#x27;s small size means it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of drawer space between uses.</li>
            <li> It gets dirty easily, and the filing side is easily worn.</li>
            <li> I dont spend a lot of time on my nails, but this helps me when Im in a hurry and need a quick file down.</li>
            <li> I think it wears down alittle quickly but order 2</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how (maybe magic), but it actually made the tips of my nails whiter.  </li>
            <li> that could make your nails perfectly smooth and glossy, with very little effort and no damage.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d give this brand a try because the other wasn&#x27;t lasting very long and am I ever glad I ordered them.  </li>
            <li> Hands down, this buffer is better than any other I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> The white, final stage side gets torn up fast.  </li>
            <li> so, the quLity does decrease a little, but is still more proficient than the other</li>
            <li> The surfaces (all 4) are soft and gentle, not leaving those unsightly scratches or grooves which can happen with other sub-standard products.&lt;br /&gt;4.  </li>
            <li> In reality though you are getting a better, longer lasting product, in my opinion, so I personally am saving money as opposed to 3.99 for a Revelon shine buffer which has less uses in it and the results are not nearly as stunning.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I like how each side is marked and tells you the order to properly use it.</li>
            <li> While 5 dollars may sound a lot for what you can seemingly purchase for a few bucks less at CVS, I assure you, you are purchasing less and spending more money in the long run for a smaller return as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s Super small for the price</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews and after using it I can say I highly recommended this product!</li>
            <li> The shine lasts MUCH longer than the other products.  </li>
            <li> My nails aren&#x27;t made thinner by this process as some other blocks are capable of doing.  </li>
            <li> Although its not as high quality as I expected.</li>
            <li> This was a bit more expensive than other buffing blocks, but I will willingly spend the extra money!  </li>
            <li> The ridge removing side loses its roughness rather quickly, although the shining sides continue working.</li>
            <li> I mean, the sides weren&#x27;t smooth as they are supposed to be, but rather bumpy like it was wet and the covering was about to come off.</li>
            <li> , something else a little strange: The rest of my nails were fine after using all sides of the block-for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Works really well but not sure how long it will last.....</li>
            <li> What others have said about it not lasting long I agree with.  </li>
            <li> By the way, rather than use the block to buff nails along the long edges, use it along the short edges.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to check the durability however.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> That way this block would last twice as long.</li>
            <li> guessing that you need to buy a new one a few times a year.</li>
            <li> The buffer doesn&#x27;t seem to be lasting as long as I expected</li>
            <li> and i can tell the block will last a while, unlike other files that i had.</li>
            <li> These seem to last longer than the other types.  </li>
            <li> Everything from OPI, Tweezerman, Revelon, generic store brands, old school buffers, and even an embarrassing and expensive go round with a professional mechanical buffer with attachments similar to what a nail technician uses for acrylics, but used only for buffing.&lt;br /&gt;5.  </li>
            <li> besides the rough side, all the other sides feel the same.</li>
            <li> or I could have used the rough side too long.</li>
            <li> only down side is that these cost approx $5.00 a block.  </li>
            <li> only down side is that these cost approx $5.00 a block.  </li>
            <li> The time it takes to use this block is substantially less than it took with similar products.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other similar models from Revlon and other drugstore brands.</li>
            <li> lots of packaging for this tiny little thing.  </li>
            <li> Not only does the slight shape difference make them easier to use, but my nails looked nicer than when I was using the other product.  </li>
            <li> so im not sure how long it will last.  </li>
            <li> I love this thing - it makes my usually terrible nails look very presentable.</li>
            <li> Not much of a difference between the shine and the buff level.</li>
            <li> It also wore out after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> ive only used it a few times</li>
            <li> I guess the rough side might jist be rougher than what I&#x27;m used to</li>
            <li> It takes only a few minutes to buff all my nails and toenails.</li>
            <li> When it finally started to fall apart, I went looking for a replacement and found quite a few options strung along a wide price range.</li>
            <li> Seriously, it looks like you&#x27;ve received a pro manicure and have shiny clear polish on your nails, without the time, expense, and worrying about tacky nails ruining what you just paid and waited for.  </li>
            <li> but this block is sturdy and has lasted me over six months with very little obvious wear.  </li>
            <li> This is a little odd, and I was originally going to give this a 1 star because of what it did to my nails, but then I realized that my nails are probably just very thin</li>
            <li> Turned dull after third use.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it came very bubbly.</li>
            <li> One negative is that there is a tiny gap in between sides of each buffing surface thus your nails sometime get caught in it.</li>
            <li> I need not apply a base or top</li>
            <li> As the material wears down, cut it.</li>
            <li> although writing is white and a little hard to see</li>
            <li> the black courser side will do its job</li>
            <li> Unfortunately after only 2 uses, this one is bubbling up in the middle like it&#x27;s about to peel off.  </li>
            <li> My nails snag less and the shine keeps me wanting to take care of my nails.</li>
            <li> hate to admit how much money I have spent on so called &amp;#34;amazing products&amp;#34; in the pursuit of the above listed results, with little to no return.  </li>
            <li> I mean I can buff/shine my nails in less than half the time it took with other products</li>
            <li> It is poor quality compared to similar nail blocks out there.</li>
            <li> Waste of $$.</li>
            <li> hard corners.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After side 2 and 3, my ring and pinky fingernails were so thin that they would indent if you touched them.</li>
            <li> but now my nails look worse than before.</li>
            <li> Which is really annoying when you&#x27;ve only used a product</li>
            <li> Seriously!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other nail blocks out of convenience (I have to go some distance to get to The Body Shop store)... and am always disappointed.  </li>
            <li> just the expensive ones they demonstrate on you then try to sell you on malls and department stores.</li>
            <li> admit I was skeptical and would never have purchased this unless I hadn&#x27;t needed another 4$ and</li>

            <li> If I hadn&#x27;t already known what to do I would have been very confused.</li>
            <li> the block shape is awkward to use.</li>
            <li> Steps two and four are very difficult to read.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> It worked really well, but only for about 3 uses. The ridge removing side loses its roughness rather quickly, although the shining sides continue working.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s any better than the standard, cheap purple ones. It&#x27;s better looking, I suppose.</li>
            <li> Good to have all surfaces on one nail block, but the sides&lt;br /&gt;are not discernibly different. Okay for the price.</li>
            <li> I love it! I have been needing one for the longest time. My husband saw the results of the buffing on my nails so he went and did his nails too lol.</li>
            <li> A great product for at home manicures.</li>
            <li> This works really well and shines your nails beautifully!</li>
            <li> I like how each side is marked and tells you the order to properly use it.</li>
            <li> Not much of a difference between the shine and the buff level. Roughest grit is vastly more rough than the smooth level. It also wore out after only a few uses. Still, it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> New , came in about a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used various nail buffing systems and this block is the quickest and easiest one I&#x27;ve ever used! I&#x27;ve used it 3 times in the last 2 months and it worked as well the 3rd time as it did the 1st.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what the I wanted to. Although its not as high quality as I expected. After one use, it looks pretty beat up already. The shine part rly does make my nails shine which is nice. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> An acceptable product I suppose however I assumed there were 3 of these for $14 not 1, can you spell rip off?</li>
            <li> Just use sides 2-4 and your nails are shiny! I&#x27;m a middle aged woman whose nails have developed ridges in them and I decided I would give my nails a &#x27;face lift&#x27;. Now I just need a device to keep me from picking at my cuticles and I got it made.</li>
            <li> Love this buffer.  Wish it was bigger. It&#x27;s Super small for the price</li>
            <li> The best nail buffer on the market</li>
            <li> This nail block works better than any other nail block that I&#x27;ve had.  My nails look great and it&#x27;s really easy to use.  I&#x27;ve used it several times and it&#x27;s holding up well.  Will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> This is honestly the ONLY buffer that I&#x27;ve ever tried that actually works!&lt;br /&gt;Once I use it, my nails shine like they have been painted with clear polish. I even had a woman in the nail salon try to take the polish off of my nails even though they were only buffed because they were so shiny!</li>
            <li> i agree with others that the filing side would have been more useful as another grade of buffing, but it is a good product, works very well and is fairly priced.</li>
            <li> This was a bit more expensive than other buffing blocks, but I will willingly spend the extra money!  Most blocks start collapsing in the center after just a couple of uses and the grit wears away so you have to replace them frequently but this block is sturdy and has lasted me over six months with very little obvious wear.  It does what it&#x27;s meant to well, it&#x27;s easy to buff your nails shiny in just a few minutes.  I&#x27;ll be buying backups, though hopefully they will never, ever change or discontinue this product.  I&#x27;m done with cheap buffing blocks.</li>
            <li> love this filing block, perfect for my needs. I dont spend a lot of time on my nails, but this helps me when Im in a hurry and need a quick file down. Beats spending money on someone else doing it. the black courser side will do its job and i can tell the block will last a while, unlike other files that i had. The sides are numbered so you know what order to go in if you want to do all the steps.</li>
            <li> works very well to buff, polish, etc. My sister likes to give our cousins these nail treatments while I give facials when we have our at-home spa days for fun. Our &amp;#34;clients&amp;#34; say it feels really nice to get their nails polished by this thing. lol.</li>
            <li> ive only used it a few times so im not sure how long it will last.  but so far it has worked amazingly.  i can&#x27;t believe how well my nails shine.  it looks like i have a clear coat of polish on.</li>
            <li> I have had other nail blocks like this before, but The Body Shop nail block is the best I have used. My nails are so, so shiny and it&#x27;s an easy way to save on manicure costs.</li>
            <li> Best nail buffer I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> Does not last at all.  The white, final stage side gets torn up fast.  Get something cheaper.</li>
            <li> just the expensive ones they demonstrate on you then try to sell you on malls and department stores. Follow the instructions. Easy to use. Great results. Has not impacted the health of my nails.</li>
            <li> I got this one because the filing parts peeled off the last one I had.  Unfortunately after only 2 uses, this one is bubbling up in the middle like it&#x27;s about to peel off.  Does a great job on my nails but won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> It does the job and makes your nails look beautiful.  I don&#x27;t like the shape as it is hard to hold on too, but it works good.</li>
            <li> Awesome block, with different sides that have different functions. I don&#x27;t know how useful each function is, but it gets the job done</li>
            <li> I am recently having vertical lines on my nails and its sooooo gross.  I cannot believe how this works!  It&#x27;s miraculous!  Seriously!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  My nails are smooth and sleek now :).  And you cannot beat the price + free shipping.</li>
            <li> love this multi-use nail item!!!!</li>
            <li> The nail shine is amazing!</li>
            <li> The shine part works marvelously! I read the other reviews and after using it I can say I highly recommended this product!</li>
            <li> My nails have never been so shiny. It takes only a few minutes, and is super easy to use. Great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many products like this.  Four-sided, from filing to final buffing to a sheen.  THIS has been the best.  I was surprised at the shine it gave my nails.  They were as shiny as a high gloss clear polish is.  Very pleased.  What others have said about it not lasting long I agree with.  It wears after two, maybe three uses, especially if you&#x27;re doing mani and pedis.  BUT I wanted a product I could use so that I didn&#x27;t NEED polish, that my nails would look shiny and healthy just buffing and at this price, I figure I am SAVING money.  I don&#x27;t like to have to take polish off, seeing chipping, I just want clean, fresh-looking nails, and this little block does that better than others. SO yes, the ONLY downside for me is replacing it often, but consider the cost when you buy nail polish, polish remover and the time saved not having to take layers of polish off and repolishing your nails.  That&#x27;s why I find this great little block WELL worth it to get the clean nails I want much quicker.</li>
            <li> I prefer to not wear color on my nails but still want that shiny polish look for my nails.  This block works perfectly for that.  My nails look as if they have clear nail polish on them.  The block is simply, quick, and easy to use.  You do have to replace them after time so I keep several on hand.</li>
            <li> This is a little odd, and I was originally going to give this a 1 star because of what it did to my nails, but then I realized that my nails are probably just very thin or I could have used the rough side too long. The former is probably the more likely case; I&#x27;ve had tons of blocks like this and use them all for the same amount of time and this has never happened before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To elaborate, I used the roughest side and everything was fine at this point. After side 2 and 3, my ring and pinky fingernails were so thin that they would indent if you touched them. The one started bleeding underneath the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It seemed like a good block but I&#x27;ll probably never use one ever again after this.&lt;br /&gt;Also, something else a little strange: The rest of my nails were fine after using all sides of the block-for a few minutes. All of a sudden I noticed what looked like a white film on my nails, but it was underneath the nail because there was nothing to rub off. I even put clear polish over it and it&#x27;s definitely underneath.&lt;br /&gt;I guess I just can&#x27;t use these anymore. Too freaked out now. I just wanted to look nice but now my nails look worse than before. I think I&#x27;d rather have ridges on my nails than have my nails peel off or look like I tried painting them with streaks of glue o_O&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I guess the rough side might jist be rougher than what I&#x27;m used to</li>
            <li> Hands down, this buffer is better than any other I have ever used.  I have ordered a lot more so I won&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as they say it does. Your nails will turn out shiny but will still have ridges on them.</li>
            <li> My nails are so much healthier 2 weeks after purchasing this and periodically treating to buffing out. My nails snag less and the shine keeps me wanting to take care of my nails. The price is very affordable, as well.</li>
            <li> Would have liked this nail block to be a little bigger in size, but it works well. Other blocks I have bought have been made very cheaply, and only last for a couple uses. This one seems to be holding up longer</li>
            <li> The numbers on the sides (telling you what to do first, second, etc.) are really hard to see, but the product itself works fine.</li>
            <li> Santa left a similar block in my stocking last Christmas and I fell in love with it.  I thought I&#x27;d give this brand a try because the other wasn&#x27;t lasting very long and am I ever glad I ordered them.  All I was looking for was a longer lasting block, but I got much more.  Not only does the slight shape difference make them easier to use, but my nails looked nicer than when I was using the other product.  I wouldn&#x27;t have believed that possible if my nails didn&#x27;t prove it to me.&lt;br /&gt;It was wonderful having them delivered right to my door, but the best part is how nice my hands look.  No nail polish to chip or remove and the nail block gives a luster that leaves my nail looking naturally beautiful and healthy.  So if you want great looking nails with little effort on your part give these a try!&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> Does a great job on nails, providing a long-lasting shine...only downside: numbers rub off on the block so I have to keep looking closely to see in which order to use the sides.</li>
            <li> this little block is great, doesn&#x27;t last very long but still so worth it</li>
            <li> it really works...my nails shine...</li>
            <li> I was happy with this purchase. By the way, rather than use the block to buff nails along the long edges, use it along the short edges. As the material wears down, cut it. You then have a new surface.</li>
            <li> This nail block works very well.  I have used it a number of times and it continues to do a great job on my nails.  Good price!!</li>
            <li> While I like getting a manicure once a month, I didn&#x27;t like having to cough up $25 for it. When I saw this block I thought I&#x27;d give it a try and see how it works.&lt;br /&gt;The first side has a texture much like an emery board and I use it to shape my nail tips.&lt;br /&gt;The second side has a fairly fine texture and I use it to smooth out the top of my nails. I sometimes use the first side for the top of my nails as well.&lt;br /&gt;The third and fourth sides will buff your nails and give them a really good shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it 4 times now and it still does an excellent job. This block will pay for itself the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> This is an okay nail block. Definately have used better buffers. The price was nice</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an avid do-it-yourself manicure junkie.  I leave Pedis to those beyond my skill sets.  I&#x27;ve amassed quite a bit of manicure products with the ultimate goal always being: a gorgeous natural looking nail, with as limited amount of work /polish required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d hate to admit how much money I have spent on so called &amp;#34;amazing products&amp;#34; in the pursuit of the above listed results, with little to no return.  And then I acquired, by adding a product - The Body Shop Nail Block - to my cart in order to receive free shipping.  It had good reviews, but I was unsure if it was any different than the $2.99 shine/buff blocks I can purchase at my local beauty supply/drug store.  I figured I&#x27;d try it out despite the $5.00 price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LIKES:  this block is far superior to any other shine/buff product I&#x27;ve used in 15+ years! and that is not an exaggeration at all! It is similar in construction to the rectangular Multi-colored 4 step buffers you can purchase at most any store EXCEPT it actually works phenomenally.  It has some elements, aside from the end result that set it apart from its market competition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  It is light weight (which most are) but not with the boxes hard corners.&lt;br /&gt;2.  The adhesive that is generally present on those blocks seem to separate quickly from the buffer or become sticky or tacky.  This is more soundly constructed and doesn&#x27;t pull apart or have corners curl up on you.  Which is really annoying when you&#x27;ve only used a product once.&lt;br /&gt;3.  It is softer on your nail beds (which is important for me as I do not wish to damage my nail beds, keeping them strong and healthy for more natural durable nails.  Many of the aforementioned buffers tend to strip too much of your nail surface.  The surfaces (all 4) are soft and gentle, not leaving those unsightly scratches or grooves which can happen with other sub-standard products.&lt;br /&gt;4.  The shine I&#x27;ve received on the third side of the block (2nd to last buffing step) is so much better than the final shine side results on the lesser type products I&#x27;ve used, and again, I&#x27;ve easily tried 50+. Everything from OPI, Tweezerman, Revelon, generic store brands, old school buffers, and even an embarrassing and expensive go round with a professional mechanical buffer with attachments similar to what a nail technician uses for acrylics, but used only for buffing.&lt;br /&gt;5.  The 4th buffing step takes shine to a whole separate level.  Seriously, it looks like you&#x27;ve received a pro manicure and have shiny clear polish on your nails, without the time, expense, and worrying about tacky nails ruining what you just paid and waited for.  People constantly comment about my nails since I started using this and I have turned several friends onto this product (each with equal success even though one had what you would call damaged nails from years of using acrylics).  Perfect strangers compliment me almost on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;6.  The time it takes to use this block is substantially less than it took with similar products.  I have no clue what the components are that make this block so much better and different, but it is.  The process of going through the four steps is exactly the same yet it yields faster and better results, and by faster I mean I can buff/shine my nails in less than half the time it took with other products PLUS I need not apply a base or top coat.&lt;br /&gt;7.  The shine lasts MUCH longer than the other products.  I can go two weeks without a touch up, and I work on a keyboard constantly and scrape my nails while working and it just stays.&lt;br /&gt;8.  My nails aren&#x27;t made thinner by this process as some other blocks are capable of doing.  This is a HUGE factor for me.  I don&#x27;t want thinner weaker nails, just shinny beautiful ones.&lt;br /&gt;9.  These seem to last longer than the other types.  This may be due to the length of time the shine lasts or better construction, or a combo of both.  I easily get double digit uses out of it, but once I hit 9 or so, the quLity does decrease a little, but is still more proficient than the other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side is that these cost approx $5.00 a block.  In reality though you are getting a better, longer lasting product, in my opinion, so I personally am saving money as opposed to 3.99 for a Revelon shine buffer which has less uses in it and the results are not nearly as stunning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never go back to another product unless by some miracle a better product is created within my budget/capability/ease/length of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly suggest this product to anyone who wants a natural nail with a gorgeous shine.  While 5 dollars may sound a lot for what you can seemingly purchase for a few bucks less at CVS, I assure you, you are purchasing less and spending more money in the long run for a smaller return as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit I was skeptical and would never have purchased this unless I hadn&#x27;t needed another 4$ and some change to qualify for free two day shipping, but it turned out to be one of the best - if not THE best - nail purchases I have ever made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give this a try and see if you don&#x27;t agree.  The points I listed as positives are all results of multiple uses of one block.  I hope you give it a try and are equally pleased with the outcome as I have been.

            <li> Purchased this item to bring a shine to my dull nails, works great, bring a shine that last and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This product is handy when you need something a bit chunkier for a larger finger. It&#x27;s easy to hold in the hand. I use only 2 sides, since the other sides don&#x27;t seem to be very effective. But the price is right and it does the job.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it came very bubbly. I mean, the sides weren&#x27;t smooth as they are supposed to be, but rather bumpy like it was wet and the covering was about to come off. It didn&#x27;t come off and it actually does a good job polishing. I guess I wasn&#x27;t lucky with this one item I got...</li>
            <li> This works very nicely to buff my nails before applying polish. I was very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I am returning the nail block I purchased. It is poor quality compared to similar nail blocks out there. The file side is the only step that really works. The instruction on the block was fine, but the middle steps don&#x27;t make sense for what they&#x27;re really for. If I hadn&#x27;t already known what to do I would have been very confused. I loved the Revlon shine block I have purchased in the past, and will again.</li>
            <li> This polishing block works really well- my nails shine like the heavens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But why such a steep price? I guess I was expecting more for something so pricey. I think drugstore polishing blocks work just as well. Maybe this one lasts longer? We&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> Not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> great, very good, I love it</li>
            <li> GREAT product with good quality!!!  :D</li>
            <li> besides the rough side, all the other sides feel the same.</li>
            <li> Why is this nail polishing block $16?  I received it today and it looks like a polishing block for $4.  Feeling ripped off.</li>
            <li> I love the no-polish shine. It lasts about a day.</li>
            <li> I love this thing - it makes my usually terrible nails look very presentable. It has 4 sides to progressively file, smooth, and polish your nails. By the end my nails looked like they had a coat of clear polish because they were so shiny. They felt like glass. It&#x27;s easy to hold and use and it&#x27;s small size means it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of drawer space between uses. The shiny smooth nails only last maybe about 3 days for me but that&#x27;s plenty of time.</li>
            <li> This is really a nice nail buffer, and it lasts a lot longer then the ones that take 4 weeks to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to. Keep my nails clean, and buffed.  I am buying another one today.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, just a bit overpriced.</li>
            <li> Good product but the polishing side looked slightly used upon arrival.</li>
            <li> I love it but find it a little pricy.  My local nail shop has similar products that are much more affordable.</li>
            <li> I got this product last friday and use it once already. I really love the result! It makes my nails shine and very smooth!!!</li>
            <li> Works very well for the price. Probably one of the best I&#x27;ve used. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to check the durability however.</li>
            <li> Seems to work fine.  Have used it twice.  Like that the sides are labeled-- although writing is white and a little hard to see</li>
            <li> I bought this for my aunt and she loves using it! The shine stays long and gives the nails a very healthy look. Very reasonably priced! fast shipping and arrived in great condition! Definitely recommended seller!&lt;br /&gt;Prompt communication too! Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> Works really well but not sure how long it will last.....guessing that you need to buy a new one a few times a year.</li>
            <li> My mom used to have something like this when I was younger and I am very happy I found it. :) It works really well.</li>
            <li> lots of packaging for this tiny little thing.  great product.  follow the order and you dont even have to use clear nail polish.  its really neat.</li>
            <li> I finally learned how to use each side and my nails have never looked better. The value you get for the price is amazing. The bar is easy to use and easy to store.</li>
            <li> Practically destroyed the item trying to get the wrapping and cardboard off. Won&#x27;t last long.  Waste of $$.</li>
            <li> I received a complementary nail block a couple of years ago and fell in love with it. When it finally started to fall apart, I went looking for a replacement and found quite a few options strung along a wide price range. I ordered several to try them out (yes, I&#x27;m a diva, he says) and found the Body Shop Nail Block to be the cat&#x27;s meow and at a price that made me purr. Take it from me, lassies, the more expensive ones have nothing over this block.</li>
            <li> The 4 sides are numbered and labeled to make use easy. My nails are beautifully buffed and shiny, and this tool has really helped to eliminate some of the unsightly ridges. Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> My hands are busy hands. Now I can have nice looking nails that last a long time.</li>
            <li> Nice! Shines nails nicely and files them too. Does a good job, so I bought two more.</li>
            <li> Turned dull after third use.</li>
            <li> Eh, it&#x27;s fine, but it&#x27;s just cheap foam and the block shape is awkward to use. I found a &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; type at the drugstore for a dollar, and I&#x27;m much more likely to reach for that because of the shape.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other nail blocks out of convenience (I have to go some distance to get to The Body Shop store)... and am always disappointed.  These are the only nail blocks I use.  Needless to say, I was happy to find them on Amazon and save myself a trip to the mall!</li>
            <li> Handy and useful. I keep this one in my bathroom and after I bathe or shower and buff my nails and smooth the edges. It works really well on all four sides designed for filing, smoothing, and then buffing.</li>
            <li> Using a flash block like this will allow you to give yourself (or someone else) a great looking shiny set of nails with little effort.  I have been asked if I have nail polish on before and no I don&#x27;t lol.  Basically this block when used correctly will take the surface of your finger/toenails down to a perfect smooth surface which can then be buffed to a high glossy shine.  Very attractive and easy to use.  I do my own nails and my girlfriends as well.  She rather enjoys it.</li>
            <li> This is a much more aggressive sanding buffer than others I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s nice for deep ridges, but if you don&#x27;t have serious ridges and/or want something for more frequent use, I&#x27;d go a different route.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers praised this buffer so I bought it. I really didn&#x27;t find it superior to other products. It&#x27;s a nail buffer, go figure... lol</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like getting manicures, they always hurt more than they soothe me! I do my nails at home often, but I don&#x27;t wear nail polish very much. I love they way they look when they&#x27;ve been nicely shaped and buffed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, wow... just WOW. This Body Shop Nail Block is incredible. My nails are so smooth and shiny they look like glass. They look like they&#x27;ve been painted clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nail block was very easy to use and worked very quickly also. I would definitely buy this again. In fact, I bought two to start with, and I anticipate never being without one of these things again. Highly, highly recommended for smooth and shiny nails!</li>
            <li> Love this product, just wish it lasted longer!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different nail buffers and the Body Shop nail buffer made my nails more shiny than any I&#x27;ve used - plus the shine lasted. The buffer doesn&#x27;t seem to be lasting as long as I expected but it was very inexpensive so only if it lasts a few months it&#x27;s still worth it.</li>
            <li> Love this buffer and all the sides it has</li>
            <li> These are great. Didn&#x27;t actually realize this came in a set of 3 but it was a pleasant surprise. Love these things!</li>
            <li> This works very well and gives my nails that very polished look.  I think it wears down alittle quickly but order 2 and you should be fine</li>
            <li> My nails definitely look better and are more shiny after the last two steps.</li>
            <li> So, it seems to be a very good buffer &amp; polisher, the best part is that 3 comes in a pack, not just one.</li>
            <li> This is a great nail block! I&#x27;ve tried other brands, but this is the best I have found. My nails look like I&#x27;ve been to a salon for manicure &amp; polish when I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> I live @ the beach &amp; our nail places get insulted when we bring out own tools. They will let me bring own polish &amp; top coat!  So really don&#x27;t know how to rate it...</li>
            <li> I purchased this as an add-on to get my 2-day free shipping. I&#x27;m really glad I did. It makes your nails look as though you have a clear, shiny polish on. I am a firefighter and the shine lasts about 5 days for me.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the best nail buffer I have ever used. I use it accordingly and I get really shiny nails after without having to apply clear nail polish. Sometimes, bare is beautiful and my bare nails become beautiful because of this fantastic charm of a buffer!</li>
            <li> Buffing surface #2 and 3 are not that different. Can&#x27;t seems to tell the difference in its effect when buffing the nails. Polishing side (#4) is awesome and will make your nail super shiny like as if you put a clear coat of polish on your nails. One negative is that there is a tiny gap in between sides of each buffing surface thus your nails sometime get caught in it.</li>
            <li> I love the shiny look it gives my nails (which lasts about a week!)</li>
            <li> This little tool is awesome!  I had no idea a product like this was out there that could make your nails perfectly smooth and glossy, with very little effort and no damage.</li>
            <li> This is all right.  It could use one side that is a little stronger for buffing; the soft part is great for the final shine.  But I wouldnt buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is by far the nicest nail block I have owned.  I&#x27;m not sure how (maybe magic), but it actually made the tips of my nails whiter.  The shine lasts for days and the sides don&#x27;t peel off like some brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better nail blocks. Problems: It isn&#x27;t very good at smoothing ridges. Steps two and four are very difficult to read. However, it definitely leaves you with shiny nails.</li>
            <li> Nice nail block,  Four sides for different uses and the block appears to keep its shape and sharpness/polishing areas longer than some cheaper blocks.</li>
            <li> Was a gift for my daughter-in-law and she says it works great.</li>
            <li> It gets dirty easily, and the filing side is easily worn. Other than that, it really makes nails look healthy and shiny if you use all four sides.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other similar models from Revlon and other drugstore brands. Most buffers get the job done, so I assumed this would be just another buffer. No big difference. File, smooth, buff to shine. However, this particular buffer seems to get the job done exceptionally well. The smooth surfaces smooths really well and the buffing surface makes my nails nearly twice as shiny as any other buffing block I&#x27;ve ever tried. The shine lasts for days and it looks like I&#x27;m wearing clear polish. It takes only a few minutes to buff all my nails and toenails. The only downside is that this buffer only seems to last about 2 uses. I wish Body Shop would substitute the emery board type surface (which I never use since I have better emery boards) with a second buffing surface. That way this block would last twice as long. I don&#x27;t love having to toss this into the landfill after just a few uses, so I&#x27;m subtracting a star since this product has short longevity.</li>
            <li> This product is good, but it does not hold up.After a month, there were worn places that showed.  The best thing&lt;br /&gt;about the nail block is the shine--it really shines, but that, too, fades after about a month&#x27;s use.</li>
    </ol>
