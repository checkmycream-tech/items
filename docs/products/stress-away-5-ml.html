            <li> It&#x27;s Young Living, Stress Away oil...  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t guarantee you&#x27;ll get Young Living oils</li>
            <li> A new fan of essential oils</li>
            <li> Tested with one from young living (straight from young living) it was watered down.</li>
            <li> I thought surely I was missing something, surely they&#x27;re not actually selling the liquid in this bottle that smells so bad.  </li>
            <li> Essential oils have been really helpful in calming me down.  </li>
            <li> I am a Young Living Member/distributor and the cost for this 5ml bottle of Stress Away is $.50 less than a 15ml bottle @ $29.75.  </li>
            <li> Received earlier than expected, it just smells calming, I cant wait to put it in my diffuser and let it work</li>
            <li> I roll it on the back of my neck and down to my shoulders , even on my pulse points.</li>
            <li> came and used as expected</li>
            <li> this is not real young living oils, this has been watered down!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Well, I am not willing to try this product beyond my three-times-and-out-it-goes limit.</li>
            <li> My restless cat calmed down and fell asleep within MINUTES of diffusing this oil into the air.  </li>
            <li> Less screaming from mom I have noticed.</li>
            <li> ; in the subject line.</li>
            <li> Absolutely not true in this case.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy a few and try them out.</li>
            <li> I bought a diffuser and put a few drops of</li>
            <li> Not sure if that meant they bought from Germany and resold in US.  </li>
            <li> The bottle was sealed when I got it, so I&#x27;m not sure if it had been tampered with or if one of the ingredients just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I was optimistic but a little skeptical as well.  </li>
            <li> Seal was broken and leaking</li>
            <li> and it was even worse.  </li>
            <li> do not buy this could be dangerous to your health.</li>
            <li> It made me sick to my stomach.</li>
            <li> I ended up with a horrible headache.</li>
            <li> My bottle looked sealed, but before I opened it I could smell the nasty stench that was inside.  </li>
            <li> Awful!</li>

            <li> Great scent! love it in my diffuser! Makes my house smell great and helps me chill!</li>
            <li> the high quality of young living&#x27;s products shines once again in this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the scent, not overwhelming as some oils can be yet effective. I am using it in the Greenair Aroma Diffuser, Spa Mister and I am pleased.</li>
            <li> It makes you wanna smell it in an inhaler all day. Think I am gonna do that. It&#x27;s such a great smell.</li>
            <li> Received earlier than expected, it just smells calming, I cant wait to put it in my diffuser and let it work it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a college student and tend to have a ton of stress but ever since I&#x27;ve started using stress away have noticed that I&#x27;m a lot calmer! Love this product!</li>
            <li> arrived fast, unopened. smells wonderful and just like the one i ordered from YL. best part i paid much less than YL. i love YL products but can&#x27;t afford them.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday,,,on my temples, back of neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> This is a good one to dilute and wear.  Very nice to inhale while working.</li>
            <li> Smells too strong. Was opened.</li>
            <li> This is a great essential oil. I love it. It smeels wonderful. Really helps with stress. I would recomend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Young Living Oils are high quality and certified pure with no added &amp;#34;yucky&amp;#34; stuff.  Stress Away smells great and is quite relaxing.</li>
            <li> Like the aroma very relaxing and a good price for this essential oil. I love my electric atomizer would recommend.</li>
            <li> Perhaps this works for some, but for me, the smell alone is enough to make me want to toss this bottle in the trash. Applying it to my skin, forget it, too smelly. I tried two drops in water as suggested on the bottle; again, yuck! I ended up with a horrible headache. When the cure creates more stress than it was suppose to relieve, then it is time to handle stress without this product. Yes, I read online that if you are repeled by the scent/taste of an oil then it means that your body needs the oil more than ever. Well, I am not willing to try this product beyond my three-times-and-out-it-goes limit.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  It takes away all the stuff of moments and the day.......I use it often and recommend it to those in the workforce that have hectic jobs and lifestyles that are challenged.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I should have known better, but my bottle looked like it had been opened as well. I&#x27;ve bought several bottles of Doterra and none of them had been tampered with. I won&#x27;t be buying any Young Living oils on Amazon again.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome, it really works. Exactly as its title, it does take the stress away.</li>
            <li> I have been using this in my home for about month now in an oil warmer- with Distilled water and on waxes. It seems to keep the household calmer. Less screaming from mom I have noticed. Maybe it&#x27;s in my heads but I&#x27;ll take it.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorites, like having a nice glass of wine...very calming!!!</li>
            <li> Just what I needed!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have just gotten into using essential oils.  I have arthritis and eczema (autoimmune issues) and am trying to find something to help- pain and itching.,  I love the way this oil smells and originally used it just for it&#x27;s beautiful aroma as perfume.  After studying a bit more about the oils, I discovered it has copaiba and other anti-inflammatory agents in it, so have started using it on my sore joints in my hands and it has provided good relief.  It is a bit &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34; when first applied but then it absorbs well.  It has not helped my itchy, rashy eczema, though.  Nonetheless, I  probably use this oil the most, except for maybe lavender.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite essential oil. It smells so wonderful...I believe it really helps to melt the stress away. This is the second time I bought it, I love it so much.</li>
            <li> I am a Young Living Member/distributor and the cost for this 5ml bottle of Stress Away is $.50 less than a 15ml bottle @ $29.75.  Become a member of Young Living and get true savings.</li>
            <li> Meh.... Didnt do a whole lot for my stress but liked the smell</li>
            <li> I have very high blood pressure and this is helping me stay calm, and cool and is helping with my blood presure</li>
            <li> Love this essential oil! Smells so good and made me feel calm and relaxed. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Love Young Living oils.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Scent doesn&#x27;t appeal to me.  I was told for maximum benefits you need to enjoy scent. Got refund.</li>
            <li> I love my young living oils. I buy a lot of stress a at and have found this product to be the best . I will continue to buy young living oils due to the fact that they tend to work better for me</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, bottle was perfect. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just finding out about essential oils and this works great!</li>
            <li> The product was in German. Not sure if that meant they bought from Germany and resold in US.  Seems to be ok though.</li>
            <li> I did not like the scent of this oil. It made me sick to my stomach. The bottle was sealed when I got it, so I&#x27;m not sure if it had been tampered with or if one of the ingredients just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Fast ship!! Item as described!! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> this is good, I place a few drops into my mister and it gives off a nice smell and keeps stress at bay</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;m new to essential oils. I decided to buy a few and try them out. I was optimistic but a little skeptical as well.  I bought a diffuser and put a few drops of this Stress Away oil in and turned it on. My restless cat calmed down and fell asleep within MINUTES of diffusing this oil into the air.  I&#x27;m no longer a skeptic. These oils do work and I am a believer. This is a great oil to relieve stress and calm the mind.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me, but everyone&#x27;s system/body is different. It might work for you.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product and received it right away.  I use this on my husband at bedtime to help him sleep.  Received it really quickly!!</li>
            <li> Tested with one from young living (straight from young living) it was watered down.</li>
            <li> I wear it all the time</li>
            <li> Great oil for when I&#x27;m feeling stressed! Just opening the bottle and smelling it helps me feel relief.</li>
            <li> really enjoy the scent of this oil</li>
            <li> Excellent!  Very relaxing</li>
            <li> Have heard iffy reviews about ordering oils on line. Absolutely not true in this case. Product arrived well protected, and oil is amazing.</li>
            <li> The ,very affordable, couldn&#x27;t  beat this.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I thought it would smell.  Probably wouldn&#x27;t order again.</li>
            <li> Seal was broken and leaking</li>
            <li> I use Stress Away when I feel overwhelmed with the many things I deal with on a daily basis.  I can sense a feeling of relief and relaxation when I use it.  The seller packaged the product securely and mailed it promptly.</li>
            <li> I have used young living oils. Before they work great I would recommend them to other people to use.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite oils.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Young Living, Stress Away oil...  This is a great product at a better than average price, what more could I want???</li>
            <li> A new fan of essential oils</li>
            <li> this is not real young living oils, this has been watered down! do not buy this could be dangerous to your health.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to order YL EO on amazon for fear of tampering, but the bottle was sealed and not opened! I&#x27;m so happy that I got this at a cheaper price :)</li>
            <li> My bottle looked sealed, but before I opened it I could smell the nasty stench that was inside.  I should have thrown it away right then, but I gave it a chance and opened it.  It smelled like furniture polish...no, it didn&#x27;t even smell that good.  I thought surely I was missing something, surely they&#x27;re not actually selling the liquid in this bottle that smells so bad.  So I gave it yet another chance and put it in an oil warmer, thinking it would magically change into some fabulous smell with a little heat to it.  It didn&#x27;t smell at all!&lt;br /&gt;I also bought Peace and Calming and it was even worse.  I can see getting one bottle of oil that is tainted and foul, but two??  And they came from two different vendors.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t blame Amazon for this, I&#x27;ve had great luck with everything else I&#x27;ve bought through Amazon, everything.  But I&#x27;m through buying oils.</li>
            <li> came and used as expected</li>
            <li> Me nor my boyfriend are fans of the scent of this one. Won&#x27;t be purchasing again. Has almost a sweet musky smell.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this..At first i did not but now it is so nice..I roll it on the back of my neck and down to my shoulders , even on my pulse points.</li>
            <li> Love Young Living oils!</li>
            <li> Anything by Young Living is good!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite EOs. I love to diffuse this in my office</li>
            <li> It is obvious this seller is breaking up starter kits and selling the oils individually! Awful! You can&#x27;t guarantee you&#x27;ll get Young Living oils this way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Young Living are really good quality essential oils! However, a better deal to buy this collection would be to purchase what is called the Premium Starter Kit. The Premium Starter Kit (price: $150) includes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Everyday Oils collection (original price: $163)-(Keep in mind that the original price of this one thing is more than you will be paying for the Premium Starter Kit that includes this and more than this!!!) Includes 10 Essential Oils:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Singles&lt;br /&gt;1 - 5 ml Frankincense&lt;br /&gt;1 - 5 ml Lemon&lt;br /&gt;1 - 5 ml Lavender&lt;br /&gt;1 - 5 ml Tea Tree&lt;br /&gt;1 - 5 ml Peppermint&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blends&lt;br /&gt;1 - 5 ml Joy&lt;br /&gt;1 - 5 ml Purification&lt;br /&gt;1 - 5 ml PanAway&lt;br /&gt;1 - 5 ml Thieves&lt;br /&gt;1 - 5 ml Stress Away&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Home Diffuser (original price: $98)-(Yours, practically free in the eyes of the PSK!)&lt;br /&gt;-Loads of info about the oils and how to use them!&lt;br /&gt;(Examples: Welcome to Young Living booklet, Essential Oils at a Glance user&#x27;s guide, Product Guide and Product Price List) -Distributor Info (Distributor Resource Guide, S.E.E.D. Sharing for Success booklet, Sample Packet Business Cards, Distributor Agreement)-This is just info that is provided in every PSK.&lt;br /&gt;-Bonus Oil! Citrus Fresh 5-ml&lt;br /&gt;-Plus! AromaGlide Roller Fitment, two Lavender Sample Packets, two Peppermint Sample Packets, two Peace &amp; Calming Sample Packets, two Lemon Sample Packets, two Thieves Sample Packets, two NingXia Red 2-oz. samples).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything in the Premium Starter Kit is valued at over $300 and you could get it all for only $150! Please don&#x27;t buy through Amazon. This would be wasting money as you would not get a good deal on your oils. Also, on top of that, buying the Premium Starter through your distributor gives you an automatic 24% off discount for everything else you ever buy from Young Living!(Amazon not included). It&#x27;s a really good business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re interested in Young Living Essential Oils, then find a distributor that you know or email me briessentially@gmail.com and I can help you further! Please put &amp;#34;Young Living Oils&amp;#34; in the subject line. Thank you! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what type of magic they use to make this stuff but I&#x27;ve been sleeping like a baby since I started using it on my big toe and the soles of my feet!</li>
            <li> Nice oil, calming scent.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love young living products!  Essential oils have been really helpful in calming me down.  Thank you!</li>
