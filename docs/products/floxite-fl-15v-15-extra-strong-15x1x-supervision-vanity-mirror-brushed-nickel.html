            <li>Nice but not 15x.</li>
            <li>&amp; I am thrilled with it...</li>

            <li>I asked for a lighted 15X magnifying mirror and this was my own fault -</li>
            <li>nice  </li>
            <li>I exchanged it for a 10x mirror that works perfectly for me; tipping the mirror back allows it to fix very nicely.  </li>
            <li>This mirror is excellent as I am getting older and cannot see like I used to.</li>
            <li>For super, up close viewing it works great.  </li>
            <li>but I though strong was good.</li>
            <li>The 15x is very strong.  </li>
            <li>Makes using it very easy.</li>

            <li>Shockingly strong!  </li>
            <li>The size is great, so it is nice to have a large mirror, which is why I didn&#x27;t return</li>
            <li>excellent mirror and 15x magnification is great with little distortion</li>
            <li>The exchange and return went very smoothly.</li>
            <li>This mirror looks nice and has a strong magnification - which I need.  </li>

            <li>I love this mirror.  </li>
            <li>I use the Floxite smaller portable mirrors and love them, but wanted something on a stand and this fits the bill perfectly.  </li>
            <li>What more could I want?</li>
            <li>The 15x magnification is perfect for seeing all those tiny eyebrow hairs, etc.  </li>
            <li>I love this mirror.  </li>
            <li>i really love it.</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s okay...</li>
            <li>Lovely mirror ...</li>
            <li>However the magnifier is just OK</li>
            <li>AND I THOUGHT I&#x27;D BE ABLE TO SEE BETTER</li>

            <li>Sure makes doing my makeup and tweezing the eyebrows a lot easier.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad we bought it.</li>
            <li>I love this mirror.  </li>
            <li>My mom has really enjoyed it.  </li>
            <li>I got this because I wanted to have a better skin care routine and needed it to better apply my makeup and groom my eyebrows.&lt;br</li>

            <li>When your eyesight starts to go, you will love it, too.</li>
            <li>I needed more magnification for applying makeup and tweezing eyebrow strays.  </li>
            <li>understand that the more you magnify, the more the distortion...</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping , I use it every morning, It works great for putting on my make up when you need glasses just to see your face.</li>
            <li>Just wasn&#x27;t working any more- love</li>

            <li>Station this in a nice bright room or take it near a window, and you won&#x27;t miss anything on your face!  </li>
            <li>The normal side is great, too.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty, though, and looks good on the counter.  </li>
            <li>It is not ego friendly when looking at your flaws, as you will see all of them!  </li>
            <li>This is the first magnifying mirror that I have found that is perfect for my old eyes!</li>
            <li>It is tall enough and the magnification is very good.  </li>
            <li>great magnification - a little heavier then most mirrors of this type, but good value</li>
            <li>Amazing mirror,well worth the money</li>
            <li>Great magnification, clear mirror.</li>
            <li>10x is available everywhere, but I needed greater magnification</li>
            <li>I recommend Floxite mirrors to anyone who wants good quality.</li>
            <li>arrived quickly,  very well made and good quality</li>
            <li>so it isn&#x27;t easily tipped over.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to see the finest details.  </li>
            <li>I have inward growing eyelashes and with the enlargement, I can pluck out them out easily to relieve the irritation to my cornea.</li>
            <li>Since it stands by itself, it is easy to position.  </li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t tip over easily.</li>
            <li>so it will not tip and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>Easy to see to pluck eyebrows without wearing reading glasses.  </li>
            <li>wear reading glasses and thought the 15x would make it easy to see everything</li>
            <li>WAY too strong.</li>
            <li>well built, nice big mirror, and good magnification.</li>
            <li>Really strong magnification.</li>
            <li>I recommend it,it&#x27;s a strong 15x.</li>
            <li>I did not know that 15X would be that strong.  </li>
            <li>The Floxite FI-15v 15xtra Strong Supervision Vanity Mirror was just as advertised.  </li>
            <li>strong one would be just the thing!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s right, while you can pay more for a table mirror, it won&#x27;t offer more than the floxite 15X mirror period.</li>
            <li>The product arrived on time and in perfect condition; it is hard to find a 15 magnification mirror; this one is a solid construction and is perfect for my needs; it fits on my closet shelves and in the cabinet under the sink.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;The dissapointment is in the fact that the 15X side is greatly distorted and barely useable.</li>
            <li>For most general purpose use you are probably better off with 7x or 10x but for cases when you want higher magnification this mirror is great.  </li>
            <li>This mirror is quite sturdy, pretty to look at, and really does a great job of magnification.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this for my wife, she wanted one without a light but easy to see.  </li>
            <li>As I have gotten older, applying makeup has become more &amp; more challenging...</li>
            <li>There are very few resources for 15x mirrors, this was a good price a great viewing area.</li>
            <li>Sturdy, very pretty even better than I had imagined.</li>
            <li>The standard magnification side is fine, and the mirror is attractive.</li>
            <li>I like it, but wish it would of had a light.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t like the ones with light causes shadows.</li>
            <li>It was satisfactory although in hindsight, we should have gotten one with a light.</li>
            <li>I use a task light desk lamp with it so, that I have plenty of light to see.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product could not manage without it  once you&#x27;ve  seen your face</li>
            <li>However, it was too tall to fit under the cabinet over my bathroom sink.  </li>
            <li>Great for applying makeup and checking different skin areas.</li>
            <li>is great for doing that along with the regular to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This mirror is perfect for us who have trouble seeing as well as we use to.&lt;br /&gt;It is sturdy and well made.</li>
            <li>I did not want a makeup mirror with a light.  </li>
            <li>nice product and came fast</li>
            <li>Nice finish.&lt;br /&gt;15 times way too much.  </li>
            <li>to sum it up, this mirror is a great bang for the buck and like all mirrors, it&#x27;ll last you a lifetime with care.</li>
            <li>And, both hands are free.</li>
            <li>I just wish it had a light.</li>
            <li>Would fit into any décor.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic mirror.</li>
            <li>and I prefer not to have to a light for the mirror.</li>
            <li>Liked it so much</li>
            <li>I thought I could see before, but this mirror is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I love this just the right mirror</li>
            <li>This mirror is great and provides more than ample magnification for putting on make-up and a host of other things.</li>
            <li>very powerful - unique use</li>
            <li>Great I can see with out my glasses easy to put my make up on just what I expected</li>
            <li>Instead, I purchased a small traveling standing magnifying mirror at Amazon which worked perfectly and also put a magnifying mirror (10X) with suction cups on my bathroom mirror.</li>
            <li>It is pretty and stylish.</li>
            <li>, it was really rough and may have not done a good job fitting it.</li>
            <li>I just get nervous every time I clean the mirror</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the right size and doesn&#x27;t tip easily.  </li>
            <li>I was Super excited when I received the package.</li>
            <li>At any rate, it is very helpful when I apply mascara, and I am glad to have it.</li>
            <li>Good quality for the price especially.</li>
            <li>so maybe I don&#x27;t know the full benefits of having a 15x strength.</li>
            <li>You have to move very close to the mirror surface, almost touching it, to see anything, which defies the purpose.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use it where I wanted to, but it&#x27;s such a good mirror</li>
            <li>15X is the sweet spot and does the trick.</li>
            <li>She absolutely, and immediately, fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>A true winner product that I would purchase again and again.</li>
            <li>but it really is overkill for most jobs.&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li>Good solid product.</li>
            <li>The magnification is wonderful and it does get a little fuzzier at the edges, but the glass surface is so large it doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li>This is seriously the best mirror ever.  </li>
            <li>Several have mentioned problems with this mirror, but the one I received is in great condition and very well made.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick and the product met and exceeded my wifes expectations{birthday gift}</li>
            <li>The 15 X is super.</li>
            <li>Met expectations and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Came on time and in adequate packaging.</li>
            <li>This is adequate for eyebrow tweezing.</li>
            <li>i love this mirror, has a big enough surface area, and great magnification</li>
            <li>This is a very powerful mirror, makes makeup application, plucking, etc, SO VERY MUCH EASIER for those who require reading glasses.  </li>
            <li>my wife loved it, larger than expected (good thing), delivered on time.</li>
            <li>This a large beautiful mirror, the magnifying side will require practice, but I certainly can see without my glasses my facial features.</li>
            <li>but it is so strong I lose perspective of my whole face.</li>
            <li>I can still use it, but it ain&#x27;t pretty!</li>
            <li>Very clear image makes it much easier to apply makeup, also nice looking piece on my makeup table.</li>
            <li>It has the right magnification for mildly sight impaired people.</li>
            <li>I truly wish this mirror, or one nearly as large, was available in a hand mirror.  </li>
            <li>I realized that, to get that amount of magnification, it would have to be a little distorted, but it would be wonderful if I didn&#x27;t have to hold it so close to get a clear view.  </li>
            <li>Probably better to spend a little more and get a light up one but</li>
            <li>Mirror is heavy but otherwisse great</li>
            <li>I would recommend this item to anyone interested in viewing their true idenity...</li>
            <li>so I rarely use it.  </li>
            <li>but well worth the money</li>
            <li>The 1x is so clear I love it.  </li>
            <li>THE ONE I HAVE HOME IS JUST AS GOOD, NOT MUCH DIFFERENCE IN THE VISION</li>
            <li>you want the honest truth of what your skin looks like, you definitely want to get this mirror.</li>
            <li>I will probably by another so that she has a backup/travel mirror of the same kind.</li>
            <li>Liked the brushed finish and that it is 15X.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a HUGE hit at my office, which is full of women, you can see very clear nd on the magnified side</li>
            <li>Super fast service!</li>
            <li>would be wise to start with a lesser power first and really listen to what the reviews say.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right mirror for my aging eyes.  </li>
            <li>You have to get right in close to use.  </li>
            <li>The size, weight, and stand are just right too.</li>
            <li>Just be aware that while itr&#x27;s a great product, it does not light up</li>
            <li>This is a very attractive mirror that would fit in any expensive bathroom/makeup room and even looks good in our humble bathroom.</li>
            <li>This extra strong magnification was a bit strong at first</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use it in the sun, it will cause a burn if you are not careful :)  </li>
            <li>no sweet spot, it magnifies beautifully, light weight, looks nice sitting on the vanity.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely extra strong!</li>
            <li>The magnified side can look a bit distorted if you don&#x27;t look at it from exactly the right angle-pretty site that&#x27;s thpical of a magnification mirror.</li>
            <li>exactly the right height to sit on my window sill for &amp;#34;close up&amp;#34; makeup application.</li>
            <li>Large mirror off kilt!</li>
            <li>More useful than the smaller pocket sized magnifying mirrors</li>
            <li>This mirror is great for people who have a hard time seeing.</li>
            <li>The mirror was exactly what was stated.</li>
            <li>Love the double side of the mirrors.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Came exactly how and when it was supposed to.</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my mother and it was exactly what she wanted -</li>
            <li>The only thing that would make this mirror better would be if it had a lighted face.</li>
            <li>It is only minor and the 15X magnification is great.</li>
            <li>Only thing that would make it even better: lighting around the diameter.</li>
            <li>I love it because it&#x27;s pretty and the brushed nickle finish fits my bathroom fixture decor.  </li>
            <li>, this is my first mirror like this</li>
            <li>love this mirror with it you can see every tiny detail .</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t aware of how magnifed I&#x27;d be when I look in the mirror.</li>
            <li>I wanted something simple in design and not flashy or elaborate, which it fits that criteria.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and being used every day.</li>
            <li>This mirror is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Able to get back to plucking my eyebrows every morning.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>This is a good sized, heavy duty vanity mirror.</li>
            <li>I have to stand up and look down in it if I really want a good look.  </li>
            <li>The size is fantastic and the magnification in a larger size is very user friendly.  </li>
            <li>This is so strong I need to be right next to it to use it.</li>
            <li>It is very high quality and a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>However, what I wanted was to be able to see tiny hairs and imperfections on my face and this mirror accommodates that very well.</li>
            <li>If in 2 sided hand mirror, with a hole at the end of the handle, it could be hung from hook, or near anything if a loop of string or ribbon was later added, which would also be handy for travel.  </li>
            <li>will definitely buy more Floxite products because the quality of this one seems really good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;She is now able to apply her eye makeup without the use of her glasses and cannot give it high enough praise.</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy, high quality, and well worth the price paid.</li>
            <li>and my magnified mirror isn&#x27;t strong enough.</li>
            <li>only 3 stars because it was too strong a magnification for me.</li>
            <li>I had read a review that said there is such a thing as too strong</li>
            <li>Looks smart in bathroom.</li>
            <li>Large but not unattractive.</li>
            <li>My first one broke due to an accident, I was glad I could find this one again.</li>
            <li>and the 15X side is 7\\&quot; in diameter and those large sizes makes any kind of facial work a breeze since it allows you to view your&lt;br /&gt;entire face at once unlike those smaller size mirrors.</li>
            <li>It is great quality and heavy enough</li>
            <li>I like it, but it is very tall</li>
            <li>He really likes it.</li>
            <li>I started purchasing Floxite mirrors on QVC and was very impresses with their quality and reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>but I really like the 15x</li>
            <li>Got this for my mom, her eyesight isnt what it used to be, and this mirror really helps out with applying makeup and things of the like.</li>
            <li>Thanks a needed item for those who no longer see the world magnified.</li>
            <li>so you can really put makeup on spotlessly.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>find it very usefullto</li>
            <li>this clearly you will realize how useful it is</li>
            <li>very magnified.</li>
            <li>I really like this mirror.  </li>
            <li>very strong,takes awhile to get use too.large mirror.</li>
            <li>but this is reasonable priced</li>
            <li>My wife absolutely loves this mirror.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really use it.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Product is better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>When I look in it, I can see so much on my skin that you can never see in a commonplace magnifier mirror.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really do that well with this mirror.  </li>
            <li>and is weighted and very stable</li>
            <li>Grooming tasks are easier and quickly accomplished.</li>
            <li>115 strength is too much, should have bought the 100 strength</li>
            <li>It is too much.</li>
            <li>Fortunately this arrived a day later.</li>
            <li>You really need this if you wear glasses and want to apply make-up with wearing your glasses.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I really need to get another one for my sister-in-law.</li>
            <li>Nice and heavy</li>
            <li>with high quality tweezers makes facial hair plucking fast and easy thanks to it&#x27;s tilting head.</li>
            <li>Mirror is crystal clear and the Magnification is just right.  </li>
            <li>This mirror stays exactly where you position it &amp; has 15x magnification, so you can see your eyebrows very clearly.</li>
            <li>I have had other 15x mirrors and can say this one is just okay.  </li>
            <li>The mirror is large and seems well made, but to see clearly in the 15X side, you have to get VERY close to the mirror.  </li>
            <li>I bought it to use for everyday make-up application, but it is a bit strong for that, so I am still using my 5X mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But!</li>
            <li>And it has a classic appearance that adds to the room.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The high magnification and clarity of this mirror is A+</li>
            <li>I also wanted high magnification.  </li>
            <li>If you want really high magnification this one will do the trick.  </li>
            <li>High magnification makes you not want to look into it.</li>
            <li>I like the high magnifying lens on it to see everything.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li>the lens are high quality.</li>
            <li>It does not seem to be a high quality mirror or stand.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this mirror.. for those of us who are needing help to see to do your make-up or eyebrows..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only do I recommend this mirror, I will be buying two more for my nieces in the very near future.</li>
            <li>I can see much more with my little 12 times from walmart</li>
            <li>the powerful clear 15X side really magnifies all facial hairs including the throat and&lt;br /&gt;used</li>
            <li>I love it, I use it everyday</li>
            <li>It set on a nice base and is sturdy, great looking, and the size is big</li>
            <li>heavy metal, mirrors are appropriate, 15x/1x.</li>
            <li>I use the 15X side for the perfecting of my makeup, plucking hairs, eye makeup, and the normal side to view the finished look.</li>
            <li>This magnification is not readily available in most stores.  </li>
            <li>I think as long as I take good care of it it should last for a long time.</li>
            <li>is somewhat heavy; quality is great, should last a long time--only disadvatage is it doesn&#x27;t fold up to put away or travel with</li>
            <li>(I ordered new, though it appears used?</li>
            <li>It got here promptly, but I am not going to use it until I get moved into a new home.</li>
            <li>Heavy enough to stand on its own.</li>
            <li>I returned it to obtain a less strong magnification.</li>
            <li>very clear</li>
            <li>So I love that I can see those fine hairs so easily...yet hate that I can see those fine wrinkles so clearly also.  </li>
            <li>I can see clearly every eyebrow hair that needs to be plucked!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get old!  </li>
            <li>I can usually get a better deal on Amazon--free shipping.  </li>
            <li>Much more nicer and bigger than I expected!</li>
            <li>Stylish with a 15 magnification on one side and regular on the other.  </li>
            <li>Hard to find without a light which was what was requested.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks much!</li>
            <li>The 15x is a bit hard to see in, I think a 5x would be better however</li>
            <li>Get a clear image, without distortions.</li>
            <li>,that is perfectly clear.</li>
            <li>This is a terrific mirror for applying makeup, though you may not always be happy with what you see (sadly).</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re looking close up, about a six inch circle is clear.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re trying to remove an ingrown hair or something from your neck, the image isn&#x27;t clear.</li>
            <li>how far I moved away from the mirror.  </li>
            <li>Compares very favorably to similar mirrors that sell for twice the price at Ulta, etc.</li>
            <li>Very well built and sturdy - its only fault is it&#x27;s not extendable</li>
            <li>I have to get real close to it to get the mag side to focus properly for me to see.  </li>
            <li>I think that it distorts as you can only use it when you stand very close .</li>
            <li>but it takes care of all your needs as far as seeing the details on your face.</li>
            <li>Really needed the extra power in mag.</li>
            <li>What I like best about this magnifying mirror is the height and sturdiness of the base.</li>
            <li>you can literally see inside every single poor and every single hair follicle you have lmao!!</li>
            <li>Thank you for sending me the mirror, I was expecting it more clear, may be it little small, next time I will try to find larger diameter or may be 20x will be better.</li>
            <li>This mirror is sturdy, takes up little space, and is user friendly.  </li>
            <li>The quality of the Floxite mirrors in general and, specifically this one, definitely live up to my expectations.  </li>
            <li>One side is regular mirror and the other side is a good magnification to see small things, especially when you get older and can&#x27;t see well!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to see those little hairs for a long time.</li>
            <li>The stand is heavy enough to prevent knocking it over easily.</li>
            <li>It is a solidly built mirror, large enough to show the area of your face that you need to look at.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s large enough to see your entire face, hair and neck.</li>
            <li>Scored some major points with the Mrs. on this surprise purchase.</li>
            <li>I went to several places locally and could not find this high of a magnifying mirror in this size.</li>
            <li>great mirror for those getting bad eye sight.</li>
            <li>Purchased this because of the 15x magnification, however it is not as clear as a smaller mirror I have.  </li>
            <li>no regrets</li>
            <li>Was also pleasantly surprised at how tall it is, can use it to see the back of my head.&lt;br /&gt;Thrilled!!</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to bend over so much like I did with my other one that broke.  </li>
            <li>Yes, the price is a little higher than others but you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li>One side is a regular mirror and the magnified side shows EVERY hair on my face (that is good and bad at the same time</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love everything about this mirror!  </li>

            <li> A really nice size magnifying mirror.  </li>
            <li> Nice but not 15x.</li>
            <li> &amp; I am thrilled with it...</li>
            <li> I deft.</li>
            <li> Nice</li>

            <li> and the brass stand looks nice and&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife really liked this as she asked for one as a gift.</li>
            <li> It looks nice sitting on the counter as well.  </li>
            <li> I asked for a lighted 15X magnifying mirror and this was my own fault -</li>
            <li> nice  </li>
            <li> I exchanged it for a 10x mirror that works perfectly for me; tipping the mirror back allows it to fix very nicely.  </li>
            <li> This mirror is excellent as I am getting older and cannot see like I used to.</li>
            <li> For super, up close viewing it works great.  </li>
            <li> but I though strong was good.</li>
            <li> The 15x is very strong.  </li>
            <li> Makes using it very easy.</li>
            <li> Nice large mirror, the stand is sturdy and has a beautiful finish.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic magnification and a good price.</li>
            <li> I have to take this from the bathroom into another room to get good light.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the best vanity mirrors I have ever seen or used.  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love this mirror!</li>
            <li> Shockingly strong!  </li>
            <li> The size is great, so it is nice to have a large mirror, which is why I didn&#x27;t return</li>
            <li> excellent mirror and 15x magnification is great with little distortion</li>
            <li> The exchange and return went very smoothly.</li>
            <li> This mirror looks nice and has a strong magnification - which I need.  </li>
            <li> Mirror is quite large but it does do a great job of magnifying.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s big, but wonderful!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t LOVE it though.  </li>
            <li> I love the weight of it, and the 1X side.  </li>

            <li> I love the magnification</li>
            <li> If lighted it would be outstanding</li>
            <li> Glad to have found it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror.  </li>
            <li> I use the Floxite smaller portable mirrors and love them, but wanted something on a stand and this fits the bill perfectly.  </li>
            <li> What more could I want?</li>
            <li> The 15x magnification is perfect for seeing all those tiny eyebrow hairs, etc.  </li>

            <li> i really love it.</li>

            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay...</li>
            <li> Lovely mirror ...</li>
            <li> However the magnifier is just OK</li>
            <li> AND I THOUGHT I&#x27;D BE ABLE TO SEE BETTER</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Sure makes doing my makeup and tweezing the eyebrows a lot easier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad we bought it.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror.  </li>
            <li> My mom has really enjoyed it.  </li>
            <li> I got this because I wanted to have a better skin care routine and needed it to better apply my makeup and groom my eyebrows.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> any time I need to be able to see something closely, like a spot, blemish, hair, it is always the mirror</li>
            <li> Who could ask for anything more?</li>
            <li> Have seen many magnification mirrors but this one takes the cake.</li>
            <li> I love mine</li>
            <li> I was glad I purchased this mirror.</li>
            <li> but could use a nicer quality for better resolution.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this mirror.</li>
            <li> Well made, we are glad we bought this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;No point in having to spend more money than you have to.</li>
            <li> When your eyesight starts to go, you will love it, too.</li>
            <li> I needed more magnification for applying makeup and tweezing eyebrow strays.  </li>
            <li> understand that the more you magnify, the more the distortion...</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping , I use it every morning, It works great for putting on my make up when you need glasses just to see your face.</li>
            <li> Just wasn&#x27;t working any more- love</li>
            <li> I really like this mirror and thought it was a great deal at the price.  </li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> It would have been better if it had been lighted.</li>
            <li> This mirror is wonderful especially for those  of us who have diminished eyesight as we age.</li>
            <li> I simply love everything about it.</li>
            <li> My eyes are not terrible, but even using a 10x mirror I needed to have my glasses on!  </li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I rate this item right up there, if you have eyes that aren&#x27;t so good</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my mirror great product  for people with low vision .I</li>
            <li> It is very stylish and heavy and has made her very happy that the 15x side of the mirror magnifies fantastically.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight, and the 15x magnify is great for older women who want to put on their makeup without using their glasses.  </li>
            <li> Station this in a nice bright room or take it near a window, and you won&#x27;t miss anything on your face!  </li>
            <li> The normal side is great, too.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty, though, and looks good on the counter.  </li>
            <li> It is not ego friendly when looking at your flaws, as you will see all of them!  </li>
            <li> This is the first magnifying mirror that I have found that is perfect for my old eyes!</li>
            <li> It is tall enough and the magnification is very good.  </li>
            <li> great magnification - a little heavier then most mirrors of this type, but good value</li>
            <li> Amazing mirror,well worth the money</li>
            <li> Great magnification, clear mirror.</li>
            <li> 10x is available everywhere, but I needed greater magnification</li>
            <li> I recommend Floxite mirrors to anyone who wants good quality.</li>
            <li> arrived quickly,  very well made and good quality</li>
            <li> so it isn&#x27;t easily tipped over.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to see the finest details.  </li>
            <li> I have inward growing eyelashes and with the enlargement, I can pluck out them out easily to relieve the irritation to my cornea.</li>
            <li> Since it stands by itself, it is easy to position.  </li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t tip over easily.</li>
            <li> so it will not tip and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Easy to see to pluck eyebrows without wearing reading glasses.  </li>
            <li> wear reading glasses and thought the 15x would make it easy to see everything</li>
            <li> WAY too strong.</li>
            <li> well built, nice big mirror, and good magnification.</li>
            <li> Really strong magnification.</li>
            <li> I recommend it,it&#x27;s a strong 15x.</li>
            <li> I did not know that 15X would be that strong.  </li>
            <li> The Floxite FI-15v 15xtra Strong Supervision Vanity Mirror was just as advertised.  </li>
            <li> strong one would be just the thing!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s right, while you can pay more for a table mirror, it won&#x27;t offer more than the floxite 15X mirror period.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and in perfect condition; it is hard to find a 15 magnification mirror; this one is a solid construction and is perfect for my needs; it fits on my closet shelves and in the cabinet under the sink.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;The dissapointment is in the fact that the 15X side is greatly distorted and barely useable.</li>
            <li> For most general purpose use you are probably better off with 7x or 10x but for cases when you want higher magnification this mirror is great.  </li>
            <li> This mirror is quite sturdy, pretty to look at, and really does a great job of magnification.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife, she wanted one without a light but easy to see.  </li>
            <li> As I have gotten older, applying makeup has become more &amp; more challenging...</li>
            <li> There are very few resources for 15x mirrors, this was a good price a great viewing area.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, very pretty even better than I had imagined.</li>
            <li> The standard magnification side is fine, and the mirror is attractive.</li>
            <li> I like it, but wish it would of had a light.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the ones with light causes shadows.</li>
            <li> It was satisfactory although in hindsight, we should have gotten one with a light.</li>
            <li> I use a task light desk lamp with it so, that I have plenty of light to see.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product could not manage without it  once you&#x27;ve  seen your face</li>
            <li> However, it was too tall to fit under the cabinet over my bathroom sink.  </li>
            <li> Great for applying makeup and checking different skin areas.</li>
            <li> is great for doing that along with the regular to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This mirror is perfect for us who have trouble seeing as well as we use to.&lt;br /&gt;It is sturdy and well made.</li>
            <li> I did not want a makeup mirror with a light.  </li>
            <li> nice product and came fast</li>
            <li> Nice finish.&lt;br /&gt;15 times way too much.  </li>
            <li> to sum it up, this mirror is a great bang for the buck and like all mirrors, it&#x27;ll last you a lifetime with care.</li>
            <li> And, both hands are free.</li>
            <li> I just wish it had a light.</li>
            <li> Would fit into any décor.</li>
            <li> Fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic mirror.</li>
            <li> and I prefer not to have to a light for the mirror.</li>
            <li> Liked it so much</li>
            <li> I thought I could see before, but this mirror is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I love this just the right mirror</li>
            <li> This mirror is great and provides more than ample magnification for putting on make-up and a host of other things.</li>
            <li> very powerful - unique use</li>
            <li> Great I can see with out my glasses easy to put my make up on just what I expected</li>
            <li> Instead, I purchased a small traveling standing magnifying mirror at Amazon which worked perfectly and also put a magnifying mirror (10X) with suction cups on my bathroom mirror.</li>
            <li> It is pretty and stylish.</li>
            <li> , it was really rough and may have not done a good job fitting it.</li>
            <li> I just get nervous every time I clean the mirror</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the right size and doesn&#x27;t tip easily.  </li>
            <li> I was Super excited when I received the package.</li>
            <li> At any rate, it is very helpful when I apply mascara, and I am glad to have it.</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price especially.</li>
            <li> so maybe I don&#x27;t know the full benefits of having a 15x strength.</li>
            <li> You have to move very close to the mirror surface, almost touching it, to see anything, which defies the purpose.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use it where I wanted to, but it&#x27;s such a good mirror</li>
            <li> 15X is the sweet spot and does the trick.</li>
            <li> She absolutely, and immediately, fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> A true winner product that I would purchase again and again.</li>
            <li> but it really is overkill for most jobs.&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li> Good solid product.</li>
            <li> The magnification is wonderful and it does get a little fuzzier at the edges, but the glass surface is so large it doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best mirror ever.  </li>
            <li> Several have mentioned problems with this mirror, but the one I received is in great condition and very well made.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick and the product met and exceeded my wifes expectations{birthday gift}</li>
            <li> The 15 X is super.</li>
            <li> Met expectations and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Came on time and in adequate packaging.</li>
            <li> This is adequate for eyebrow tweezing.</li>
            <li> i love this mirror, has a big enough surface area, and great magnification</li>
            <li> This is a very powerful mirror, makes makeup application, plucking, etc, SO VERY MUCH EASIER for those who require reading glasses.  </li>
            <li> my wife loved it, larger than expected (good thing), delivered on time.</li>
            <li> This a large beautiful mirror, the magnifying side will require practice, but I certainly can see without my glasses my facial features.</li>
            <li> but it is so strong I lose perspective of my whole face.</li>
            <li> I can still use it, but it ain&#x27;t pretty!</li>
            <li> Very clear image makes it much easier to apply makeup, also nice looking piece on my makeup table.</li>
            <li> It has the right magnification for mildly sight impaired people.</li>
            <li> I truly wish this mirror, or one nearly as large, was available in a hand mirror.  </li>
            <li> I realized that, to get that amount of magnification, it would have to be a little distorted, but it would be wonderful if I didn&#x27;t have to hold it so close to get a clear view.  </li>
            <li> Probably better to spend a little more and get a light up one but</li>
            <li> Mirror is heavy but otherwisse great</li>
            <li> I would recommend this item to anyone interested in viewing their true idenity...</li>
            <li> so I rarely use it.  </li>
            <li> but well worth the money</li>
            <li> The 1x is so clear I love it.  </li>
            <li> THE ONE I HAVE HOME IS JUST AS GOOD, NOT MUCH DIFFERENCE IN THE VISION</li>
            <li> you want the honest truth of what your skin looks like, you definitely want to get this mirror.</li>
            <li> I will probably by another so that she has a backup/travel mirror of the same kind.</li>
            <li> Liked the brushed finish and that it is 15X.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a HUGE hit at my office, which is full of women, you can see very clear nd on the magnified side</li>
            <li> Super fast service!</li>
            <li> would be wise to start with a lesser power first and really listen to what the reviews say.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the right mirror for my aging eyes.  </li>
            <li> You have to get right in close to use.  </li>
            <li> The size, weight, and stand are just right too.</li>
            <li> Just be aware that while itr&#x27;s a great product, it does not light up</li>
            <li> This is a very attractive mirror that would fit in any expensive bathroom/makeup room and even looks good in our humble bathroom.</li>
            <li> This extra strong magnification was a bit strong at first</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use it in the sun, it will cause a burn if you are not careful :)  </li>
            <li> no sweet spot, it magnifies beautifully, light weight, looks nice sitting on the vanity.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely extra strong!</li>
            <li> The magnified side can look a bit distorted if you don&#x27;t look at it from exactly the right angle-pretty site that&#x27;s thpical of a magnification mirror.</li>
            <li> exactly the right height to sit on my window sill for &amp;#34;close up&amp;#34; makeup application.</li>
            <li> Large mirror off kilt!</li>
            <li> More useful than the smaller pocket sized magnifying mirrors</li>
            <li> This mirror is great for people who have a hard time seeing.</li>
            <li> The mirror was exactly what was stated.</li>
            <li> Love the double side of the mirrors.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Came exactly how and when it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my mother and it was exactly what she wanted -</li>
            <li> The only thing that would make this mirror better would be if it had a lighted face.</li>
            <li> It is only minor and the 15X magnification is great.</li>
            <li> Only thing that would make it even better: lighting around the diameter.</li>
            <li> I love it because it&#x27;s pretty and the brushed nickle finish fits my bathroom fixture decor.  </li>
            <li> , this is my first mirror like this</li>
            <li> love this mirror with it you can see every tiny detail .</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t aware of how magnifed I&#x27;d be when I look in the mirror.</li>
            <li> I wanted something simple in design and not flashy or elaborate, which it fits that criteria.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and being used every day.</li>
            <li> This mirror is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Able to get back to plucking my eyebrows every morning.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This is a good sized, heavy duty vanity mirror.</li>
            <li> I have to stand up and look down in it if I really want a good look.  </li>
            <li> The size is fantastic and the magnification in a larger size is very user friendly.  </li>
            <li> This is so strong I need to be right next to it to use it.</li>
            <li> It is very high quality and a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> However, what I wanted was to be able to see tiny hairs and imperfections on my face and this mirror accommodates that very well.</li>
            <li> If in 2 sided hand mirror, with a hole at the end of the handle, it could be hung from hook, or near anything if a loop of string or ribbon was later added, which would also be handy for travel.  </li>
            <li> will definitely buy more Floxite products because the quality of this one seems really good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;She is now able to apply her eye makeup without the use of her glasses and cannot give it high enough praise.</li>
            <li> It is very sturdy, high quality, and well worth the price paid.</li>
            <li> and my magnified mirror isn&#x27;t strong enough.</li>
            <li> only 3 stars because it was too strong a magnification for me.</li>
            <li> I had read a review that said there is such a thing as too strong</li>
            <li> Looks smart in bathroom.</li>
            <li> Large but not unattractive.</li>
            <li> My first one broke due to an accident, I was glad I could find this one again.</li>
            <li> and the 15X side is 7\\&quot; in diameter and those large sizes makes any kind of facial work a breeze since it allows you to view your&lt;br /&gt;entire face at once unlike those smaller size mirrors.</li>
            <li> It is great quality and heavy enough</li>
            <li> I like it, but it is very tall</li>
            <li> He really likes it.</li>
            <li> I started purchasing Floxite mirrors on QVC and was very impresses with their quality and reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> but I really like the 15x</li>
            <li> Got this for my mom, her eyesight isnt what it used to be, and this mirror really helps out with applying makeup and things of the like.</li>
            <li> Thanks a needed item for those who no longer see the world magnified.</li>
            <li> so you can really put makeup on spotlessly.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery</li>
            <li> find it very usefullto</li>
            <li> this clearly you will realize how useful it is</li>
            <li> very magnified.</li>
            <li> I really like this mirror.  </li>
            <li> very strong,takes awhile to get use too.large mirror.</li>
            <li> but this is reasonable priced</li>
            <li> My wife absolutely loves this mirror.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really use it.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Product is better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> When I look in it, I can see so much on my skin that you can never see in a commonplace magnifier mirror.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really do that well with this mirror.  </li>
            <li> and is weighted and very stable</li>
            <li> Grooming tasks are easier and quickly accomplished.</li>
            <li> 115 strength is too much, should have bought the 100 strength</li>
            <li> It is too much.</li>
            <li> Fortunately this arrived a day later.</li>
            <li> You really need this if you wear glasses and want to apply make-up with wearing your glasses.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I really need to get another one for my sister-in-law.</li>
            <li> Nice and heavy</li>
            <li> with high quality tweezers makes facial hair plucking fast and easy thanks to it&#x27;s tilting head.</li>
            <li> Mirror is crystal clear and the Magnification is just right.  </li>
            <li> This mirror stays exactly where you position it &amp; has 15x magnification, so you can see your eyebrows very clearly.</li>
            <li> I have had other 15x mirrors and can say this one is just okay.  </li>
            <li> The mirror is large and seems well made, but to see clearly in the 15X side, you have to get VERY close to the mirror.  </li>
            <li> I bought it to use for everyday make-up application, but it is a bit strong for that, so I am still using my 5X mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But!</li>
            <li> And it has a classic appearance that adds to the room.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The high magnification and clarity of this mirror is A+</li>
            <li> I also wanted high magnification.  </li>
            <li> If you want really high magnification this one will do the trick.  </li>
            <li> High magnification makes you not want to look into it.</li>
            <li> I like the high magnifying lens on it to see everything.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> the lens are high quality.</li>
            <li> It does not seem to be a high quality mirror or stand.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this mirror.. for those of us who are needing help to see to do your make-up or eyebrows..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only do I recommend this mirror, I will be buying two more for my nieces in the very near future.</li>
            <li> I can see much more with my little 12 times from walmart</li>
            <li> the powerful clear 15X side really magnifies all facial hairs including the throat and&lt;br /&gt;used</li>
            <li> I love it, I use it everyday</li>
            <li> It set on a nice base and is sturdy, great looking, and the size is big</li>
            <li> heavy metal, mirrors are appropriate, 15x/1x.</li>
            <li> I use the 15X side for the perfecting of my makeup, plucking hairs, eye makeup, and the normal side to view the finished look.</li>
            <li> This magnification is not readily available in most stores.  </li>
            <li> I think as long as I take good care of it it should last for a long time.</li>
            <li> is somewhat heavy; quality is great, should last a long time--only disadvatage is it doesn&#x27;t fold up to put away or travel with</li>
            <li> (I ordered new, though it appears used?</li>
            <li> It got here promptly, but I am not going to use it until I get moved into a new home.</li>
            <li> Heavy enough to stand on its own.</li>
            <li> I returned it to obtain a less strong magnification.</li>
            <li> very clear</li>
            <li> So I love that I can see those fine hairs so easily...yet hate that I can see those fine wrinkles so clearly also.  </li>
            <li> I can see clearly every eyebrow hair that needs to be plucked!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get old!  </li>
            <li> I can usually get a better deal on Amazon--free shipping.  </li>
            <li> Much more nicer and bigger than I expected!</li>
            <li> Stylish with a 15 magnification on one side and regular on the other.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find without a light which was what was requested.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks much!</li>
            <li> The 15x is a bit hard to see in, I think a 5x would be better however</li>
            <li> Get a clear image, without distortions.</li>
            <li> ,that is perfectly clear.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific mirror for applying makeup, though you may not always be happy with what you see (sadly).</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re looking close up, about a six inch circle is clear.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re trying to remove an ingrown hair or something from your neck, the image isn&#x27;t clear.</li>
            <li> how far I moved away from the mirror.  </li>
            <li> Compares very favorably to similar mirrors that sell for twice the price at Ulta, etc.</li>
            <li> Very well built and sturdy - its only fault is it&#x27;s not extendable</li>
            <li> I have to get real close to it to get the mag side to focus properly for me to see.  </li>
            <li> I think that it distorts as you can only use it when you stand very close .</li>
            <li> but it takes care of all your needs as far as seeing the details on your face.</li>
            <li> Really needed the extra power in mag.</li>
            <li> What I like best about this magnifying mirror is the height and sturdiness of the base.</li>
            <li> you can literally see inside every single poor and every single hair follicle you have lmao!!</li>
            <li> Thank you for sending me the mirror, I was expecting it more clear, may be it little small, next time I will try to find larger diameter or may be 20x will be better.</li>
            <li> This mirror is sturdy, takes up little space, and is user friendly.  </li>
            <li> The quality of the Floxite mirrors in general and, specifically this one, definitely live up to my expectations.  </li>
            <li> One side is regular mirror and the other side is a good magnification to see small things, especially when you get older and can&#x27;t see well!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to see those little hairs for a long time.</li>
            <li> The stand is heavy enough to prevent knocking it over easily.</li>
            <li> It is a solidly built mirror, large enough to show the area of your face that you need to look at.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s large enough to see your entire face, hair and neck.</li>
            <li> Scored some major points with the Mrs. on this surprise purchase.</li>
            <li> I went to several places locally and could not find this high of a magnifying mirror in this size.</li>
            <li> great mirror for those getting bad eye sight.</li>
            <li> Purchased this because of the 15x magnification, however it is not as clear as a smaller mirror I have.  </li>
            <li> no regrets</li>
            <li> Was also pleasantly surprised at how tall it is, can use it to see the back of my head.&lt;br /&gt;Thrilled!!</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to bend over so much like I did with my other one that broke.  </li>
            <li> Yes, the price is a little higher than others but you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li> One side is a regular mirror and the magnified side shows EVERY hair on my face (that is good and bad at the same time</li>
            <li> This is a heavy duty mirror, much larger and powerful than I expected.</li>
            <li> The only drawback and one that I do not see changing due to the nature of magnification is that you need to be up close to the mirror to get a clear and undistorted view.</li>
            <li> Sturdy well made large mirror with very little distortion in 15 magnification mirror.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent for applying makeup as glasses are not required.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why I thought I&#x27;d need to see so much detail on my face</li>
            <li> you have no trouble finding a black head on your face.</li>
            <li> so it is not clear on the total surface, only in the center.</li>
            <li> One side is a regular mirror; the other side magnifies to the 15th power, making plucking eyebrows or facial hair a breeze.</li>
            <li> I can actually see the tiny hairs under my brow and other flaws now too.</li>
            <li> Have kept it too long to return.</li>
            <li> It has glue sticking out on the rim/edges and a strange sticky residue on the platform when it came in.</li>
            <li> Wish I would have gotten this a long time ago</li>
            <li> Why did i wait so long to buy one of these.  </li>
            <li> I should have done it long ago.  </li>
            <li> This product does what it promises, however, I do wish I had bought a lighted mirror, and as long as you&#x27;re going for magnification, why not buy a mirror with 20x power?  </li>
            <li> My only gripe, and it&#x27;s a small one, is that only you have to look directly at the center of the mirror to get it in focus.  </li>
            <li> How long has those been there?</li>
            <li> however there are very few choices when it comes to that high of magnification.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The magnification or the curved surface of this mirror creates a double image that is difficult to focus through to get a true reflection.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife who had been complaining about the mirror she was presently using (a left over from my previous marriage and which I used to shave neck hair).</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this for a number of years and could only find a few but with a price tag that I felt was a little high.  </li>
            <li> Not just a small section of the other side of the mirror, but the whole side is 15x.</li>
            <li> On the other side it is a regular mirror.</li>
            <li> You can see everything with this mirror on one side and the other is just a regular mirror.</li>
            <li> I like how it is standard on one side and up close on the other.</li>
            <li> This mirror was a great disappointment--the distortion is so bad that it&#x27;s hardly usable.  </li>
            <li> She stated that it was not powerful enough</li>
            <li> I also like the simple design and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t come with an integrated light, those lights are always useless and just a waste of space in my experience.</li>
            <li> Oh and if you guys find that the neck of the mirror seems wobbly or loose you can fix that by screwing in the platform.  </li>
            <li> and I find the stem a little short</li>
            <li> This does have a BIG magnification, BUT it is upside down!</li>
            <li> Bought two of these mirriors, one for my mother which has bad eyesight, and my wife who likes to look at her face up close, they both love this mirrior.</li>
            <li> the maginified mirror really helps me visually as I was having a difficult time puttong on my eye make or tweezing my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> The Mirror arrived on the date expected.</li>
            <li> This mirror works as expected.  </li>
            <li> Its easy-care finish polishes with a wet rag.</li>
            <li> the only problem is, it does not light up so my wife was diappointed with that aspect of it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s big and heavy, not for traveling.</li>
            <li> it gets harder to see</li>
            <li> I have purchased less expensive mirrors in the past that were way better quality</li>
            <li> My husband uses this mirror to pluck all the hairs he can&#x27;t see on his ears and other places on his face.</li>
            <li> I use the magnified side for my eyes and other side for the rest.</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror seconds before seeing it recommended on the YouTube channel Hot n Flashy.</li>
            <li> I sometimes close one eye to tweeze the other eye.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s magnified 15 times on one side and nothing on the other.  </li>
            <li> The other side is for everything else.</li>
            <li> I did not realize that the 15X magnification requires that you be extremely close to the mirror in order to see.</li>
            <li> I expect that I will need to replace this in a couple of years, due to its quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried talking her into this one, but she had her mind set on the other.</li>
            <li> I went ahead and bought the other one.....</li>
            <li> should have listened to the other reviewers that said 15x is too much!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is not fun.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps if you stand on your head you could see your skin pores, but the extra-large, sharp, magnification compounded by being upside down will give the hardest sailor sea-sickness in 3 seconds!</li>
            <li> I would suggest a slightly lower magnification as this one limits the scope of view to just about your nose and surrounding areas.</li>
            <li> Like the plain mirror on other side also.</li>
            <li> (And it&#x27;s already a shock to see a little bit of me at 15x!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife has had a long standing problem applying makeup due to poor eye sight until we purchased this mirror.</li>
            <li> It does NOT light up, however I do like the magnification.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy and sturdy.</li>
            <li> There is no warping, it is well made and heavy.</li>
            <li> I did open it to check and see if it was broken and it wasn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> The mirror is too heavy</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this item.  </li>
            <li> The mirror is heavy and therefore stable.</li>
            <li> Not exactly &#x27;right&#x27;!!</li>
            <li> it is small and looks like a bubble in the glass or it could be plastic area.  </li>
            <li> There is a small amount of distortion at the edges</li>
            <li> I do have 2 small 15x travel mirror, but they&#x27;re toooo small to see both eyes at once.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to see.  </li>
            <li> PERFECT.&lt;br /&gt;I am 74 and have a hard time putting on my makeup and the magnifying</li>
            <li> It is so hard to find 15x magnification (</li>
            <li> I have had the vanity mirror for at least a year and find it to be a quality product.</li>
            <li> But, at least it works.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any problems with the quality of the mirrors construction which others have complained about.  </li>
            <li> My one complaint is that it&#x27;s too tall and there is no way to shorten it.  </li>
            <li> The base fell out of the bottom after only a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> Arrived scratched and with poor visibility.</li>
            <li> The mirror arrived, packed well, and nothing broken.</li>
            <li> It helps with her poor eyesight for makeup application.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> I unfortunately broke mine.</li>
            <li> the base is heavy</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the one I received was defective.</li>
            <li> (scary)</li>
            <li> Very heavy duty base and stand.  </li>
            <li> It is scary sometimes what we see!  </li>
            <li> It was very disappointing and am sorry I purchased it.</li>
            <li> :-(  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed on this purchase.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are real expensive mirrors out there</li>
            <li> I will not be returning it but was a tad disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I FIND IT VERY AWKWARD TO USE&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE</li>
            <li> my vision is horrible and I hate using glasses with my mirror</li>
            <li> I have very bad eyesight</li>
            <li> MY EYES ARE VERY BAD</li>
            <li> After searching the stores and being very disappointed (I did not want to spend 80 dollars on a mirror)</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It is a good mirror, but unless you have good lighting to reflect off the mirror it&#x27;s hard to see.  I guess I would recommend a lighted mirror instead of this one.</li>
            <li> Perfect and Just as ordered.</li>
            <li> BETTER QUALITY THEN I WAS EXPECTING</li>
            <li> This mirror is wonderful.  It&#x27;s perfect in every way except for size.  It&#x27;s a bit too big for my area, but that&#x27;s my fault for not measuring.  I love that it is elevated so I don&#x27;t have to bend over so much like I did with my other one that broke.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I can finally see to pluck my eyebrows. The reflection is not distorted, and as an aging woman, I appreciate the 15 times magnification for putting in and removing my contact lenses. All of you ladies over 50 will love it for spotting those random stray chin and facial hairs. It is very sturdy, high quality, and well worth the price paid.</li>
            <li> The size is great, so it is nice to have a large mirror, which is why I didn&#x27;t return it.&lt;br /&gt;The dissapointment is in the fact that the 15X side is greatly distorted and barely useable.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this mirror! Now I can really see to get my mascara on PERFECTLY! Excellent in every way.</li>
            <li> I like it, but it is very tall and I am short.</li>
            <li> I purched these mirrors for help putting in contacts.  One of the mirrors has a defect on the mangnification side it is small and looks like a bubble in the glass or it could be plastic area.  I decided not to return the item as I had already tossed the packaging. For the price it is not the quality I thought it would be. I have purchased less expensive mirrors in the past that were way better quality</li>
            <li> It is as described.  Get a clear image, without distortions.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s big, but wonderful!</li>
            <li> I LIKE this mirror - I don&#x27;t LOVE it though.  It does NOT light up, however I do like the magnification. My main issue is that it fell off my counter, less than 3&#x27; and it bent the stem. I can still use it, but it ain&#x27;t pretty!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this makeup mirror I purchased from Amazon, The mirror has a magnificent magnetized 15x glass ,that is perfectly clear. I would recommend this item to anyone interested in viewing their true idenity...</li>
            <li> This mirror distorted images and I couldn&#x27;t see anything.  Although the reviews were terrific for this mirror, I couldn&#x27;t see anything and it was so tall that everyhing was blurry no matter how far I moved away from the mirror.  I needed it for close work:  to put on eye-liner and to tweeze my eyebrows inbetween threading.  It didn&#x27;t work out so I returned it. Instead, I purchased a small traveling standing magnifying mirror at Amazon which worked perfectly and also put a magnifying mirror (10X) with suction cups on my bathroom mirror.</li>
            <li> I love the weight of it, and the 1X side.  The 15X side is helpful, but has lots of distortion.  I realized that, to get that amount of magnification, it would have to be a little distorted, but it would be wonderful if I didn&#x27;t have to hold it so close to get a clear view.  At any rate, it is very helpful when I apply mascara, and I am glad to have it.</li>
            <li> Have reached the point that I need my reading glasses most of the time. :-(  Reality bites. The 10X mirror needs upgrading to a stronger power. Totally misjudged 15X magnification. WAY too strong. Have kept it too long to return. Darn.</li>
            <li> Amazing build quality! I was not expecting this for the price point.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something stronger than 10x and this is perfect.  Absolutely love it!  Good quality.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and it was well received. It is very high quality and a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get old!  It is not fun.  This mirror looks nice and has a strong magnification - which I need.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> The mirror was exactly what was stated. There are very few resources for 15x mirrors, this was a good price a great viewing area.</li>
            <li> It is great, but I thought I would use it more than I do.</li>
            <li> Purchased this because of the 15x magnification, however it is not as clear as a smaller mirror I have.  The image is fuzzy and distorted  so I rarely use it.  It was very disappointing and am sorry I purchased it.</li>
            <li> My mom is 82 and loves this mirror.  It does ot get better than this.</li>
            <li> Great magnification, clear mirror. great item.</li>
            <li> We all need the help of magnification at some point.  It is scary sometimes what we see!  Station this in a nice bright room or take it near a window, and you won&#x27;t miss anything on your face!  A lighted mirror is nicer, but you will have to add the expense.</li>
            <li> I had a challenge finding a 15x mirror, so glad I found this one!</li>
            <li> My husband uses this mirror to pluck all the hairs he can&#x27;t see on his ears and other places on his face. He really likes it. It&#x27;s magnifies greatly. It&#x27;s heavy and sturdy. I keep it out on the bathroom counter because it looks so nice. Have found guest using it also!!</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT MIRROR!</li>
            <li> I started purchasing Floxite mirrors on QVC and was very impresses with their quality and reasonable price.  Now that i&#x27;m a prime customer I can usually get a better deal on Amazon--free shipping.  I recommend Floxite mirrors to anyone who wants good quality.</li>
            <li> BOUGHT THIS MIRROR FOR MY WIFE AND SHE LOVES IT. IT APPEARS TO BE WELL MADE, BUT OF COURSE IT&#x27;S MADE IN CHINA LIKE 90% OF ALL PRODUCTS WE BUY IN AMERICA.</li>
            <li> Love this mirror. Nice quality, great magnification. I like that it is two-sided. I use it to apply makeup with. I use the magnified side for my eyes and other side for the rest. I use a desk lamp beside it to provide lighting.</li>
            <li> I like it, but wish it would of had a light.  I don&#x27;t have to wear my glasses which is what I wanted</li>
            <li> Love the double side of the mirrors. As we age eye sight is not what it was so I ordered the 1x-15x mirror. Don&#x27;t like the ones with light causes shadows. This one is perfect. Have a Travel 1x-10x but I really like the 15x better may look for a travel one. Love the Brush Nickel as well.</li>
            <li> I wanted a mirror so I could see up close.  This extra strong magnification was a bit strong at first but I have gotten used to it and I love it.</li>
            <li> I was Super excited when I received the package. my vision is horrible and I hate using glasses with my mirror so this is a good fix.  The mirror wasn&#x27;t manufactured too well. It has glue sticking out on the rim/edges and a strange sticky residue on the platform when it came in. it also had alot of dust on it (I ordered new, though it appears used? just a thought.) Oh and if you guys find that the neck of the mirror seems wobbly or loose you can fix that by screwing in the platform.  All in all, it does what it should, and is great if you don&#x27;t care for aesthetics (of the mirror).</li>
            <li> It was satisfactory although in hindsight, we should have gotten one with a light.</li>
            <li> love this mirror, works great. is somewhat heavy; quality is great, should last a long time--only disadvatage is it doesn&#x27;t fold up to put away or travel with</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the right mirror for my aging eyes.  It is a good idea when you are without any glasses to have this mirror handy for your eye makeup.</li>
            <li> Excellent magnification. Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Came exactly how and when it was supposed to. Compares very favorably to similar mirrors that sell for twice the price at Ulta, etc. The magnified side can look a bit distorted if you don&#x27;t look at it from exactly the right angle-pretty site that&#x27;s thpical of a magnification mirror.</li>
            <li> I love the magnification</li>
            <li> Great magnification, but I wish it had lighting.</li>
            <li> This mirror was a very pleasant surprise. Several have mentioned problems with this mirror, but the one I received is in great condition and very well made. The magnification is wonderful and it does get a little fuzzier at the edges, but the glass surface is so large it doesn&#x27;t matter. (And it&#x27;s already a shock to see a little bit of me at 15x!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only do I recommend this mirror, I will be buying two more for my nieces in the very near future.</li>
            <li> Wish I would have gotten this a long time ago</li>
            <li> Excellent buy!! Super fast service!</li>
            <li> Looks smart in bathroom. very clear</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my mother and it was exactly what she wanted - but when she opened it Christmas morning - there was a crack the length of one side.  I have returned it and waiting on getting a replacement with hopefully no cracks...</li>
            <li> What a buy...the quality is great...exactly the right height to sit on my window sill for &amp;#34;close up&amp;#34; makeup application.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful mirror it&#x27;s a HUGE hit at my office, which is full of women, you can see very clear nd on the magnified side you can literally see inside every single poor and every single hair follicle you have lmao!!</li>
            <li> excellent quality, excellent magnification.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t but my wife, for some reason, does - and this product made her happy.  So I&#x27;m happy.  I feel like I&#x27;m looking thru a microscope at an orange - but, my wife loves it - go figure</li>
            <li> This is excellent....when will you carry it again....can&#x27;t be without it during travel....</li>
            <li> Exceeded expectations. If lighted it would be outstanding</li>
            <li> This does have a BIG magnification, BUT it is upside down! Perhaps if you stand on your head you could see your skin pores, but the extra-large, sharp, magnification compounded by being upside down will give the hardest sailor sea-sickness in 3 seconds! Stay away from this money waster!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. Is great quality with superb magnification-makes makeup application a snap. Best magnification makeup mirror I have ever owned</li>
            <li> Very glad I purchased this mirror is perfect, no sweet spot, it magnifies beautifully, light weight, looks nice sitting on the vanity.  A++++</li>
            <li> Why did i wait so long to buy one of these.  I should have done it long ago.  So handy for applying makeup, cleaning teeth, plucking eyebrows, squeezing blackheads (NO!!!), etc.  More useful than the smaller pocket sized magnifying mirrors but i have those too.</li>
            <li> Got this for my mom, her eyesight isnt what it used to be, and this mirror really helps out with applying makeup and things of the like. She is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great mirror! Made of very good quality materials. No doubt I would purchase this brand again. Can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> Thanks a needed item for those who no longer see the world magnified. Plus, it is very nicely build.</li>
            <li> Mirror is heavy but otherwisse great</li>
            <li> A really nice size magnifying mirror.  On the other side it is a regular mirror. I use a task light desk lamp with it so, that I have plenty of light to see. I went to several places locally and could not find this high of a magnifying mirror in this size. Glad to have found it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> i love this mirror, has a big enough surface area, and great magnification so you can really put makeup on spotlessly.  There is no warping, it is well made and heavy.</li>
            <li> This mirror is excellent as I am getting older and cannot see like I used to. The high magnification and clarity of this mirror is A+</li>
            <li> I love this mirror.  The size is fantastic and the magnification in a larger size is very user friendly.  I use the Floxite smaller portable mirrors and love them, but wanted something on a stand and this fits the bill perfectly.  The quality of the Floxite mirrors in general and, specifically this one, definitely live up to my expectations.  So glad I made this purchase!</li>
            <li> You can see everything with this mirror on one side and the other is just a regular mirror. It would be perfect if it had come with a light.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and in perfect condition; it is hard to find a 15 magnification mirror; this one is a solid construction and is perfect for my needs; it fits on my closet shelves and in the cabinet under the sink.</li>
            <li> Was purchased as a Christmas gift. The quality was beautiful and recipient loved it....Good quality and great price. Hard to find without a light which was what was requested.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks much!</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price especially. Fast delivery</li>
            <li> In order to use it and get it to focus, you have to get so close as to practically touch it.  Get a weaker magnification.  The standard magnification side is fine, and the mirror is attractive.</li>
            <li> Fantastic magnification and a good price. Sturdy construction.</li>
            <li> Stands at a perfect height, tilts to desired position, perfectly weighted, classy look and allows me to see it all! What more could I want?</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my mirror great product  for people with low vision .I find it very usefullto me no regrets</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best mirror ever.  It is great quality and heavy enough so it isn&#x27;t easily tipped over.  The 15x magnification is perfect for seeing all those tiny eyebrow hairs, etc.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great magnifying mirror.  Yes, the price is a little higher than others but you get what you pay for.  I&#x27;ve had cheaper mirrors and they just aren&#x27;t as good.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror.  I actually can see everything.  It is a great height as well.  Would definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Great product, wish it came with a light.</li>
            <li> I love it, I use it everyday it&#x27;s great for putting on my contacts on.</li>
            <li> So I love that I can see those fine hairs so easily...yet hate that I can see those fine wrinkles so clearly also.  This mirror is quite sturdy, pretty to look at, and really does a great job of magnification.  I have to take a moment to focus in on the mirror, things are so close up they are out of focus until my eyes adjust to what I am looking at.  Would recommend it though, for those moments when you just have to see close up.</li>
            <li> It is easy to see the finest details.  I have had the vanity mirror for at least a year and find it to be a quality product.</li>
            <li> it is just the perfect size for my vanity table.the 10x magnificatiopn gives me the correct closeness that i need. i really love it.</li>
            <li> Awesome non-distorted mirror. I unfortunately broke mine. Can not wait to purchase another !!</li>
            <li> Bought two of these mirriors, one for my mother which has bad eyesight, and my wife who likes to look at her face up close, they both love this mirrior. It set on a nice base and is sturdy, great looking, and the size is big, just what they were looking for! You won&#x27;t be disappointed on this purchase.</li>
            <li> excellent mirror and 15x magnification is great with little distortion</li>
            <li> Fantastic product could not manage without it  once you&#x27;ve  seen your face this clearly you will realize how useful it is</li>
            <li> Love everything about this mirror!  It has no distortions and is TALL enough so you aren&#x27;t bending over or stacking books underneath it.  The magnified side is wonderful for seeing everything on your face, and your teeth.  The normal side is great, too.  I&#x27;ve shopped and shopped trying to find a quality mirror, but this one has it all.</li>
            <li> Great for my forty-something eyes that don&#x27;t see detail.  I can once again tweezer my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Nice but not 15x. I can see much more with my little 12 times from walmart</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick and the product met and exceeded my wifes expectations{birthday gift}</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror seconds before seeing it recommended on the YouTube channel Hot n Flashy. It&#x27;s made plucking my eyebrows a lot easier. Very well built and sturdy - its only fault is it&#x27;s not extendable and I find the stem a little short - I have to stand it on a box to use it.</li>
            <li> As I have gotten older, applying makeup has become more &amp; more challenging... this is the ticket!&lt;br /&gt;Just got it unpacked &amp; I am thrilled with it...I can see AND it is very attractive! Was also pleasantly surprised at how tall it is, can use it to see the back of my head.&lt;br /&gt;Thrilled!!</li>
            <li> Shopped around before I found this mirror. Was larger than I thought it would be but after using it I wouldn&#x27;t want to go back to a smaller one. The 15 X is super. It is made well &amp; has a beautiful finish.</li>
            <li> For super, up close viewing it works great.  I would suggest a slightly lower magnification as this one limits the scope of view to just about your nose and surrounding areas.</li>
            <li> The base fell out of the bottom after only a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> Sturdy well made large mirror with very little distortion in 15 magnification mirror.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent for applying makeup as glasses are not required.</li>
            <li> I like the mirror.  I could not find another mirror that even came close to this one, but I wish the 15X&#x27;s was larger than just in the middle area.  My first one broke due to an accident, I was glad I could find this one again.</li>
            <li> This is definitely extra strong! I bought this mirror for my grandma she loved that she could still put on her make up and pluck her eyebrows. This mirror is great for people who have a hard time seeing. I deft. recommended it for that person in your life that needs an extra magnified mirror.</li>
            <li> Good buy, nice mirror.</li>
            <li> I like the product. It serves my purpose. I have inward growing eyelashes and with the enlargement, I can pluck out them out easily to relieve the irritation to my cornea.</li>
            <li> This mirror is perfect for what I needed.  I needed a 15x magnification mirror that I could apply makeup with while being able to see both eyes.  This mirror feature no distortion and has a beautiful nickel stand.  I am really pleased with the purchase and will be able to use it for years to come.</li>
            <li> Great quality and the magnification is excellent.  Perfect to insert contacts, or to apply makeup with out the contacts in.. Nice large mirror, the stand is sturdy and has a beautiful finish.  Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This mirror is great for aging eyes. I am at the point that I can&#x27;t see in the mirror anymore and my magnified mirror isn&#x27;t strong enough. I can actually tweeze my eyebrows now. I haven&#x27;t been able to see those little hairs for a long time. Just remember, there is a curvature to the mirror so it is not clear on the total surface, only in the center.</li>
            <li> The only thing that would make this mirror better would be if it had a lighted face.</li>
            <li> It got here promptly, but I am not going to use it until I get moved into a new home. I did open it to check and see if it was broken and it wasn&#x27;t so I repacked it and will open it later to use. I have very bad eyesight and I&#x27;m sure a 15X will help greatly.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely mirror for my dressing table.  It&#x27;s the right size and doesn&#x27;t tip easily.  I would recommend this  purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific mirror for applying makeup, though you may not always be happy with what you see (sadly). The distortion increases towards the outer edge, so if you&#x27;re looking close up, about a six inch circle is clear. It&#x27;s the only mirror I can see, to pluck my eyebrows. Love it.</li>
            <li> Mirror is big, really big.  Heavy enough to stand on its own. Wish it had been lit with leds.</li>
            <li> I like this mirror but it does have a bit of distortion.  I sometimes close one eye to tweeze the other eye.  It is only minor and the 15X magnification is great.</li>
            <li> Love this mirror. Works great for putting makeup on without glasses &amp; doing eyebrows.</li>
            <li> It was too strong!! I ordered another one at 10X and that is great.</li>
            <li> The 15x is very strong.  You have to get right in close to use.  The 1x side is perfect.  Nice</li>
            <li> very magnified. great mirror for those getting bad eye sight. i am more than happy with it. would buy again</li>
            <li> There is a small amount of distortion at the edges but well worth the money</li>
            <li> Excellent product better than I expected, and an excellent price, very good quality.</li>
            <li> I love this just the right mirror</li>
            <li> The mirror is too heavy</li>
            <li> I CAN ONCE AGAIN SEE TO PUT ON MAKEUP!  GREAT PRICE, ALSO!</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best mirror. It has the right magnification for mildly sight impaired people. Since it stands by itself, it is easy to position.  It is really the best mirror I&#x27;ve ever purchased and would not hesitate to purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I guess I should have read closer.  It&#x27;s magnified 15 times on one side and nothing on the other.  But, at least it works.</li>
            <li> Great makeup mirror! The15x magnification side is perfect for tweezing eyebrows &amp; applying precision eyeliner. The other side is for everything else. The size, weight, and stand are just right too. Only thing that would make it even better: lighting around the diameter.</li>
            <li> Presents well on vanity, I use it all the time</li>
            <li> Thank you for sending me the mirror, I was expecting it more clear, may be it little small, next time I will try to find larger diameter or may be 20x will be better.</li>
            <li> This item was beautiful and as described.  However, it was too tall to fit under the cabinet over my bathroom sink.  I exchanged it for a 10x mirror that works perfectly for me; tipping the mirror back allows it to fix very nicely.  The exchange and return went very smoothly.</li>
            <li> I really like this mirror.  As I am aging I can see my skin and apply my makeup flawlessly.</li>
            <li> Great mirror. Met expectations and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> This mirror stays exactly where you position it &amp; has 15x magnification, so you can see your eyebrows very clearly. Great item. My friend ordered one, too.</li>
            <li> great magnification - a little heavier then most mirrors of this type, but good value</li>
            <li> Amazing mirror,well worth the money</li>
            <li> This is a welcome addition on my dresser. Good quality</li>
            <li> Very clear image makes it much easier to apply makeup, also nice looking piece on my makeup table.</li>
            <li> Mirror is quite large but it does do a great job of magnifying.</li>
            <li> Great I can see with out my glasses easy to put my make up on just what I expected</li>
            <li> only 3 stars because it was too strong a magnification for me. I returned it to obtain a less strong magnification. The mirror was good looking and was well made.</li>
            <li> very strong,takes awhile to get use too.large mirror.</li>
            <li> Good quality, nicely weighted, and has felt on the bottom so it doesn&#x27;t scratch my stone counter top.</li>
            <li> my wife loved it, larger than expected (good thing), delivered on time.</li>
            <li> well built, nice big mirror, and good magnification. the base is heavy so it doesn&#x27;t tip over easily. the color was very nice looks great in my bathroom</li>
            <li> Excellent height and quality.</li>
            <li> Really great. Really strong magnification.</li>
            <li> Large mirror off kilt! Not exactly &#x27;right&#x27;!!</li>
            <li> Arrived scratched and with poor visibility.</li>
            <li> the magnification is so good and it works great for applying your eye make up or just for contouring your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Good mirror I recommend it,it&#x27;s a strong 15x. Giving these as gifts at Xmas. Checked around the price at stores.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife who had been complaining about the mirror she was presently using (a left over from my previous marriage and which I used to shave neck hair). She stated that it was not powerful enough so I began to do some research on Amazon and found this awesome mirror. It is very stylish and heavy and has made her very happy that the 15x side of the mirror magnifies fantastically. This is a very attractive mirror that would fit in any expensive bathroom/makeup room and even looks good in our humble bathroom. Scored some major points with the Mrs. on this surprise purchase.</li>
            <li> The mirror is large and seems well made, but to see clearly in the 15X side, you have to get VERY close to the mirror.  You see every hair and pore,  but your nose will be practically touching the glass.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife... She loves it! Much more nicer and bigger than I expected!</li>
            <li> Sturdy, very pretty even better than I had imagined. The magnification is perfect without having my glasses on. I love it. Came on time and in adequate packaging.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay... too heavy to move around much, so don&#x27;t plan on using it here and there, just plant it somewhere</li>
            <li> Great for applying makeup and checking different skin areas. Like the plain mirror on other side also. Very nice looking also.</li>
            <li> Shockingly strong!  This product does what it promises, however, I do wish I had bought a lighted mirror, and as long as you&#x27;re going for magnification, why not buy a mirror with 20x power?  I have to take this from the bathroom into another room to get good light.</li>
            <li> The mirror is WONDERFUL ----------- PERFECT.&lt;br /&gt;I am 74 and have a hard time putting on my makeup and the magnifying&lt;br /&gt;part is great for doing that along with the regular to use.&lt;br /&gt;There are real expensive mirrors out there but this is reasonable priced&lt;br /&gt;and also a beautiful addition to my vanity top. If the reader is needing a&lt;br /&gt;mirror DON&#x27;T PASS THIS ONE UP ! ! !</li>
            <li> Great mirror, love the amplification !</li>
            <li> Very nice and sturdy mirror.  Great price.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the one I received was defective. The magnified side was opaque and had a puncture on the bottom.  Returned it</li>
            <li> very good mirror but too strong.for the use intended.</li>
            <li> My wife absolutely loves this mirror.  Works great.  We&#x27;d even give it six stars if the stand were 4-6&amp;#34; taller.</li>
            <li> I love it because it&#x27;s pretty and the brushed nickle finish fits my bathroom fixture decor.  Lovely mirror ...However the magnifier is just OK and that is why I gave it four stars.  I have to get real close to it to get the mag side to focus properly for me to see.  Dang it!</li>
            <li> This mirror is great.  The 1x is so clear I love it.  The 15x is a bit hard to see in, I think a 5x would be better however, this is my first mirror like this so maybe I don&#x27;t know the full benefits of having a 15x strength.</li>
            <li> This mirror is perfect for us who have trouble seeing as well as we use to.&lt;br /&gt;It is sturdy and well made.</li>
            <li> Fits my needs for magnification perfectly.  Large but not unattractive.</li>
            <li> love this mirror with it you can see every tiny detail .</li>
            <li> Nice mirror to have to pluck your eyebrows, and to see to put makeup on, etc. I use mine every day! One side is regular mirror and the other side is a good magnification to see small things, especially when you get older and can&#x27;t see well!</li>
            <li> THE ONE I HAVE HOME IS JUST AS GOOD, NOT MUCH DIFFERENCE IN THE VISION MY EYES ARE VERY BAD AND I THOUGHT I&#x27;D BE ABLE TO SEE BETTER</li>
            <li> I did not want a makeup mirror with a light.  I also wanted high magnification.  After searching the stores and being very disappointed (I did not want to spend 80 dollars on a mirror) I came back to Amazon.  This mirror is perfect.  Stylish with a 15 magnification on one side and regular on the other.  It works perfect for detailed eye makeup magnification.  It is not ego friendly when looking at your flaws, as you will see all of them!  But, guess we need to see what we&#x27;re dealing with and this mirror does that  Looks beautiful in my bathroom and easy to move around.  Love it.</li>
            <li> nice product and came fast</li>
            <li> This mirror is great and provides more than ample magnification for putting on make-up and a host of other things. I like that it also had a regular size mirror, too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a well-made and sturdy mirror, but the 15x magnification makes it unusable to me. You have to move very close to the mirror surface, almost touching it, to see anything, which defies the purpose.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this item.  Foggy glass that never clears up and not the appropriate height for anything!  You have to bend over or tilt it so you can even see!</li>
            <li> GreatSeller,ItemPerfect,Emails,FastShipper &amp; trustworthy-that’sImportant</li>
            <li> Probably better to spend a little more and get a light up one but the magnification is good. Don&#x27;t go lower than 15x like this one if buying as a gift for someone.</li>
            <li> I am totally happy with my mirror, great for plucking eyebrows--exactly what I wanted.  Best thing I have bought for myself.</li>
            <li> arrived quickly,  very well made and good quality</li>
            <li> Well built mirror. Nice finish.&lt;br /&gt;15 times way too much.  Can&#x27;t really use it. I believe 10 times is the perfect strength</li>
            <li> If you want really high magnification this one will do the trick.  For most general purpose use you are probably better off with 7x or 10x but for cases when you want higher magnification this mirror is great.  I didn&#x27;t have any problems with the quality of the mirrors construction which others have complained about.  I also like the simple design and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t come with an integrated light, those lights are always useless and just a waste of space in my experience.</li>
            <li> The mirror is larger than I thought it would be.  I can&#x27;t use it where I wanted to, but it&#x27;s such a good mirror I&#x27;m keeping it anyway.  The magnification is so good, I can see without my glasses to put on my makeup.</li>
            <li> My wife has had a long standing problem applying makeup due to poor eye sight until we purchased this mirror.( She has found wrinkles she didn&#x27;t know existed!)&lt;br /&gt;She is now able to apply her eye makeup without the use of her glasses and cannot give it high enough praise.</li>
            <li> Item was received timely and in good condition. It has an attractive rubbed nickel finish and looks nice sitting on the vanity. I am please with the purchase and feel I received a quality product for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> This is a great mirror, can see things that I would rather not know are there.  Sure makes doing my makeup and tweezing the eyebrows a lot easier.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but I wasn&#x27;t aware of how magnifed I&#x27;d be when I look in the mirror. It&#x27;s good. I&#x27;m glad we bought it.</li>
            <li> Excellent mirror and well made  very pleased !</li>
            <li> Excellent mirror. I recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> Perfect. Fast delivery. Good mirror quality. Nice finish on the metal. High magnification makes you not want to look into it.</li>
            <li> Fifty-nine years old&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can finally srr what im doing whem putting on make-up at 5:30 a.m.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah!!!</li>
            <li> I love this mirror.  It&#x27;s lightweight, and the 15x magnify is great for older women who want to put on their makeup without using their glasses.  Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I did not realize that the 15X magnification requires that you be extremely close to the mirror in order to see. In hindsight I would order a 10X magnification instead.</li>
            <li> Product is better than I expected.  Very heavy duty base and stand.  Mirror is crystal clear and the Magnification is just right.  The Mirror arrived on the date expected.</li>
            <li> heavy metal, mirrors are appropriate, 15x/1x. the maginified mirror really helps me visually as I was having a difficult time puttong on my eye make or tweezing my eyebrows.  The mirror arrived, packed well, and nothing broken.</li>
            <li> Good quality.  Over priced.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift.  My mom has really enjoyed it.  The magnification is wonderful and exactly how it was advertised.</li>
            <li> This is a heavy duty mirror, much larger and powerful than I expected.</li>
            <li> If you want to explore every pore in your face and obsess over it, this is the mirror for you!</li>
            <li> good mirror - the product is made well. it is sturdy, does what it says it does. makes plucking eyebrows easier.</li>
            <li> Very nice mirror.  It is tall enough and the magnification is very good.  I can see clearly every eyebrow hair that needs to be plucked!</li>
            <li> I think that it distorts as you can only use it when you stand very close . but it takes care of all your needs as far as seeing the details on your face.</li>
            <li> I got this because I wanted to have a better skin care routine and needed it to better apply my makeup and groom my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice. I wanted something simple in design and not flashy or elaborate, which it fits that criteria. The glass seems not to be fitted too well. How to explain this... it looks like when the glass was cut to be fitted in the frame, it was really rough and may have not done a good job fitting it. I expect that I will need to replace this in a couple of years, due to its quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it works for now and I use it everyday,for hours. I like the high magnifying lens on it to see everything. I think as long as I take good care of it it should last for a long time. I just get nervous every time I clean the mirror thinking it&#x27;s going to pop out.</li>
            <li> This mirror works as expected.  I&#x27;m not sure why I thought I&#x27;d need to see so much detail on my face (scary) but it works as advertized.  My only gripe, and it&#x27;s a small one, is that only you have to look directly at the center of the mirror to get it in focus.  If you&#x27;re trying to remove an ingrown hair or something from your neck, the image isn&#x27;t clear.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the best vanity mirrors I have ever seen or used.  The 15xtra Strong (15x) magnification is excellent for those like me who have impaired vision.  I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> The magnification or the curved surface of this mirror creates a double image that is difficult to focus through to get a true reflection. I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works great for applying makeup.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and being used every day.</li>
            <li> This was actually a gift, so I cannot personally say....but the recipient says she likes it.</li>
            <li> This magnifies to a VERY strong degree!  When I look in it, I can see so much on my skin that you can never see in a commonplace magnifier mirror.  My one complaint is that it&#x27;s too tall and there is no way to shorten it.  I have to stand up and look down in it if I really want a good look.  My habit is to sit at my make-up table where I can simply look into the mirror.  I can&#x27;t really do that well with this mirror.  However, what I wanted was to be able to see tiny hairs and imperfections on my face and this mirror accommodates that very well.</li>
            <li> This is a great mirror.  I did not know that 15X would be that strong.  I have another magnifying mirror that is 5X but wanted a stronger one, and didn&#x27;t know what strength to get.  This is so strong I need to be right next to it to use it. I bought it to use for everyday make-up application, but it is a bit strong for that, so I am still using my 5X mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But! any time I need to be able to see something closely, like a spot, blemish, hair, it is always the mirror I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very nice quality, a nice bronze like finish.</li>
            <li> This mirror is absolutely perfect. One side is a regular mirror; the other side magnifies to the 15th power, making plucking eyebrows or facial hair a breeze. Its easy-care finish polishes with a wet rag. The stand is heavy enough to prevent knocking it over easily. Who could ask for anything more?</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s right, while you can pay more for a table mirror, it won&#x27;t offer more than the floxite 15X mirror period. this dual side mirror with&lt;br /&gt;both 1X and 15X is quite simply the only mirror you&#x27;ll need for plucking facial hairs or removing/applying makeup. the 1X side is 7.75\\&quot; in&lt;br /&gt;diameter and the 15X side is 7\\&quot; in diameter and those large sizes makes any kind of facial work a breeze since it allows you to view your&lt;br /&gt;entire face at once unlike those smaller size mirrors. the powerful clear 15X side really magnifies all facial hairs including the throat and&lt;br /&gt;used with high quality tweezers makes facial hair plucking fast and easy thanks to it&#x27;s tilting head. and the brass stand looks nice and&lt;br /&gt;professional and is weighted and very stable and the bottom is padded very nicely which protects and avoids scratching anything it&#x27;s sitting&lt;br /&gt;on. to sum it up, this mirror is a great bang for the buck and like all mirrors, it&#x27;ll last you a lifetime with care. i&#x27;m a very happy customer&lt;br /&gt;with this purchase and so will you.</li>
            <li> The product is made well and looks very nice. the only problem is, it does not light up so my wife was diappointed with that aspect of it. I should have paid attention to this. She probably would have caught it. I assumed all make up mirrors were back lit. Just be aware that while itr&#x27;s a great product, it does not light up</li>
            <li> The 15x Magnification mirror is amazing. I definitely DO NOT NEED MY GLASSES to see with this mirror. And, both hands are free. Grooming tasks are easier and quickly accomplished. The only drawback and one that I do not see changing due to the nature of magnification is that you need to be up close to the mirror to get a clear and undistorted view. Otherwise, this review would have been 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This mirror is exactly what I was looking for. It is pretty and stylish. One side is a regular mirror and the magnified side shows EVERY hair on my face (that is good and bad at the same time LOL).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want the honest truth of what your skin looks like, you definitely want to get this mirror.</li>
            <li> Great mirror to use while applying my make up! I like how it is standard on one side and up close on the other.</li>
            <li> Have seen many magnification mirrors but this one takes the cake. Good quality. Nice and heavy so it will not tip and easy to handle. And the 15x is not distorted like a lot are. Not just a small section of the other side of the mirror, but the whole side is 15x.</li>
            <li> The 15x magnification is great for Mom. It helps with her poor eyesight for makeup application. Sturdy and nice to look at!</li>
            <li> ...I can see up close and personal....I love mine so ordered one for my sister! She got it for my Christmas gift and loves it!</li>
            <li> I rate this item right up there, if you have eyes that aren&#x27;t so good this is just what you need.</li>
            <li> My wife really liked this as she asked for one as a gift.</li>
            <li> 115 strength is too much, should have bought the 100 strength</li>
            <li> 15X is the sweet spot and does the trick. It is a solidly built mirror, large enough to show the area of your face that you need to look at. Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Really good product.  Easy to see to pluck eyebrows without wearing reading glasses.  I was glad I purchased this mirror.</li>
            <li> Comparing this to a product I&#x27;ve owned for years, this mirror quality is somewhat lacking, but I kept it &amp; relegated it to my guest bath.</li>
            <li> I use the 15X side for the perfecting of my makeup, plucking hairs, eye makeup, and the normal side to view the finished look. The mirror works well for what I needed. I just wish it had a light. It is sturdy and made well.</li>
            <li> I had read a review that said there is such a thing as too strong but I though strong was good. It is too much. The mirror itself is great but it is so strong I lose perspective of my whole face. I use it once in a while but I had to buy a 10x.</li>
            <li> My wife chose a different mirror before I purchased this. I tried talking her into this one, but she had her mind set on the other. I went ahead and bought the other one.....BUT I also bought this at the same time. Fortunately this arrived a day later. She absolutely, and immediately, fell in love with it.The one she wanted is now her back up or travel mirror, but this one she is in awe over. I will probably by another so that she has a backup/travel mirror of the same kind. EXCELLENT Decision by any loved one. PTD</li>
            <li> What I like best about this magnifying mirror is the height and sturdiness of the base. the lens are high quality. Makes using it very easy.</li>
            <li> Able to get back to plucking my eyebrows every morning. Had been doing so for 50 years and had to stop because I could no longer see them. Now I can!</li>
            <li> The Floxite FI-15v 15xtra Strong Supervision Vanity Mirror was just as advertised.  Liked the brushed finish and that it is 15X.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This is a very powerful mirror, makes makeup application, plucking, etc, SO VERY MUCH EASIER for those who require reading glasses.  One thing is, you must get close to the mirror, 4-6&amp;#34; away to get a good focus.  Second thing, &#x27;&#x27;only since I cannot sit for use&#x27;&#x27; I FIND IT VERY AWKWARD TO USE&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE TO MANUFACTURER.... I truly wish this mirror, or one nearly as large, was available in a hand mirror.  If in 2 sided hand mirror, with a hole at the end of the handle, it could be hung from hook, or near anything if a loop of string or ribbon was later added, which would also be handy for travel.  I do have 2 small 15x travel mirror, but they&#x27;re toooo small to see both eyes at once.</li>
            <li> This was bought so I can put my contacts in and not blunder. It is wonderful. No distortion and magnifies beautifully.  I can actually see the tiny hairs under my brow and other flaws now too. How long has those been there? OMG.  Works great.</li>
            <li> This mirror is sturdy, takes up little space, and is user friendly.  I recommend this reversible mirror to all who need magnification to view their faces.</li>
            <li> Great mirror. 15x magnification.  You really need this if you wear glasses and want to apply make-up with wearing your glasses.&lt;br /&gt; A must have!</li>
            <li> This a large beautiful mirror, the magnifying side will require practice, but I certainly can see without my glasses my facial features.</li>
            <li> Great mirror.  This is the first magnifying mirror that I have found that is perfect for my old eyes! Beautiful on my vanity too.</li>
            <li> Great mirror but could use a nicer quality for better resolution.  But good for the value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this mirror. It&#x27;s large enough to see your entire face, hair and neck. The 15x magnification comes very handy to me as my eye sight keeps deteriorating and I can&#x27;t wear glasses while doing my makeup, so this is a must have for me. I looked and looked for the perfect vanity mirror, which had to be the cheapest and best at the same time and this is it! A true winner product that I would purchase again and again.</li>
            <li> The magnification is just what I wanted.  The mirror is heavy and therefore stable.</li>
            <li> GREAT BUT IT CAN NOT FIY IN MY SUITCASE !</li>
            <li> Very nice quality.  No distortion and good maginifigation.</li>
            <li> Great mirror...attractive</li>
            <li> This is a good sized, heavy duty vanity mirror. Works great, looks good and it well made.</li>
            <li> Great product !  It is so hard to find 15x magnification (10x is available everywhere, but I needed greater magnification so I could use this mirror without wearing my glasses).  Well made, we are glad we bought this.</li>
            <li> The product is great. I give myself no stars!&lt;br /&gt;I should have listened to the other reviewers that said 15x is too much!&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy more Floxite products because the quality of this one seems really good.&lt;br /&gt;I wear reading glasses and thought the 15x would make it easy to see everything but it really is overkill for most jobs.&lt;br /&gt;Next time I will go with just a 5x or 7x magnification.&lt;br /&gt;You would be wise to start with a lesser power first and really listen to what the reviews say.&lt;br /&gt;No point in having to spend more money than you have to.</li>
            <li> I have several smaller 15X mirrors and have been eyeing this one for awhile. I love it! When your eyesight starts to go, you will love it, too. 10X is just not enough. And the price was great!</li>
            <li> This mirror was a great disappointment--the distortion is so bad that it&#x27;s hardly usable.  I also would have preferred that it be heavier.</li>
            <li> I needed more magnification for applying makeup and tweezing eyebrow strays.  I did have an 8x magnification and hoped that this 15x strong one would be just the thing!&lt;br /&gt;I understand that the more you magnify, the more the distortion...It does not seem to be a high quality mirror or stand. I guess you get what you pay for however there are very few choices when it comes to that high of magnification.&lt;br /&gt;Hence, the rating of &amp;#34;it&#x27;s okay&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this mirror.. for those of us who are needing help to see to do your make-up or eyebrows.. This mirror is wonderful.  It looks nice sitting on the counter as well.  Would fit into any décor.</li>
            <li> very powerful - unique use</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping , I use it every morning, It works great for putting on my make up when you need glasses just to see your face. It is very nice too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife, she wanted one without a light but easy to see.  She is very happy with this for applying makeup, eyewear, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely purchase this model again if she ever needs a replacement.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use it in the sun, it will cause a burn if you are not careful :)  I can see what I need to pluck</li>
            <li> How I&#x27;ve gone through life without one of these, I have no idea. You do need to get about 6-8 inches away from the magnifying mirror to be in focus. This is adequate for eyebrow tweezing.</li>
            <li> Great amplification! My wife adores it. It&#x27;s big and heavy, not for traveling. But it frees up both hands to tweeze. Good solid product.</li>
            <li> I asked for a lighted 15X magnifying mirror and this was my own fault - I didn&#x27;t see that it WAS NOT lighted.  I returned the mirror.</li>
            <li> Fantastic.  However, it would be great to get a 20X on the otherside.</li>
            <li> as advertised! good product</li>
            <li> Really needed the extra power in mag. And this did it, the lesser mag. Just wasn&#x27;t working any more- love</li>
            <li> I really like this mirror and thought it was a great deal at the price.  I really need to get another one for my sister-in-law.</li>
            <li> This magnification is not readily available in most stores.  I have been looking for this for a number of years and could only find a few but with a price tag that I felt was a little high.  This is essential for people with contacts.</li>
            <li> Arrived as promised and my wife likes it. And it has a classic appearance that adds to the room.</li>
            <li> nice  you have no trouble finding a black head on your face. love it</li>
            <li> Fantastic mirror. Can see everything. Excellent quality.</li>
            <li> I noticed as I age it gets harder to see and this mirror brings everything into focus!  Excellent quality and price.</li>
            <li> this is a good mirror, but you need good lighting for maximum effect.  It would have been better if it had been lighted.</li>
            <li> This mirror is wonderful especially for those  of us who have diminished eyesight as we age. I can pluck my eyebrows with my glasses off.</li>
            <li> very good bought 3 and all loved it</li>
            <li> Received as gift and the wife loves it!</li>
            <li> Quality mirror.  Beautifully designed, and very good weight.  Exceeds my expectations.  I simply love everything about it.</li>
            <li> My eyes are not terrible, but even using a 10x mirror I needed to have my glasses on!  I feel like I can finally see using this 15x mirror!  I am loving it!</li>
            <li> Perfect magnifying and height for applying make-up</li>
            <li> I have had other 15x mirrors and can say this one is just okay.  It works but my others were not blurry around the edges like this one is.  I will not be returning it but was a tad disappointed.  It is pretty, though, and looks good on the counter.  &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> No distortion, great mirror and I prefer not to have to a light for the mirror. Liked it so much this is my second order, keep 1 upstairs and 1 downstairs!</li>
            <li> I thought I could see before, but this mirror is fantastic.  There is never a doubt where the make up is going or where it should not. This mirror is wonderful...I don&#x27;t know how I managed without it.</li>
