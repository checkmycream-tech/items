    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Wonderful product, I just wish the curlers were easier to remove from the heating unit.  </li>
            <li>and I thought it would be so perfect in the mornings</li>
            <li>I had a set like this years ago, wonderful.</li>
            <li>I think this might have been my best purchase of 2014.</li>
            <li>Perfect curls and no crease from the roller clip!  </li>
            <li>However,  I am not overly impressed ...for me..</li>
            <li>Beautiful curls.</li>
            <li>but they did a very nice job, and I looked very good if I do say</li>
            <li>Once I got the hang of using these they were really great.</li>
            <li>But... The curlers work great.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s great and it sits upright</li>
            <li>This product gave me the most perfect curls ever.  </li>
            <li>The curlers themselves are awesome, but I received two and the indicator light never worked on either.</li>
            <li>I really loved that set.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Good idea...poorly executed.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t hold a good curl for either one of use.</li>
            <li>The design of the heating element/storage unit is excellent, with a plastic cover that keeps the curlers clean and in place.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would like a set with MORE curlers in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li>but it works  better on her hair!</li>
            <li>It kind of defeats the purpose imo.</li>
            <li>It kind of defeats the purpose imo.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than that problem, these are nice curlers that work well.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t use it immediately to determine if I liked it. .</li>
            <li>They were super easy to unroll out of my hair and the curls were beautiful!</li>
            <li>Fantastic product; love it and love all the curls!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Assuming you have some knowledge of how to use hot rollers, I think this is a really great set.  </li>
            <li>had no clue what I was doing, but it worked very easily, and my hair which likes to fly all over the place handled it very well.</li>
            <li>It has cups/rollers that are made of a top of rigid plastic material designed in a swirl shape with an attached shaft that leads to a silicone bottom.</li>
            <li>I plan to use this set on just the ends of my hair to give it a more finished look.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because of this, the idea of clipless rollers was really, really appealing to me.  </li>
            <li>I love the features they built in.  </li>
            <li>The silicone construction is also great since it makes these more gentle on your fingers</li>
            <li>and if I put more hair into each curler, then basically the curlers won&#x27;t &#x27;snap&#x27; shut</li>
            <li>( I have many)</li>
            <li>(which didn&#x27;t affect my rating since it&#x27;s more of a wish)</li>
            <li>(which didn&#x27;t affect my rating since it&#x27;s more of a wish)</li>
            <li>I also think that it should come with twice as many rollers in order to work for most people.</li>
            <li>Conair Infiniti curl has created for me a head of lovely shiny curls.  </li>
            <li>I am in love with this product.  </li>
            <li>I never got anything that looked more than a somewhat wavy strip of hair-no curls.  </li>
            <li>it is challenging to use</li>
            <li>I have tried many types of curlers.  </li>
            <li>These are my favorite.</li>
            <li>This probably won&#x27;t be an issue for most people (I have spine issues) but it sure was annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Four, not five, stars, because I realize that if I had a lot more hair (which I do at times) I would not be able to do all my hair at once.</li>
            <li>I guesstimated that they were good to go at around 5 minutes, which seemed about right.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am really excited about these rollers!</li>
            <li>This is really quite handy and a nice feature.  </li>
            <li>really like using these, find them easy and make my hair look nice!</li>
            <li>For longer or thicker hair, hotter rollers might be better (I have fine, shoulder-length</li>
            <li>great item, love it, works super, fast shipping, would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, it takes 15 mins to really warm them up, and they get hot!  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to get these as I&#x27;ve been wanting them for awhile and have seen so many positive video reviews and tutorials, and the curls looked so gorgeous.</li>
            <li>It does a great job on my naturally curly hair helping control the frizzies in the winter.</li>
            <li>I thought it would work more like clipless curling irons where there is nothing to secure your hair.  </li>
            <li>but honestly, it isn&#x27;t even worth $9.  </li>
            <li>These are much more scalp friendly.  </li>
            <li>They fall out easily.</li>
            <li>This really gives you a nice 40s style wave, its sexy and bouncy.</li>
            <li>I like the design of the curlers, and in my opinion they were easy to put in the hair and take out.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s still easy to just do it in stages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Compact and easy to store&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the curls look great, and last most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>I wish this had worked out better because I love clip-less rollers (and having a roller option vs. irons) and it looks like fun.</li>
            <li>I think if your hair is thinner it would be fine.</li>
            <li>These curlers are light and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I have lots of fine wavy hair that is just below my shoulders.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad someone innovated a new kind of set.ickness of your hair</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad someone innovated a new kind of set.</li>
            <li>I like the unique design, the way it stands up on end, it turns for easy access to the curlers, and no clips or pins are involved...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my hair styled with hot rollers before by hair stylists (often for special events like weddings) and have always liked the look.  </li>
            <li>A textured surface rather than smooth plastic would do wonders.</li>
            <li>The indicator light never worked on mine, so</li>
            <li>Then just pop the bottom to secure your hair .  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There are two cons I have for these rollers.&lt;br /&gt;1. A lot of hair cannot fit into 1 roller</li>
            <li>A lot of hair cannot fit into 1 roller</li>
            <li>Then clip to secure and repeat.  </li>
            <li>There is something to secure your hair, it is just built into the curler rather than separate.  </li>
            <li>This is the light that indicates when the curlers are heated.  </li>
            <li>and I liked that it has silicone rollers-curling irons just really damage my hair.  </li>
            <li>but the light never came</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look like a light.</li>
            <li>Nice natural curls with no creases , way faster than I have been able to curl my hair before.</li>
            <li>It never fails, every time I buy something from China I have to return it!!</li>
            <li>a high level, the most effective way seems be to (and obviously those experienced with hot rollers can skip this)</li>
            <li>I was in love with these rollers the first time I tried them because I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy and quick it was to roll into my hair</li>
            <li>I was really excited for this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure these work great for people with relatively thin hair, but honestly?</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure these work great for people with relatively thin hair, but honestly?</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First things first, I do think that whatever kind of hot rollers you use (clipless or standard) using good technique helps.  </li>
            <li>I hardly ever write reviews - but I feel compelled to tell everyone that these are the best rollers that I have ever used - ever.  </li>
            <li>They looked nice and curled very fast, but didn&#x27;t have much hold.  </li>
            <li>These are a great update to traditional hot rollers</li>
            <li>This system could potentially be really good because I like how it is &amp;#34;clipless&amp;#34; but they DEFINITELY need to be bigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Let cool for 15-20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That isn&#x27;t true.  </li>
            <li>The concept is cool ...</li>
            <li>It just says to wait til they&#x27;re cool.</li>
            <li>It seems like it would work well on most hair, mine just does not curl very well.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product and keep it because these hot rollers are the easiest and most practical hot rollers I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>I like them very much for medium length kinda fine hair.</li>
            <li>I said, I have pretty fine hair and when I use rollers, I like looser curls</li>
            <li>but the more I put them to the test, the more I&#x27;m starting to regret my purchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice because it does hold your hair secure but in a gentler way than standard rollers with nothing to dig into your scalp, or as often my problem, lose.  </li>
            <li>QUICK.</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly, and they curl quickly as well:</li>
            <li>The rollers themselves are soft silicone and while they are clunky, they do not hurt and are very easy on your hair.  </li>
            <li>if you are very, very familiar with hot rollers you may think you don&#x27;t like the experience at first.  </li>
            <li>loved playing with these, I have over shoulder long  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always washed my hair every day and although my hair is fine and not thick, the 1-inch swath of hair you are directed to part off to wind around the shaft of the roller filled the roller</li>
            <li>this is not a serious product for an adult woman looking to get gorgeous curls.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, straight hair that never holds a curl</li>
            <li>But as much as I practiced with this, my hair is just too fine and the curlers would just slide out.  </li>
            <li>Were I still managing beauty salons, I am sure I would supply each station with one of these however, as it is pretty clever.</li>
            <li>they told her the light should come to let you know when it is ready for use.</li>
            <li>I did not like that the ready indicator light never came on even after 45 minutes of warming up</li>
            <li>They come out looser and more natural</li>
            <li>They come out looser and more natural looking.  </li>
            <li>The silicone (soft rubbery material) protects hair from heat, so is great, except in this case, there are just NOT enough curlers, period.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get any volume near the top of my head from these rollers -</li>
            <li>Not to be superficial, but the unit design is pretty cool as well.</li>
            <li>I get great concentrated curl near the bottom though - so I&#x27;m still using the root volumizer attachment on my flat iron for that.</li>
            <li>I really wish it came with more rollers or if we have the option to buy more rollers because 12 rollers barely cover my whole head.</li>
            <li>The rollers fall right out of my hair.  </li>
            <li>light is pretty much non-existent...</li>
            <li>And even when you&#x27;re used to it, it can&#x27;t fit much hair and you definitely need more than twelve.</li>
            <li>I wanted to see how long they lasted on their own</li>
            <li>Took me about 5-7 minutes to pop all 12 rollers in my hair - very fast and easy for busy mornings&lt;</li>
            <li>At first look</li>
            <li>but my first attempt was a disaster.  </li>
            <li>You must follow the instructions exactly ... also be able to identify the medium from the larger curlers ... and Practice using them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I saw the ad for clip-less/ pin-less  hot rollers  .  </li>
            <li>They get hot but not too hot where you will burn yourself</li>
            <li>They get hot but not too hot where you will burn yourself  - NO CLIPS OR PINS &#x3D;</li>
            <li>There are ample tutorials about hot rollers (with pictures) on the internet</li>
            <li>I love that the case rotates so you can access only 6 curlers on the time, keeping the rest of the set hot.  </li>
            <li>Once I unroll the first section, it takes another 5 minutes of reheating the rollers again before I can use them to finish my hair.</li>
            <li>The first time I used these without the iron, I ended up with what my kiddo called The Harry Styles which wasn&#x27;t what I was going for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but when we tried it would get hot</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a compact roller set that I really like!</li>
            <li>importantly I love the absence of clips.  </li>
            <li>I really love that the plastic rollers hardly touch the heat, so they don&#x27;t really burn your hands much like other curlers: the soft rubbery material used underneath that does get hot, is reasonably easy not to touch too much while you are rolling: would love to see more of this material used in curler sets!</li>
            <li>so the only way I knew the rollers were ready to use was by touching them during the warm-up period.</li>
            <li>I think it could be fun for a 14 year old to use at a sleep over for fun.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s worth investigating them if you are new to hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>My shoulder-length long hair worked better, and resulted in lose curls.</li>
            <li>I never knew when I should be using them, so I usually waited a fair amount of time before using.  </li>
            <li>They are natural, full bouncy curls - and you look like you just stepped out of a salon.  </li>
            <li>in ten minutes, I had pleasant, loose curls.  </li>
            <li>The curlers stayed warm to the touch for about a half an hour</li>
            <li>Short Answer- Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I never saw any sort of light, and had to keep guessing if it was hot enough or not.</li>
            <li>The curls set easily and last.  </li>
            <li>The build quality is good and seems like it should last a long time.  </li>
            <li>and you have no idea which are the large and which are the medium</li>
            <li>Significantly easier to roll into your hair than traditional hot rollers</li>
            <li>(I have asian fine hair).</li>
            <li>(I have asian fine hair).</li>
            <li>The curls come out so much better than any other hot roller device</li>
            <li>She had a very hard time figuring out how to rotate the container to access the curlers - I had to show her twice that instead of twisting the top by the handle, you just hold the top and twist the translucent plastic to access the curlers.  </li>
            <li>Overall the idea is great, but the design could use a little work.  </li>
            <li>Nice carrying handle and it stores in a compact little corner ready to be used when you need it.</li>
            <li>, the  upright box is a pain, what happened to the flat easy to to use box?</li>
            <li>The curls take better on freshly washed hair and with some styling/curl activating product in it, but for me the curls still fell limp at the end of my days.</li>
            <li>Not only will you not have enough rollers to do your entire head at the same time, but it does not produce any impressive curls.  </li>
            <li>results are very pleasing</li>
            <li>Fast heat up.</li>
            <li>If I put too much hair in one roller, the curl will not take at all.</li>
            <li>Fast heat up</li>
            <li>so if you have thicker hair, 12 rollers probably will not cover your whole head.&lt;br</li>
            <li>On my fine asian hair, I feel like the curls do not hold for long even with a strong hold hair spray.</li>

            <li>On my fine asian hair, I feel like the curls do not hold for long even with a strong hold hair spray.</li>
            <li>Much of it, for me, has to do with the clips because I find them finicky to work with - they dig into my scalp, they can be problematic to position, they get lost, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Start with a section of your hair closest to the hairline and pull it straight up.  </li>
            <li>I really, really like them.  </li>
            <li>I typically really like the look of jumbo rollers and</li>
            <li>&#x27;I&#x27;m ready&#x27;</li>
            <li>and since I was getting ready for my sister in-laws baby shower, I ended up having to redo my whole head so that all of my hair could be set.</li>
            <li>the thought of buying extra curlers for these to stick in slots as they become available as I&#x27;m setting does not really appeal to me, especially storage wise.</li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t know how 12 one in sections would cover anyone&#x27;s whole head.  </li>
            <li>There doesn&#x27;t appear to be an actual light at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it is portable and doesn&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
            <li>They are a struggle to put in and very time consuming.  </li>
            <li>I am far from a girly girl, but these looked like fun, and I thought I would give them a try for those moments</li>
            <li>things surprised me, but overall I am quite pleased with these rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have thick/long hair there is no way 12 rollers is enough , but they heat pretty quickly</li>
            <li>- I really like how these don&#x27;t make my hair feel damaged or dry at all  - Compact and easy to store    </li>
            <li>I would have bought that originally instead of my standard set.  </li>
            <li>The product website for this product does have some tutorials, but I&#x27;ve found other videos and pictures on the web to be more helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have long fine hair</li>
            <li>Not so great, the curlers are too large and difficult to use plus the curls are so large that my hair was not curly.  </li>
            <li>These are very much like the old Conair Hotsticks.</li>
            <li>Nice curls with very little effort.</li>
            <li>I also understand you can buy more rollers, but you don&#x27;t get an extra heating unit, so in my opinion extra rollers are not going to help solve the problem of not covering the whole head.</li>
            <li>For years I could never understand why when I used hot rollers at home I never could get it to replicate how it looked when a professional used them.  </li>
            <li>Also, depending on the thickness of your hair, this might not be enough to do a full head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think this is such a cool set.  </li>
            <li>, this might not be enough to do a full head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think this is such a cool set.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty short, fine hair, but even so, I could barely get more than a few strands in each roller.  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of very long hair and it held it securely.</li>
            <li>Also, the rubber part that &amp;#34;snaps&amp;#34; shut on your hair is also easily snapped closed in the device.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d have to pull them back off, open them, repeat (usually more than once).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Rolling takes practice, just be sure to pop them close tight, or they fall out.</li>
            <li>This set was highly recommended on a blog I follow, but I was thoroughly unimpressed.</li>
            <li>Without any reviews to read I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for these rollers</li>
            <li>- Took me about 5-7 minutes to pop all 12 rollers in my hair - very fast and easy for busy mornings  - Cools down in about 15-20 minutes  </li>
            <li>The size of the rollers is okay, but there is little difference between the two sizes.  </li>
            <li>....to quickly and easily tame my daughters mousy-fine hair without having to use a ton of hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, quick to heat up, silicone does NOT get tangled in her</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t live up to it&#x27;s promise though, having enough minor issues from start-up to comb-out that my rating is just &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; vs. &amp;#34;I love it.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is pourly made, not easy to use and surely does not delver what it is promsing</li>
            <li>and I was only able to get the loose curls.  </li>
            <li>After two full rotations you tuck the loose ends around the roller and continue rolling to your scalp.  </li>
            <li>The indicator light on the machine is supposed to go from red to white to indicate readiness, but mine didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>As many have said, there are just too few curlers in the &amp;#34;kit&amp;#34; to cover any adult&#x27;s head.  </li>
            <li>So far I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is due to the unique new technology of this set that eliminates the nubs and clips of traditional hot rollers.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re curling 1&amp;#34; sections, sure, but if you have hard to curl or thick hair, you&#x27;re not going to get amazing</li>
            <li>So after the first somewhat confounding use, the system works well enough.  </li>
            <li>Does not heat up hot enough to hold curls</li>
            <li>when hot than standard rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It did take a long time for the curlers to heat up, actually the light never went on</li>
            <li>Because of this, these curlers were nowhere near hot enough to accomodate the thicker sections.</li>
            <li>The outside of the curler may feel cool, but it won&#x27;t have curled properly.</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s first comment was that it has no On/Off light - no way to know that it&#x27;s plugged in and heating, so I pulled out the instructions and read that there is in fact a small, cheap LED that dimly lights &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; (really pink) when you plug it in and goes &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; (in fact, simply OFF) when the curlers are heated.  </li>
            <li>A couple years back I bought a new standard set of hot rollers, but never took them out of the box!  </li>
            <li>Granted, my hair is pretty thick and straight and takes pretty high heat to curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this set has only large.</li>
            <li>so I left them in while I finished getting ready.</li>
            <li>My biggest complaint is it needs more curlers.</li>
            <li>It wont work on very short hair, nor will it take much hair per roller.</li>
            <li>These rollers do not work on second day hair very well.</li>
            <li>Curls come out soft, bouncy and voluminous</li>
            <li>- Curls come out soft, bouncy and voluminous</li>
            <li>it supposed comes on red when you plug it in and goes off when ready...</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s not enough to get a reasonable amount of hair sectioned off and rolled to the scalp.wasn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s not enough to get a reasonable amount of hair sectioned off and rolled to the scalp.</li>
            <li>The only part I don&#x27;t like is that it takes two settings to do my whole head.</li>
            <li>I do have some natural curve, so there was something for the curlers to work with -</li>
            <li>but my hair holds a curl really well when using a regular curling iron.  </li>
            <li>Not a great product - for a few pennies more they could have used a true multi-colored LED instead of relying on the darkness-emitting property of the diode to indicate that the curlers are sufficiently hot.</li>
            <li>but if you have longer thick hair you need to order more curlers to meet your needs.</li>
            <li>I still do prefer these over the other traditional hot rollers, but because they&#x27;re not working out for me in the way I intended them to, I&#x27;m debating whether or not I want to keep these hot rollers.&lt;br /&gt;//end of</li>
            <li>The locking design in your hair, not the traditional clips, was really easy to roll your hair into and then locked in tight.</li>
            <li>By the time you move the clear &amp;#34;cover&amp;#34; over and remove a curler and then close it to keep the others hot, wrap a 1&amp;#34; wide piece of hair and get it to your scalp,the curler has lost a lot of heat.  </li>
            <li>this design is really limited, in the same amount of space my old box set held twice as many curlers, both large and small.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s neat, but even using a small piece of hair, my hair fell down way too easily, which means that the hot curlers are down on my forehead and hot, which I really didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>I have very thick but very fine medium length hair.  </li>
            <li>However because I&#x27;ve never seen or heard of clipless hot rollers before I had absolutely no idea what to expect when these arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The construction of these wasn&#x27;t exactly what I expected, though I do still like it.  </li>
            <li>All of the pros I listed below I still believe are true, however after experimenting with these for some time, I think the few cons out weigh the pros.</li>
            <li>I really like how these don&#x27;t make my hair feel damaged or dry at all&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;You wouldn&#x27;t think that 12 rollers wouldn&#x27;t be enough for your whole head, but if you consider the fact each curler should only have a 1&amp;#34; section of hair, you&#x27;ll find you run out of curlers</li>
            <li>If I stick with small sections, the curls do come out beautiful, but it takes 2x longer to curl my whole head with these rollers because I have to wait until one side cools, unroll them and pop them back into the heater and then use them on the other half of my head--this is just not very practical for me because I&#x27;m looking for a less damaging way to curl my hair quickly in the mornings before I have to leave.</li>
            <li>Major annoyance.</li>
            <li>I have very thick hair so need to order more curlers</li>
            <li>At least, it&#x27;s referred to as a light. . .</li>
            <li>The actual roller portion is made of a soft silicone feeling plastic .  </li>
            <li>I had trouble with larger sections as it would be too full and not shut.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Either the heat indicator on my unit is broken or Conair needs to work on making them all better because it never turned on that I could tell,</li>
            <li>I love the way my hair looks in hot rollers , but honestly I  loose the clips and end up with weird dents etc.</li>
            <li>It is supposed to turn from red to white when the curlers are ready; what it actually does is fade from red to no color.  </li>
            <li>When I try to get all my hair in rollers between the 12, then there is too much hair and the curls fall out due to gravity &amp;</li>
            <li>You have to use very small sections in order for your hair to fit into each of the rollers.  </li>
            <li>The curls produced by these curlers are pretty enough, but not worth the time and effort.</li>
            <li>The Conair Infiniti Pro Secret Curl is a good idea with a few flaws.  </li>
            <li>My hair fell limp within an hour after removing the hot rollers.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t slide smoothly and there&#x27;s no easy way to get to both size rollers with one hand other than picking up the unit and turning it around</li>
            <li>The other con that is changing my mind about these hot rollers is that the curls do not last long at all.</li>
            <li>(some traditional rollers are heavy and HOT and can burn my scalp)&lt;br</li>
            <li>(some traditional rollers are heavy and HOT and can burn my scalp)  </li>
            <li>Okay, so we are dumb, but this is not a particularly user-friendly product.  </li>
            <li>They do heat up quickly, but the light is a little weird.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Wonderful product, I just wish the curlers were easier to remove from the heating unit.  </li>
            <li> and I thought it would be so perfect in the mornings</li>
            <li> I had a set like this years ago, wonderful.</li>
            <li> I think this might have been my best purchase of 2014.</li>
            <li> Perfect curls and no crease from the roller clip!  </li>
            <li> However,  I am not overly impressed ...for me..</li>
            <li> Beautiful curls.</li>
            <li> but they did a very nice job, and I looked very good if I do say</li>
            <li> Once I got the hang of using these they were really great.</li>
            <li> But... The curlers work great.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it&#x27;s great and it sits upright</li>
            <li> This product gave me the most perfect curls ever.  </li>
            <li> The curlers themselves are awesome, but I received two and the indicator light never worked on either.</li>
            <li> I really loved that set.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Good idea...poorly executed.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t hold a good curl for either one of use.</li>
            <li> The design of the heating element/storage unit is excellent, with a plastic cover that keeps the curlers clean and in place.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would like a set with MORE curlers in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> but it works  better on her hair!</li>
            <li> It kind of defeats the purpose imo.</li>
            <li> It kind of defeats the purpose imo.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than that problem, these are nice curlers that work well.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t use it immediately to determine if I liked it. .</li>
            <li> They were super easy to unroll out of my hair and the curls were beautiful!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product; love it and love all the curls!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Assuming you have some knowledge of how to use hot rollers, I think this is a really great set.  </li>
            <li> had no clue what I was doing, but it worked very easily, and my hair which likes to fly all over the place handled it very well.</li>
            <li> It has cups/rollers that are made of a top of rigid plastic material designed in a swirl shape with an attached shaft that leads to a silicone bottom.</li>
            <li> I plan to use this set on just the ends of my hair to give it a more finished look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because of this, the idea of clipless rollers was really, really appealing to me.  </li>
            <li> I love the features they built in.  </li>
            <li> The silicone construction is also great since it makes these more gentle on your fingers</li>
            <li> and if I put more hair into each curler, then basically the curlers won&#x27;t &#x27;snap&#x27; shut</li>
            <li> ( I have many)</li>
            <li> (which didn&#x27;t affect my rating since it&#x27;s more of a wish)</li>
            <li> (which didn&#x27;t affect my rating since it&#x27;s more of a wish)</li>
            <li> I also think that it should come with twice as many rollers in order to work for most people.</li>
            <li> Conair Infiniti curl has created for me a head of lovely shiny curls.  </li>
            <li> I am in love with this product.  </li>
            <li> I never got anything that looked more than a somewhat wavy strip of hair-no curls.  </li>
            <li> it is challenging to use</li>
            <li> I have tried many types of curlers.  </li>
            <li> These are my favorite.</li>
            <li> This probably won&#x27;t be an issue for most people (I have spine issues) but it sure was annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Four, not five, stars, because I realize that if I had a lot more hair (which I do at times) I would not be able to do all my hair at once.</li>
            <li> I guesstimated that they were good to go at around 5 minutes, which seemed about right.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I am really excited about these rollers!</li>
            <li> This is really quite handy and a nice feature.  </li>
            <li> really like using these, find them easy and make my hair look nice!</li>
            <li> For longer or thicker hair, hotter rollers might be better (I have fine, shoulder-length</li>
            <li> great item, love it, works super, fast shipping, would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, it takes 15 mins to really warm them up, and they get hot!  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to get these as I&#x27;ve been wanting them for awhile and have seen so many positive video reviews and tutorials, and the curls looked so gorgeous.</li>
            <li> It does a great job on my naturally curly hair helping control the frizzies in the winter.</li>
            <li> I thought it would work more like clipless curling irons where there is nothing to secure your hair.  </li>
            <li> but honestly, it isn&#x27;t even worth $9.  </li>
            <li> These are much more scalp friendly.  </li>
            <li> They fall out easily.</li>
            <li> This really gives you a nice 40s style wave, its sexy and bouncy.</li>
            <li> I like the design of the curlers, and in my opinion they were easy to put in the hair and take out.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s still easy to just do it in stages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Compact and easy to store&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the curls look great, and last most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> I wish this had worked out better because I love clip-less rollers (and having a roller option vs. irons) and it looks like fun.</li>
            <li> I think if your hair is thinner it would be fine.</li>
            <li> These curlers are light and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I have lots of fine wavy hair that is just below my shoulders.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m glad someone innovated a new kind of set.ickness of your hair</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m glad someone innovated a new kind of set.</li>
            <li> I like the unique design, the way it stands up on end, it turns for easy access to the curlers, and no clips or pins are involved...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my hair styled with hot rollers before by hair stylists (often for special events like weddings) and have always liked the look.  </li>
            <li> A textured surface rather than smooth plastic would do wonders.</li>
            <li> The indicator light never worked on mine, so</li>
            <li> Then just pop the bottom to secure your hair .  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There are two cons I have for these rollers.&lt;br /&gt;1. A lot of hair cannot fit into 1 roller</li>
            <li> A lot of hair cannot fit into 1 roller</li>
            <li> Then clip to secure and repeat.  </li>
            <li> There is something to secure your hair, it is just built into the curler rather than separate.  </li>
            <li> This is the light that indicates when the curlers are heated.  </li>
            <li> and I liked that it has silicone rollers-curling irons just really damage my hair.  </li>
            <li> but the light never came</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like a light.</li>
            <li> Nice natural curls with no creases , way faster than I have been able to curl my hair before.</li>
            <li> It never fails, every time I buy something from China I have to return it!!</li>
            <li> a high level, the most effective way seems be to (and obviously those experienced with hot rollers can skip this)</li>
            <li> I was in love with these rollers the first time I tried them because I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy and quick it was to roll into my hair</li>
            <li> I was really excited for this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sure these work great for people with relatively thin hair, but honestly?</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sure these work great for people with relatively thin hair, but honestly?</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First things first, I do think that whatever kind of hot rollers you use (clipless or standard) using good technique helps.  </li>
            <li> I hardly ever write reviews - but I feel compelled to tell everyone that these are the best rollers that I have ever used - ever.  </li>
            <li> They looked nice and curled very fast, but didn&#x27;t have much hold.  </li>
            <li> These are a great update to traditional hot rollers</li>
            <li> This system could potentially be really good because I like how it is &amp;#34;clipless&amp;#34; but they DEFINITELY need to be bigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let cool for 15-20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That isn&#x27;t true.  </li>
            <li> The concept is cool ...</li>
            <li> It just says to wait til they&#x27;re cool.</li>
            <li> It seems like it would work well on most hair, mine just does not curl very well.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product and keep it because these hot rollers are the easiest and most practical hot rollers I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> I like them very much for medium length kinda fine hair.</li>
            <li> I said, I have pretty fine hair and when I use rollers, I like looser curls</li>
            <li> but the more I put them to the test, the more I&#x27;m starting to regret my purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice because it does hold your hair secure but in a gentler way than standard rollers with nothing to dig into your scalp, or as often my problem, lose.  </li>
            <li> QUICK.</li>
            <li> They heat up quickly, and they curl quickly as well:</li>
            <li> The rollers themselves are soft silicone and while they are clunky, they do not hurt and are very easy on your hair.  </li>
            <li> if you are very, very familiar with hot rollers you may think you don&#x27;t like the experience at first.  </li>
            <li> loved playing with these, I have over shoulder long  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always washed my hair every day and although my hair is fine and not thick, the 1-inch swath of hair you are directed to part off to wind around the shaft of the roller filled the roller</li>
            <li> this is not a serious product for an adult woman looking to get gorgeous curls.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair that never holds a curl</li>
            <li> But as much as I practiced with this, my hair is just too fine and the curlers would just slide out.  </li>
            <li> Were I still managing beauty salons, I am sure I would supply each station with one of these however, as it is pretty clever.</li>
            <li> they told her the light should come to let you know when it is ready for use.</li>
            <li> I did not like that the ready indicator light never came on even after 45 minutes of warming up</li>
            <li> They come out looser and more natural</li>
            <li> They come out looser and more natural looking.  </li>
            <li> The silicone (soft rubbery material) protects hair from heat, so is great, except in this case, there are just NOT enough curlers, period.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get any volume near the top of my head from these rollers -</li>
            <li> Not to be superficial, but the unit design is pretty cool as well.</li>
            <li> I get great concentrated curl near the bottom though - so I&#x27;m still using the root volumizer attachment on my flat iron for that.</li>
            <li> I really wish it came with more rollers or if we have the option to buy more rollers because 12 rollers barely cover my whole head.</li>
            <li> The rollers fall right out of my hair.  </li>
            <li> light is pretty much non-existent...</li>
            <li> And even when you&#x27;re used to it, it can&#x27;t fit much hair and you definitely need more than twelve.</li>
            <li> I wanted to see how long they lasted on their own</li>
            <li> Took me about 5-7 minutes to pop all 12 rollers in my hair - very fast and easy for busy mornings&lt;</li>
            <li> At first look</li>
            <li> but my first attempt was a disaster.  </li>
            <li> You must follow the instructions exactly ... also be able to identify the medium from the larger curlers ... and Practice using them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I saw the ad for clip-less/ pin-less  hot rollers  .  </li>
            <li> They get hot but not too hot where you will burn yourself</li>
            <li> They get hot but not too hot where you will burn yourself  - NO CLIPS OR PINS &#x3D;</li>
            <li> There are ample tutorials about hot rollers (with pictures) on the internet</li>
            <li> I love that the case rotates so you can access only 6 curlers on the time, keeping the rest of the set hot.  </li>
            <li> Once I unroll the first section, it takes another 5 minutes of reheating the rollers again before I can use them to finish my hair.</li>
            <li> The first time I used these without the iron, I ended up with what my kiddo called The Harry Styles which wasn&#x27;t what I was going for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but when we tried it would get hot</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a compact roller set that I really like!</li>
            <li> importantly I love the absence of clips.  </li>
            <li> I really love that the plastic rollers hardly touch the heat, so they don&#x27;t really burn your hands much like other curlers: the soft rubbery material used underneath that does get hot, is reasonably easy not to touch too much while you are rolling: would love to see more of this material used in curler sets!</li>
            <li> so the only way I knew the rollers were ready to use was by touching them during the warm-up period.</li>
            <li> I think it could be fun for a 14 year old to use at a sleep over for fun.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s worth investigating them if you are new to hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> My shoulder-length long hair worked better, and resulted in lose curls.</li>
            <li> I never knew when I should be using them, so I usually waited a fair amount of time before using.  </li>
            <li> They are natural, full bouncy curls - and you look like you just stepped out of a salon.  </li>
            <li> in ten minutes, I had pleasant, loose curls.  </li>
            <li> The curlers stayed warm to the touch for about a half an hour</li>
            <li> Short Answer- Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I never saw any sort of light, and had to keep guessing if it was hot enough or not.</li>
            <li> The curls set easily and last.  </li>
            <li> The build quality is good and seems like it should last a long time.  </li>
            <li> and you have no idea which are the large and which are the medium</li>
            <li> Significantly easier to roll into your hair than traditional hot rollers</li>
            <li> (I have asian fine hair).</li>
            <li> (I have asian fine hair).</li>
            <li> The curls come out so much better than any other hot roller device</li>
            <li> She had a very hard time figuring out how to rotate the container to access the curlers - I had to show her twice that instead of twisting the top by the handle, you just hold the top and twist the translucent plastic to access the curlers.  </li>
            <li> Overall the idea is great, but the design could use a little work.  </li>
            <li> Nice carrying handle and it stores in a compact little corner ready to be used when you need it.</li>
            <li> , the  upright box is a pain, what happened to the flat easy to to use box?</li>
            <li> The curls take better on freshly washed hair and with some styling/curl activating product in it, but for me the curls still fell limp at the end of my days.</li>
            <li> Not only will you not have enough rollers to do your entire head at the same time, but it does not produce any impressive curls.  </li>
            <li> results are very pleasing</li>
            <li> Fast heat up.</li>
            <li> If I put too much hair in one roller, the curl will not take at all.</li>
            <li> Fast heat up</li>
            <li> so if you have thicker hair, 12 rollers probably will not cover your whole head.&lt;br</li>
            <li> On my fine asian hair, I feel like the curls do not hold for long even with a strong hold hair spray.</li>

            <li> On my fine asian hair, I feel like the curls do not hold for long even with a strong hold hair spray.</li>
            <li> Much of it, for me, has to do with the clips because I find them finicky to work with - they dig into my scalp, they can be problematic to position, they get lost, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Start with a section of your hair closest to the hairline and pull it straight up.  </li>
            <li> I really, really like them.  </li>
            <li> I typically really like the look of jumbo rollers and</li>
            <li> &#x27;I&#x27;m ready&#x27;</li>
            <li> and since I was getting ready for my sister in-laws baby shower, I ended up having to redo my whole head so that all of my hair could be set.</li>
            <li> the thought of buying extra curlers for these to stick in slots as they become available as I&#x27;m setting does not really appeal to me, especially storage wise.</li>
            <li> the thought of buying extra curlers for these to stick in slots as they become available as I&#x27;m setting does not really appeal to me, especially storage wise.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how 12 one in sections would cover anyone&#x27;s whole head.  </li>
            <li> There doesn&#x27;t appear to be an actual light at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it is portable and doesn&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
            <li> They are a struggle to put in and very time consuming.  </li>
            <li> I am far from a girly girl, but these looked like fun, and I thought I would give them a try for those moments</li>
            <li> things surprised me, but overall I am quite pleased with these rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have thick/long hair there is no way 12 rollers is enough , but they heat pretty quickly</li>
            <li> - I really like how these don&#x27;t make my hair feel damaged or dry at all  - Compact and easy to store    </li>
            <li> I would have bought that originally instead of my standard set.  </li>
            <li> The product website for this product does have some tutorials, but I&#x27;ve found other videos and pictures on the web to be more helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have long fine hair</li>
            <li> Not so great, the curlers are too large and difficult to use plus the curls are so large that my hair was not curly.  </li>
            <li> These are very much like the old Conair Hotsticks.</li>
            <li> Nice curls with very little effort.</li>
            <li> I also understand you can buy more rollers, but you don&#x27;t get an extra heating unit, so in my opinion extra rollers are not going to help solve the problem of not covering the whole head.</li>
            <li> For years I could never understand why when I used hot rollers at home I never could get it to replicate how it looked when a professional used them.  </li>
            <li> Also, depending on the thickness of your hair, this might not be enough to do a full head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I think this is such a cool set.  </li>
            <li> , this might not be enough to do a full head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I think this is such a cool set.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty short, fine hair, but even so, I could barely get more than a few strands in each roller.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of very long hair and it held it securely.</li>
            <li> Also, the rubber part that &amp;#34;snaps&amp;#34; shut on your hair is also easily snapped closed in the device.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d have to pull them back off, open them, repeat (usually more than once).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Rolling takes practice, just be sure to pop them close tight, or they fall out.</li>
            <li> This set was highly recommended on a blog I follow, but I was thoroughly unimpressed.</li>
            <li> Without any reviews to read I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for these rollers</li>
            <li> - Took me about 5-7 minutes to pop all 12 rollers in my hair - very fast and easy for busy mornings  - Cools down in about 15-20 minutes  </li>
            <li> The size of the rollers is okay, but there is little difference between the two sizes.  </li>
            <li> ....to quickly and easily tame my daughters mousy-fine hair without having to use a ton of hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, quick to heat up, silicone does NOT get tangled in her</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t live up to it&#x27;s promise though, having enough minor issues from start-up to comb-out that my rating is just &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; vs. &amp;#34;I love it.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is pourly made, not easy to use and surely does not delver what it is promsing</li>
            <li> and I was only able to get the loose curls.  </li>
            <li> After two full rotations you tuck the loose ends around the roller and continue rolling to your scalp.  </li>
            <li> The indicator light on the machine is supposed to go from red to white to indicate readiness, but mine didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> As many have said, there are just too few curlers in the &amp;#34;kit&amp;#34; to cover any adult&#x27;s head.  </li>
            <li> So far I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is due to the unique new technology of this set that eliminates the nubs and clips of traditional hot rollers.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re curling 1&amp;#34; sections, sure, but if you have hard to curl or thick hair, you&#x27;re not going to get amazing</li>
            <li> So after the first somewhat confounding use, the system works well enough.  </li>
            <li> Does not heat up hot enough to hold curls</li>
            <li> when hot than standard rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did take a long time for the curlers to heat up, actually the light never went on</li>
            <li> Because of this, these curlers were nowhere near hot enough to accomodate the thicker sections.</li>
            <li> The outside of the curler may feel cool, but it won&#x27;t have curled properly.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s first comment was that it has no On/Off light - no way to know that it&#x27;s plugged in and heating, so I pulled out the instructions and read that there is in fact a small, cheap LED that dimly lights &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; (really pink) when you plug it in and goes &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; (in fact, simply OFF) when the curlers are heated.  </li>
            <li> A couple years back I bought a new standard set of hot rollers, but never took them out of the box!  </li>
            <li> Granted, my hair is pretty thick and straight and takes pretty high heat to curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this set has only large.</li>
            <li> so I left them in while I finished getting ready.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is it needs more curlers.</li>
            <li> It wont work on very short hair, nor will it take much hair per roller.</li>
            <li> These rollers do not work on second day hair very well.</li>
            <li> Curls come out soft, bouncy and voluminous</li>
            <li> - Curls come out soft, bouncy and voluminous</li>
            <li> it supposed comes on red when you plug it in and goes off when ready...</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s not enough to get a reasonable amount of hair sectioned off and rolled to the scalp.wasn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s not enough to get a reasonable amount of hair sectioned off and rolled to the scalp.</li>
            <li> The only part I don&#x27;t like is that it takes two settings to do my whole head.</li>
            <li> I do have some natural curve, so there was something for the curlers to work with -</li>
            <li> but my hair holds a curl really well when using a regular curling iron.  </li>
            <li> Not a great product - for a few pennies more they could have used a true multi-colored LED instead of relying on the darkness-emitting property of the diode to indicate that the curlers are sufficiently hot.</li>
            <li> but if you have longer thick hair you need to order more curlers to meet your needs.</li>
            <li> I still do prefer these over the other traditional hot rollers, but because they&#x27;re not working out for me in the way I intended them to, I&#x27;m debating whether or not I want to keep these hot rollers.&lt;br /&gt;//end of</li>
            <li> The locking design in your hair, not the traditional clips, was really easy to roll your hair into and then locked in tight.</li>
            <li> By the time you move the clear &amp;#34;cover&amp;#34; over and remove a curler and then close it to keep the others hot, wrap a 1&amp;#34; wide piece of hair and get it to your scalp,the curler has lost a lot of heat.  </li>
            <li> this design is really limited, in the same amount of space my old box set held twice as many curlers, both large and small.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s neat, but even using a small piece of hair, my hair fell down way too easily, which means that the hot curlers are down on my forehead and hot, which I really didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> I have very thick but very fine medium length hair.  </li>
            <li> However because I&#x27;ve never seen or heard of clipless hot rollers before I had absolutely no idea what to expect when these arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The construction of these wasn&#x27;t exactly what I expected, though I do still like it.  </li>
            <li> All of the pros I listed below I still believe are true, however after experimenting with these for some time, I think the few cons out weigh the pros.</li>
            <li> I really like how these don&#x27;t make my hair feel damaged or dry at all&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;You wouldn&#x27;t think that 12 rollers wouldn&#x27;t be enough for your whole head, but if you consider the fact each curler should only have a 1&amp;#34; section of hair, you&#x27;ll find you run out of curlers</li>
            <li> If I stick with small sections, the curls do come out beautiful, but it takes 2x longer to curl my whole head with these rollers because I have to wait until one side cools, unroll them and pop them back into the heater and then use them on the other half of my head--this is just not very practical for me because I&#x27;m looking for a less damaging way to curl my hair quickly in the mornings before I have to leave.</li>
            <li> Major annoyance.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair so need to order more curlers</li>
            <li> At least, it&#x27;s referred to as a light. . .</li>
            <li> The actual roller portion is made of a soft silicone feeling plastic .  </li>
            <li> I had trouble with larger sections as it would be too full and not shut.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Either the heat indicator on my unit is broken or Conair needs to work on making them all better because it never turned on that I could tell,</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair looks in hot rollers , but honestly I  loose the clips and end up with weird dents etc.</li>
            <li> It is supposed to turn from red to white when the curlers are ready; what it actually does is fade from red to no color.  </li>
            <li> When I try to get all my hair in rollers between the 12, then there is too much hair and the curls fall out due to gravity &amp;</li>
            <li> You have to use very small sections in order for your hair to fit into each of the rollers.  </li>
            <li> The curls produced by these curlers are pretty enough, but not worth the time and effort.</li>
            <li> The Conair Infiniti Pro Secret Curl is a good idea with a few flaws.  </li>
            <li> My hair fell limp within an hour after removing the hot rollers.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t slide smoothly and there&#x27;s no easy way to get to both size rollers with one hand other than picking up the unit and turning it around</li>
            <li> The other con that is changing my mind about these hot rollers is that the curls do not last long at all.</li>
            <li> (some traditional rollers are heavy and HOT and can burn my scalp)&lt;br</li>
            <li> (some traditional rollers are heavy and HOT and can burn my scalp)  </li>
            <li> Okay, so we are dumb, but this is not a particularly user-friendly product.  </li>
            <li> They do heat up quickly, but the light is a little weird.</li>
            <li> I needed two sets for my thick hair, but they are worth it.</li>
            <li> I get about half a day before they calm down to waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Large could be fuscia and small could be purple.</li>
            <li> I have tried it on both long and short hair.</li>
            <li> If you have long hair, this will only curl your ends.</li>
            <li> I also think the temperature level is sufficient, even as someone who has stubborn hair that often requires the highest settings on flat irons and curling irons.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would only recommend this for people with long hair.  </li>
            <li> I read in the instructions that they come in two sizes, but it&#x27;s not clear at all that there are two different sizes until you pull them out and use them.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re a pro at sectioning, rolling and pinning it may not be as much of an issue but the way Conair designed the unit, with the plastic cover you have to twist open over each roller area, is clunky and hard to deal with one-handed.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m not in love with this particular set of curlers, I like the base idea of this product, it just needs a lot of improvements:&lt;br</li>
            <li> The curls don&#x27;t hold for a long time.</li>
            <li> The only reason i am taking a star off is because these are really not curlers, these are wavers.</li>
            <li> the long version.  </li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t take long to heat up.  </li>
            <li> This is because I have long hair.</li>
            <li> does not work for really long hair</li>
            <li> but since my hair is so thick, I usually leave curlers in longer to really secure it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only down side is there are only 12 curlers.  </li>
            <li> I had trouble with small sections as it would just roll right out.  </li>
            <li> The other catch 22 is that when I put smaller amount of hair, the curlers stay on my hair.</li>
            <li> : Divide your dry hair into sections with clips.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s this red thing that turns white, it looks like a plastic dot, not a light.</li>
            <li> I use every single one of the 12 rollers and still could use another 4 or so to cover my head.</li>
            <li> liked the enclosed tower since my previous purchases of electric rollers always resulted in broken plastic tops and then later, dusty rollers that I would need to wash.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this product even after reading all the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After an hour and a half in my hair, my hair was barely wavy when I took them out, and I do mean barely.</li>
            <li> (I left one side in for an hour and a half, and the other side in for 45 minutes.</li>
            <li> I will give it one more shot but bad experience.</li>
            <li> After the rollers are heated, you wind your hair around the shaft and snap the roller closed.</li>
            <li> I don’t want to have to reheat the rollers for a 2nd round of rolling my hair.</li>
            <li> Oh, and they were a bit heavier than I expected.</li>
            <li> I had to do half of mine and then go back and do the other half</li>
            <li> Overall pretty disappointing</li>
            <li> Someone with long thick hair will need extra rollers.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last all that long, but that is probably due to the humid rainy weather we have been having lately.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since my hair is long &amp; thick (past my shoulders, close to the middle of my back) and a small amount of hair can be used in the curler, there aren&#x27;t enough rollers to cover my head.</li>
            <li> Which brings me to my other con:</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t enough of them, they&#x27;re too small for any length of hair, and you can&#x27;t control the direction of the curl.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind because I do other things while this is going on like housework, make-up and breakfast, and play with</li>
            <li> It was not worth the time I spent using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> once I realized my sections just had to be bigger, but I was expecting at least a LOOSE curl.</li>
            <li> First of all the instructions were printed in a sloppy and confusing way, but that was a minor flaw.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using them daily or at least every other day.</li>
            <li> Nope, It hardly looked any different than it did before I set my hair.</li>
            <li> If these had any chance working for me, and to be set 1&amp;#34; at a time, I&#x27;d need at LEAST double that to set all my hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product simply isn&#x27;t capable of it.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it because you can&#x27;t put enough hair in if you have thick hair</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s not yet clear, I absolutely HATE hot roller clips</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s not yet clear, I absolutely HATE hot roller clips</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Cools down in about 15-20 minutes</li>
            <li> and they just start falling down.</li>
            <li> Even the ones that stayed rolled down half way away from my scalp.  </li>
            <li> Especially since I could only do one part of my head, that part of my head felt like it was being weighted down, which put some weird pressure on my neck.</li>
            <li> I am black with relaxed hair</li>
            <li> I bought these because they seemed easier to put in and less damaging to the hair.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s typical-</li>
            <li> The rollers are not easy to put in and when you &amp;#34;clip&amp;#34; them shut there is a mark left on your hair from the hard plastic casing the silicone roller is inside.  </li>
            <li> after heating the curlers, you just wind a small amount of hair around the curler, and push it closed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I think if you have shorter, shoulder length hair, this could work for you but unfortunately for me, I&#x27;ll be returning these and continue the hunt of finding rollers that I can live with.</li>
            <li> but she says it makes her hair a little frizzy.</li>
            <li> I do think there is a little bit of a learning curve to use these so</li>
            <li> And with the twisting, and then the wrapping around the curler, it sort of snagged a little, and it created the UGLIEST curls.</li>
            <li> a neat little gadget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They rubber material is heavy that they are made of.</li>
            <li> So far I find this to be kinda difficult to use and gives me a so so result.  </li>
            <li> They do not feel heavy at all when they&#x27;re sitting on your head</li>
            <li> They do not feel heavy at all when they&#x27;re sitting on your head</li>
            <li> Place a roller under the hair a few inches from the ends.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t specifically notice any difference, though these don&#x27;t seem to be unnecessarily harsh on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Take a small section of your hair , put the roller midway up the section, wrap the bottom of section around and roll up.</li>
            <li> but no more curls.</li>
            <li> but no more curls.</li>
            <li> I imagine these would especially be a godsend with children because I have terrible memories of my mother putting hot rollers in my hair for skating and dance performances and all the poking and pain that ensues.  </li>
            <li> Sorry Conair, I like your products, but it&#x27;s back to product development on this one.</li>
            <li> and I have medium length hair and found the smaller sized curlers useless.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure why I thought this would</li>
            <li> I am feeling too lazy to get my hair cut, but it is all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, it&#x27;s incredibly difficult to tell the small curlers from the large just by sight, which makes ease of use difficult while you&#x27;re setting your hair.</li>
            <li> Too hard to do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s really hard to know when they&#x27;re done, too.</li>
            <li> But since my hair is so thick, it can be hard to gauge.</li>
            <li> you need two sets at least.  </li>
            <li> This product sucks.</li>
            <li> but I thought that at least, I get something from it</li>
            <li> This product is not for people with thick hair.  </li>
            <li> To preface, I have really thick hair, so maybe that makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Not good.  </li>
            <li> But for me, the worst two cons are, I have thick, long hair, and there is no way that there are enough curlers in here to cover all my hair: I tried and failed.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t work on short to medium hair:(</li>
            <li> Very hard to keep the rollers in.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and these curlers would not stay in.</li>
            <li> This Conair Infiniti Pro Secret Curl is a novel idea.</li>
            <li> Alas, all I had was what came with the set</li>

            <li> Unfortunately, these didn&#x27;t work for my hair.</li>
            <li> Kinda disappointing.</li>

            <li> So I found it annoying that they didn&#x27;t have any suggested amount of time to leave the curlers in.</li>
            <li> But I hated these curlers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing I hated was that I had to twist my hair before I put it in the curler.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Once I got the hang of using these they were really great. My hair is medium length and on the thinner side. Someone with long thick hair will need extra rollers.</li>
            <li> I was really excited for this product. But it takes a while to get used to. And even when you&#x27;re used to it, it can&#x27;t fit much hair and you definitely need more than twelve. Overall pretty disappointing so I&#x27;ll stick with a curling iron or standard curlers. I returned mine.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s first comment was that it has no On/Off light - no way to know that it&#x27;s plugged in and heating, so I pulled out the instructions and read that there is in fact a small, cheap LED that dimly lights &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; (really pink) when you plug it in and goes &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; (in fact, simply OFF) when the curlers are heated.  She had a very hard time figuring out how to rotate the container to access the curlers - I had to show her twice that instead of twisting the top by the handle, you just hold the top and twist the translucent plastic to access the curlers.  Okay, so we are dumb, but this is not a particularly user-friendly product.  The curlers themselves work well enough.  I read in the instructions that they come in two sizes, but it&#x27;s not clear at all that there are two different sizes until you pull them out and use them.  So after the first somewhat confounding use, the system works well enough.  Not a great product - for a few pennies more they could have used a true multi-colored LED instead of relying on the darkness-emitting property of the diode to indicate that the curlers are sufficiently hot.</li>
            <li> This Conair Infiniti Pro Secret Curl is a novel idea. It has cups/rollers that are made of a top of rigid plastic material designed in a swirl shape with an attached shaft that leads to a silicone bottom. After the rollers are heated, you wind your hair around the shaft and snap the roller closed. Your hair remains inside the heated roller unit until it cools and when you unwind your hair from the shaft, it is curled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set comes with 12 rollers in two sizes but it is difficult to tell the sizes apart. The heated rollers remain inside the tower and you rotate the inner roller holder to expose and access each roller. The silicone is supposed to make your hair shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set did not work well for my daughter’s shorter hair. My shoulder-length long hair worked better, and resulted in lose curls. I&#x27;ve always washed my hair every day and although my hair is fine and not thick, the 1-inch swath of hair you are directed to part off to wind around the shaft of the roller filled the roller and there weren’t enough rollers to roll all of my hair. My hair did look a bit shinier, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the enclosed tower since my previous purchases of electric rollers always resulted in broken plastic tops and then later, dusty rollers that I would need to wash. I also like the no clip &amp; cord storage around the base design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scarcity of rollers is a deal breaker for me. I don’t want to have to reheat the rollers for a 2nd round of rolling my hair. I would need two of these to do the job once. I plan to use this set on just the ends of my hair to give it a more finished look.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t work on short to medium hair:(</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, I just wish the curlers were easier to remove from the heating unit.  A textured surface rather than smooth plastic would do wonders.</li>
            <li> ....to quickly and easily tame my daughters mousy-fine hair without having to use a ton of hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, quick to heat up, silicone does NOT get tangled in her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a win-win product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing: I would like a set with MORE curlers in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> These curlers actually do everything that they advertise that they do! It did take a long time for the curlers to heat up, actually the light never went on I just started using them. The locking design in your hair, not the traditional clips, was really easy to roll your hair into and then locked in tight. I have a lot of very long hair and it held it securely. The curlers stayed warm to the touch for about a half an hour so I left them in while I finished getting ready. They were super easy to unroll out of my hair and the curls were beautiful! Big bouncy and shiny curls! I wanted to see how long they lasted on their own so I didn&#x27;t even put hairspray in. The curls lasted all day and I got complimented on my hair several times. These are a great update to traditional hot rollers and I know I will be using them all the time.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is it needs more curlers. It does a great job on my naturally curly hair helping control the frizzies in the winter.</li>
            <li> Did not give me a curl!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it because you can&#x27;t put enough hair in if you have thick hair you need two sets at least.  I think if your hair is thinner it would be fine. I sent it back and was promptly refunded</li>
            <li> Granddaughter  loves this!..got it for me but it works  better on her hair!</li>
            <li> Not so great, the curlers are too large and difficult to use plus the curls are so large that my hair was not curly.  Added tons of height to my hair.</li>
            <li> Did not work. Was a gift for person out of town.  Must return.</li>
            <li> Does not hold a curl for thicker hair. Not enough curlers.</li>
            <li> curls don&#x27;t last.  Too hard to do.</li>
            <li> great item, love it, works super, fast shipping, would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. This was a present for my wife. She likes it but she says it makes her hair a little frizzy. The curls don&#x27;t hold for a long time. They fall out easily.</li>
            <li> Very hard to keep the rollers in. They rubber material is heavy that they are made of. I have tried it on both long and short hair. I would not recommend this curler set.</li>
            <li> So far I find this to be kinda difficult to use and gives me a so so result.  Kinda disappointing.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping. It was wreath the price. At first look</li>
            <li> Ugh....I am going to try again but my first attempt was a disaster.  The rollers fall right out of my hair.  I have very thick but very fine medium length hair.  I had trouble with larger sections as it would be too full and not shut.  I had trouble with small sections as it would just roll right out.  Even the ones that stayed rolled down half way away from my scalp.  Not good.  Hair looked terrible.  I will give it one more shot but bad experience.</li>
            <li> I wish Amazon would specify where the products are made in big letters. This product sucks. And giess where is it made? In China! It never fails, every time I buy something from China I have to return it!! This product is pourly made, not easy to use and surely does not delver what it is promsing</li>
            <li> The only reason i am taking a star off is because these are really not curlers, these are wavers. This really gives you a nice 40s style wave, its sexy and bouncy. I like them very much for medium length kinda fine hair.</li>
            <li> Does not heat up hot enough to hold curls</li>
            <li> They are difficult to put in, difficult to keep in, and difficult to take out. They do not heat uniformly. The light that indicates readiness was broken on my set. This set was highly recommended on a blog I follow, but I was thoroughly unimpressed.</li>
            <li> This product is not for people with thick hair.  Not only will you not have enough rollers to do your entire head at the same time, but it does not produce any impressive curls.  I like the design of the curlers, and in my opinion they were easy to put in the hair and take out.  The indicator light never worked on mine, so I never knew when I should be using them, so I usually waited a fair amount of time before using.  I also understand you can buy more rollers, but you don&#x27;t get an extra heating unit, so in my opinion extra rollers are not going to help solve the problem of not covering the whole head.</li>
            <li> This is a nifty hot curler set for those with longer hair that wish to make small curls. It wont work on very short hair, nor will it take much hair per roller. This is due to the unique new technology of this set that eliminates the nubs and clips of traditional hot rollers. after heating the curlers, you just wind a small amount of hair around the curler, and push it closed. Unfortunately for me, I obtained this product to review for my mother who&#x27;s hair is too short, and my wife who doesn&#x27;t want the bother, and prefers a curling iron. Were I still managing beauty salons, I am sure I would supply each station with one of these however, as it is pretty clever. It just didn&#x27;t work for my house.</li>
            <li> You must follow the instructions exactly ... also be able to identify the medium from the larger curlers ... and Practice using them.&lt;br /&gt;The results are very pleasing but if you have longer thick hair you need to order more curlers to meet your needs.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product; love it and love all the curls!!</li>
            <li> If you have long hair, this will only curl your ends. This system could potentially be really good because I like how it is &amp;#34;clipless&amp;#34; but they DEFINITELY need to be bigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my hair is long &amp; thick (past my shoulders, close to the middle of my back) and a small amount of hair can be used in the curler, there aren&#x27;t enough rollers to cover my head. The other catch 22 is that when I put smaller amount of hair, the curlers stay on my hair. When I try to get all my hair in rollers between the 12, then there is too much hair and the curls fall out due to gravity &amp; the fact they can&#x27;t close well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think if you have shorter, shoulder length hair, this could work for you but unfortunately for me, I&#x27;ll be returning these and continue the hunt of finding rollers that I can live with.</li>
            <li> Short Answer- Easy to use. Fast heat up. So far I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the long version.  I saw the ad for clip-less/ pin-less  hot rollers  .  I love the way my hair looks in hot rollers , but honestly I  loose the clips and end up with weird dents etc. all over my head etc.  Without any reviews to read I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for these rollers but I figured for $60 why not be the guinea pig?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They take maybe 3 minutes to heat up .  The actual roller portion is made of a soft silicone feeling plastic .  Take a small section of your hair , put the roller midway up the section, wrap the bottom of section around and roll up. Then just pop the bottom to secure your hair .  Once your hair cools, pop the bottom back out. Unroll . No crease. Easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If you have thick/long hair there is no way 12 rollers is enough , but they heat pretty quickly so it&#x27;s still easy to just do it in stages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am really excited about these rollers! Nice natural curls with no creases , way faster than I have been able to curl my hair before.</li>
            <li> //Edit&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had these rollers for almost two weeks now and I&#x27;ve been using them daily or at least every other day. All of the pros I listed below I still believe are true, however after experimenting with these for some time, I think the few cons out weigh the pros. I really wish it came with more rollers or if we have the option to buy more rollers because 12 rollers barely cover my whole head. If I put too much hair in one roller, the curl will not take at all. If I stick with small sections, the curls do come out beautiful, but it takes 2x longer to curl my whole head with these rollers because I have to wait until one side cools, unroll them and pop them back into the heater and then use them on the other half of my head--this is just not very practical for me because I&#x27;m looking for a less damaging way to curl my hair quickly in the mornings before I have to leave. The other con that is changing my mind about these hot rollers is that the curls do not last long at all. The curls take better on freshly washed hair and with some styling/curl activating product in it, but for me the curls still fell limp at the end of my days. These rollers do not work on second day hair very well. My hair fell limp within an hour after removing the hot rollers. I really wanted to love this product and keep it because these hot rollers are the easiest and most practical hot rollers I&#x27;ve ever tried. I was in love with these rollers the first time I tried them because I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy and quick it was to roll into my hair and I thought it would be so perfect in the mornings but the more I put them to the test, the more I&#x27;m starting to regret my purchase. I still do prefer these over the other traditional hot rollers, but because they&#x27;re not working out for me in the way I intended them to, I&#x27;m debating whether or not I want to keep these hot rollers.&lt;br /&gt;//end of edit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Fast heat up, about 2 minutes&lt;br /&gt;- Significantly easier to roll into your hair than traditional hot rollers&lt;br /&gt;- They get hot but not too hot where you will burn yourself&lt;br /&gt;- NO CLIPS OR PINS &#x3D; NO CREASES&lt;br /&gt;- They do not feel heavy at all when they&#x27;re sitting on your head (some traditional rollers are heavy and HOT and can burn my scalp)&lt;br /&gt;- Took me about 5-7 minutes to pop all 12 rollers in my hair - very fast and easy for busy mornings&lt;br /&gt;- Cools down in about 15-20 minutes&lt;br /&gt;- Curls come out soft, bouncy and voluminous (I have asian fine hair).

            <li> The curlers themselves are awesome, but I received two and the indicator light never worked on either. Major annoyance. But... The curlers work great. I needed two sets for my thick hair, but they are worth it. Beautiful curls.</li>
            <li> I had a set like this years ago, wonderful. I really loved that set.&lt;br /&gt;I loved playing with these, I have over shoulder long  hair.&lt;br /&gt;First, it takes 15 mins to really warm them up, and they get hot!  Rolling takes practice, just be sure to pop them close tight, or they fall out. the curls look great, and last most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons, the  upright box is a pain, what happened to the flat easy to to use box? hint , the open space is supposed to rotate, holding things in and out, its a pain.&lt;br /&gt;Also this design is really limited, in the same amount of space my old box set held twice as many curlers, both large and small. this set has only large.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my hair styled with hot rollers before by hair stylists (often for special events like weddings) and have always liked the look.  A couple years back I bought a new standard set of hot rollers, but never took them out of the box!  Much of it, for me, has to do with the clips because I find them finicky to work with - they dig into my scalp, they can be problematic to position, they get lost, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of this, the idea of clipless rollers was really, really appealing to me.  I had no idea such a thing existed or I would have bought that originally instead of my standard set.  However because I&#x27;ve never seen or heard of clipless hot rollers before I had absolutely no idea what to expect when these arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things surprised me, but overall I am quite pleased with these rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First things first, I do think that whatever kind of hot rollers you use (clipless or standard) using good technique helps.  For years I could never understand why when I used hot rollers at home I never could get it to replicate how it looked when a professional used them.  Turned out I was using them in correctly.  There are ample tutorials about hot rollers (with pictures) on the internet so it&#x27;s worth investigating them if you are new to hot rollers.  The product website for this product does have some tutorials, but I&#x27;ve found other videos and pictures on the web to be more helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At a high level, the most effective way seems be to (and obviously those experienced with hot rollers can skip this): Divide your dry hair into sections with clips.  Start with a section of your hair closest to the hairline and pull it straight up.  Place a roller under the hair a few inches from the ends.  Leave the ends out, and keeping the hair pulled taut, start rolling away from your face.  After two full rotations you tuck the loose ends around the roller and continue rolling to your scalp.  Then clip to secure and repeat.  Let cool for 15-20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Assuming you have some knowledge of how to use hot rollers, I think this is a really great set.  I love the features they built in.  I love that the case rotates so you can access only 6 curlers on the time, keeping the rest of the set hot.  This is really quite handy and a nice feature.  The silicone construction is also great since it makes these more gentle on your fingers when hot than standard rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly I love the absence of clips.  The construction of these wasn&#x27;t exactly what I expected, though I do still like it.  I thought it would work more like clipless curling irons where there is nothing to secure your hair.  That isn&#x27;t true.  There is something to secure your hair, it is just built into the curler rather than separate.  Essentially, they snap shut.  It&#x27;s nice because it does hold your hair secure but in a gentler way than standard rollers with nothing to dig into your scalp, or as often my problem, lose.  I do think there is a little bit of a learning curve to use these so if you are very, very familiar with hot rollers you may think you don&#x27;t like the experience at first.  But for me after I got used to them I really, really like them.  I imagine these would especially be a godsend with children because I have terrible memories of my mother putting hot rollers in my hair for skating and dance performances and all the poking and pain that ensues.  These are much more scalp friendly.  I also think the temperature level is sufficient, even as someone who has stubborn hair that often requires the highest settings on flat irons and curling irons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I can&#x27;t vouch for is the added shine from the silicone.  I didn&#x27;t specifically notice any difference, though these don&#x27;t seem to be unnecessarily harsh on my hair.  I will also say I wish the rollers were a bit bigger.  I typically really like the look of jumbo rollers and both sizes seem to be much smaller than that.  Also, depending on the thickness of your hair, this might not be enough to do a full head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this is such a cool set.  If it&#x27;s not yet clear, I absolutely HATE hot roller clips so I&#x27;m glad someone innovated a new kind of set.ickness of your hair, this might not be enough to do a full head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this is such a cool set.

            <li> While I&#x27;m not in love with this particular set of curlers, I like the base idea of this product, it just needs a lot of improvements:&lt;br /&gt;The Pros: I like the unique design, the way it stands up on end, it turns for easy access to the curlers, and no clips or pins are involved...I really love that the plastic rollers hardly touch the heat, so they don&#x27;t really burn your hands much like other curlers: the soft rubbery material used underneath that does get hot, is reasonably easy not to touch too much while you are rolling: would love to see more of this material used in curler sets! The silicone (soft rubbery material) protects hair from heat, so is great, except in this case, there are just NOT enough curlers, period.&lt;br /&gt;The Cons: the &#x27;I&#x27;m ready&#x27; light is pretty much non-existent...it supposed comes on red when you plug it in and goes off when ready...yeah, I never saw any sort of light, and had to keep guessing if it was hot enough or not. it&#x27;s also a bit weird to get used to where/how the curlers are located so you can turn and use them...and you have no idea which are the large and which are the medium: that should be labeled. But for me, the worst two cons are, I have thick, long hair, and there is no way that there are enough curlers in here to cover all my hair: I tried and failed. and if I put more hair into each curler, then basically the curlers won&#x27;t &#x27;snap&#x27; shut and they just start falling down. Which brings me to my other con: it&#x27;s neat, but even using a small piece of hair, my hair fell down way too easily, which means that the hot curlers are down on my forehead and hot, which I really didn&#x27;t like. Overall, a neat product idea that could use further development, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it...even those who had thinner hair said that it doesn&#x27;t work well for them either. Sorry Conair, I like your products, but it&#x27;s back to product development on this one.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever write reviews - but I feel compelled to tell everyone that these are the best rollers that I have ever used - ever.  The curls come out so much better than any other hot roller device ( I have many) They are natural, full bouncy curls - and you look like you just stepped out of a salon.  I think this might have been my best purchase of 2014.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get these from Amaon, although I should have since its $10 cheaper on Amazon vs. Target, but regardless they&#x27;re going back. I was so excited to get these as I&#x27;ve been wanting them for awhile and have seen so many positive video reviews and tutorials, and the curls looked so gorgeous. Unfortunately, these didn&#x27;t work for my hair. Granted, my hair is pretty thick and straight and takes pretty high heat to curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You wouldn&#x27;t think that 12 rollers wouldn&#x27;t be enough for your whole head, but if you consider the fact each curler should only have a 1&amp;#34; section of hair, you&#x27;ll find you run out of curlers QUICK. If these had any chance working for me, and to be set 1&amp;#34; at a time, I&#x27;d need at LEAST double that to set all my hair. Alas, all I had was what came with the set and since I was getting ready for my sister in-laws baby shower, I ended up having to redo my whole head so that all of my hair could be set. Because of this, these curlers were nowhere near hot enough to accomodate the thicker sections. If you&#x27;re curling 1&amp;#34; sections, sure, but if you have hard to curl or thick hair, you&#x27;re not going to get amazing results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, it&#x27;s incredibly difficult to tell the small curlers from the large just by sight, which makes ease of use difficult while you&#x27;re setting your hair. Couldn&#x27;t they have made them different colors?! Large could be fuscia and small could be purple. Who designed these?! Also, the rubber part that &amp;#34;snaps&amp;#34; shut on your hair is also easily snapped closed in the device. They won&#x27;t heat properly this way, and you can&#x27;t tell from the front if they&#x27;ve snapped shut. Again, creating frustration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After an hour and a half in my hair, my hair was barely wavy when I took them out, and I do mean barely. I wasn&#x27;t expecting Shirley Temple curls once I realized my sections just had to be bigger, but I was expecting at least a LOOSE curl. Nope, It hardly looked any different than it did before I set my hair. Needless to say I was really disappointed and upset, especially since I didn&#x27;t have time to redo my hair before I had to leave. My hair now looks as though I haven&#x27;t done a thing to it. No wonder they call it Secret Curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure these work great for people with relatively thin hair, but honestly? the thought of buying extra curlers for these to stick in slots as they become available as I&#x27;m setting does not really appeal to me, especially storage wise. It kind of defeats the purpose imo. I&#x27;d prefer to buy a set that has enough curlers and enough spots to curl all of my hair effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the next...Needless to say I was really disappointed and upset, especially since I didn&#x27;t have time to redo my hair before I had to leave.

            <li> This item just not for me.  My hair slipped off as I was trying to put it on and I have medium length hair and found the smaller sized curlers useless.  Good idea...poorly executed.</li>
            <li> These are very much like the old Conair Hotsticks. The inside of each roller is made out of the same rubber stuff. There aren&#x27;t enough of them, they&#x27;re too small for any length of hair, and you can&#x27;t control the direction of the curl.</li>
            <li> Does not work as advertised</li>
            <li> I wish this had worked out better because I love clip-less rollers (and having a roller option vs. irons) and it looks like fun. It didn&#x27;t live up to it&#x27;s promise though, having enough minor issues from start-up to comb-out that my rating is just &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; vs. &amp;#34;I love it.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either the heat indicator on my unit is broken or Conair needs to work on making them all better because it never turned on that I could tell, so the only way I knew the rollers were ready to use was by touching them during the warm-up period. I guesstimated that they were good to go at around 5 minutes, which seemed about right. For longer or thicker hair, hotter rollers might be better (I have fine, shoulder-length hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a pro at sectioning, rolling and pinning it may not be as much of an issue but the way Conair designed the unit, with the plastic cover you have to twist open over each roller area, is clunky and hard to deal with one-handed. It doesn&#x27;t slide smoothly and there&#x27;s no easy way to get to both size rollers with one hand other than picking up the unit and turning it around and if you&#x27;re alternating sizes...you can see why this is a problem. The rollers also tended to close when I put them back on their pegs to reheat so I&#x27;d have to pull them back off, open them, repeat (usually more than once).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, I have pretty fine hair and when I use rollers, I like looser curls so I use thicker sections of hair. I use every single one of the 12 rollers and still could use another 4 or so to cover my head. Once I unroll the first section, it takes another 5 minutes of reheating the rollers again before I can use them to finish my hair. I don&#x27;t get any volume near the top of my head from these rollers - I get great concentrated curl near the bottom though - so I&#x27;m still using the root volumizer attachment on my flat iron for that. The first time I used these without the iron, I ended up with what my kiddo called The Harry Styles which wasn&#x27;t what I was going for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final thing I wish Conair would address (which didn&#x27;t affect my rating since it&#x27;s more of a wish) is that the rollers are very short. There&#x27;s only about an inch or so of usable roller area when you factor in the space needed to close it and that&#x27;s not enough to get a reasonable amount of hair sectioned off and rolled to the scalp.wasn&#x27;t what I was going for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final thing I wish Conair would address (which didn&#x27;t affect my rating since it&#x27;s more of a wish) is that the rollers are very short.

            <li> The Conair Infiniti Pro Secret Curl is a good idea with a few flaws.  First of all the instructions were printed in a sloppy and confusing way, but that was a minor flaw.  The second thing is that the instructions say to use one inch sections, but they picture the model with the 12 rollers being the only ones in her hair.  I don&#x27;t know how 12 one in sections would cover anyone&#x27;s whole head.  I had to do half of mine and then go back and do the other half and my sections were much larger than one inch.  The size of the rollers is okay, but there is little difference between the two sizes.  Neither would do well with short hair.  I would only recommend this for people with long hair.  I am black with relaxed hair and I was only able to get the loose curls.  They looked nice and curled very fast, but didn&#x27;t have much hold.  I didn&#x27;t try it with hair spray though.  The rollers are a bid awkward to use and may take some practice to master.  The indicator light on the machine is supposed to go from red to white to indicate readiness, but mine didn&#x27;t work.  I could tall be the heat coming from the machine and it didn&#x27;t take long to heat up.  The rollers themselves are soft silicone and while they are clunky, they do not hurt and are very easy on your hair.  Overall the idea is great, but the design could use a little work.  I also think that it should come with twice as many rollers in order to work for most people.</li>
            <li> Conair Infiniti curl has created for me a head of lovely shiny curls.  They don&#x27;t last all that long, but that is probably due to the humid rainy weather we have been having lately.  I get about half a day before they calm down to waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These curlers actually make my hair shinier!  The only part I don&#x27;t like is that it takes two settings to do my whole head. This is because I have long hair. So with two heat ups and 20 minutes to each set that is over an hour lead time.  I don&#x27;t mind because I do other things while this is going on like housework, make-up and breakfast, and play with my dog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like using these, find them easy and make my hair look nice!</li>
            <li> These curlers are light and easy to use.  They heat up quickly, and they curl quickly as well: in ten minutes, I had pleasant, loose curls.  The design of the heating element/storage unit is excellent, with a plastic cover that keeps the curlers clean and in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given this a five star review, except for one thing: the &amp;#34;ready dot&amp;#34;.  This is the light that indicates when the curlers are heated.  At least, it&#x27;s referred to as a light. . . It is supposed to turn from red to white when the curlers are ready; what it actually does is fade from red to no color.  There doesn&#x27;t appear to be an actual light at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that problem, these are nice curlers that work well.</li>
            <li> This product gave me the most perfect curls ever.  I am in love with this product.  Perfect curls and no crease from the roller clip!  The only down side is there are only 12 curlers.  Otherwise it&#x27;s great and it sits upright so it is portable and doesn&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself a couple of days before Christmas at my local CVS.  It was going for $79 on here and the store had it for $59 but honestly, it isn&#x27;t even worth $9.  I have fine, straight hair that never holds a curl and I&#x27;m not sure why I thought this would but I thought that at least, I get something from it and I liked that it has silicone rollers-curling irons just really damage my hair.  But as much as I practiced with this, my hair is just too fine and the curlers would just slide out.  But even if you don&#x27;t have my type of hair, I don&#x27;t know who Conair designed this for.  As many have said, there are just too few curlers in the &amp;#34;kit&amp;#34; to cover any adult&#x27;s head.  Each curer is supposed to be used for a 1&amp;#34; section of hair.  Do the math and try to figure out how 12 curlers would/could possibly cover a head of hair.  It&#x27;s also awkward to use.  By the time you move the clear &amp;#34;cover&amp;#34; over and remove a curler and then close it to keep the others hot, wrap a 1&amp;#34; wide piece of hair and get it to your scalp,the curler has lost a lot of heat.  I never got anything that looked more than a somewhat wavy strip of hair-no curls.  Thankfully, CVS allowed me to return it.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this.  However,  I am not overly impressed ...for me..it is challenging to use and I didn&#x27;t get the results I wad hoping for.  The concept is cool ...just didn&#x27;t work for me as I have longer,  thicker hair. ..if i could return it ..I would ...but I didn&#x27;t use it immediately to determine if I liked it. .</li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife an open box but when we tried it would get hot but the light never came so she called Conair.  they told her the light should come to let you know when it is ready for use. So i am returning it.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair so need to order more curlers but it seems to work well.</li>
            <li> does not work for really long hair</li>
            <li> Conair Infiniti Pro Secret Curl&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Category: Hair Care&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a compact roller set that I really like! You dont lose the clips because there aren&#x27;t any! Nice carrying handle and it stores in a compact little corner ready to be used when you need it. Nice curls with very little effort. Way to go Conair!</li>
            <li> Tried it on my self and my daughters hair. Didn&#x27;t hold a good curl for either one of use. I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have tried many types of curlers.  These are my favorite.</li>
            <li> I have lots of fine wavy hair that is just below my shoulders.  This product did not work for me.  There are only 12 curlers provided in the kit which was not enough to curl all of my hair.  You have to use very small sections in order for your hair to fit into each of the rollers.  Thus, I had to separate my hair into three different sections in order to curl my entire head.  The rollers are not easy to put in and when you &amp;#34;clip&amp;#34; them shut there is a mark left on your hair from the hard plastic casing the silicone roller is inside.  I bought these because they seemed easier to put in and less damaging to the hair.  They are a struggle to put in and very time consuming.  The curls produced by these curlers are pretty enough, but not worth the time and effort.</li>
            <li> These are terrible! To preface, I have really thick hair, so maybe that makes a difference. But I hated these curlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, there are only 12, so I could only do 2/3 of my hair at once. So I had to unplug it, wait for the 2/3 to finish, then heat up the curlers again and start over. They do heat up quickly, but the light is a little weird. It doesn&#x27;t look like a light. It&#x27;s this red thing that turns white, it looks like a plastic dot, not a light. You have to get up close to it to tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really hard to know when they&#x27;re done, too. It just says to wait til they&#x27;re cool. But since my hair is so thick, it can be hard to gauge. The outside of the curler may feel cool, but it won&#x27;t have curled properly. So I found it annoying that they didn&#x27;t have any suggested amount of time to leave the curlers in. (I left one side in for an hour and a half, and the other side in for 45 minutes.I probably could have gotten by with 20 minutes- that&#x27;s typical- but since my hair is so thick, I usually leave curlers in longer to really secure it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I hated was that I had to twist my hair before I put it in the curler. And with the twisting, and then the wrapping around the curler, it sort of snagged a little, and it created the UGLIEST curls. It was not worth the time I spent using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Oh, and they were a bit heavier than I expected. (Not the heaviest curlers I&#x27;ve used, but not light-weight either.) Especially since I could only do one part of my head, that part of my head felt like it was being weighted down, which put some weird pressure on my neck. This probably won&#x27;t be an issue for most people (I have spine issues) but it sure was annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it two stars since it did actually give me curls. But they were hideous and I hated this product. I will be selling it as soon as I can.</li>
            <li> It seems like it would work well on most hair, mine just does not curl very well. I did not like that the ready indicator light never came on even after 45 minutes of warming up</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this product even after reading all the positive reviews.  I have pretty short, fine hair, but even so, I could barely get more than a few strands in each roller.  I was not happy and returned it.</li>
            <li> Picked this up for my wife and it was an instant hit.  The curls set easily and last.  The build quality is good and seems like it should last a long time.  Not to be superficial, but the unit design is pretty cool as well.</li>
            <li> I am far from a girly girl, but these looked like fun, and I thought I would give them a try for those moments I am feeling too lazy to get my hair cut, but it is all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no clue what I was doing, but it worked very easily, and my hair which likes to fly all over the place handled it very well. I do have some natural curve, so there was something for the curlers to work with - but they did a very nice job, and I looked very good if I do say so myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a neat little gadget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four, not five, stars, because I realize that if I had a lot more hair (which I do at times) I would not be able to do all my hair at once.</li>
            <li> this is not a serious product for an adult woman looking to get gorgeous curls.  I think it could be fun for a 14 year old to use at a sleep over for fun.  I have long fine hair but my hair holds a curl really well when using a regular curling iron.  Unfortunately, this product simply isn&#x27;t capable of it.  Taking it back to the store for a refund.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and these curlers would not stay in. Very disappointed</li>
