            <li>Softens the skin pretty good, but there are just as good lotions and balms for the price.</li>

            <li>He swears by it and has told many people about it.</li>
            <li>The smell was lovely and co workers remarked at how it didn&#x27;t smell like lotions of that sort.</li>
            <li>I would not have believed it worked better than my prescription gel.</li>
            <li>We love it.</li>
            <li>once a day or more or when your feet hurt?  </li>
            <li>My theory seems to work and she has enjoyed the benefits of the product.  </li>
            <li>There are times that I like the thicker product better than the lotion, too  </li>
            <li>My expectations of this product were greater than the reality of its results.  </li>
            <li>love this because it stays attached much better than the lotion option.  </li>
            <li>We now call this our magic lotion</li>
            <li>We recommend it to everyone and will be buying more.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion I use it on every night</li>

            <li>It was ok.  </li>
            <li>so well I no longer need to receive steroid injection any more.</li>
            <li>Wow, this is really good foot balm/lotion/whathaveyou!</li>
            <li>A friend bought me this a couple of years ago, and I loved it from the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li>Excellent product/  Little thicker than the lotion so nice for using on feet/</li>
            <li>Basically a great marketing brand that hooked one old goat.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about the lotion &amp; cream!  </li>
            <li>In hindsight, I wish I&#x27;d just bought her the regular lotion, that stuff works great for me.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!!!</li>
            <li>; but I believe this is an attempt to get more money for less product by mis-labeling a GREAT product.</li>
            <li>Nowhere on the original container does it say &amp;#34;Foot balm&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>As you can see from how many times I have order this product I am in love with two old goats.</li>
            <li>I choose this rating because I have used the product for over six months and find that everything the manufacturer said it would do is true.</li>
            <li>Love how the old goats feels to your skin &amp; makes it soft &amp; smells good.</li>
            <li>I thought she would be able to feel how much she was getting from this jar, rather than trying to pour out the right amount of lotion from the bottle.  </li>
            <li>The smell is fine but it doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance, silky consistency does help with muscle aches and or spasms and joint aches but not for deep tendon problems.</li>
            <li>It works, I make sure I rub it in completely.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know how effective it is, but I ordered it because I have neuroma in both feet and was under the impression this was specific to feet.  </li>
            <li>I love &amp;#34;Two Old Goats&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I am a satisfied customer and have made several recommendations to my friends and family members.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>I have several products that works better.</li>
            <li>I am able to do more and experience far less pain.</li>
            <li>My husband has arthritis in his thumb joint and went to an orthopedic doctor who had a brace made to wear whenever he is using his hand, which is pretty much always.  </li>
            <li>We are so happy with this product that it beats Blue Enu and other products on the market by 1000 fold.  </li>
            <li>Two old goats worth your money.</li>
            <li>Now the whole family uses it.</li>
            <li>Really helped with neck pain...</li>
            <li>It really reduces the aches and pains.</li>

            <li>I works very well for the arthritis in my shoulders and hands.</li>
            <li>It has helped me so much that I no longer use pain medication for pain, I just reach for this product instead.</li>
            <li>And it is very greasy.</li>
            <li>My fellow worker and I work in a warehouse this product is working very well for our needs of sore feet knees and shoulders</li>
            <li>and it help him so much he told my mother who is in her 80s.  </li>
            <li>My feet are summer ready</li>
            <li>I am an avid user of the Two Old Goats lotion, however, this was my first purchase of the foot balm.  </li>
            <li>(I also love their other products I have tried)</li>
            <li>The first balm I&#x27;ve tried that reduces the pain in my foot/ankle from an old ball playing injury I have.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Thank you Two Old Goats!!</li>
            <li>Two Old Goats products really relieve my arthritis in my feet and hands.  </li>
            <li>I sent this to my 90 year old mother because she has macular degeneration and can&#x27;t see very well.  </li>
            <li>They were right in describing the instant relief on will receive upon application.</li>
            <li>product works ok, not sure if it helps like they state</li>
            <li>The foot balm is the exact same thing as the lotion, just thicker.  </li>
            <li>Gold Bond would have been fine for half the money.</li>
            <li>This works ....where other lotions had done little to nothing, this is working magic with my feet!  </li>
            <li>When my feet or wrists ache I can count on the Two Old Goats.</li>
            <li>It doesnt get rid of the pain completely</li>
            <li>My daughter asked me to try two old goats .</li>
            <li>Works really the same as the lotion, just easier to apply to the feet.  </li>
            <li>I use two old goats when my arthritis flares up.  </li>
            <li>If you have pain in your feet and want to get rid of it as fast as possible, this balm is what you need.</li>
            <li>Old Goats Balm&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Old Goats Lotion Foot balm New&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Love this product and have ordered it 3 times, but this time the scent is much different (not pleasant at all).</li>
            <li>---the relief doesn&#x27;t last a long time, but when you are in a lot of pain, a few minutes of pain relief is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much except a little moisturizer.</li>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much except a little moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Was not at all what I expected it only worked for a short time we used/ rubbed on the body partys that were in need of pain relief</li>
            <li> To me it works the same as any other similar product I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> Just a tad goes a long way</li>
            <li> have found it very helpful during the night when it is difficult to get comfortable or unable to sleep due to pain, just rubbing into the affected joints really helps.</li>
            <li> I guess i had expected miracles</li>
            <li> It did not help with gout and other muscle pain.</li>
            <li> A paper label was affixed to the jar upside down which declared it to be &amp;#34;Two</li>
            <li> Just great for tired painful feet!</li>
            <li> Would use again if the price were less.</li>
            <li> For awhile she was using half of a 8 ounce bottle.  </li>
            <li> Pain from previous surgery that nothing seemed to help</li>
            <li> but I have to say this did little if anything to help my severe arthritic pain.</li>
            <li> No more cracked heels.</li>
            <li> So, at the least, the description is misleading.  </li>
            <li> The smell is a little bit weird but not nearly as strong as the counter rubs.</li>
            <li> Made wrong review on wrong product (sorr)</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it fell sort of my expectations.</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> I hurt my ankle years ago and when it is going to storm, the ankle hurts like crazy...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It works well.  I use it every day.</li>
            <li> This product is really great.  Would give it a 10 star rating if I could.  Helps relieve the aches from rheumatoid arthritis and softens the skin.  Very light fragrance.</li>
            <li> Made wrong review on wrong product (sorr) This is great help on feet and handy size but can use it anywhere you need achy or pain relief! :)</li>
            <li> This very good for massaging my feet.  It is really good, I do use it on my legs, neck, and hand even though it says foot balm.  It does feel very nice and it smells good.</li>
            <li> Save your money and buy regular moisturizing creams.</li>
            <li> My husband has arthritis in his thumb joint and went to an orthopedic doctor who had a brace made to wear whenever he is using his hand, which is pretty much always.  A friend told him about this balm, so he tried it.  It works so well, he never uses the brace anymore.  He swears by it and has told many people about it.</li>
            <li> Two Old Goats products really relieve my arthritis in my feet and hands.  I&#x27;ve used this brand for more than a year and am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> product works ok, not sure if it helps like they state but is doesn&#x27;t do any harm either.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in taking away pain when applying this product.</li>
            <li> Two old goats worth your money. For Charley Horse in thigh or a king feet. I&#x27;ve used a lot and it works good</li>
            <li> Excellent use for joint pains and arthritis.  Try it...you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> Did wonders on my feet!</li>
            <li> Smells great and helps the aches.  Nice alternative to products with capsaicin for when you need some relief from achy wrists and fingers.</li>
            <li> it works and that says it all</li>
            <li> Just as soothing as the lotion for foot pain. Now the whole family uses it. Just great for tired painful feet!</li>
            <li> Recommended it to several of my friends.</li>
            <li> I have had 3 knee surgeries, have problems with my feet, and have degenerated disks in my back.  A friend bought me this a couple of years ago, and I loved it from the first time I tried it. Now, I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it.  Provides instant relief---the relief doesn&#x27;t last a long time, but when you are in a lot of pain, a few minutes of pain relief is fantastic.  You have got to try this for knees and feet, especially.  You won&#x27;t regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!!!</li>
            <li> I guess i had expected miracles but I have to say this did little if anything to help my severe arthritic pain. The smell was lovely and co workers remarked at how it didn&#x27;t smell like lotions of that sort. I did give it a good try but unfortunately it fell sort of my expectations.</li>
            <li> Really helped with neck pain...</li>
            <li> Excellent stuff delivered fast</li>
            <li> A nice consistency for applying to aching feet and toes.  Very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Two Old Goats is good in whatever form you have it in!!! Take care of the pain</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much except a little moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Great for pain. When my feet or wrists ache I can count on the Two Old Goats. All of their products work.</li>
            <li> I recently got this and it helps with pains alot!!! It doesnt get rid of the pain completely but it does help with 80% of it.</li>
            <li> This is the same product as the bottled liquid, but it is thicker, so easier to use on the feet.  I use it at bedtime when my feet have taken a beating all day.  It really reduces the aches and pains.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Instant relief. We had heard of this product from a personal friend of ours. They were right in describing the instant relief on will receive upon application.</li>
            <li> I choose this rating because I have used the product for over six months and find that everything the manufacturer said it would do is true. I am a satisfied customer and have made several recommendations to my friends and family members.</li>
            <li> This is really great &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34;. I use this cream as well as the lotion  I would not have believed it worked better than my prescription gel. I had real flare up of my hands and knees. My daughter asked me to try two old goats . I have since purchased it for five of my &amp;#34;0ld goat&amp;#34; friends with arthritis of all kinds, fibromyalgia, tendinitis and neuropathy. We love it. Even my MD asked where did I purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;I have found it very helpful during the night when it is difficult to get comfortable or unable to sleep due to pain, just rubbing into the affected joints really helps. Thanks</li>
            <li> Softens the skin pretty good, but there are just as good lotions and balms for the price. Would use again if the price were less.</li>
            <li> My husband says that it works great</li>
            <li> I love this foot balm!  I hurt my ankle years ago and when it is going to storm, the ankle hurts like crazy...this balm alleviates the pain.&lt;br /&gt;and it smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> A friend heard someone rave about this, so he purchased some.  He had several friends try it, who also raved about it, saying within about 15-20 minutes their pain was gone.  I didn&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li> no instructions as to how to use it. once a day or more or when your feet hurt?  seems  to help some.  has good smell</li>
            <li> Great stuff . It really works. We can&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> The foot balm is the exact same thing as the lotion, just thicker.  I sent this to my 90 year old mother because she has macular degeneration and can&#x27;t see very well.  I thought she would be able to feel how much she was getting from this jar, rather than trying to pour out the right amount of lotion from the bottle.  My theory seems to work and she has enjoyed the benefits of the product.  There are times that I like the thicker product better than the lotion, too  I have both, plus the body wash and the bar soap!</li>
            <li> Gives temporary relief, especially at bedtime.</li>
            <li> Love this product and have ordered it 3 times, but this time the scent is much different (not pleasant at all). Will still use it because it still works.</li>
            <li> My expectations of this product were greater than the reality of its results.  To me it works the same as any other similar product I&#x27;ve used.  I will probably not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Works really the same as the lotion, just easier to apply to the feet.  Can&#x27;t say enough good things about the lotion &amp; cream!  It has worked after so many years of pain &amp; cramping and applying just about everything out there for relief!  Thank you Two Old Goats!!</li>
            <li> love this because it stays attached much better than the lotion option.  Great for easing the pain of sore feet of any sort.</li>
            <li> Did not do anything that bengay didn&#x27;t already do.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, silky consistency does help with muscle aches and or spasms and joint aches but not for deep tendon problems.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this product!  I works very well for the arthritis in my shoulders and hands. I was amazed at the difference in my shoulders and hands. I am able to do more and experience far less pain.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and I recommended it to my doctor.  It has helped me so much that I no longer use pain medication for pain, I just reach for this product instead.</li>
            <li> Great item... We now call this our magic lotion</li>
            <li> Very good arthritis lotion! Just a tad goes a long way</li>
            <li> Wow, this is really good foot balm/lotion/whathaveyou! This works ....where other lotions had done little to nothing, this is working magic with my feet!  I love this stuff! Wonder if it comes in 16 oz sizes!!</li>
            <li> Great Product.  The first balm I&#x27;ve tried that reduces the pain in my foot/ankle from an old ball playing injury I have.</li>
            <li> Love how the old goats feels to your skin &amp; makes it soft &amp; smells good. Helps my pains.  I use it all the time.</li>
            <li> Balm? This is just the lotion in a different container. Sorry but that&#x27;s what I got!</li>
            <li> Excellent delivery time.  Not as effective as it claims for the severity of my pain.  Had I read further to see it was not patented I would not have chanced it.  Going to stick with what I know works.  No difference in foot balm vs the lotion.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! My husband and I both use it for arthritis and sore joints. It works almost immediately. The smell is a little bit weird but not nearly as strong as the counter rubs. We recommend it to everyone and will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion I use it on every night</li>
            <li> Very refreshing and not greasy at all.  Nice for aches and pains.</li>
            <li> I use two old goats when my arthritis flares up.  I find that it helps if you use plenty and rub it in well.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me.  And it is very greasy.</li>
            <li> Great service and customer relations. Love this product</li>
            <li> This foot balm relieved the pain. It works, I make sure I rub it in completely. We have recommended it to our family &amp; friends!</li>
            <li> helps with wrist pain...</li>
            <li> My fellow worker and I work in a warehouse this product is working very well for our needs of sore feet knees and shoulders</li>
            <li> I love this. A customer where my sister words told her about it and gave her some to try. She then gave me some to try and that is all it took for me to buy it. If you have pain in your feet and want to get rid of it as fast as possible, this balm is what you need. It works in minutes!</li>
            <li> The description says that this is \\&quot;foot\\&quot; balm, but the package says nothing about a \\&quot;foot\\&quot;.  I just got it  so I don&#x27;t know how effective it is, but I ordered it because I have neuroma in both feet and was under the impression this was specific to feet.  It just says \\&quot;balm\\&quot;.  So, at the least, the description is misleading.  I would not have ordered it but would have ordered the lotion, as it is recommended for pain relief.</li>
            <li> This stuff is o.k. I have several products that works better. The smell is fine but it doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> works good and great value,ships quick,it works,use it every day on my feet.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! Achy feet no longer a problem and I get a foot rub to boot!</li>
            <li> It did not help with gout and other muscle pain. Overwhelming smell</li>
            <li> A friend of my husband recommended this and it help him so much he told my mother who is in her 80s.  She uses it every day.  For awhile she was using half of a 8 ounce bottle.  This product makes them feel so good that I went and got the Foot Balm and started using it.  After I have had 8 operations on one foot I needed something to releive the soreness and numbness.  We are so happy with this product that it beats Blue Enu and other products on the market by 1000 fold.  Thank you and God Bless.</li>
            <li> Was not at all what I expected it only worked for a short time we used/ rubbed on the body partys that were in need of pain relief</li>
            <li> Excellent product/  Little thicker than the lotion so nice for using on feet/</li>
            <li> Love this foot balm.  Don&#x27;t know how I loved without it.  No more cracked heels. My feet are summer ready</li>
            <li> this product was recommended by a physical therapist and I love this product. Works well. I will be using it for my arthritis.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this foot balm. It helps a lot with Fibromyalgia. (I also love their other products I have tried) I highly recommend it. It also smells soothing which is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I am an avid user of the Two Old Goats lotion, however, this was my first purchase of the foot balm.  I bought it for a friend, not myself.  She says it smells like Vick&#x27;s Vapor Rub and works &amp;#34;ok, I guess&amp;#34;.  In hindsight, I wish I&#x27;d just bought her the regular lotion, that stuff works great for me.</li>
            <li> This foot cream is wonderful and it works. Pain from previous surgery that nothing seemed to help - this eased the pain finally.</li>
            <li> Nowhere on the original container does it say &amp;#34;Foot balm&amp;#34;.  It appears to be a 4oz jar of &amp;#34;Two Old Goats Balm&amp;#34;.  Also on the lid it says &amp;#34;Tackles your toughest aches, pains and swelling in joints, tendons and muscles while moisturizing skin.  A paper label was affixed to the jar upside down which declared it to be &amp;#34;Two Old Goats Lotion Foot balm New&amp;#34;.  I love &amp;#34;Two Old Goats&amp;#34; but I believe this is an attempt to get more money for less product by mis-labeling a GREAT product.</li>
            <li> This is great, relaxing foot balm.</li>
            <li> It was ok.  Basically a great marketing brand that hooked one old goat.  Gold Bond would have been fine for half the money.</li>
            <li> As you can see from how many times I have order this product I am in love with two old goats. I was having knee pain related to arthritis. A friend told me about the product. It works so well I no longer need to receive steroid injection any more.</li>
