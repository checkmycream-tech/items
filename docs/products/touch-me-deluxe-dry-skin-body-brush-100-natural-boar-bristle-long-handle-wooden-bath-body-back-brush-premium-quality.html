            <li>Have used the brush before and think it&#x27;s  great.</li>

            <li>This brush works good</li>

            <li>The texture of the Boar Bristle brush makes it easy to use and the results are great.</li>
            <li>Nice bristle brush.</li>
            <li>Good quality, cute ribbon makes it great as a gift right out of the box!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a scrubber like this for a while and was very happy to find it for such a good price on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Skin brushing is very important for your health and to jump start lymph system circulation.  </li>
            <li>I would have liked the bristles a touch stiffer but it does the job just fine.</li>
            <li>This is an OK brush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of brushes but this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Glad I found these online.</li>
            <li>Love this brush.</li>
            <li>I love this Boar Bristle.</li>
            <li>The package arrived quickly and we love the way it works!</li>
            <li>I love the wooden handle and the bristles feel great.  </li>
            <li>I use it to clean off my convertible top</li>
            <li>High quality and fairly priced.</li>
            <li>But overall a great Brush.</li>
            <li>Also the handle is made of smooth wood which could be slippery if you have soap on your hand.</li>
            <li>A very nice back brush.</li>
            <li>I feel extremely clean after using this brush.</li>
            <li>and I enjoyed the real wood handle</li>
            <li>The booklet states on the front Deluxe Natural Body Brush.</li>
            <li>However, if you encounter problems, this is not a professional, courteous seller to deal with and I&#x27;m sure you can find whatever type of brush you&#x27;re looking for through another source.</li>
            <li>Perfect for reaching the middle of my back and shoulders.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft and I would think if I used it for it&#x27;s intended purpose, it would be fantastic!</li>
            <li>Nice back brush, bought 2.</li>
            <li>This is a good brush with pretty stiff bristles that I enjoy.  </li>
            <li>Been using it for about a month and is holding up just fine so far.  </li>
            <li>After surgery and not being able to bend, it&#x27;s a bit too short.  </li>
            <li>I bought this after seeing the same type of brush in many model homes.  </li>
            <li>First the plastic cracked on the edge.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely order more.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t, as I first indicated to seller, any mention of 100% boar bristles.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>The bristles are quite stiff (which I like) and the length is good.</li>
            <li>Love the long handle.  </li>
            <li>but she has much softer skin than I do.  </li>
            <li>I was very upset with the manner in which the seller handled this situation</li>
            <li>but I still enjoy using this for my back and shoulders.  </li>
            <li>Really gets all the dirt off</li>
            <li>Really rough bristles I thought would be different, good product.</li>
            <li>Nice brush, bristles stiff, hope it lasts.</li>
            <li>I USE IT IN THE SHOWER TO CLEAN MY BACK</li>
            <li>The brush did arrive wrapped as pictured, (a clever selling feature) together with a mini-type booklet for description/use instructions.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this bristle is between hard and soft so it feels really good.</li>
            <li>At first I did not worry to much about it, until the bristles started coming out, then finally a chunk came off.</li>
            <li>Works well, you should be aware that the bristles are short and a little rough, but it&#x27;s very effective.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find in the stores anymore where I live.</li>
            <li>Long lasting and very clean item and very soft for total body showering and cremes.</li>
            <li>I really have to stretch to get all of my back.</li>
            <li>, it is so soft you can bathe a child with it.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a soft brush to bathe with, you&#x27;ll like this one.</li>
            <li>The brush was exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li>Bristles too soft and short!</li>
            <li>It barely lasted 3 months.  </li>
            <li>Not great quality but ok for the price</li>
            <li>Bristles are stiff enough to clean but not stiff enough to irritate my face or other sensitive areas.</li>

            <li> A very nice back brush. The bristles were not to stiff for my back and I enjoyed the real wood handle... Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Wooden handle is unbreakable. I broke several plastic handle brushes from Target.&lt;br /&gt;Also head design is good.  Separate plastic panel is holding brushes well.&lt;br /&gt;I like this product.</li>
            <li> do to bad shoulders i have a problem reaching my back while bathing and this brush solves the problem. well made, i have been getting a couple years out of these brushes and for the money i don&#x27;t think you can beat it!</li>
            <li> It cracked after about 4months of use. Maybe do to water damage. But overall a great Brush.</li>
            <li> Bristles too soft and short!</li>
            <li> Good value for the money. Only wish it had a longer handle so I could reach all areas of my back.</li>
            <li> I was hoping the handle would be longer.  After surgery and not being able to bend, it&#x27;s a bit too short.  The bristles are already falling out, but not too badly.  This is an OK brush.  Not great, not bad.</li>
            <li> Nice back brush, bought 2.</li>
            <li> too tough,irates my skin.</li>
            <li> Have used the brush before and think it&#x27;s  great._</li>
            <li> I already had one of these brushes and bought this as a replacement after years of use. The bristles are quite stiff (which I like) and the length is good.</li>
            <li> Works well, you should be aware that the bristles are short and a little rough, but it&#x27;s very effective. Also the handle is made of smooth wood which could be slippery if you have soap on your hand.</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT!!  I USE IT IN THE SHOWER TO CLEAN MY BACK</li>
            <li> I bought this after seeing the same type of brush in many model homes.  We have an unused shower that was recently remodeled.  I placed this brush with some rolled up towels on the bench and it makes for an attractive display.  The bristles are very soft and I would think if I used it for it&#x27;s intended purpose, it would be fantastic!</li>
            <li> Not great quality but ok for the price</li>
            <li> The brush is not as hard to scrub on my skin</li>
            <li> I like this brush for scrubbing my back in the shower. I would have liked the bristles a touch stiffer but it does the job just fine.</li>
            <li> This is a good brush with pretty stiff bristles that I enjoy.  My wife thinks it is a little to scratchy but she has much softer skin than I do.  Perfect for reaching the middle of my back and shoulders.  Been using it for about a month and is holding up just fine so far.  Good quality product in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed!  I&#x27;ve been looking for a scrubber like this for a while and was very happy to find it for such a good price on Amazon.  I love the wooden handle and the bristles feel great.  Coupled with a good body wash, this brush makes showering a joy!</li>
            <li> It is a little to short for me. I really have to stretch to get all of my back. I&#x27;m 5&#x27; 11&amp;#34; weigh in at about 238 lbs. It&#x27;ll also depend on the length of your arms and limberness, I guess. I just know I need it longer to make it easier for me. The brush does work great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of brushes but this is my favorite. The store where I usually bought them stopped selling this particular type. Was thrilled when I found it on Amazon! I stocked up and bought several!!</li>
            <li> Great brush to use all over your body.  The texture of the Boar Bristle brush makes it easy to use and the results are great.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Stiff brush which I like.</li>
            <li> This was my 3rd brush.  The last one felt a bit cheeper made than the ones before.  It barely lasted 3 months.  First the plastic cracked on the edge.  At first I did not worry to much about it, until the bristles started coming out, then finally a chunk came off.</li>
            <li> Glad I found these online. Can&#x27;t find in the stores anymore where I live. Love this brush. Will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> Good quality, cute ribbon makes it great as a gift right out of the box!</li>
            <li> Its a bath brush that brushes, what else is there to say.</li>
            <li> Nice bristle brush. Not to hard and not to soft.  I use it to clean off my convertible top</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using boars hair brushes for years. Long lasting and very clean item and very soft for total body showering and cremes.</li>
            <li> The package arrived quickly and we love the way it works!</li>
            <li> Last few fall a part after a few months.</li>
            <li> I love this Boar Bristle. I have sensitive skin and this bristle is between hard and soft so it feels really good.</li>
            <li> Really rough bristles I thought would be different, good product.</li>
            <li> Great brush for the shower.  Bristles are just stiff enough to clean my back without being too harsh. Love the long handle.  Looks great too.</li>
            <li> Nice brush, bristles stiff, hope it lasts.</li>
            <li> One of my best buys ever. Bristles are stiff enough to clean but not stiff enough to irritate my face or other sensitive areas. I feel extremely clean after using this brush. Buy it, you will not regret it.</li>
            <li> item purchased because of the material and it&#x27;s a one piece unit. The brush did arrive wrapped as pictured, (a clever selling feature) together with a mini-type booklet for description/use instructions. The booklet states on the front Deluxe Natural Body Brush. Thinking I received the wrong item I immediately contacted the seller, whose response was quite rude. Seller replied the correct item was sent and I should read the label. I wet the brush used it over my arm, it is so soft you can bathe a child with it. I again contacted the seller mentioning almost every word listed on the info label. There isn&#x27;t, as I first indicated to seller, any mention of 100% boar bristles.  The seller never responded. I filed a complaint with Amazon accusing this seller of false advertising and misleading consumers.  I was very upset with the manner in which the seller handled this situation, obviously I will never purchase another item from Spa Plus. If you are looking for a soft brush to bathe with, you&#x27;ll like this one. However, if you encounter problems, this is not a professional, courteous seller to deal with and I&#x27;m sure you can find whatever type of brush you&#x27;re looking for through another source. The description on Amazon&#x27;s site for this brush &amp;#34;100% Boar Bristles&amp;#34; should be removed as this is false advertisement.</li>
            <li> Great reach with great bristles.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush. It&#x27;s invigorating enough without being harsh. That&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I use this brush for dry skin brushing.  I would not attempt to wet it.  The one reason I bought it was it was all one piece.  I have other brushes that work both with a long handle then detach to be held in the hand.  They are good but I still enjoy using this for my back and shoulders.  The others would separate just as the brushing started to feel good. Skin brushing is very important for your health and to jump start lymph system circulation.  This brush works good and I bought two.</li>
            <li> Really gets all the dirt off</li>
            <li> High quality and fairly priced.</li>
            <li> great product, will buy again if still for available!</li>
            <li> The brush was exactly what I expected!</li>
