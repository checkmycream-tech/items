            <li>This is a very impressive device.</li>

            <li>AWESOME PRODUCT , YOU CAN USE IT FOR MORE THAN ONE THING , THATS</li>
            <li>It was a pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li>It is a really good price.</li>
            <li>Good purchase.</li>
            <li>so we knew this was a good name brand.  </li>
            <li>Recommended for a number of good reasons</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how good this trimmer was.  </li>
            <li>This is a good priced, value trimmer.  </li>
            <li>quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, trimming nose and ear hair is not a topic we like to talk about but come on guys, grooming is good.</li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>Good product if you have out of control nose hair</li>
            <li>I also wish I knew the best way to clean it.</li>
            <li>Works great and easy to use!</li>
            <li>very satisfied with it</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the Phillips nose trimmer.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this item.  </li>
            <li>But I found this unit at a great price and have great respect for the Norelco brand (used their rotary shavers for many many years), so I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>I love this trimmer!</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t experienced an ingrown hair in your nose consider yourself lucky!</li>
            <li>The trimmer worked as advertised, was comfortable, and did a great job.</li>
            <li>It trims the ear hair nicely.</li>
            <li>feels good and slightly better make than others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Nice product</li>
            <li>That said, this one does a nice job.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s about time they upgraded this kind of thing.</li>
            <li>Eyebrow trimmer might come in handy for some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So many times you&#x27;ll see some Congressman on a talk show and they so need a good trim...</li>
            <li>I have my own tremors, and use the rotary trimmer to finish off my shaving under my nose.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and seems to be a quality product.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to manipulate into nose, ears, eyebrows.</li>
            <li>The instructions also suggest soaking the head in warm water before running the device to clean it, presumably if you weren&#x27;t good about rinsing it after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one is by far the best one yet.</li>
            <li>must say this unit was a much better tool than the Series 3300 that I also own.  </li>
            <li>Best nose trimmer as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li>Great product, worth every penny.</li>
            <li>This is the third one of these kind of trimmers I&#x27;ve owned and the best.  </li>
            <li>Very cheaply made - purchase with caution.</li>
            <li>Nice that it can be easily cleaned by rinsing under the faucet.  </li>
            <li>also feel it isn&#x27;t as efficient as many reviewers have stated.</li>
            <li>This product is OK.</li>
            <li>Still absolutely love this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>trimmer did a great job gently around the inside of the nostrils, without pulling or scratching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to say that this trimmer leads the pack, and I&#x27;m really pleased with it.</li>
            <li>glad I got this one.</li>
            <li>Have used many nose and ear clippers over the years.</li>
            <li>Am cwet pleased with it.</li>
            <li>But still love the product.</li>
            <li>Much better than the microtouch.</li>
            <li>This is so much better than using scissors.  </li>
            <li>Works well I am pleased with it</li>
            <li>Trimmer is one of the better trimmers I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I really do love this trimmer, but if there is one fault</li>
            <li>The batteries that came with it were still good and functional, something that I rarely find with products that come prepackaged with disposable batteries.</li>
            <li>Gets you looking great fast.</li>
            <li>What more can</li>
            <li>The unit worked great and made fast work of my nose hair with no pulling at all.  </li>
            <li>Nose trimmers that have the razors closer to the edge of the tip are better.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>, what more can you ask for.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheap and comes with a warranty!</li>
            <li>I like this one better than the rotary ones</li>
            <li>It was okay for stray hairs in between brows and did not irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>I now have a better feel for the angle and length of time to have a better experience.  </li>
            <li>the box you will find nose trimmer itself, a cover for the top of the trimmer, and the eyebrow trimmer attachment.  </li>
            <li>I still prefer the rotary trimmers and would have preferred a device that had a more solid construction, but--that said--this device works perfectly well and is up to snuff with its competition in this category.</li>
            <li>If you want a good nose and ear trimmer at the right price it&#x27;s this one.</li>
            <li>It is very comfortable in my ears and easy to maneuver in the ears.  </li>
            <li>Well worth 10 bucks!!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and safe also.</li>
            <li>Does the job quickly and effectively</li>
            <li>Most surprisingly, the I found the most useful aspect of it was the eyebrow trimming comb attachment which trimmed my eyebrows to just the right length.  </li>
            <li>Overall it does a very good job.  </li>
            <li>I can safely and comfortably use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>To make it short and sweet unlike others who write a novel just to review a product, this is the best nose hair trimmer I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>It easily slides into a nostril and doesn&#x27;t pull.</li>
            <li>Works amazing and fast and comes with a free battery!</li>
            <li>Feels durable and cuts hair fairly easy.</li>
            <li>Compact, lightweight and easy to use</li>
            <li>Easy to handle.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Also has an eyebrow comb for easy trimming.</li>
            <li>Easy to install the battery and go.  </li>
            <li>Ear trimming is just as easy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Clean-up is easy, just hold the head under running water.</li>
            <li>Cleans up easily too.</li>
            <li>So easy to use and does the job</li>
            <li>so it is easy to maintain, and</li>
            <li>The directions are easy to follow and the trimmer comes with a tip cover, battery and eyebrow comb.  </li>
            <li>It is far more superior than Panasonic.</li>
            <li>Since the Philips Norelco didn&#x27;t cost very much, I&#x27;ll keep it for the handy eyebrow grooming feature.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty nice trimmer.</li>
            <li>This particular type of trimmer does a better job than the circular kind.</li>
            <li>Everything works fine, but some edges stick out here and</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, it&#x27;s an awesome feature that you can run water over the tip, but I prefer to use a little alcohol square on the end to disinfect it.  </li>
            <li>Excellent little device.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a huge fan of micro-trimmers.</li>
            <li>device seems to fit well in your hand, but it is light weight and feels a bit cheap.  </li>
            <li>It doesnt pull hair and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Initially I was happy with this purchase but the trimmer stopped working after 2 1/2 months.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to finally have one</li>
            <li>It is also easy to clean not to mention it does the job.</li>
            <li>Great work on multiple &amp;#</li>
            <li>The ears are also hair free.</li>
            <li>Three Phillips Norelco Trimmers were available for review.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Very powerful, so</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easily controlled so it doesn&#x27;t over trim, and it does the job quickly and evenly.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice product and pretty useful.</li>
            <li>The trimmer quickly and easily trimmed rogue nose hairs with no problem at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Original review:  </li>
            <li>(no need to keep track of yet another charger) and priced inexpensively (rechargeable batteries and their associated mechanisms add significant cost).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Can clean the heads with water.  </li>
            <li>You can also run the trimmer under the water to clean</li>
            <li>You can use it to cut away unsightly nose hairs or to trim and clean up your eyebrows.</li>
            <li>The guard makes it especially safe, although it tickles enough to cause a sneeze if you are not careful.  </li>
            <li>www.amazon.com/Remington-ND3150CDN-Battery-Operated-Trimmer/dp/B003AQ61B8/  Reasonable for ears, but seems to leave more strays than the Remington.</li>
            <li>good on the short ones</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s good to go for the next time.</li>
            <li>Absolutely necessary gadget, philips quality, good price</li>
            <li>This one is different, Norelco took the time to design something safer that would not pull, and could be rotated around for a good trimming.</li>
            <li>If you have need of a micro-trimmer for some personal grooming, this is a good choice.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, very practical!</li>
            <li>I know I&#x27;m going to lose the accessories quickly.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve decided to buy another Panasonic because the rotary head trims more easily and much closer than this straight trimmer.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, just as described.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s also an eyebrow comb (that will get lost quickly) and a storage cap, but otherwise the unit is self-contained.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Super and painless hair removal tool.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of my new favorite tools on the sink.  </li>
            <li>But with this nose trimmer, it&#x27;s been great, I can just turn the little trimmer and clip off those portions.</li>
            <li>Worth the cost difference, in my opinion, but this \\&quot;basic\\&quot; model is fine if it&#x27;s really all you</li>
            <li>It will fit fine in my normal shaving kit, but it&#x27;s considerably larger than most nose trimmers I&#x27;ve seen, but that is not really a bad thing.  </li>
            <li>WORKS GREAT AND NOT CHEAPLY MADE</li>
            <li>I trimmed years worth of hair from my ears with no pain</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use the eyebrow attachment that you can use to keep them the same length because I don&#x27;t have a problem there, but it&#x27;s definitely a nice addition to the set, along with a cover for the tip of the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful (unlike some trimmers)</li>
            <li>The body has a nice design and overall, this trimmer will get the job done ... slowly...with a level of discomfort.</li>
            <li>Powerful trimmer uses 1 AA battery which is included.</li>
            <li>The guard works great because I&#x27;m pressed up against the skin, which would not be possible with the old types</li>
            <li>build is solid for this kind of device.</li>
            <li>But you can push this thing right onto a hair the four times without any success.</li>
            <li>I was excited about this nose trimmer, thinking it would be an advance over the more traditional trimmers in which you inserted a slotted metal cylinder into your nostril.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But the real test for me was trimming above the eyebrows,  to leave a nice clean line.  </li>
            <li>clears the nose hairs right out.</li>
            <li>Quit working right after I got it.</li>
            <li>This trimmer does it right</li>
            <li>I now no longer have to wait till I get a haircut to get the eyebrows trimmed right.  </li>
            <li>you can see right throw my brow .</li>
            <li>To turn it on and off you twist the bottom of the device to the right.</li>
            <li>Strangely it doesn&#x27;t cost much more than the cheap ones I&#x27;ve had before.  </li>
            <li>Works ok, but needs to be stuck up pretty far into the nostril to work.  </li>
            <li>It works great for a little trim!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Philips is sending me a free replacement, so I would say that customer service is good, but not the product, at least for me.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and simple to use.  </li>
            <li>The long comb was much more effective for my eyebrows than the short.</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Another plus is that this trimmer is very reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like this trimmer very much.</li>
            <li>pretty good little product.</li>
            <li>The nozzle is a perfect shape to get into tight places and the blades are very effective in cutting hair.</li>
            <li>However, it turns out that traditional design is much better.</li>
            <li>At first I thought the design was funky but now I see the genius in it.</li>
            <li>operates exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>The older I get, the less hair on top and the more elsewhere.</li>
            <li>This is my first nose hair trimer</li>
            <li>This product is more about the design than actual function.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>When I first took the device out of the package I could tell it was a well made item.  </li>
            <li>This is my first foray into trimmers.</li>
            <li>I do think the first time I tried it</li>
            <li>Given that there is no where to store the attachment, it will most likely be the first thing that I lose.  </li>
            <li>If you twist left and line up the triangles, you are able to pull the device apart to reveal the battery compartment.  </li>
            <li>first Phillips Norelco Trimmer up for review is the Philips Norelco</li>
            <li>with steady hands and this high quality Philips Norelco trimmer,  my eyebrows looked fantastic.</li>
            <li>Much better than the razors with the wider, flat head.</li>
            <li>The first of this type of trimmer that really works.  </li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s face it, no one ever wants to admit that they have nose hair in the first place, or a nose hair problem at all.  </li>
            <li>It effectively trims nose and ear hair down close to the skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s going to tickle the back part of your nose closest to your head, so take it easy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s reasonably quiet and easy to use, just press it against the skin where you are cleaning up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a fair number of the Philips Norelco products and they all seem to last a long time, despite being budget priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m liking the side approach, it certainly cuts well, both in the ear and in the nose.</li>
            <li>(You have to twist it to a certain position.)</li>
            <li>The con is that there is a somewhat large area of &amp;#34;no cut zone&amp;#34; at the tip of the device.  </li>
            <li>Philips Norelco Nose Trimmer is a no frills, easy to use, wet-dry personal groomer that gives you reasonable value for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It healed fine, but the opening is smaller for one nostril and the inside tissue thicker.  </li>
            <li>This is a handy little trimmer at a \\&quot;reasonable\\&quot; price.  </li>
            <li>Many seem to think it works fine, but to me it&#x27;s a distant second.</li>
            <li>It was effective in removing stray long hairs and would likely do a decent job on eyebrows, assuming that the length is right for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is one of the most painful things I ever experienced.</li>
            <li>Thanks so,p.s.</li>
            <li>This type of tool will be dropped and I find it very discouraging that it could now withstand this sort of problem.  </li>
            <li>Did not process the bats in the cave very well.</li>
            <li>Does not cut much.  </li>
            <li>Works very well doing what it was intended for.</li>
            <li>This trimmer had absolutely zero pain involve.</li>
            <li>Simple, cheap, and does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li>I hope that it works as well for you as it did for me and thanks for taking the time to read my review.</li>
            <li>You can trim very close, without any injury (unlike scissors).</li>
            <li>Lightning fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended product!</li>
            <li>Depending on disposable AA batts (one, included) is reasonable for a gadget used infrequently</li>
            <li>It took so much hair off</li>
            <li>so the trimmer can get in there and do some real work.</li>
            <li>34;too much hair&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Comes with a eye brow trimmer and works very well.  </li>
            <li>Philips Norelco could have sprung for a real on/off switch.  </li>
            <li>The blades seem to cut well enough and, as promised by Philips Norelco, the shave was comfortable without any pulling or tugging.  </li>
            <li>the whole, the Philips Norelco Nose Trimmer works as you expect it would.  </li>
            <li>However, with much experience, I still prefer the rotary blade style for nose hair...</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no pinching or catching of hair, and if you keep it pressed firmly to the skin, there shouldn&#x27;t be any tickling.</li>
            <li>This is a great little trimmer for small places, is easy to use, works really well and is very convenient.  </li>
            <li>Already it has lasted longer and cuts better than any other trimmer I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>The design, with its vertical trimming head, makes it more efficient at its task than other trimmers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I know it sounds silly, but if you have used many trimmers you are well aware of how flimsy most of them feel.  </li>
            <li>With the unique shape of the trimmer like a tiny comb, I can control the movement inside my nose.</li>
            <li>and it is much better than other trimmers that I have used,</li>
            <li>As we get older hair pops up in places that we really didn&#x27;t want it.  </li>
            <li>I typically use the rounded style of nose hair trimmer, but this version is a bit more comfortable - especially if you&#x27;ve ever used the circular type with the battery going out (yeouch!!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It felt solid and strong, unlike many of the cheap trimmers that last only a couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery compartment cover is firm, the blade on top is solid as well.  </li>
            <li>It might be a little better if it had a light, but that&#x27;s really not necessary.  </li>
            <li>As we age, hair in desirable places begins to vanish or change color, and less desirable hair starts growing all the more vigorously.</li>
            <li>I got this to replace an older trimmer with blades on the end instead of the side.</li>
            <li>It is quiet and cuts quickly without any pulling of the hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, these are decent nose hair trimmers (</li>
            <li>The price is decent and they do a decent job.</li>
            <li>The price is decent and they do a decent job.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>or if there is the slightest chance that you&#x27;re going to want to do some \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot;, then I would highly recommend you invest in the NT5175/42 5100 model.  </li>
            <li>It is always a little intimidating to have something that noisy coming at your face, but this little puppy works beautifully.  </li>
            <li>Outstanding little product.</li>
            <li>Did the job + a few more jobs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for the normal viewers sitting at home</li>
            <li>usually purchase those $10 micro-trimmers that break quickly, but do their job if you squeeze them correctly (hold the top together because that is usually the breaking point for these cheaply made micro-trimmers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this makes a fine trimmer to have in the bathroom when you have to go check yourself after watching their out of control eyebrows and ear hair and all that other stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine</li>
            <li>Oddly enough, it was so hot</li>
            <li>Update after using it periodically for about a year &amp; a half: It was doing fine</li>
            <li>Really, this thing barely cuts.</li>
            <li>This is just like the simple original I bought several years ago which I&#x27;d still be using if I hadn&#x27;t dropped it.</li>
            <li>It also takes care of all his extra hair, which is why I bought it in the first place.  </li>
            <li>The top half that looks like it might be covered with a grippy latex is really just more textured hard plastic, finished differently to give it designer looks.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve got hairy ears or other parts, this baby will clean you up.</li>
            <li>Found that the other design of blade with the &#x27;circular&#x27; head actually gives you a closer and more complete cut of  objectionable nasal hairs.</li>
            <li>It is the first one that seems to have been designed as a professional tool, rather than simply an &amp;#34;as</li>
            <li>For hairs that are lying flat, this one is really difficult to use effectively, whereas the other style lets you kind of stab and plow where the hair and skin meet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy enough to get used to, though, especially with the overall quality of the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a simple enough maneuver, but not as easy to use as the ‘weed whacker’ variety of nose hair trimmer, where the blade rotates and you simply have to abut the trimmer to the surface that needs trimming.  </li>
            <li>It took several passes and did not remove the hairs in certain places inside my nose.</li>
            <li>is this doesn&#x27;t fit in one of those little grooming kits like my others do.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my 15 year old son who has severe disabilities (so I have to do all his shaving for him).</li>
            <li>Relegated my old one to the garbage immediately.</li>
            <li>I tried it on my eyebrows and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>So long and thanks for all the fish!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After popping the battery in and turning the trimmer on you are instantly surprised by the amount of power it delivers.  </li>
            <li>as well as cut any \\&quot;wild</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t had any issues with \\&quot;pulls\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Production values are reasonable for a product such as this.  </li>
            <li>No as powerful as expected</li>
            <li>Nothing wrong with any of them, just not as good, for me, as the rotary.ested, either.  </li>
            <li>Nothing wrong with any of them, just not as good, for me, as the rotary.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t touch it with my bare hands so that I could pull the new battery I had just put in out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the exact same as this one, but with several attachments, and it&#x27;s only a few $$&#x27;s more.  </li>
            <li>The main reason was the trimmer didn&#x27;t cut nose hair properly.</li>
            <li>Overall, these are decent nose hair trimmers (</li>
            <li>My one tiny issue is that there are little pieces you want to hold onto or together and they are so easy to lose.  </li>
            <li>see how long the trimmer lasts, but I have very high hopes.  </li>
            <li>It is powerful for running on only a single AA battery.</li>
            <li>The packing is also this impossible to open, totally destroyed when you do kind that can easily slice your hand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super risky to use a trimmer here because one little slip and you&#x27;re done for, but</li>
            <li>Needed this desperately and it is a wonderful little tool.  </li>
            <li>There is no pinching or cutting, and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>And I really only need a light trim of a few hairs here and there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d go for something else, this isn&#x27;t worth even the ten I spent on it.</li>
            <li>A real bargain at $9.99 with the same features as similar devices at 2X or 3X the price</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is reasonably priced on Amazon, but it is also similarly priced in retail stores such as Target.</li>
            <li>Not a sharp or efficient trimmer for nasal hair.</li>
            <li>generally like Philips Norelco&#x27;s grooming products (beard, body, shaving), and this tool is no exception.</li>
            <li>The inside of my nose actually felt bare after using this, whereas I still felt hairs in there after using my old Remington.</li>
            <li>Old age brings enough indignities without suffering from unwanted hair.</li>
            <li>I really like the extension as it gets up inside where other trimmers can&#x27;t reach.  </li>
            <li>vine program gives reviewers only a limited amount of time to try out and then review products...and nose hair takes a while to grow back, but the one time I used it I&#x27;d have to say that it was, well, an absolute pleasure.  </li>
            <li>generally I just used it to trim back the protruding hairs.  </li>
            <li>Hardly cuts the nose hair and you have to place it pretty far up to get to the blade.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The nose hair trimmer itself is mostly composed of hard, black plastic.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Washes quickly under the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its very small so it takes up no room in the cabinet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace a Panasonic rotary-type trimmer that actually is still going after many years but is getting a little old and tired.</li>

            <li> It is a really good price.</li>
            <li> Good purchase.</li>
            <li> so we knew this was a good name brand.  </li>
            <li> Recommended for a number of good reasons</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how good this trimmer was.  </li>
            <li> This is a good priced, value trimmer.  </li>
            <li> quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, trimming nose and ear hair is not a topic we like to talk about but come on guys, grooming is good.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.</li>
            <li> Good product if you have out of control nose hair</li>
            <li> I also wish I knew the best way to clean it.</li>
            <li> Works great and easy to use!</li>
            <li> very satisfied with it</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the Phillips nose trimmer.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this item.  </li>
            <li> But I found this unit at a great price and have great respect for the Norelco brand (used their rotary shavers for many many years), so I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> I love this trimmer!</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t experienced an ingrown hair in your nose consider yourself lucky!</li>
            <li> The trimmer worked as advertised, was comfortable, and did a great job.</li>
            <li> It trims the ear hair nicely.</li>
            <li> feels good and slightly better make than others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Nice product</li>
            <li> That said, this one does a nice job.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s about time they upgraded this kind of thing.</li>
            <li> Eyebrow trimmer might come in handy for some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So many times you&#x27;ll see some Congressman on a talk show and they so need a good trim...</li>
            <li> I have my own tremors, and use the rotary trimmer to finish off my shaving under my nose.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and seems to be a quality product.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to manipulate into nose, ears, eyebrows.</li>
            <li> The instructions also suggest soaking the head in warm water before running the device to clean it, presumably if you weren&#x27;t good about rinsing it after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one is by far the best one yet.</li>
            <li> must say this unit was a much better tool than the Series 3300 that I also own.  </li>
            <li> Best nose trimmer as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> Great product, worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This is the third one of these kind of trimmers I&#x27;ve owned and the best.  </li>
            <li> Very cheaply made - purchase with caution.</li>
            <li> Nice that it can be easily cleaned by rinsing under the faucet.  </li>
            <li> also feel it isn&#x27;t as efficient as many reviewers have stated.</li>
            <li> This product is OK.</li>
            <li> Still absolutely love this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> trimmer did a great job gently around the inside of the nostrils, without pulling or scratching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to say that this trimmer leads the pack, and I&#x27;m really pleased with it.</li>
            <li> glad I got this one.</li>
            <li> Have used many nose and ear clippers over the years.</li>
            <li> Am cwet pleased with it.</li>
            <li> But still love the product.</li>
            <li> Much better than the microtouch.</li>
            <li> This is so much better than using scissors.  </li>
            <li> Works well I am pleased with it</li>
            <li> Trimmer is one of the better trimmers I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I really do love this trimmer, but if there is one fault</li>
            <li> The batteries that came with it were still good and functional, something that I rarely find with products that come prepackaged with disposable batteries.</li>
            <li> Gets you looking great fast.</li>
            <li> What more can</li>
            <li> The unit worked great and made fast work of my nose hair with no pulling at all.  </li>
            <li> Nose trimmers that have the razors closer to the edge of the tip are better.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> , what more can you ask for.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheap and comes with a warranty!</li>
            <li> I like this one better than the rotary ones</li>
            <li> It was okay for stray hairs in between brows and did not irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> I now have a better feel for the angle and length of time to have a better experience.  </li>
            <li> the box you will find nose trimmer itself, a cover for the top of the trimmer, and the eyebrow trimmer attachment.  </li>
            <li> I still prefer the rotary trimmers and would have preferred a device that had a more solid construction, but--that said--this device works perfectly well and is up to snuff with its competition in this category.</li>
            <li> If you want a good nose and ear trimmer at the right price it&#x27;s this one.</li>
            <li> It is very comfortable in my ears and easy to maneuver in the ears.  </li>
            <li> Well worth 10 bucks!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and safe also.</li>
            <li> Does the job quickly and effectively</li>
            <li> Most surprisingly, the I found the most useful aspect of it was the eyebrow trimming comb attachment which trimmed my eyebrows to just the right length.  </li>
            <li> Overall it does a very good job.  </li>
            <li> I can safely and comfortably use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> To make it short and sweet unlike others who write a novel just to review a product, this is the best nose hair trimmer I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> It easily slides into a nostril and doesn&#x27;t pull.</li>
            <li> Works amazing and fast and comes with a free battery!</li>
            <li> Feels durable and cuts hair fairly easy.</li>
            <li> Compact, lightweight and easy to use</li>
            <li> Easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Also has an eyebrow comb for easy trimming.</li>
            <li> Easy to install the battery and go.  </li>
            <li> Ear trimming is just as easy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Clean-up is easy, just hold the head under running water.</li>
            <li> Cleans up easily too.</li>
            <li> So easy to use and does the job</li>
            <li> so it is easy to maintain, and</li>
            <li> The directions are easy to follow and the trimmer comes with a tip cover, battery and eyebrow comb.  </li>
            <li> It is far more superior than Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Since the Philips Norelco didn&#x27;t cost very much, I&#x27;ll keep it for the handy eyebrow grooming feature.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty nice trimmer.</li>
            <li> This particular type of trimmer does a better job than the circular kind.</li>
            <li> Everything works fine, but some edges stick out here and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, it&#x27;s an awesome feature that you can run water over the tip, but I prefer to use a little alcohol square on the end to disinfect it.  </li>
            <li> Excellent little device.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a huge fan of micro-trimmers.</li>
            <li> device seems to fit well in your hand, but it is light weight and feels a bit cheap.  </li>
            <li> It doesnt pull hair and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Initially I was happy with this purchase but the trimmer stopped working after 2 1/2 months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to finally have one</li>
            <li> It is also easy to clean not to mention it does the job.</li>
            <li> Great work on multiple &amp;#</li>
            <li> The ears are also hair free.</li>
            <li> Three Phillips Norelco Trimmers were available for review.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Very powerful, so</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s easily controlled so it doesn&#x27;t over trim, and it does the job quickly and evenly.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice product and pretty useful.</li>
            <li> The trimmer quickly and easily trimmed rogue nose hairs with no problem at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Original review:  </li>
            <li> (no need to keep track of yet another charger) and priced inexpensively (rechargeable batteries and their associated mechanisms add significant cost).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can clean the heads with water.  </li>
            <li> You can also run the trimmer under the water to clean</li>
            <li> You can use it to cut away unsightly nose hairs or to trim and clean up your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> The guard makes it especially safe, although it tickles enough to cause a sneeze if you are not careful.  </li>
            <li> www.amazon.com/Remington-ND3150CDN-Battery-Operated-Trimmer/dp/B003AQ61B8/  Reasonable for ears, but seems to leave more strays than the Remington.</li>
            <li> good on the short ones</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s good to go for the next time.</li>
            <li> Absolutely necessary gadget, philips quality, good price</li>
            <li> This one is different, Norelco took the time to design something safer that would not pull, and could be rotated around for a good trimming.</li>
            <li> If you have need of a micro-trimmer for some personal grooming, this is a good choice.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, very practical!</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;m going to lose the accessories quickly.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve decided to buy another Panasonic because the rotary head trims more easily and much closer than this straight trimmer.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, just as described.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also an eyebrow comb (that will get lost quickly) and a storage cap, but otherwise the unit is self-contained.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Super and painless hair removal tool.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of my new favorite tools on the sink.  </li>
            <li> But with this nose trimmer, it&#x27;s been great, I can just turn the little trimmer and clip off those portions.</li>
            <li> Worth the cost difference, in my opinion, but this \\&quot;basic\\&quot; model is fine if it&#x27;s really all you</li>
            <li> It will fit fine in my normal shaving kit, but it&#x27;s considerably larger than most nose trimmers I&#x27;ve seen, but that is not really a bad thing.  </li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT AND NOT CHEAPLY MADE</li>
            <li> I trimmed years worth of hair from my ears with no pain</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use the eyebrow attachment that you can use to keep them the same length because I don&#x27;t have a problem there, but it&#x27;s definitely a nice addition to the set, along with a cover for the tip of the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful (unlike some trimmers)</li>
            <li> The body has a nice design and overall, this trimmer will get the job done ... slowly...with a level of discomfort.</li>
            <li> Powerful trimmer uses 1 AA battery which is included.</li>
            <li> The guard works great because I&#x27;m pressed up against the skin, which would not be possible with the old types</li>
            <li> build is solid for this kind of device.</li>
            <li> But you can push this thing right onto a hair the four times without any success.</li>
            <li> I was excited about this nose trimmer, thinking it would be an advance over the more traditional trimmers in which you inserted a slotted metal cylinder into your nostril.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But the real test for me was trimming above the eyebrows,  to leave a nice clean line.  </li>
            <li> clears the nose hairs right out.</li>
            <li> Quit working right after I got it.</li>
            <li> This trimmer does it right</li>
            <li> I now no longer have to wait till I get a haircut to get the eyebrows trimmed right.  </li>
            <li> you can see right throw my brow .</li>
            <li> To turn it on and off you twist the bottom of the device to the right.</li>
            <li> Strangely it doesn&#x27;t cost much more than the cheap ones I&#x27;ve had before.  </li>
            <li> Works ok, but needs to be stuck up pretty far into the nostril to work.  </li>
            <li> It works great for a little trim!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Philips is sending me a free replacement, so I would say that customer service is good, but not the product, at least for me.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and simple to use.  </li>
            <li> The long comb was much more effective for my eyebrows than the short.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Another plus is that this trimmer is very reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like this trimmer very much.</li>
            <li> pretty good little product.</li>
            <li> The nozzle is a perfect shape to get into tight places and the blades are very effective in cutting hair.</li>
            <li> However, it turns out that traditional design is much better.</li>
            <li> At first I thought the design was funky but now I see the genius in it.</li>
            <li> operates exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> The older I get, the less hair on top and the more elsewhere.</li>
            <li> This is my first nose hair trimer</li>
            <li> This product is more about the design than actual function.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> When I first took the device out of the package I could tell it was a well made item.  </li>
            <li> This is my first foray into trimmers.</li>
            <li> I do think the first time I tried it</li>
            <li> Given that there is no where to store the attachment, it will most likely be the first thing that I lose.  </li>
            <li> If you twist left and line up the triangles, you are able to pull the device apart to reveal the battery compartment.  </li>
            <li> first Phillips Norelco Trimmer up for review is the Philips Norelco</li>
            <li> with steady hands and this high quality Philips Norelco trimmer,  my eyebrows looked fantastic.</li>
            <li> Much better than the razors with the wider, flat head.</li>
            <li> The first of this type of trimmer that really works.  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, no one ever wants to admit that they have nose hair in the first place, or a nose hair problem at all.  </li>
            <li> It effectively trims nose and ear hair down close to the skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to tickle the back part of your nose closest to your head, so take it easy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s reasonably quiet and easy to use, just press it against the skin where you are cleaning up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a fair number of the Philips Norelco products and they all seem to last a long time, despite being budget priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m liking the side approach, it certainly cuts well, both in the ear and in the nose.</li>
            <li> (You have to twist it to a certain position.)</li>
            <li> The con is that there is a somewhat large area of &amp;#34;no cut zone&amp;#34; at the tip of the device.  </li>
            <li> Philips Norelco Nose Trimmer is a no frills, easy to use, wet-dry personal groomer that gives you reasonable value for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It healed fine, but the opening is smaller for one nostril and the inside tissue thicker.  </li>
            <li> This is a handy little trimmer at a \\&quot;reasonable\\&quot; price.  </li>
            <li> Many seem to think it works fine, but to me it&#x27;s a distant second.</li>
            <li> It was effective in removing stray long hairs and would likely do a decent job on eyebrows, assuming that the length is right for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is one of the most painful things I ever experienced.</li>
            <li> Thanks so,p.s.</li>
            <li> This type of tool will be dropped and I find it very discouraging that it could now withstand this sort of problem.  </li>
            <li> Did not process the bats in the cave very well.</li>
            <li> Does not cut much.  </li>
            <li> Works very well doing what it was intended for.</li>
            <li> This trimmer had absolutely zero pain involve.</li>
            <li> Simple, cheap, and does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> I hope that it works as well for you as it did for me and thanks for taking the time to read my review.</li>
            <li> You can trim very close, without any injury (unlike scissors).</li>
            <li> Lightning fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended product!</li>
            <li> Depending on disposable AA batts (one, included) is reasonable for a gadget used infrequently</li>
            <li> It took so much hair off</li>
            <li> so the trimmer can get in there and do some real work.</li>
            <li> 34;too much hair&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Comes with a eye brow trimmer and works very well.  </li>
            <li> Philips Norelco could have sprung for a real on/off switch.  </li>
            <li> The blades seem to cut well enough and, as promised by Philips Norelco, the shave was comfortable without any pulling or tugging.  </li>
            <li> the whole, the Philips Norelco Nose Trimmer works as you expect it would.  </li>
            <li> However, with much experience, I still prefer the rotary blade style for nose hair...</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no pinching or catching of hair, and if you keep it pressed firmly to the skin, there shouldn&#x27;t be any tickling.</li>
            <li> This is a great little trimmer for small places, is easy to use, works really well and is very convenient.  </li>
            <li> Already it has lasted longer and cuts better than any other trimmer I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> The design, with its vertical trimming head, makes it more efficient at its task than other trimmers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I know it sounds silly, but if you have used many trimmers you are well aware of how flimsy most of them feel.  </li>
            <li> With the unique shape of the trimmer like a tiny comb, I can control the movement inside my nose.</li>
            <li> and it is much better than other trimmers that I have used,</li>
            <li> As we get older hair pops up in places that we really didn&#x27;t want it.  </li>
            <li> I typically use the rounded style of nose hair trimmer, but this version is a bit more comfortable - especially if you&#x27;ve ever used the circular type with the battery going out (yeouch!!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It felt solid and strong, unlike many of the cheap trimmers that last only a couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery compartment cover is firm, the blade on top is solid as well.  </li>
            <li> It might be a little better if it had a light, but that&#x27;s really not necessary.  </li>
            <li> As we age, hair in desirable places begins to vanish or change color, and less desirable hair starts growing all the more vigorously.</li>
            <li> I got this to replace an older trimmer with blades on the end instead of the side.</li>
            <li> It is quiet and cuts quickly without any pulling of the hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, these are decent nose hair trimmers (</li>
            <li> The price is decent and they do a decent job.</li>
            <li> The price is decent and they do a decent job.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> or if there is the slightest chance that you&#x27;re going to want to do some \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot;, then I would highly recommend you invest in the NT5175/42 5100 model.  </li>
            <li> It is always a little intimidating to have something that noisy coming at your face, but this little puppy works beautifully.  </li>
            <li> Outstanding little product.</li>
            <li> Did the job + a few more jobs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for the normal viewers sitting at home</li>
            <li> usually purchase those $10 micro-trimmers that break quickly, but do their job if you squeeze them correctly (hold the top together because that is usually the breaking point for these cheaply made micro-trimmers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this makes a fine trimmer to have in the bathroom when you have to go check yourself after watching their out of control eyebrows and ear hair and all that other stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine</li>
            <li> Oddly enough, it was so hot</li>
            <li> Update after using it periodically for about a year &amp; a half: It was doing fine</li>
            <li> Really, this thing barely cuts.</li>
            <li> This is just like the simple original I bought several years ago which I&#x27;d still be using if I hadn&#x27;t dropped it.</li>
            <li> It also takes care of all his extra hair, which is why I bought it in the first place.  </li>
            <li> The top half that looks like it might be covered with a grippy latex is really just more textured hard plastic, finished differently to give it designer looks.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got hairy ears or other parts, this baby will clean you up.</li>
            <li> Found that the other design of blade with the &#x27;circular&#x27; head actually gives you a closer and more complete cut of  objectionable nasal hairs.</li>
            <li> It is the first one that seems to have been designed as a professional tool, rather than simply an &amp;#34;as</li>
            <li> For hairs that are lying flat, this one is really difficult to use effectively, whereas the other style lets you kind of stab and plow where the hair and skin meet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy enough to get used to, though, especially with the overall quality of the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a simple enough maneuver, but not as easy to use as the ‘weed whacker’ variety of nose hair trimmer, where the blade rotates and you simply have to abut the trimmer to the surface that needs trimming.  </li>
            <li> It took several passes and did not remove the hairs in certain places inside my nose.</li>
            <li> is this doesn&#x27;t fit in one of those little grooming kits like my others do.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my 15 year old son who has severe disabilities (so I have to do all his shaving for him).</li>
            <li> Relegated my old one to the garbage immediately.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my eyebrows and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> So long and thanks for all the fish!</li>
            <li> /&gt;After popping the battery in and turning the trimmer on you are instantly surprised by the amount of power it delivers.  </li>
            <li> as well as cut any \\&quot;wild</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t had any issues with \\&quot;pulls\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Production values are reasonable for a product such as this.  </li>
            <li> No as powerful as expected</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with any of them, just not as good, for me, as the rotary.ested, either.  </li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with any of them, just not as good, for me, as the rotary.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t touch it with my bare hands so that I could pull the new battery I had just put in out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the exact same as this one, but with several attachments, and it&#x27;s only a few $$&#x27;s more.  </li>
            <li> The main reason was the trimmer didn&#x27;t cut nose hair properly.</li>
            <li> Overall, these are decent nose hair trimmers (</li>
            <li> My one tiny issue is that there are little pieces you want to hold onto or together and they are so easy to lose.  </li>
            <li> see how long the trimmer lasts, but I have very high hopes.  </li>
            <li> It is powerful for running on only a single AA battery.</li>
            <li> The packing is also this impossible to open, totally destroyed when you do kind that can easily slice your hand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super risky to use a trimmer here because one little slip and you&#x27;re done for, but</li>
            <li> Needed this desperately and it is a wonderful little tool.  </li>
            <li> There is no pinching or cutting, and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> And I really only need a light trim of a few hairs here and there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d go for something else, this isn&#x27;t worth even the ten I spent on it.</li>
            <li> A real bargain at $9.99 with the same features as similar devices at 2X or 3X the price</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is reasonably priced on Amazon, but it is also similarly priced in retail stores such as Target.</li>
            <li> Not a sharp or efficient trimmer for nasal hair.</li>
            <li> generally like Philips Norelco&#x27;s grooming products (beard, body, shaving), and this tool is no exception.</li>
            <li> The inside of my nose actually felt bare after using this, whereas I still felt hairs in there after using my old Remington.</li>
            <li> Old age brings enough indignities without suffering from unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> I really like the extension as it gets up inside where other trimmers can&#x27;t reach.  </li>
            <li> vine program gives reviewers only a limited amount of time to try out and then review products...and nose hair takes a while to grow back, but the one time I used it I&#x27;d have to say that it was, well, an absolute pleasure.  </li>
            <li> generally I just used it to trim back the protruding hairs.  </li>
            <li> Hardly cuts the nose hair and you have to place it pretty far up to get to the blade.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The nose hair trimmer itself is mostly composed of hard, black plastic.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Washes quickly under the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its very small so it takes up no room in the cabinet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a Panasonic rotary-type trimmer that actually is still going after many years but is getting a little old and tired.</li>
            <li> but until now I dealt mainly with nose hair by plucking those pesky little hairs one-by-one.  </li>
            <li> Seems much harder to use effectively, especially for my nose, than a Remington product which recently stopped working after about 20 years; it was similar to this one:</li>
            <li> It also comes with a AA lithium battery--lithium technology, long and short eyebrow combs, plus a beard comb, cleaning brush, and a carrying pouch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed with this item, it does not clear all the hair instantly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my second, the other tends to tickle my nose making it a more difficult job.  </li>
            <li> Probably used it 5-10 times and since it&#x27;s outside Amazon&#x27;s return window, it was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Try the Toilet Tree Nose Trimmer--good one, that.</li>
            <li> As a bonus, the trimmer works anywhere you can bring it flat against your skin, allowing minor clean-up or shaping without using another tool.</li>
            <li> needs are simple - but other simple nose trimmers never worked as well</li>
            <li> I do not have a beard and so could not test the beard comb, but having had a beard and having gone through a number of beard trimmers, I find it hard to believe this attachment is of much use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is a touch of orange around the cutting apparatus, an interesting stylistic measure that, perhaps, indicates that someone on the Philips Norelco team that designed this is a Cincinnati Bengals fan.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does not grab the long hairs</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know why I waited so long in ordering this..</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s minor</li>
            <li> The plastic tip at the end is just a bit too long.</li>
            <li> I like the long eyebrow comb.</li>
            <li> although I do like the long eyebrow</li>
            <li> there and this is clearly not the result of precision manufacturing.  </li>
            <li> I read reviews on other trimers people were regularly taking abut the hair getting pulled or yanked.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> I find it works a bit better than the traditional trimmer design, and have had no pulling, but it is not perfect, and I still need to finish up with small scissors.</li>
            <li> The only way you know it&#x27;s working is the sound of the blades cutting the hair.</li>
            <li> The second thing may be the clear cover, but at least this is replaced on the item after each use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s sharp no pulling of the hairs very smooth cutting and</li>
            <li> Better then my last trimmer with a circular cutting blade, gets in tight places and cuts like a champ...</li>
            <li> Has a 2 year limited warranty.</li>
            <li> so far they cut instead of pulling.nose and ear hair no more.</li>
            <li> This is not an heirloom device, but will probably last a 1-3 years, which seems to be the average for this class.  </li>
            <li> It can be used to get those small hairs right under the nose that are hard to get with the razor.</li>
            <li> The other two used a round shaped head that generally pulled on the nose hair when inserted.  </li>
            <li> Never really had one before,but</li>
            <li> And, I will probably buy another one but being so fragile weighs heavily on this decision.</li>
            <li> The device feels heavy enough, and not \\&quot;cheap\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> You then drag the trimmer across your eyebrow and the job is done.</li>
            <li> This eyebrow trimmer was not very efficient, either.</li>
            <li> complete waste of money!!</li>
            <li> The device trims your hair in your nose well, but it also takes it to another level by offering the ability to touch up other spots on your face and body.</li>
            <li> This is a small thing, and I do recommend this trimmer overall.</li>
            <li> The other nose trimmers that I have used are the circular blade type</li>
            <li> I was using it the other day</li>
            <li> /&gt;The trimmer also comes with an eyebrow trimmer attachment, but let&#x27;s just say that I&#x27;m not interested in going there.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband loves the trimmer and likes that the trimmer itself is small enough to trim the nose hairs.  </li>
            <li> The packaging term: &amp;#34;Nose Trimmer&amp;#34; is funny or frightening, depending on how you look at it.).</li>
            <li> The packaging term: &amp;#34;Nose Trimmer&amp;#34; is funny or frightening, depending on how you look at it.).</li>
            <li> The problem with this trimmer is that the cutting blades are too far down on the device, so you have to stick it really far up into your nose to get any hairs.</li>
            <li> They must have gotten dull with age, so I bought the same ones again.  </li>
            <li> I was always cautious that I did not stick my eye when using them, and it was hard to orient them in the mirror, especially when switching hands.  </li>
            <li> Not worth a dime.</li>
            <li> Works very well, much less expensive at Amazon.</li>
            <li> It makes a popping sound every so often which seems to indicate it&#x27;s done something, but really, it&#x27;s tedious slow going and repetitive to make any progress with this thing.</li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t go wrong with this especially for the LOW price!!!!!</li>
            <li> lasted less than two weeks..dead.</li>
            <li> and it was an odd feeling.</li>
            <li> You place the device slightly in the ear canal and turn it around.</li>
            <li> Uses one battery and provides very active microblade type trimming.</li>
            <li> Got bogged down in boogers.</li>
            <li> I just need it for little updates and trims and maybe a stray eye-brow hair that popped up.</li>
            <li> I do wish it came with a little bag to put the three pieces in.</li>
            <li> I keep those little packaged alcohol squares around, along with baby wipes, for keeping everything from tweezer tips to the handle of my makeup case</li>
            <li> used to use a small sharp pointy scissors to trim the brows.  </li>
            <li> Solidly made, not flimsy or poorly constructed.</li>
            <li> have had for a few months and working well</li>
            <li> Those of us with round bulby noses sprouting hairs in the Rotunda could use some help.</li>
            <li> It also cleans off easily so no booger-transference.</li>
            <li> It was not easy to manipulate it either, so</li>
            <li> The eyebrow trimmer  is small and looks like a little plastic spring.</li>
            <li> It might just be me, but it was hard to determine if I had the blade down against the skin or area</li>
            <li> The trimmer end is long, thin, and angled, which makes it even easier to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a few nose hair trimmers in the past</li>
            <li> I like how it is a small narrow trimmer which you can rotate around inside your nose.</li>
            <li> NOT worth a DAMN, Phillips/Norelco should be ASHAMED to have their name on this product!!</li>
            <li> have very little ear hair, and so that feature was not tested, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite uncomfortable and I can only trim the closest hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used in the past and gets the job done with a minimum of bother and time.</li>
            <li> But unless someone is lying, they usually do (have hair/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used one other nose/ear trimmer in the past, which was too painful to use.</li>
            <li> thing does well for ear hair or making eyebrows neater, but as a nose trimmer it&#x27;s not very good.</li>
            <li> As above, it looks like a plastic spring that  fits over the existing trimmer head, giving you a small clearance for cutting.  </li>
            <li> It seems silly to emphasize that the battery compartment closes snugly and stays closed, but I&#x27;ve found you can&#x27;t always assume that will be the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just be careful if you give it as a gift, the recipient might take it the wrong way!</li>
            <li> The tip makes it difficult to get in the small spaces and trim hairs.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and this product has no issue with it.  </li>
            <li> Not happy with this item.</li>
            <li> It gets somewhat frustrating.  </li>
            <li> Had some trimmers in the past but they all pulled rather than cutting the hairs.</li>
            <li> How weird is that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> CAN T GO WRONG WITH NORELCO .</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not perfect.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Seems to grind up the hair instead of cutting them.</li>
            <li> yet!&lt;br /&gt;The angle of the tip makes it awkward to rotate the head and keep it in contact with the skin.</li>
            <li> Has a no pull cutting blade technology; and works as stated.  </li>
            <li> Was somewhat disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hated this product shape.</li>
            <li> WORTHLESS!!!!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I was excited about this nose trimmer, thinking it would be an advance over the more traditional trimmers in which you inserted a slotted metal cylinder into your nostril. However, it turns out that traditional design is much better. The problem with this trimmer is that the cutting blades are too far down on the device, so you have to stick it really far up into your nose to get any hairs. It&#x27;s quite uncomfortable and I can only trim the closest hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing does well for ear hair or making eyebrows neater, but as a nose trimmer it&#x27;s not very good.</li>
            <li> The first of this type of trimmer that really works.  Already it has lasted longer and cuts better than any other trimmer I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works great.  I really like the extension as it gets up inside where other trimmers can&#x27;t reach.  Great price too.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Did the job + a few more jobs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a huge fan of micro-trimmers. I don&#x27;t pluck. Nope not me. I don&#x27;t have a big &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; problem though, so there is there. I just need it for little updates and trims and maybe a stray eye-brow hair that popped up. Nothing major.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually purchase those $10 micro-trimmers that break quickly, but do their job if you squeeze them correctly (hold the top together because that is usually the breaking point for these cheaply made micro-trimmers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Philips Norelco is built for Nose Hair trimming - but it has add-ons and the ability for the micro-trimming functions. The device trims your hair in your nose well, but it also takes it to another level by offering the ability to touch up other spots on your face and body. It also cleans off easily so no booger-transference. Wouldn&#x27;t want that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t pass this one up just because it says nose trimmer. If you need a great micro-trimmer this one is for you.</li>
            <li> Better then my last trimmer with a circular cutting blade, gets in tight places and cuts like a champ...</li>
            <li> I had to return this to Philips after six weeks and using it only twice. It just didn&#x27;t work. Oddly enough, it was so hot I couldn&#x27;t touch it with my bare hands so that I could pull the new battery I had just put in out. How weird is that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also feel it isn&#x27;t as efficient as many reviewers have stated. It took several passes and did not remove the hairs in certain places inside my nose. The inside of my nose was sore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips is sending me a free replacement, so I would say that customer service is good, but not the product, at least for me.</li>
            <li> Update after using it periodically for about a year &amp; a half: It was doing fine but then suddenly shorted out while I was rinsing it. Time to go back to Remington.  Original review:  Seems much harder to use effectively, especially for my nose, than a Remington product which recently stopped working after about 20 years; it was similar to this one: www.amazon.com/Remington-ND3150CDN-Battery-Operated-Trimmer/dp/B003AQ61B8/  Reasonable for ears, but seems to leave more strays than the Remington. For hairs that are lying flat, this one is really difficult to use effectively, whereas the other style lets you kind of stab and plow where the hair and skin meet.</li>
            <li> It works great! It doesnt pull hair and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> clears the nose hairs right out.</li>
            <li> As describes--no pulling. I trimmed years worth of hair from my ears with no pain whatever..</li>
            <li> works like charm specially in facial corners</li>
            <li> Quit working right after I got it. Changed batteries but still won&#x27;t work. Not happy with this item.</li>
            <li> Pass on these.....buyer beware.</li>
            <li> It stopped working after being used four or five times</li>
            <li> This product is OK. it does do the job, but I found it to be a bit on the flimsy side.</li>
            <li> Purchased in March four months and five uses later and it stopped working.</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer I have ever owned. At first I thought the design was funky but now I see the genius in it. Trust me, if you are doing ears and nose this is the best thing you can get and the price is outstanding.</li>
            <li> Initially I was happy with this purchase but the trimmer stopped working after 2 1/2 months. Probably used it 5-10 times and since it&#x27;s outside Amazon&#x27;s return window, it was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Really, this thing barely cuts. It makes a popping sound every so often which seems to indicate it&#x27;s done something, but really, it&#x27;s tedious slow going and repetitive to make any progress with this thing. And I really only need a light trim of a few hairs here and there. But you can push this thing right onto a hair the four times without any success. The packing is also this impossible to open, totally destroyed when you do kind that can easily slice your hand. I&#x27;d go for something else, this isn&#x27;t worth even the ten I spent on it.</li>
            <li> I like this. I use it on my 15 year old son who has severe disabilities (so I have to do all his shaving for him). It easily slides into a nostril and doesn&#x27;t pull. It can be used to get those small hairs right under the nose that are hard to get with the razor. It trims the ear hair nicely. It didn&#x27;t do well on the neck hair but hey, if it does only the nose then you get what it is advertised as. It is a really good price. It comes with a battery. I do wish it came with a little bag to put the three pieces in. I know I&#x27;m going to lose the accessories quickly.</li>
            <li> This is the best ear and nose trimmer that I have and I favor Norelco products for quality.</li>
            <li> UPDATE:  Nov. 30, 2015.  Still absolutely love this trimmer.  It&#x27;s great to finally have one that I can safely and comfortably use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;This is incredibly solid and well-made, unlike some of the flimsy , unstable trimmers I&#x27;ve thrown money away on over the years.  It seems silly to emphasize that the battery compartment closes snugly and stays closed, but I&#x27;ve found you can&#x27;t always assume that will be the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer did a great job gently around the inside of the nostrils, without pulling or scratching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the real test for me was trimming above the eyebrows,  to leave a nice clean line.  It&#x27;s super risky to use a trimmer here because one little slip and you&#x27;re done for, but with steady hands and this high quality Philips Norelco trimmer,  my eyebrows looked fantastic. I didn&#x27;t use the eyebrow attachment that you can use to keep them the same length because I don&#x27;t have a problem there, but it&#x27;s definitely a nice addition to the set, along with a cover for the tip of the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, it&#x27;s an awesome feature that you can run water over the tip, but I prefer to use a little alcohol square on the end to disinfect it.  I keep those little packaged alcohol squares around, along with baby wipes, for keeping everything from tweezer tips to the handle of my makeup case clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for reading my review.  I hope it helps someone decide. I&#x27;ve purchased dozens of trimmers over the years, for myself and for family members.  I have to say that this trimmer leads the pack, and I&#x27;m really pleased with it.</li>
            <li> operates exactly as described.  Recommend it</li>
            <li> Does not grab the long hairs&lt;br /&gt;does good on the short ones</li>
            <li> Very nice trimmer.Never really had one before,but glad I got this one.Thanks so,p.s.Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Have used many nose and ear clippers over the years. This one is by far the best one yet.</li>
            <li> I dropped it and that is all it wrote!  The distance was about 30 inches on a tile floor.  The head broke and parts went everywhere.  This type of tool will be dropped and I find it very discouraging that it could now withstand this sort of problem.  The plastic did break so there is no repairing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say this unit was a much better tool than the Series 3300 that I also own.  And, I will probably buy another one but being so fragile weighs heavily on this decision.</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT AND NOT CHEAPLY MADE</li>
            <li> Had some trimmers in the past but they all pulled rather than cutting the hairs. These do the job well. Used them for several hours (not all at one time - I am not that hairy) and they did not get appreciably duller. I even use them to blend my neck hair. I do not worry about getting nicked or cut. The older I get, the less hair on top and the more elsewhere. Product seems well designed, made, and is durable.</li>
            <li> This is my first nose hair trimer and I think I started with the best!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I read reviews on other trimers people were regularly taking abut the hair getting pulled or yanked.&lt;br /&gt;With this one that NEVER happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very basic operation. One click and its on. 2 click replace battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Washes quickly under the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its very small so it takes up no room in the cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a blade guard for eyebrows but i never used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All i can say this has been a excellent experience and you can&#x27;t go wrong with this especially for the LOW price!!!!!</li>
            <li> Stopped working after 2 days. Very cheaply made - purchase with caution.</li>
            <li> Excellent little device.  Very powerful, so no tugging.  Can clean the heads with water.  Well worth 10 bucks!!</li>
            <li> To make it short and sweet unlike others who write a novel just to review a product, this is the best nose hair trimmer I have ever owned.Easy to use and safe also.It is also easy to clean not to mention it does the job.</li>
            <li> Does the job at a great price point!</li>
            <li> Am cwet pleased with it.</li>
            <li> feels good and slightly better make than others I&#x27;ve used. Good purchase.</li>
            <li> Works great just what was needed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it sparingly, but it work great.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a Panasonic rotary-type trimmer that actually is still going after many years but is getting a little old and tired. Since the Philips Norelco didn&#x27;t cost very much, I&#x27;ll keep it for the handy eyebrow grooming feature. However, I&#x27;ve decided to buy another Panasonic because the rotary head trims more easily and much closer than this straight trimmer. Many seem to think it works fine, but to me it&#x27;s a distant second.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, very practical! I recommend it</li>
            <li> Does the job quickly and effectively</li>
            <li> pretty good little product. helps me keep those stray nose hairs tamed</li>
            <li> I like the way it works but it stopped working after a month. Repaced batteries no avail going to return.</li>
            <li> This is just like the simple original I bought several years ago which I&#x27;d still be using if I hadn&#x27;t dropped it. If you want a good nose and ear trimmer at the right price it&#x27;s this one.</li>
            <li> Works just as described! Does NOT pull nose hairs.</li>
            <li> Best nose trimmer as far as I&#x27;m concerned. Also works well for ear hair. Relegated my old one to the garbage immediately.</li>
            <li> Trimmed well my nose jungle vines. Did not process the bats in the cave very well. Got bogged down in boogers. Could use 4 wheel drive.</li>
            <li> Disappointing. Does not cut much.  Try the Toilet Tree Nose Trimmer--good one, that.</li>
            <li> Nice product it&#x27;s sharp no pulling of the hairs very smooth cutting and the size is perfect for the ears and the nose. The cleaning with water is perfect although we use alcohol for sanitation purposes after the nose use. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> AWESOME PRODUCT , YOU CAN USE IT FOR MORE THAN ONE THING , THATS WHAT IS AWESOME ABOUT IT . CAN T GO WRONG WITH NORELCO .</li>
            <li> Hardly cuts the nose hair and you have to place it pretty far up to get to the blade. I also use to clip stray eyebrows and the awkwardness of the blade cut my eyelashes. I hated this product shape. I have used these type on instruments before with no effort or problem. This thing I give one star.</li>
            <li> it  works great.. don&#x27;t know why I waited so long in ordering this.. very satisfied with it</li>
            <li> Same brand we have been using for years. They must have gotten dull with age, so I bought the same ones again.  They work well.</li>
            <li> Works very well doing what it was intended for. It&#x27;s powerful (unlike some trimmers) I&#x27;ve used in the past and gets the job done with a minimum of bother and time. Rinse it under the tap and it&#x27;s good to go for the next time. The design, with its vertical trimming head, makes it more efficient at its task than other trimmers I&#x27;ve used. I have not used the eyebrow trimmer attachment so can&#x27;t speak to that. I leave that to my barber. I don&#x27;t want to come out looking like Joan Crawford!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this nose trimmer.  His shaver is a Philips Norelco so we knew this was a good name brand.  This is a great little trimmer for small places, is easy to use, works really well and is very convenient.  Much better than him using my nail scissors to trim!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty nice trimmer. What I like best is that it can be rinsed with water. This trimmer works well and fits well into the hand. The trimmer end is long, thin, and angled, which makes it even easier to use. It is effective in getting rid of nose hairs without cutting or nicking skin. It hums quietly. It is powerful for running on only a single AA battery. Another plus is that this trimmer is very reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there is one thing I did not like about it. In order to turn it on and off takes two hands. I prefer one that turns on and off with the simple push of a button. This is a small thing, and I do recommend this trimmer overall.</li>
            <li> Works amazing and fast and comes with a free battery! I love this trimmer!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the Phillips nose trimmer. This particular type of trimmer does a better job than the circular kind. I also used the eyebrow trimmers and they work very nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used one other nose/ear trimmer in the past, which was too painful to use. This trimmer had absolutely zero pain involve. No pulling, tearing, or scratching. The only way you know it&#x27;s working is the sound of the blades cutting the hair. Great product, worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Broke within a month of purchase</li>
            <li> My husband is happy with it.  I tried it on my eyebrows and was pleasantly surprised.  It works great for a little trim!  It also takes care of all his extra hair, which is why I bought it in the first place.  It might be a little better if it had a light, but that&#x27;s really not necessary.  I also wish I knew the best way to clean it. I&#x27;ve just been wiping it with an antibacterial wipe. But still love the product.</li>
            <li> Ouch! Not a sharp or efficient trimmer for nasal hair. This trimmer has a tendency to pull rather than cut. The body has a nice design and overall, this trimmer will get the job done ... slowly...with a level of discomfort.</li>
            <li> Was somewhat disappointed. Found that the other design of blade with the &#x27;circular&#x27; head actually gives you a closer and more complete cut of  objectionable nasal hairs.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got hairy ears or other parts, this baby will clean you up. A real bargain at $9.99 with the same features as similar devices at 2X or 3X the price</li>
            <li> Works great. Comes with a battery which is awesome.</li>
            <li> Nose hair trimmer doesn&#x27;t hurt at all, no pulling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints about this product. Simple, cheap, and does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> Much better than the microtouch. Feels durable and cuts hair fairly easy. Great price.</li>
            <li> Guys...  and gals, it&#x27;s reality.  As we get older hair pops up in places that we really didn&#x27;t want it.  Nobody likes the reality that a nose hair trimmer might be a necessity, but it is.  That said, this one does a nice job.  It&#x27;s my second, the other tends to tickle my nose making it a more difficult job.  This one functions as described without the tickling.  If you buy it I hope that it works as well for you as it did for me and thanks for taking the time to read my review.</li>
            <li> This is so much better than using scissors.  You can trim very close, without any injury (unlike scissors).</li>
            <li> Really great quality. Lightning fast shipping. Awesome!</li>
            <li> No as powerful as expected</li>
            <li> Outstanding little product. Very happy with my purchase. Solidly made, not flimsy or poorly constructed. Amazing value!</li>
            <li> So far so good. I got this to replace an older trimmer with blades on the end instead of the side. I&#x27;m liking the side approach, it certainly cuts well, both in the ear and in the nose.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this item.  Quick delivery, just as described.</li>
            <li> Works well I am pleased with it</li>
            <li> Awesome but it died after 2.5 months......</li>
            <li> have had for a few months and working well</li>
            <li> Absolutely necessary gadget, philips quality, good price</li>
            <li> Hubby is happy with his &amp;#34;hair free&amp;#34; nose.</li>
            <li> This product is more about the design than actual function.</li>
            <li> Compact, lightweight and easy to use</li>
            <li> Works great and easy to use!</li>
            <li> Broke after only a month use. Check out manual nose hair trimmer by Muzitao.</li>
            <li> So long and thanks for all the fish!</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised. Trimmed nose hairs close without pulling and no nicks. Have not yet used the eyebrow trimmer attachment. Easy to handle. Comes with 1 AA battery.</li>
            <li> complete waste of money!! NOT worth a DAMN, Phillips/Norelco should be ASHAMED to have their name on this product!! WORTHLESS!!!!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Doesn&#x27;t pinch or pull.&lt;br /&gt;Only one regret about the purchase: now I&#x27;m having to carry a stick to beat back all the ladies.</li>
            <li> Best trimmers so far they cut instead of pulling.nose and ear hair no more.</li>
            <li> Works very well, much less expensive at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Best nose trimmer I&#x27;ve found yet.</li>
            <li> Like this trimmer very much. Won&#x27;t use anything else. Old age brings enough indignities without suffering from unwanted hair. This trimmer is an essential part of the solution.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a few nose hair trimmers in the past and I always purchase the Norelco brand. It trims without pulling the hair. No pain involved! Powerful trimmer uses 1 AA battery which is included. Also has an eyebrow comb for easy trimming. Best part is the trimmer is fully washable. Highly recommended product!</li>
            <li> This is the third one of these kind of trimmers I&#x27;ve owned and the best.  The other two used a round shaped head that generally pulled on the nose hair when inserted.  It was not easy to manipulate it either, so generally I just used it to trim back the protruding hairs.  It would not do eyebrows or mustaches either.  This one is different, Norelco took the time to design something safer that would not pull, and could be rotated around for a good trimming. The guard makes it especially safe, although it tickles enough to cause a sneeze if you are not careful.  I had nose surgery (outside) last summer, they cut a deep divot to remove a basil cancer cell.  It took months to heal, and I opted not to do any reconstruction.  It healed fine, but the opening is smaller for one nostril and the inside tissue thicker.  The guard works great because I&#x27;m pressed up against the skin, which would not be possible with the old types I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use a small sharp pointy scissors to trim the brows.  I was always cautious that I did not stick my eye when using them, and it was hard to orient them in the mirror, especially when switching hands.  This trimmer does it right, it&#x27;s easily controlled so it doesn&#x27;t over trim, and it does the job quickly and evenly.  I now no longer have to wait till I get a haircut to get the eyebrows trimmed right.  The only downside and it&#x27;s minor is this doesn&#x27;t fit in one of those little grooming kits like my others do.  It will fit fine in my normal shaving kit, but it&#x27;s considerably larger than most nose trimmers I&#x27;ve seen, but that is not really a bad thing.  Strangely it doesn&#x27;t cost much more than the cheap ones I&#x27;ve had before.  Recommended for a number of good reasons, it&#x27;s about time they upgraded this kind of thing.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco NT3155/60 Trimmer is one of the better trimmers I have ever used.  When I first took the device out of the package I could tell it was a well made item.  It felt solid and strong, unlike many of the cheap trimmers that last only a couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery compartment cover is firm, the blade on top is solid as well.  I know it sounds silly, but if you have used many trimmers you are well aware of how flimsy most of them feel.  Even the comb that fits on the blade is snug and secure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After popping the battery in and turning the trimmer on you are instantly surprised by the amount of power it delivers.  It was a pleasant surprise.  I really do love this trimmer, but if there is one fault it might be how the blade/trimmer is to the curve of the head.  It might just be me, but it was hard to determine if I had the blade down against the skin or area you wanted to trim.  It&#x27;s easy enough to get used to, though, especially with the overall quality of the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll see how long the trimmer lasts, but I have very high hopes.  It&#x27;s one of my new favorite tools on the sink.  Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how good this trimmer was.  I was apprehensive at first because the design differs from trimmers I&#x27;ve had in the past.  trimming blades are exposed on the outside of one side of the trimmer, as opposed to a 360 degree blade covered by some sort of barrier where the hair needs to be sucked in.  Easy to install the battery and go.  You can&#x27;t see the blade cut, but you will hear it.  It&#x27;s going to tickle the back part of your nose closest to your head, so take it easy.  Ear trimming is just as easy.  Cleaning is a snap, just rinse it under water.  This trimmer comes with and eyebrow trimming attachment.  As great of a trimmer as this is, I just can&#x27;t take the chance of messing up an eyebrow.  Maybe one day I&#x27;ll have the courage.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best nose trimmer that I have ever used! I like how it is a small narrow trimmer which you can rotate around inside your nose. The other nose trimmers that I have used are the circular blade type but they do not cut as well especially on those hairs that are on the outer edge of your nose. I could never get those hairs with the circular type nose trimmers and would have to resort to using tweezers or scissors. But with this nose trimmer, it&#x27;s been great, I can just turn the little trimmer and clip off those portions. This trimmer also comes with an eyebrow trimmer which works great!</li>
            <li> As we age, hair in desirable places begins to vanish or change color, and less desirable hair starts growing all the more vigorously. This trimmer helps keep that 2nd category at bay without the discomfort and inadvertent jabs of doing the job manually with scissors and tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s reasonably quiet and easy to use, just press it against the skin where you are cleaning up. There&#x27;s no pinching or catching of hair, and if you keep it pressed firmly to the skin, there shouldn&#x27;t be any tickling. It takes a couple of passes if your hair grows in different directions, but that&#x27;s all there is to it. As a bonus, the trimmer works anywhere you can bring it flat against your skin, allowing minor clean-up or shaping without using another tool. There&#x27;s also an eyebrow comb (that will get lost quickly) and a storage cap, but otherwise the unit is self-contained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean-up is easy, just hold the head under running water. The instructions also suggest soaking the head in warm water before running the device to clean it, presumably if you weren&#x27;t good about rinsing it after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The build is solid for this kind of device. Depending on disposable AA batts (one, included) is reasonable for a gadget used infrequently (no need to keep track of yet another charger) and priced inexpensively (rechargeable batteries and their associated mechanisms add significant cost).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve generally like Philips Norelco&#x27;s grooming products (beard, body, shaving), and this tool is no exception. If you have need of a micro-trimmer for some personal grooming, this is a good choice. Just be careful if you give it as a gift, the recipient might take it the wrong way! Recommended.</li>
            <li> This is a good priced, value trimmer.  It works for nose, ear, and eyebrow hair.  The trimmer takes one AA battery and lasts for awhile before needing replacement.  I typically use the rounded style of nose hair trimmer, but this version is a bit more comfortable - especially if you&#x27;ve ever used the circular type with the battery going out (yeouch!!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review as time goes by with notes for durability and battery life.  I&#x27;ve used a fair number of the Philips Norelco products and they all seem to last a long time, despite being budget priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is reasonably priced on Amazon, but it is also similarly priced in retail stores such as Target.</li>
            <li> Do not use it on your eye brows even with the guard on like i did . It took so much hair off you can see right throw my brow . I just dumped in the garbage where it belongs</li>
            <li> Excellent product, received it offered . Thank You.</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer.  It is very easy to use and seems to be a quality product.  It effectively trims nose and ear hair down close to the skin.  Most surprisingly, the I found the most useful aspect of it was the eyebrow trimming comb attachment which trimmed my eyebrows to just the right length.  The batteries that came with it were still good and functional, something that I rarely find with products that come prepackaged with disposable batteries.</li>
            <li> lasted less than two weeks..dead. No up to Philips quality!</li>
            <li> Hey, did you know sometimes females have nose hair? I bet you didn&#x27;t. Please allow me to enlighten you. The plastic tip at the end is just a bit too long. If it could be shortened, it would be  absolutely perfect. The tip makes it difficult to get in the small spaces and trim hairs. I end up having to use facial hair scissors. Ever snip the inside of your nose by mistake? Even the slightest close of the blades is exquisite pain. So please shorten or take off the plastic tip so the trimmer can get in there and do some real work. Those of us with round bulby noses sprouting hairs in the Rotunda could use some help.</li>
            <li> Seems to grind up the hair instead of cutting them. Which is great, have not felt a hair pull yet!&lt;br /&gt;The angle of the tip makes it awkward to rotate the head and keep it in contact with the skin.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: Died. I product that a person uses one a month should not die so quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, trimming nose and ear hair is not a topic we like to talk about but come on guys, grooming is good. I have had a couple of devices like this but I like this one the best. Gets you looking great fast. I was using it the other day and my wife said, &amp;#34;You know, I like it that you do that.&amp;#34; What more can I guy ask? Cleans up easily too.</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve owned. It is the first one that seems to have been designed as a professional tool, rather than simply an &amp;#34;as seen on TV&amp;#34; type trimmer. Uses one battery and provides very active microblade type trimming. No pulling of hairs. Very easy to manipulate into nose, ears, eyebrows. Inserting the battery is not obvious, but the instructions show: the bottom portion that twists on/off, is also the portion that removes for inserting the battery. (You have to twist it to a certain position.)</li>
            <li> Had been putting off buying one of these because of the cost and fear it would pull my nose hairs.  But I found this unit at a great price and have great respect for the Norelco brand (used their rotary shavers for many many years), so I purchased it.  The unit worked great and made fast work of my nose hair with no pulling at all.  I am quite happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Works ok, but needs to be stuck up pretty far into the nostril to work.  Nose trimmers that have the razors closer to the edge of the tip are better.</li>
            <li> Much better than the razors with the wider, flat head.</li>
            <li> Great product. After failing over the years with inferior products, this is a winner.  Shape. Performance. Simple on off that does not accidentally go on. Great work on multiple &amp;#34;too much hair&amp;#34; areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My needs are simple - but other simple nose trimmers never worked as well</li>
            <li> I love it.  So easy to use and does the job, what more can you ask for.  It can also be used to trim eyebrows.  You can also run the trimmer under the water to clean so it is easy to maintain, and it&#x27;s cheap and comes with a warranty!</li>
            <li> Needed this desperately and it is a wonderful little tool.  Perfect for nose hairs.</li>
            <li> Works just as advised.</li>
            <li> Received this Item on July 11,2015  Used it three (3) times. It stopped working. Not worth a dime.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed with this item, it does not clear all the hair instantly. You have to pass the area couple of times in order to see results. But I still like it.</li>
            <li> Awesome price for a great trimmer. The inside of my nose actually felt bare after using this, whereas I still felt hairs in there after using my old Remington. The ears are also hair free.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product and pretty useful.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my dad, and he is really happy with it!  I ordered a second one!</li>
            <li> This is a good product. You can use it to cut away unsightly nose hairs or to trim and clean up your eyebrows. The nozzle is a perfect shape to get into tight places and the blades are very effective in cutting hair. The more-than-reasonable list price is an added bonus. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It is always a little intimidating to have something that noisy coming at your face, but this little puppy works beautifully.  It is easy to clean and simple to use.  My one tiny issue is that there are little pieces you want to hold onto or together and they are so easy to lose.  (Already done).  I wish they had a way to keep it together or attached in some way.</li>
            <li> Operates on a AA battery which is included.  Comes with a eye brow trimmer and works very well.  Also has a storage protection cap for the cutter.  Has a no pull cutting blade technology; and works as stated.  Overall it does a very good job.  Has a 2 year limited warranty.</li>
            <li> This is a handy little trimmer at a \\&quot;reasonable\\&quot; price.  I like this one better than the rotary ones simply because I like to \\&quot;clean-up\\&quot; around my nose and sideburns. . . as well as cut any \\&quot;wild hairs\\&quot; here-and-there.  So far I haven&#x27;t had any issues with \\&quot;pulls\\&quot;.  The device feels heavy enough, and not \\&quot;cheap\\&quot;.  Nice that it can be easily cleaned by rinsing under the faucet.  Eyebrow trimmer might come in handy for some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a beard. . . or if there is the slightest chance that you&#x27;re going to want to do some \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot;, then I would highly recommend you invest in the NT5175/42 5100 model.  It&#x27;s the exact same as this one, but with several attachments, and it&#x27;s only a few $$&#x27;s more.  Worth the cost difference, in my opinion, but this \\&quot;basic\\&quot; model is fine if it&#x27;s really all you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00QYOSKH6 Philips Norelco NT5175/42 5100 Nose Trimmer]]</li>
            <li> This is my first foray into trimmers. I have tried this just for nose alone and have found it to work well.  The directions are easy to follow and the trimmer comes with a tip cover, battery and eyebrow comb.  The trimmer is made of rigid plastic and metal teeth. I was going to use it for brows and chickened out just because I do not trust myself to shape correctly.  It was okay for stray hairs in between brows and did not irritate my skin.  I do think the first time I tried it I was a bit overzealous with the trimmer, the inner wall of my nose was trimmed to close and it was an odd feeling. (so just a caution) I now have a better feel for the angle and length of time to have a better experience.  Overall this product does what it said it will and works well. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> This review is a product comparison between Philips Norelco NT3155/60 3100 Nose Trimmer and [[ASIN:B0049LUI9O Panasonic ER-GN30-K Nose, Ear n Facial Hair Trimmer Wet/Dry with Vortex Cleaning System, Black]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased Panasonic ER-GN30-K nose trimmer six month ago because it was rated \\&quot;#1 Best Seller\\&quot; but stopped using it. The main reason was the trimmer didn&#x27;t cut nose hair properly. I often didn&#x27;t realize the hair was stuck in the trimmer and OUCH!!! it hurts when I pulled the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using Phillips Norelco NT3155 for two weeks, I am impressed. It is far more superior than Panasonic. With the unique shape of the trimmer like a tiny comb, I can control the movement inside my nose. My nose hair was never stuck in the trimmer! I rated it 5-star.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, no one ever wants to admit that they have nose hair in the first place, or a nose hair problem at all.  But unless someone is lying, they usually do (have hair/problem).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this isn&#x27;t TMI, but until now I dealt mainly with nose hair by plucking those pesky little hairs one-by-one.  This of course elicits sneezes, runny nose, etc.  So when I had a chance to try this nose trimmer I thought, &amp;#34;Heck, what have I got to lose?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vine program gives reviewers only a limited amount of time to try out and then review products...and nose hair takes a while to grow back, but the one time I used it I&#x27;d have to say that it was, well, an absolute pleasure.  There was no pulling, tugging or nipping.  The trimmer quickly and easily trimmed rogue nose hairs with no problem at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer also comes with an eyebrow trimmer attachment, but let&#x27;s just say that I&#x27;m not interested in going there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all in all my experience with this unit was 5 stars.  The trimmer worked as advertised, was comfortable, and did a great job.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work.  Looks great.  You can rinse the trimmer in water without harming it.  It just doesn&#x27;t work.  And it takes two batteries to do nothing.</li>
            <li> This thing has now given me TWO ingrown nose hairs!! If you haven&#x27;t experienced an ingrown hair in your nose consider yourself lucky! This is one of the most painful things I ever experienced. That includes a hernia where my intestines were hanging out of my body while I was running. DO NOT buy this unless you want to be in pain all the time!!</li>
            <li> My husband loves the trimmer and likes that the trimmer itself is small enough to trim the nose hairs.  Great appliance!</li>
            <li> There are some pluses and minuses to this product.  It is quiet and cuts quickly without any pulling of the hair.  I have very thick hair and this product has no issue with it.  It doesn&#x27;t tickle my nose - a big deal to me.  It is very comfortable in my ears and easy to maneuver in the ears.  The con is that there is a somewhat large area of &amp;#34;no cut zone&amp;#34; at the tip of the device.  This causes it to miss a lot of nose hairs.  I have somewhat curly hair and you have to get the device at that perfect angle at times.  It gets somewhat frustrating.  So I like the product and it is much better than other trimmers that I have used, but it&#x27;s not perfect.</li>
            <li> So many times you&#x27;ll see some Congressman on a talk show and they so need a good trim... you&#x27;d think somebody on the TV crew would menton it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for the normal viewers sitting at home this makes a fine trimmer to have in the bathroom when you have to go check yourself after watching their out of control eyebrows and ear hair and all that other stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine worked with no issues.  I think you&#x27;ll like this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Very good, just what I needed!</li>
            <li> Does what its designed to do.</li>
            <li> Super and painless hair removal tool. The Amazon price is what convinced me to purchase. I have used it several times (I am a female).</li>
            <li> Good product if you have out of control nose hair :-D</li>
            <li> This is a very impressive device. There is no pinching or cutting, and it is easy to clean. It also works well on ears and eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I find it works a bit better than the traditional trimmer design, and have had no pulling, but it is not perfect, and I still need to finish up with small scissors.</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Low cost&lt;br /&gt;Effective&lt;br /&gt;Low noise&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Cheap feel&lt;br /&gt;On/off switch combined with opener of battery compartment&lt;br /&gt;Rotating blade nose hair trimmers are easier to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Philips Norelco Nose Trimmer is a no frills, easy to use, wet-dry personal groomer that gives you reasonable value for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the box you will find nose trimmer itself, a cover for the top of the trimmer, and the eyebrow trimmer attachment.  The eyebrow trimmer  is small and looks like a little plastic spring. Given that there is no where to store the attachment, it will most likely be the first thing that I lose.  The second thing may be the clear cover, but at least this is replaced on the item after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nose hair trimmer itself is mostly composed of hard, black plastic.  The top half that looks like it might be covered with a grippy latex is really just more textured hard plastic, finished differently to give it designer looks.  Production values are reasonable for a product such as this.  Everything works fine, but some edges stick out here and there and this is clearly not the result of precision manufacturing.  This is not an heirloom device, but will probably last a 1-3 years, which seems to be the average for this class.  There is a touch of orange around the cutting apparatus, an interesting stylistic measure that, perhaps, indicates that someone on the Philips Norelco team that designed this is a Cincinnati Bengals fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device seems to fit well in your hand, but it is light weight and feels a bit cheap.  The bottom of the device serves as both the on/off switch and access to the battery compartment.  To turn it on and off you twist the bottom of the device to the right. If you twist left and line up the triangles, you are able to pull the device apart to reveal the battery compartment.  I’m not a big fan of this set up.  Philips Norelco could have sprung for a real on/off switch.  It doesn’t happen every time, but I seem to open the battery compartment all too often during my two week trial period when all I wanted to do was to turn the device on. The device is relatively quiet during operation, which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To trim your nose hairs, you insert the device in your nostril and turn it 360 degrees.  This is a simple enough maneuver, but not as easy to use as the ‘weed whacker’ variety of nose hair trimmer, where the blade rotates and you simply have to abut the trimmer to the surface that needs trimming.  The blades seem to cut well enough and, as promised by Philips Norelco, the shave was comfortable without any pulling or tugging.  Ear hairs are cut similarly.  You place the device slightly in the ear canal and turn it around. For stray hairs around the ears you just move the trimmer surface to the desired location.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning couldn’t be easier--you just rinse the head clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyebrow trimmer attachment appears to work well.  As above, it looks like a plastic spring that  fits over the existing trimmer head, giving you a small clearance for cutting.  You then drag the trimmer across your eyebrow and the job is done. I did not use it to trim my eyebrows, as it only trims to one length and I was worried that I’d end up look over plucked.  Rather, I used it to trim the lower part of my sideburns.  It was effective in removing stray long hairs and would likely do a decent job on eyebrows, assuming that the length is right for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the whole, the Philips Norelco Nose Trimmer works as you expect it would.  I still prefer the rotary trimmers and would have preferred a device that had a more solid construction, but--that said--this device works perfectly well and is up to snuff with its competition in this category.</li>
            <li> Three Phillips Norelco Trimmers were available for review. So I decided to compare them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My current trimmer is a Panasonic ER-GN30, a trimmer using rotary blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first Phillips Norelco Trimmer up for review is the Philips Norelco NT3155/60 3100 Nose Trimmer, $11.99. This is dual blade trimmer and advertised as No Pulling Guaranteed. I have used this style of trimmer before. It works, but IMHO, not as well as a rotary trimmer. I have my own tremors, and use the rotary trimmer to finish off my shaving under my nose. The &amp;#34;DualCut&amp;#34; technology is not as efficient. This comes with a AA battery and a &amp;#34;short&amp;#34; eyebrow comb. This eyebrow trimmer was not very efficient, either. Overall, this trimmer works, but it is not the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next is the Philips Norelco NT3355/60 Nose Trimmer, $13.99. Different body color, but same trimmer. This advertises &amp;#34;Lithium Technology.&amp;#34; This translates to a AA lithium battery. Comes with a &amp;#34;long&amp;#34; eyebrow comb and &amp;#34;short&amp;#34; eyebrow comb. The long comb was much more effective for my eyebrows than the short. Were I to choose between the two, I would definitely purchase this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the Philips Norelco NT5175/42 5100 Nose Trimmer, $19.87. This is the identical body to the NT3355/60. It also comes with a AA lithium battery--lithium technology, long and short eyebrow combs, plus a beard comb, cleaning brush, and a carrying pouch. I do not have a beard and so could not test the beard comb, but having had a beard and having gone through a number of beard trimmers, I find it hard to believe this attachment is of much use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All three are fully washable and come with a protective cap for the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Choosing between the three, I believe the Philips Norelco NT3355/60 Nose Trimmer is the best value. I like the long eyebrow comb. However, with much experience, I still prefer the rotary blade style for nose hair...although I do like the long eyebrow comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very little ear hair, and so that feature was not tested, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, these are decent nose hair trimmers (The packaging term: &amp;#34;Nose Trimmer&amp;#34; is funny or frightening, depending on how you look at it.). The price is decent and they do a decent job. Nothing wrong with any of them, just not as good, for me, as the rotary.ested, either.
