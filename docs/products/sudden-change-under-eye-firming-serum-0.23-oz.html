            <li>It tightens wonderfully, but dries very flakey, but I knew this before purchase.</li>
            <li>Guess I knew it was too good to be true.</li>
            <li>VERY LIGHTLY</li>
            <li>I love how this product works on my skin and smooths out the skin under my eyes.</li>
            <li>Just ok.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product.</li>

            <li> MAYBE ILL TRY IT NEXT</li>
            <li> Not sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> It gave results, but they only lasted an hour.....very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> That was a little disappointing.</li>
            <li> It was not 100%, but then I have very bad puffs under my eyes.</li>
