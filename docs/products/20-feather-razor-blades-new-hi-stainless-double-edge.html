            <li>I love em too!!</li>
            <li>But they are very popular and customers swear by them.</li>
            <li>Very nice blades.</li>
            <li>These blades are very nice,</li>
            <li>&#x27;s the difference between a good shave and a great shave?&lt;br /&gt;About four hours.</li>
            <li>These are good razors that give a great shave.</li>
            <li>The quality is good and these are a great value.  </li>
            <li>nicks and razor burn with even the mildest razors, most forgiving blades and the best shave prep and forget about BBS results unless you like your skin peeled off as well.</li>
            <li>I have tried many razors and the feather has been the best shave.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with my purchase because these allow me to have a good line for my beard.</li>
            <li>Was told by a friend that these were some of the best razors and he had tried many.  </li>
            <li>They arrived safely, in good condition, and with a very nice note from the seller thanking me.  </li>
            <li>Great blades!very close shave!will twofer them for sure!</li>
            <li>Feathers are good blades, but imho they are not the best available.  </li>
            <li>I do advise to do a pre-shave oil or pre-shave regime before shaving with any good quality blade including this one.</li>
            <li>I noticed with this thing my skin wasn&#x27;t looking too good, so I switched to Gillete 7 o clock razors.</li>
            <li>That was a mistake because now I know why my face wasn&#x27;t looking good before, the razor burn with this</li>
            <li>a good lather).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>googling brings up reviews suggesting the blades are good for 3-4 shaves, so maybe I&#x27;m using them after their peak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, good blades though.</li>
            <li>I can get about 5 good shaves out of one.</li>
            <li>Just another good blade.</li>
            <li>Good shave , holds edge</li>
            <li>These blades are every bit as good as all the reviews said they would be.  </li>
            <li>I cannot believe how close the shave was and it felt good too.</li>
            <li>I cannot believe how close the shave was and it felt good too.</li>
            <li>Till now I am having good results.</li>
            <li>Definetely a good bang for the buck.</li>
            <li>And at a good price too.</li>
            <li>On the flip side, they&#x27;re just not as good, IMO.</li>
            <li>Some not so good.  </li>
            <li>No tricks, no gimmicks, just a good experience.</li>
            <li>Good blades</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say you can get 4 good</li>
            <li>Good blade,right for the price.</li>
            <li>I get around 4 good shaves from them.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing smoother than a Feather with good technique.</li>
            <li>A sampler pack may be a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>3 good close shaves each side of the blade.</li>
            <li>These blades are wonderful and make your face smooth like the undercarriage of a Barbie.</li>
            <li>Both we&#x27;re good</li>
            <li>The blades are good, just not for my skin/face type.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying others but will keep a good supply of these as a benchmark to judge the others.</li>
            <li>what it is).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get a good two weeks out a blade, Could probably push it to a month if I tried to.</li>
            <li>a good product.</li>
            <li>So they&#x27;re still a good bargain</li>
            <li>I think I found a good way to pick a razor blade, I will share it with fellow</li>
            <li>If you buy good shaving cream, a foaming brush, have some aftershave, and have practiced DE shaving for a week (using the blade that came with your razor)</li>
            <li>Good product-</li>
            <li>I just loved the package and the way it was presented.</li>
            <li>That might be true on both accounts, but they are the best blades I&#x27;ve ever used and</li>
            <li>Great blades very smooth, and I get</li>
            <li>They also are at the very top of the cost spectrum.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are the sharpest and give me the best results with minimal burn using a Merkur 34C. Good for 4-5 excellent shaves, but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with sharpness and comfort.</li>
            <li>the best blade i have used so far.no nicks,no complaints.well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Good deal, and they give me a nice close shave.</li>
            <li>A very nice deal and prompt customer  support.. pleased to use the product .have  </li>
            <li>I get a good five days from one blade, no face scrapping, a good refreshing shave.</li>
            <li>Excellent Items, Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Just opened and used the first blade....proceed with care, but it is THE BEST BLADE I&#x27;e ever used!</li>
            <li>and I will purchase more!</li>
            <li>try many before buying one in bulk!</li>
            <li>These have worked out amazingly well.  </li>
            <li>blades are of the highest quality, are packaged well in packs of 5, and if my beard was a bit coarser, they would be amazing.</li>
            <li>A great smooth shave.</li>
            <li>These blades are amazing.</li>
            <li>I also use prorazo preshave cream and post balm and it feels amazing.</li>
            <li>Really amazing.</li>
            <li>They are amazing cut like butter.  </li>
            <li>When I don&#x27;t shave for a week or so, they still work great, but understandably aren&#x27;t quite as smooth.</li>
            <li>Amazing difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just saw a pack of 8 fusion cartridges at a popular discount retail chain for about $28.  </li>
            <li>I think that speaks for itself, I have never had any blade that was good for more than a week, and pushing it at that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>each his own, what works for me may not work at all for you...</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best and sharpest blades you can find.  </li>
            <li>A variety pack really helps you decide which is best for your face.</li>
            <li>Some people say you can use these blades for a couple of shaves, honestly i don&#x27;t bother at like 40cents or so per blade</li>
            <li>Great blades, nice close  comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Totally satisfied with this purchase, good quality razor blades.</li>
            <li>The blades I own and have tried before using the Feather include Derby, Gillette, and Astra.</li>
            <li>Braun does a nice job here.</li>
            <li>The package has a built-in blade disposal which is nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller packed the product nicely, it came from Thailand</li>
            <li>With a fresh Feather loaded and the Progress set to its maximum wickedness I got an incredible 3 pass shave even on the hardest areas for me (neck &amp; jaw line).</li>
            <li>a nice day</li>
            <li>all blades, your mileage may vary, so find a 5-pack before purchasing this (or a sampler that includes a Feather) to be sure the blade is good for your face.</li>
            <li>used every kind of electric and disposable blade out there and have been rewarded with lots of nicks and razor burns.  </li>
            <li>These razors really are the best made out there.</li>
            <li>They had a nice edge to them.</li>
            <li>Once you get used to shaving with these blades they&#x27;re spectacular.</li>
            <li>I was going to give up on DE shaving, but these blades and the Feather Popular Razor(TTO) saved the day.</li>
            <li>Well, with the Derby blades I never was able to get a good shave and almost threw in the towel on DE shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>No razor burn and a nice close shave.  </li>
            <li>Feathers ard good too, just  more money.</li>
            <li>The razors are really nice  though.</li>
            <li>I started with the Merkurs, which kind of tugged and pulled.</li>
            <li>I have been using persona and have really liked them as well.</li>
            <li>nothing amazing, make sure you have a good lather before attempting to shave with these.</li>
            <li>They are good razors that give you a good clean shave</li>
            <li>First impressions is very good</li>
            <li>Well worth the extra cost, though it is best to shop around for the best deal.</li>
            <li>Pair this blade with a good shave cream (I like Taylor of Old Bond Street the best) and you have a winning combination.</li>
            <li>Sharpest may be fine in one razor and not as good in another, even though it&#x27;s sharper.</li>
            <li>These are the best safety razor blades I have used so far.</li>
            <li>I use them in my shavette and they are by far the best blades I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Wow these feather blades are awesome..</li>
            <li>these really are the best blades available.</li>
            <li>In fact, these blades \\&quot;skip\\&quot; much more frequently than their legendary sharpness would imply.</li>
            <li>These were exactly what I was looking for at a great price.</li>
            <li>No nicks, no cuts, and a very, very smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>They are very smooth on my skin</li>
            <li>Very smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Very smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Brand new, these blades will provide an incredibly close shave.  </li>
            <li>bought the inexpensive Feather Popular Safety Razor - which is 20 bucks at most - and it does the job fine.</li>
            <li>Having used them for a couple weeks now, I like them, and will probably be buying more of them.</li>
            <li>I prefer Astras more though</li>
            <li>satisfied.</li>
            <li>These blades are much better quality than the ones I got with my Merkur safety razor.  </li>
            <li>These razors also hold an edged better than Merkur, Wilkinson, etc..</li>
            <li>Ok so to debunk the hype about feather razors.</li>
            <li>I love these razors.</li>
            <li>I recommend them to any person who wants to shave with one blade - experienced or newbie.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found a better blade yet.  </li>
            <li>I love these blades.  </li>
            <li>Not my favorite razor blade</li>
            <li>Of course everyone&#x27;s best blade may be different</li>
            <li>If you are looking for the best shave possible, this may be the blade for you.  </li>
            <li>These blades have worked great for me, I get really close shaves using these in my setup.</li>
            <li>and I nicked my skin more often than I wanted.</li>
            <li>the feathers are simply the best.</li>
            <li>Spend the extra money and buy the best.</li>
            <li>Thus, a shopping trip for better accoutrements.  </li>
            <li>They deliver a close smooth shave every day!</li>
            <li>(don&#x27;t use these if you are a novice), you&#x27;ll love these.</li>
            <li>I have since found a better blade...</li>
            <li>Best double edge razor shave</li>
            <li>I love these blades.</li>
            <li>I find I get better shaves from them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve found that I have to pay more attention to the grain of my beard with this blade to avoid any irritation.  </li>
            <li>But product was delivered as described and I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>Simply the best razor blades you&#x27;ll ever find, period!</li>
            <li>manufactures many of the blades we use.</li>
            <li>I also love that these blades are a dime a dozen by comparison of the cartridges in the stores.</li>
            <li>However if I shave with one day stubble, I get more irritation and shave bumps.</li>
            <li>I have to practice more.</li>
            <li>Love these blades.</li>
            <li>Be sure to check out the suppliers.  </li>
            <li>DO believe this are my newest favorite with my others being Personna</li>
            <li>I love the blades....</li>
            <li>I will order more when the time comes.</li>
            <li>but if done properly they are the best I have seen.</li>
            <li>Outstanding service.</li>
            <li>They are, but don&#x27;t think better when you think sharper.</li>
            <li>I consider myself having excellent technique and proper prep, and I still managed to cut myself almost every time I used these.</li>
            <li>After more experience I realized the mistake I was making and it had to do with pressure - even the slightest bit of pressure and you risk</li>
            <li>Now that I know the key about pressure I shave with my Progress set to 5.5 (maximum aggressiveness) - this gave me excellent but</li>
            <li>But, I am glad I tried them.  </li>
            <li>Well these are definitely the best de blades I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I buy more blades</li>
            <li>but i seem to get a better shave if i add just a touch of pressure.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m learning more as I get into de shaving.</li>
            <li>Obviously not a deal breaker as I gave this product 5 stars, but it&#x27;s something to keep in mind when choosing which blade works best for you.</li>
            <li>These blades are so much better than the blades I was using, it makes them look like butter knives.  </li>
            <li>granted the Feathers are the second best blade I have used, but I will not be opening another pack of these... they&#x27;ll just go into my obsolete blade graveyard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes without saying that it is much more enjoyable and faster to shave with the Crystals...</li>
            <li>I have better that 42$ for a flashlight, razor that vibrates</li>
            <li>All of those worked much better with my razor.  </li>
            <li>and you will be rewarded with a fantastic shave!</li>
            <li>There are many blades to choose from, but there is no reason to use anything but Feather on your face.</li>
            <li>Truly phenomenal.</li>
            <li>These blades make it even better.</li>
            <li>I love these blades.  </li>
            <li>shaves out of one blade before I feel a notable difference.</li>
            <li>I love them in my Merkur 34C, as it&#x27;s not known as an aggressive razor.</li>
            <li>Simply the BEST shave EVER!</li>
            <li>; because anything more than the slightest bit of pressure makes my face look like it was shaved by Ramsey Bolton.  </li>
            <li>I love the blades..</li>
            <li>With one of these, it is better to have your morning coffee after you finish shaving.</li>
            <li>inconsistency in terms of sharpness, some in a pack are better than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>think if you are worried about nicking tier 3 would be at your top and tier 1 would be at your bottom of choices.</li>
            <li>I have been able to use these blades for 4 shaves before switching blades.  </li>
            <li>Blades seem more flexible which to me helps the blade angle.</li>
            <li>I get more shaves per blade, and better shaves, compared to the cheaper bulk packs.</li>
            <li>Reviewed as being better than the blades included with the razor</li>
            <li>The Feather blade worked better [FOR ME] than all the others with the next best being a Shark blade.  </li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t for everyone, as most people will tell you.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found better ones here in the US.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more razor blades when I run out.</li>
            <li>I personally love them.</li>
            <li>Still using them because I haven&#x27;t found any better for me.</li>
            <li>I love these razor blades.</li>
            <li>Like many guys, I&#x27;ve read the reviews about these blades and was hesitant to try them.  </li>
            <li>Wilkinson Swords and Astra SP&#x27;s were more forgiving in this regard, perhaps because of their coating.  </li>
            <li>The PolSilver was my favorite until I tried Feather.</li>
            <li>I have had equally satisfying shaves with both the Feather and Personna.  </li>
            <li>They were ok.  </li>
            <li>These blades are fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Also, using sharper blades does not make you more</li>
            <li>They cut so much better, easier, almost no irritation at all.  </li>
            <li>Some blades are more flexible</li>
            <li>There is no &#x27;one ultimate blade&#x27; that everyone will love best.</li>
            <li>You will not be able to ascertain whether this is the blade for you, or not.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These blades give a great shave, but aren&#x27;t very forgiving if mistakes are made with your technique.</li>
            <li>I use this shaving method in part because I do not have to throw away cartridges every time I change the blade, I would feel better if my razor blades were package in paper &amp;#34;box&amp;#34; that would be better for the environment to dispose.</li>
            <li>After sampling many (Dorco, Wilkinson, Gilette, Bic, et al.)</li>
            <li>but I get more shaves, and closer shaves, than I ever did before.  </li>
            <li>I have used Derby and Personna and this blade comes out on top.</li>
            <li>These blades are just okay and</li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>As I continued my research into shaving with double-edged blades, I came across these beautiful Japanese feather blades and found that they cut my beard with amazing ease.</li>
            <li>Nice and clean shave, and</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them for the experienced shaver.</li>
            <li>This is easily the best way to get a close shave with a regular double-edged razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I believe that I have pretty good shaving technique</li>
            <li>Blades (along with a good razor - like the De 89) are everything to enjoying a good, close shave without medical intervention - and I give credit to Feather for helping to accomplish that.</li>
            <li>The blades give the best shave that I have had in quite a long time.</li>
            <li>Still, the blades are very good and, overall I am pleased with the value.</li>
            <li>and these babies work great in my new safety razor.  </li>
            <li>It is a good blade, but they are only good for two shaves, for me anyway.</li>
            <li>Overall these blades are fantastic and will be the best complement to your shaving kit!</li>
            <li>Though I&#x27;m sure if you take your time and adjust your technique it should be fine.</li>
            <li>I found the derby blades to give me just as close a shave a bit more comfortably.</li>
            <li>get a better shave than a cheap razor</li>
            <li>It is the sharpest and most comfortable blade made, and the price is all but identical to any competitors.</li>
            <li>you are sampling blades to find the one that gives the most comfortable shave, I do believe you need to try these.\\</li>
            <li>My razor came with some &amp;#34;Shark&amp;#34; blades which were ok, but when i ran out i gave these a try, and i must say these are fantastic.</li>
            <li>Much better than the cheap Derbys I tried before.</li>
            <li>Well, he called me this morning and said he tried the Feather on his first shave and was very pleased.</li>
            <li>Well, he called me this morning and said he tried the Feather on his first shave and was very pleased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I switched, and I am wondering what I can do with my Art of Shaving Power Fusion Razors with light.</li>
            <li>All you have to do is decide which is more important to you.</li>
            <li>Awesome blades!--forget the fortune spent on Gillette Fusion</li>
            <li>These are the sharpest, most durable, and comfortable blades I have used to date.</li>
            <li>Not much to say, tried sample packs of blades, like these the best.</li>
            <li>They are defiantly the sharpest, and that (if your careful) will give you the best shave of your life.</li>
            <li>Feathers were more prone to give me some razor burn if I wasn&#x27;t precise with my blade angle.  </li>
            <li>Because of this, technique/lather/aftershave become more important.</li>
            <li>Great blade in old school razors like DE Gillette&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Most of the reviews and answers to questions indicated that the Feather New Hi-Stainless blades were good for four,</li>
            <li>No razor burn, clean cuts, very smooth.</li>
            <li>Awesome and unbelievably sharp</li>
            <li>Lord blades are much better in my opinion, but each face and blade combo is unique...</li>
            <li>I had assumed that this was due to some super-manly neck hair and did my best.</li>
            <li>They are wicked sharp and will give you an excellent shave, but be awake when you use them.</li>
            <li>Wilkinson sword is more middle road and work great</li>
            <li>Care needs to be taken as you can easily give yourself razor burn and cut nicks with these things</li>
            <li>So, I can easily recommend the seller....</li>
            <li>These blades make it so easy, it&#x27;s almost effortless.</li>
            <li>You can easily slice yourself up.  </li>
            <li>I know feelings run strong on the topic, so I tread</li>
            <li>Shave preparation is also very important in getting a clean, close comfortable shave</li>
            <li>The shave is excellent, the blades are cheaper, and I enjoy the shaving experience a little better.  </li>
            <li>I am quickly becoming a huge fan of both the distributor and the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>Now, I wait till i have almost a full beard before I shave so someone that shaves every day will probably get more out of a blade than I do.</li>
            <li>Nice and sharp and a great price.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best shaving experience I&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li>They give me hands down the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had and zero irritation.</li>
            <li>The best part is they seem to stay sharp for between 10 - 15 shaves!  </li>
            <li>Excellent shave, very sharp and arrived before they were promised.</li>
            <li>Very sharp, long-lasting blades at an excellent price.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re completely new to DE safety razors, I might still recommend Derby blades just because they&#x27;re fine for training and anything to help your confidence is a good thing.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re completely new to DE safety razors, I might still recommend Derby blades just because they&#x27;re fine for training and anything to help your confidence is a good thing.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>and you should be fine.</li>
            <li>This morning I shaved with one for the first time and it definitely is the sharpest and best blade of the four brands I have used.</li>
            <li>Goes fine with Merkur Razor.</li>
            <li>Feather blades are a fine tool that should be respected.</li>
            <li>If you respect the blade and take your time, you will be fine even as a beginner.</li>
            <li>Smooth and easy shave.</li>
            <li>I have fine curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Super close shave !</li>
            <li>Super sharpe, you cant buy sharper blades better know what your doing if your buy feather.</li>
            <li>Very sharp, light, and the perfect shave.  </li>
            <li>Now I won&#x27;t tell you that I never slice my face anymore, but I now have a much more pleasant time using a double edge razor.</li>
            <li>In the early turn of the millennium I switched to the safety razor, and found it to be the most amazing shaving experience I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>They are the only ones I will use because the give me a close and comfortable shave at a great price.</li>
            <li>you cut yourself with your double edged razor, you&#x27;re probably used to shaving with cartridge razors, which require pressure - a double edged razor should glide across your happy face, trimming the happy whiskers away</li>
            <li>oh so smooth and nick free feeling.</li>
            <li>No doubt about it, these blades are among the sharpest available.</li>
            <li>tried Derby, Astra, But will stay with Feather.&lt;br /&gt;About myself - using safety blades since 1977, experienced Russian, Iranian, Turkish, Czech, Bulgarian, Polish and some others.</li>
            <li>Use light pressure.</li>
            <li>Feathers with Merkur T handle will make a smooth shave with no razor burns or irritation.</li>
            <li>Great product especially  for the price !  </li>
            <li>Ive tried using no pressure on the razor and light pressure on the razor with these blades and they still leave me with a visible 5&#x27;o clock shadow.</li>
            <li>Smooth shave</li>
            <li>I get five comfortable</li>
            <li>Silky smooth shaving with these Feather ones.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been shaving with this combo for three months and really enjoy the experience of this combo.</li>
            <li>Feather blades are great and the only ones I use.</li>
            <li>With or against the grain is equally smooth and friction-less&lt;br /&gt;+ /-</li>
            <li>No irritation, no pull  just a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Fear them not, and enjoy.</li>
            <li>sound.</li>
            <li>I was using cheap blades from CVS before these</li>
            <li>these are the sharpest de blades available.  </li>
            <li>Overall, these blades are great.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for the sharpest DE blades available, these won&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li>The shave is smooth, and lasts quite some time.</li>
            <li>The quality of shave is far superior.</li>
            <li>As a regular Derby and Wilkinson user, I kept promising myself that I would try a Feather blade to see if it lived up to its legendary status with my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great straight razor for shaving, fast delivery</li>
            <li>Feather blades are far superior.</li>
            <li>so my preparation to get a soft beard is good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-I did notice a bit more stinging all over my face when I did a pass with a styptic, but I think this is related to how closely the razor passed over my face, so that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li>nothing else, buy the best blades, and get a shave as close to a straight razor shave as possible.</li>
            <li>nice sharp and good quality blades&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Very worth it.  </li>
            <li>The Feathers aren&#x27;t heads and shoulders better than my go-to Wilkersons, so although I might buy some more Feathers every now and then just to change things up, I&#x27;ll probably stick with Wilkersons as my main blades.</li>
            <li>While in relation to other DE blades feathers are indeed costlier, in relation to Cartridges, they are incredibly inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>Fine, but nothing special with a premium price.</li>
            <li>They just slice thru the stubble so cleanly and nick free.</li>
            <li>These scrape off the hair, but doesn&#x27;t leave me with the smooth clean shave.  </li>
            <li>I would almost go as far as saying that if you&#x27;re not an experienced DE shaver, hone your skills with something else first.</li>
            <li>You put literally a quarter of the pressure that you would normally use to shave, and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>Razors came on time,they are original and they are the sharpest in the business.</li>
            <li>so there&#x27;s not a lot of room for error, make sure you&#x27;ve got the hang of DE shaving first before getting these.</li>
            <li>A much closer shave, my skin is so healthy and smooth, and I rarely cut myself!</li>
            <li>I clean my razor after EVERY use and flip the blade.</li>
            <li>Definitely sold on feather blades, good for 6-8 shaves if you have a light beard.</li>
            <li>Get it nice and hot either by taking a shower before shaving, or putting a hot towel on your face to soften the hair.</li>
            <li>are clean</li>
            <li>But if you like a clean shavin BBS face then these blades are it.</li>
            <li>The Razors are fine; great quality, and extremely sharp.  </li>
            <li>Overall \\&quot;Feathers\\&quot; is a good economical solution for a clean smooth shave.</li>
            <li>My face feels great, minimal to no burn</li>
            <li>My first two shaves I cut myself in a couple spots two to three times per shave, and since then it has been nick free and cut free shaves in the six weeks since I started.</li>
            <li>Reputed to be the sharpest blade available, it has never failed to give me a close, comfortable shave with no irritation.  </li>
            <li>, the Feather is giving me the best shave with the least amount of pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the Astra and Gillette razor blades but find myself using the Astra more often</li>
            <li>A true gentleman&#x27;s shave.</li>
            <li>In my opinion they aren&#x27;t quite as good as the personnas, but they are so close, I think that is a personal preference.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While I&#x27;m still no blademaster, I will increase my rating to a full 5-stars because as my abilities improve so does my appreciation for how well these blades perform in comparison to some others I&#x27;ve used and continue to use in the rotation.</li>
            <li>and I really recommend this product over using the garbage and money draining razors sold in most stores.</li>
            <li>I have also tried Gillette Silver Blue, Astra Superior Platinum, and Wilkinson razors.</li>
            <li>Just enough pressure to place the razor to the face (with good skin stretching technique) is used and let the razor do the work and this blade performs quite well.</li>
            <li>Then I decided to try these, since I kept hearing such good reviews on Feather blades.  </li>
            <li>Have had many shaves off of one blade and much cheaper than buying disposables.</li>
            <li>Much moreso than the cheaper brands, and worth it for a cleaner, smoother, and more comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>These blades work well, but go easy on your first use</li>
            <li>Go easy if your a first time safety razor user.</li>
            <li>I challenge anyone that has done any research on shaving double-edge razors to find one that is more all-around consistent and cleaner than these!</li>
            <li>These are great but they are super sharp,  like the sharpest you can get.  </li>
            <li>No they wont knick your face if you dont shave aggressively or quickly.</li>
            <li>I have neosporin on my face now to heal quickly.</li>
            <li>HI-STAINLESS has gained a loyal customer here.</li>
            <li>I have tried several different razor blades for use with my Merkur Safety Razor and the Feather razor blades are the best that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Sure, they&#x27;re better than the store brand I was buying at Wegmans (the only one offered amongst a wall of disposables), but not superlatively so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Merkur Super Platinum blades for months</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and smooth, more so than ever before</li>
            <li>I ONLY TAKE THE TIME TO WRITE THEM WHEN I FIND TRUELY EXCEPTIONAL PRODUCTS...</li>
            <li>It was after one particular shave where I rushed a bit, the burn healed in a day and I learned something more about DE shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use William&#x27;s Mug Shave Soap (found at a pharmacy for about a dollar), a Tweezerman brush (cheap but effective), and a Parker 99R razor (has the fancy butterfly close, but otherwise is very standard).</li>
            <li>I use them in my Fatboy, Redtip and super speeds.</li>
            <li>The thinner blade allows a much closer shave in my opinion and while I don&#x27;t get as many shaves out of a Feather blade as others, I still find the closeness factor to be worth it.</li>
            <li>They were seldom comfortable for more than one pass on my neck which is fairly sensitive unless I focused on my technique.</li>
            <li>Very sharp, the best blades I have purchased, highly recommend for all DE shavers</li>
            <li>After shaving with high quality electric razors for most of my life I decided to take another shot at using a blade (and hoping they wouldn&#x27;t rip my face apart like in my teens).  </li>
            <li>There are other very good brands that come out of the package and shave very well without the worry about nicks.  </li>
            <li>With the right touch, a close clean shave can be obtained.</li>
            <li>Sharp, smooth, and surprisingly forgiving.</li>
            <li>Great price considering quality, although they don&#x27;t last more than 2, possibly 3 shaves.</li>
            <li>I get a consistently close, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>The price difference from these and other brands is not that much more honestly.  </li>
            <li>I use this with the Merkur Long Handle, good combo.</li>
            <li>To each his own as far as brands of blades go, but the Feathers are by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve found that these sharper blades not only give a better, more even, longer lasting shave, but they also draw across the skin more easily, reducing cuts (assuming you get</li>
            <li>Great product, sharp!</li>
            <li>Fender Blues have always been a favorite they are nice and sharp and and worth the price</li>
            <li>Contrary to popular belief that these blades will mangle your face, the opposite is true, the sharper the blade</li>
            <li>Long weekend camping trip - no problem, took everything off (face and head) nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>After my first shave with these blades I was hooked!  </li>
            <li>More sturdy and far greener!</li>
            <li>They are very sharp and I got a very nice shave with them.  </li>
            <li>dont have much experience with safety razor blades, but these see just fine.</li>
            <li>Although most safety razor experts suggest changing the blade out every shave, I often get several good, smooth, no-knick shaves out of a single blade.</li>
            <li>but after a few days shaving is great.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased three different blades so far and the FEATHER blades are the best for the price so far.</li>
            <li>So is it worth paying two or three times the price to have a sharper blade for 2 out of 7 days?  </li>
            <li>(where you rarely nick yourself).  </li>
            <li>I get about 3-4 days worth of</li>
            <li>Nice plus is the prices offered for multiple packages make these blades economical.</li>
            <li>Naturally, when I ran out of blades, I ordered more of the Feather</li>
            <li>favorite razor blades so far.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice so much while I was shaving on my first pass along the growth, it was more so after I washed my face off after the first pass.</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t see the need for a second pass, but of course I did so anyway.</li>
            <li>Get a safety razor and start shaving closer and more comfortably while saving money at the same time</li>
            <li>It took 2 weeks to get but worth it</li>
            <li>I get better shaves from cheaper blades (thus far Wilkinson Sword is my favourite).</li>
            <li>well worth the price premium.</li>
            <li>Going back to old school shaving has been a joy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;+ Container comes with built in razor disposal to safely dispose of old razor blades&lt;br</li>
            <li>They glide over skin with no friction when shaving a days worth of growth.</li>
            <li>But they work far better than anything else I have come across.</li>
            <li>Shipping took a while but worth the wait.</li>
            <li>With Feather, there&#x27;s a soft and more &amp;</li>
            <li>The blades arrived from Thailand and took forever to arrive, but it was worth the wait.  </li>
            <li>well worth it</li>
            <li>Well worth the money</li>
            <li>Cuts great, but very sharp!</li>
            <li>Pricier than other blades but worth it, they seem to be able to stand up to more shaves while still performing well before needing to be changed.</li>
            <li>I found the Feather blades to work the best on problem areas like my chin and under the neck, where other blades wouldn&#x27;t get close enough or would cause razor burns</li>
            <li>This was the first brand I purchased, I got lucky.</li>
            <li>Good sharp blade.</li>
            <li>Good blades that are sharp and well made.</li>
            <li>Of course, I nicked myself and bleeded for first 3 shaves, after that my skin got adjusted and my shaving skill improved, now I am able to get a smooth shave which last for 2 to 3 days.</li>
            <li>These are razor blades, nothing to get too excited about, really.  </li>
            <li>Good sharp blade.</li>
            <li>they are really sharp and hold an edge a good while.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten pretty good about not cutting myself, and irritation is minimal.  </li>
            <li>Looking for something a little better, I began prowling Amazon and found good reviews for the Feather New Hi-Stainless.&lt;br /&gt;WHAT</li>
            <li>Both handles are great and many know it comes down to the trying different blades and</li>
            <li>Also keeping the angle right will help.</li>
            <li>The Feather blade just cut it right</li>
            <li>the bottom of this review to go right to Amazon&#x27;s page for the 100</li>
            <li>S-H-A-R-P is right.  </li>
            <li>And the price is right.</li>
            <li>I know, another positive review for this product is redundant, but these are undoubtedly the best blades I&#x27;ve used thus far.</li>
            <li>The second and third time, I was much more careful and got the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had in my life.</li>
            <li>This brand and type of blade came with my new razor last Christmas and have loved the close shave ever since.  </li>
            <li>otherwise, I feel pretty strongly that personnas are my absolute favorite de blades.&lt;br /&gt;they&#x27;re incredibly smooth, and also sharp.  </li>
            <li>There is absolutely no difference in terms of how &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; or nice the shaving experience is with an old fashion safety razor (+ these blades) and a top of the line gillette blade with lasers and vibrators and missiles.</li>
            <li>I was new to the DE world and bought 100 Derby razor blades because they were ridiculously cheap.  </li>
            <li>Amazing blade&lt;br /&gt;Shipping took a very long time&lt;br</li>
            <li>They were shipped super fast and packaged almost too well.  </li>
            <li>but if you have sensitive skin like me you might want to go with a more gentle blade.</li>
            <li>I will most likely return to the tried and true (and much cheaper) Derby after I deplete my supply of Feathers.</li>
            <li>Use a very light touch, short strokes and fewer</li>
            <li>I like the shave from the blades and the price is very reasonable,  but they ship from out of the country and shipping takes quite a while.  </li>
            <li>These are certainly the best double edge blades that I have tried, and I have sampled quite a few.  </li>
            <li>No other blade compared to the Crystal Platinum blades (my friend tried every blade in the sampler also, and w/o me bringing it up, he said the same thing... that there was no comparison to the Crystals), so I went through 100 of the Crystal&#x27;s, and when it came time to buy more, I thought I&#x27;d try the Feather instead because it had such good reviews</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent months listening to my boss brag about how amazing these blades are.</li>
            <li>I like Gillette brand cases better, but I assume that the individual wrapping of the blades keeps the edges honed longer.  </li>
            <li>I got a good 4 shaves out of this blade do to having a heavy beard the first shave.</li>
            <li>As a first time  DE shaver these were my first pick</li>
            <li>these razors consistently impress me with their accuracy and comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a Double Edge Razor one is supposed to let the weight of the razor do most of the work.</li>
            <li>but I do not feel the need to change the blade more often than every second week or so.</li>
            <li>These just feel like they&#x27;re pulled at my hair from the first stroke.</li>
            <li>My derby extra do a much better job</li>
            <li>Keep in mind, some of the reviewers who discuss the price of the blade will often brag how they can get another brand blade to last 3 weeks or more.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used these blades, my face was bleeding everywhere</li>
            <li>However, the thought of taking out a second mortgage to buy razor blades was not so appealing.  </li>
            <li>The generic blades were okay...</li>
            <li>I get irritation from the first shave on these blades, I only start getting irritation after three or more days with the Derby Extra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>any case, it&#x27;s a decent product and the third-party seller got them to me quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly how I want a shave to feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like many before have written, all razor blades are not the same for every person.</li>
            <li>and of course they gave me the nicks and cuts on those first two shaves.</li>
            <li>Thus, my recommendation is if you know how to shave, but the Feather blades first and be done with it.</li>
            <li>Thus, my recommendation is if you know how to shave, but the Feather blades first and be done with it.</li>
            <li>I am sure you won&#x27;t turn your head back to either Cartridge or electric shaving.</li>
            <li>Love the blades and will be a customer for the next forty years , I HOPE !  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried them, and I&#x27;ll use the ones I now have, but when I run out, I&#x27;ll be going back to the Kai blades.&lt;br /&gt;That</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE - Shaved with my first Feather in a vintage Gillette Slim Adjustable -</li>
            <li>Been using this blade consistently for about two years</li>
            <li>When I first started (about 6 months into it)</li>
            <li>Pull the adams apple skin to the side and shave it that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first shave with these blades is like you&#x27;re just wiping the hair off.</li>
            <li>First shave made a believer out of me.</li>
            <li>Yes they get pretty darn close</li>
            <li>you just have to plan ahead and make sure you order well before the blades are actually needed.</li>
            <li>This item (Feather Razor blades) is exactly as described, and well packaged.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat the price, and it shipped pretty quick.&lt;br</li>
            <li>pretty good blade for a few days of shaving</li>
            <li>I switched back to the 5 bladed disposable head shaving blade system I have used for many years.</li>
            <li>in all, now that I have some confidence into this seller and these blades, I&#x27;m definitely going to be ordering some more.</li>
            <li>It was my first time shaving with a Feather blade</li>
            <li>thanks to Prime!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to Derby Extras, they were more consistent for a weeks use for every blade.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand it myself, you&#x27;d think the sharper they are, the more likely you are to cut yourself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been DE shaving for 2 weeks and didn&#x27;t cut myself the first time using this blade.  </li>
            <li>Like prev reviews have said, you do NOT want this to be the first blade you use.</li>
            <li>First time safety razor user.  </li>
            <li>and I would not start out with them as your first blade.</li>
            <li>, if you order, make sure you factor in enough lead time for processing and delivery.</li>
            <li>The razors were exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>MUCH better than the Derby blades that initially came w/ my Edwin Jagger</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve settled on the Personnas, which are pretty inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;To re-iterate, though, I&#x27;d encourage anyone to try a sampler first.</li>
            <li>Personally, my first passes were butter-smooth and irritation-free.</li>
            <li>Had been using Merkur double edge blades in Merkur and Gillette adjustable razors and the Feather blades are better yet.  </li>
            <li>These blades do cause SLIGHTLY more irritation against the skin from the sharpness, which is most noticeable when I go over hairless part of my face, like the upper cheek (maybe hair lifts the razor slightly above the skin?)  </li>
            <li>Due to them being so incredibly sharp, no pressure is required while shaving, just let the razor glide along and do what it does best, cut hair like it&#x27;s butter.</li>
            <li>Im obviously nit picking:)</li>
            <li>Im never going back to gillette (and similar) razors ever again, I&#x27;ve tried a few and yes the shaving is really close and nice, but so is with a good safety razor and good blades such as this one.</li>
            <li>So far seems to give a good shave for a fairly long time.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Shark super chrome instead.</li>
            <li>wait to get them, but I plan to try some other, more readily available, brands to see if there is an alternative that doesn&#x27;t require as much advance order planning as these.</li>
            <li>they are very sharp and they deliver a very smooth and close shave!</li>
            <li>The blades are super sharp and provide a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li>These blades give a marginally better shave than a few of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried, but I don&#x27;t feel that they are significantly sharper or shave more comfortably than lower cost alternatives.</li>
            <li>I was using those fine, but then I saw a few more of these laying around</li>
            <li>A friend said that shipping from Thailand to the US can be cost effective if the shipper uses drop shipping, where the package is combined with other packages as part of a bulk shipment to save money.</li>
            <li>Nice and sharp.</li>
            <li>To be quite honest it&#x27;s been my experience that Derby should get the face chewing warning and trust me; it&#x27;s not because Derby&#x27;s are sharp.  </li>
            <li>Nice and sharp.</li>
            <li>Nice sharp razors.  </li>
            <li>However, to be fair this could have been due to my skin having to get used to the new style of shaving</li>
            <li>It is designed to be super sharp and it sure is.  </li>
            <li>and they still work OK for me, but I like the feeling of that fresh blade on my face--no drag</li>
            <li>And in no time you will be shaving as fast as before only deeper and more</li>
            <li>After years of Gillette blades, most recently the Power Fusion, I decided to try these blades in the Feather Stainless Steel Razor.  </li>
            <li>I just had my first shave with these blades and there is absolutely no&lt;</li>
            <li>I have to do multiple passes to get rid of hairs and it irritated my skin and my skin was becoming even darker as it was adjusting to get the cuts healed.</li>
            <li>Particularly true if you are sensitive to razor burn.</li>
            <li>My manly stubble has felled many less worthy blades.  </li>
            <li>When reading this review, the Crystal Brand isn&#x27;t available anymore, but they are the exact same blade as Israeli Personna, so whenever you read Crystal, you can substitute Israeli Personna...</li>
            <li>Cuts down ( no pun intended)  on the multiple passes for a great shave.</li>
            <li>intend to buy a large stock of Feather blades once these ones run out.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have an adjustment curve (especially when one comes from those supermarket multi-bladed contraptions) and it will require both a good shaving soap such as the Crabtree &amp; Evelyn Sienna and a top Double Blade safety razor such as the Feather; however, the end result is well worth it.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re cheaper, but not when considering the amount of blades I&#x27;ll go through in a certain amount</li>
            <li>They cut the hair clean off with no drag or hesitation whatsoever.</li>
            <li>These razors are great for those with tough beards.</li>
            <li>Yah they cost a little more but they&#x27;re worth every penny.</li>
            <li>These blades are economical of course but you have to be very careful when shaving with them, they can cut you easily under the jaw line or whenever shaving the neck area.</li>
            <li>These are very aggressive blades.</li>
            <li>They are also much sharper.  </li>
            <li>shipping was fast too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a real shave.</li>
            <li>I really do like this blade.</li>
            <li>, I can only get two comfortable shaves from one blade.</li>
            <li>Item came fast.</li>
            <li>I thought my technique was just off: the shave wasn&#x27;t very close</li>
            <li>really like those too),  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think they are a &amp;#34;wreaking ball&amp;#34; but you do need to be more careful.  </li>
            <li>so I really have to watch what I&#x27;m doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I had to wait much longer than I intended.</li>
            <li>All the forums pointed me to do straight edge razor shave.</li>
            <li>I have never shaved with a straight razor before, however I have no complaints about the quality of this product.</li>
            <li>They arrived unbelievably fast.</li>
            <li>This is more to rate the vendor and the fast service an product expected at a reasonable price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying out straight razor shaving after years of cartridges.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now considering buying a Merkur Slant to get as close as a straight razor shave as I can get.</li>
            <li>That blade may not exist or I may need to switch to a straight razor but its what im looking for</li>
            <li>I save so much money by using these and not the modern razors.</li>
            <li>With the Feathers, I pay 3x as much attention (because I have too), and I still get cut about 10x as much as the Crystals... all for a lower quality shave than I was used to with the Crystals.</li>
            <li>I just received the blades a couple of days ago, so I didn&#x27;t really have a chance to use them until this morning.</li>
            <li>I am not a novice safety razor user and I would advise anyone who is a beginner to use these with caution as they do not require much pressure to nick yourself.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>They are some of the sharpest blades available which actually add to their comfort.</li>
            <li>So much cheaper than what I had been using</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have much to compare too though.</li>
            <li>I use a straight razor to shave 90% of the time</li>
            <li>But like anything, if you go too fast and rush, or put too much pressure, then yes, you will probably end up needing a blood transfusion.</li>
            <li>But these.... I don&#x27;t know how much experience I&#x27;m going to need and</li>
            <li>how much pre shave oil and shaving leather</li>
            <li>Just guide the razor&#x27;s head along your face with no pressure against the skin and be rewarded with a close, comfortable shave that needs only 2 passes.  </li>
            <li>Ordered Pacific Shaving Company blade oil to see if it really extends blade life.</li>
            <li>But for anyone who cares about a close shave, Feather brand is a must.sive equipment, and just switching to Razor has made this much of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you are ready for these blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel that these offer a very close shave</li>
            <li>After the first few trips across my face it would be more than willing to attest to that through the blood.</li>
            <li>No matter what safety razor you may wield, you can be assured if you put a Feather in it, you are that much closer to that BBS or DFS all of us are trying to achieve.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It is, after all, the blade itself that is doing the work - safety razors are really just blade</li>
            <li>at least 4 or 5 good shaves out of one blade for a fraction of what those cartridge things cost.</li>
            <li>With the Feathers, almost zero sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a fairly rough beard and kind of sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Sometimes you&#x27;ll get a good sharp blade then the next one out of the package is duller than the one you just replaced.</li>
            <li>Super light and very sharp.</li>
            <li>they really are the sharpest blades, apply a very minimal amount of pressure and you won&#x27;t believe how smooth your face can be!</li>
            <li>This is a unique area of my neck where I get nervous to use a double edge razor.</li>
            <li>Sharp and retains edge for more than one or two face shaves.</li>
            <li>Take off the top layer of skin sharp.</li>
            <li>the negatives made me hesitate for a bit before trying them, it was actually the overwhelming number of positive reviews that finally got me to make the attempt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I felt very comfortable using a safety razor after only a few shaves but had not received my Feather blades in the mail yet</li>
            <li>High quality blades for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>In other words, I get fewer shaves, that are very clean, from one razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife remarked that my face was as smooth two days later as it normally is after a normal shave with Derby-</li>
            <li>A Merkur blade lasts me around 3-4 days before pulling, this blade will last a full 7 days.</li>
            <li>After finding a nice safety razor on Amazon I started using the generic blades from my local grocery store and was puzzled that I couldn&#x27;t find the old Wilkinson Sword or Remington blades I remember from my youth</li>
            <li>Blades have to be sharp or you won&#x27;t get a good shave, these are not &#x27;scary sharp, whatever that means.  </li>
            <li>So, even though they&#x27;re more expensive, they&#x27;re a better value because each blade shaves for much</li>
            <li>What the big boys say is true.</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li>shaves out of each blade, not bad when they only cost $0.17 each.</li>
            <li>Make sure you have your shaving technique down</li>
            <li>No need for that little our Vera strip that comes with the those blades or getting stuck all the time when you have too much hair in between too many blades and having to force those hairs out of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very sharp and smooth on the skin!</li>
            <li>Very sharp and not for beginners or aggressive razors, unless your ok with blood.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I notices that the sharper the blade I used, the better the shave and the LESS irritation.  </li>
            <li>so I can make the cut more or less agressive.  </li>
            <li>Shaving with a traditional Double Edge safety razor is an art neglected by most.</li>
            <li>Been using a safety razor as my main shaving instrument for a while.</li>
            <li>Only last about 1 shave each where I had others that lasted more.</li>
            <li>99R. I have yet to try with my older Mehaz.</li>
            <li>All these years I was a loyal customer to one and only one brand - Gillette Mach 3 cartridges and Gillette foam can for shaving cream .</li>
            <li>Like the blade disposal pocket too, that&#x27;s a clever design</li>
            <li>Now, I understand every face is different and various brands work better for some and not for others.  </li>
            <li>Slowly I increased the aggressiveness of my Progress to get to the coveted BBS (baby butt smooth) shave that is free of irritation and nicks</li>
            <li>Using a duller blade will cause you to go over and over the same area, which will more than likely lead to  a nick or cut.</li>
            <li>he&#x27;s been a Gillette guy from many years and wanted to switch to safety razors, so I read reviews of different products and finally decided to give all these in a shaving kit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather spend the extra few cents a shave and have a really good experience.</li>
            <li>But, with these in it, I can get by with 2 passes, and most likely not have to shave the next night.</li>
            <li>Used many different brands they are the sharpest plus last the longest.</li>
            <li>These are the best double edge razors money can buy - and they aren&#x27;t expensive.</li>
            <li>so one might say that Feathers are 40% sharper than most standard double edge razor blades.</li>
            <li>For anyone thinking about getting into shaving with a classic safety razor, everywhere you look will tell you that feather blades are not for beginners.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They last for several shaves, much more than any Fusion or disposable.</li>
            <li>The only thing that makes using a Feather different than most is the sensitivity of your blade angle.  </li>
            <li>I recommend them highly.</li>
            <li>I tend to feel these are highly over hyped.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this seller, and this brand of blades.</li>
            <li>As close a shave I have ever had with a blade, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would recommend these to anyone looking for a high quality blade and a close shave.</li>
            <li>highly recommend getting alum as well since de razors can nick at times.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this blade.</li>
            <li>I am not in military services or neither I am a president, so shaving once in 3 days works perfectly fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;During</li>
            <li>but honestly I dont think these blades are sharp enough.</li>
            <li>There is definitely a lot going for them compared to the Kai&#x27;s; they&#x27;re less money, you can get them through Prime, they come in a cool (and safe) dispenser and it can also be used to dispose of your old blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li>While I do not find it unbelievably super sharp as I have read in so many other reviews, I did find it gave me a VERY CLEAN/SMOOTH shave.</li>
            <li>a blade for a quick shaver, or someone new to double edged safety razor shaving, as these blades demand respect and control.</li>
            <li>This is especially true if you have a tough beard.</li>
            <li>if I hadn&#x27;t tried all the other crappy brands out there I would have rated these a 1 next to the Crystals, but I know these are actually quite a comfortable blade compared to most.</li>
            <li>Ive used: derby, rapira stainless, perm sharp supers, shark super chrome, lord stainless, lord platinum class,</li>
            <li>and I thought I was being careful and light.</li>
            <li>Just be careful and enjoy.</li>
            <li>the Japanese-made Feather razor blades are available for wet shavers.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a shave this close since the old barber shop days where they used a straight razor.</li>
            <li>I had to set my adjustable razor to 4 with these blades, opposed to my normal 8-9.</li>
            <li>After a few months I have gotten used to the sharpness and am now able to turn the setting up to 7 with no problems.  </li>
            <li>initially - but worth sticking with.</li>
            <li>So I guess they are worth the extra cost!</li>
            <li>It normally takes me about 3 shaves to go through a blade.</li>
            <li>Use a good shave oil (thin one, not a thick one like Art of Shaving, because it tends to clog the razor), shave soap, and let the weight of the razor work for you.</li>
            <li>With these especially, shaving cream is a must, but still worth it.</li>
            <li>second blade currently in use on its 3 rd shave and its shaving strong.</li>
            <li>The quality, the lack of nicking yourself, the smoothness that comes with such a sharp blade, made my shave superior and actually decrease the time it took to shave.</li>
            <li>only issue is that these blades cut right on through any imperfections on your face.  </li>
            <li>I have read many of the reviews on these blades both positive and negative,</li>
            <li>I shave with a Murker Classic, and my facial hair is pretty toughnna</li>
            <li>/&gt;I can echo what others have said about a very smooth shave with VERY little irritation.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t imagine I&#x27;ll buy another brand, since these are cheap, sharp, and hold their edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are sharp and require a light touch, but any wetshaving system requires care in terms of pressure used.  </li>
            <li>The steel feels smooth against my skin, and they are razor sharp.  </li>
            <li>So sharp I could use against the hair growth and get a baby butt smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I simply enjoy a brand new everytime i shave, I&#x27;m still saving like 70%+ of what i used to spend on the other type of blades.</li>
            <li>Drop in a new Feather and</li>
            <li>My new De 89 came with a pack of Derby blades.</li>
            <li>New Hi-Stainless blades.  </li>
            <li>Feather razor blades truly live up to the hype.</li>
            <li>They seem to live up to the hype of the reviews.</li>
            <li>I recommend everyone who is new to the DE world to purchase a sampler pack and find a blade that works for their face.  </li>
            <li>I do not recommend these to new users of a safety razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to DE shaving but have yet to have any nick at all with them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting about 7, 3 pass shaves with each blade before I basically decide to go to a new one.</li>
            <li>I would encourage anyone who is trying new razors to get a variety pack and see how you like them before purchasing in quantity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These gave me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had, and they will be my new mainstay from here on out.</li>
            <li>Im relatively new to DE shaving and have experimented around.</li>
            <li>Super sharp, makes your shave much easier.</li>
            <li>I only had to perform 2 passes (with the grain and cross the grain) for a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, since you only have 1 blade, it also means that when you rinse it to get rid of the tiny hairs, it gets rinsed super quick (unlike the multiblade blades which tend to get some hair stuck despite constant flush)</li>
            <li>Since my tester is based on the sharpness of a commonly available standard blade I had to adjust downward the standard 50 gram weight of the instrument&#x27;s measurement piston in order to measure the Feathers.</li>
            <li>They also last longer (At least 5 good shaves for me, versus at tops 3</li>
            <li>I may have had too high an expectation after all the rave reviews I&#x27;d read online, but I&#x27;m tempering that opinion with the fact I&#x27;m far from a shaving</li>
            <li>The Feather razors are much better suited for going against the grain, as they require very little effort to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These blades are very sharp and work fine.</li>
            <li>I used to re-lather, then shave again against the grain with most ordinary blades.</li>
            <li>Recently had my first shave with a safety razor.</li>
            <li>I got them excited at how sharp they&#x27;re supposed to be.</li>
            <li>From the reviews I read I was excited to receive these because of the claims of how sharp they are supposed to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When I first started shaving, I used a double bladed pick blade.</li>
            <li>Always soak your current razor / blade in hot water before using.</li>
            <li>Different blades work better in different razors on different faces.</li>
            <li>These things are super sharp and with patience and a steady hand, you will reap the rewards of a BBS shave.</li>
            <li>Snap in half and use it in the Dovo Shavette handle for fine detail shaving.  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>They work great in my double edge razor and last around 3-4 shaves and I have thick hair.</li>
            <li>Probably worth the long (3 weeks)</li>
            <li>he just love this blades and the price is just unbelievable</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Double edge safety razors continue to blow any modern overpriced razors out of the water!</li>
            <li>they were too harsh for my face causing major razor burn but installed in my micro touch one they worked much better.  </li>
            <li>Very sharp and oiled to stay rust free.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a safety razor for a few years now, and I had felt completely happy with my usual Derby HD blades until now.</li>
            <li>so even though sometimes you have to do 2 passes to obtain a close shave (since this razor only has 1 blade, compared to gillete&#x27;s which usually have 3-4 and effectively does 3-4 passes per pass)</li>
            <li>Nice and sharp so be careful!</li>
            <li>Because of this, I have recently switched from using cheap disposable single edge &amp;#34;fusion-type&amp;#34; razors to a new Edwin Jagger De89bl.</li>
            <li>Still a little nervous to try them In the aggressive Merkur Futur, which is not forgiving in the least, but it won&#x27;t be long before I do, and I&#x27;m confident that if I set aside the time, and not rush, I will be thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li>get more cuts with these vs my other blades the first few uses.</li>
            <li>once they dull a bit, I get a better shave with no cuts.</li>
            <li>Super sharp.  </li>
            <li>They are super sharp.  </li>
            <li>adequate shaves using other blades).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a tough beard and sensitive skin, this blade coupled with nice doubled edge razor, handles my beard well.  </li>
            <li>I did not have any major cuts, but an occasional nick that amazingly healed in a day or less (presumably because it was so small and clean).</li>
            <li>I decided to start DE shaving using Derby razor blades, which is a decent blade, especially if you&#x27;re new to it.</li>
            <li>With these feather blades I have cut myself many times when the blade will literally get caught in my hair and then break free cutting me.</li>
            <li>I got my start shaving with Gillette Rubie and Sputnik blades (two brands, same blade really) when I lived in Russia.  </li>

            <li>So I ordered 20 Feather blades, and was pleasantly surprised to find them to be the sharpest blades I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I use nothing but the old school safety razors these days.</li>
            <li>So far after 5 shaves on the feather and still almost zero pulling...</li>
            <li>Sensitive Skin Pre Shave Cream (also use as post</li>
            <li>On the practical side, the multi-blade razors leave stray hairs in some places (near the nostrils and in the corners of the mouth); these do not.  </li>
            <li>I have to set the razor to 5 to feel that it was &amp;#34;aggressive&amp;#34; enough for me, but once set I did find it did give me a very CLOSE shave without getting a lot (not any to tell the truth)</li>
            <li>I DO like these feathers (so far) however.</li>
            <li>it turns out they missed it by nearly a week.  </li>
            <li>things I will say, I was surprised when the blades arrived from Thailand.</li>
            <li>Derby is by far cheaper.</li>
            <li>Convenient case that holds old blades.</li>
            <li>Definitely made me improve my technique as you really can&#x27;t feel if you&#x27;ve cut yourself.</li>
            <li>but these we&#x27;re the sharpest by far.</li>
            <li>I have used Feather razors with Muhle and Ikon heads, open and closed combs, many different shaving creams and techniques.  </li>
            <li>I use these in my Shaving Factory Double Edge Safety Razor and in my Dovo Shavette straight razor handle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d get at least one, if not two or more, cuts on my face/neck using the Derby blades.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The blades are much better than the Van Der Hagen blades that came with my razor at least.</li>
            <li>Of course nearly everything you read about feather razor blades  </li>
            <li>Recently  I bought an inexpensive  &amp;#34;edge sharpness tester&amp;#34; for my straight razors.</li>
            <li>He told me he wants me to reorder them next time</li>
            <li>my son uses the old style razor blades ans</li>
            <li>Talk about wow</li>
            <li>/&gt;-I&#x27;ve tried Merkur blades direct from the factory, Meijer brand, Shark, and Derby HD.</li>
            <li>So there is a possibility that your fixed safety razor cuts agressively</li>
            <li>But if your into old school shaving, ya gotta try these.</li>
            <li>Actually, that is kind of undeserved.</li>
            <li>Though expensive I have gotten a really good shave from these razors.</li>
            <li>This is the sharpest blade out there, and if you have issues with razor burn or a generally thick beard you will love shaving with a feather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If your new to wet shaving you may want to get them in a sampler pack first to see if they are for you.</li>
            <li>Skinned half of my shin off the first time I used it haha, but its a substantial improvement over the standard-issue Merkur blade that came with my safety razor....</li>
            <li>Good blades, but they seem to dull faster than other blades that I have used (i.e. Shark).  </li>
            <li>Like many other reviewers, I switched to double edge safety razors from Gillette Fusion 5 blades cartridge razors and have never looked back.</li>
            <li>I purchased my brother an entire shave set and a sample pack of blades the other day for his birthday and told him to try the Feather blades after he felt comfortable with his technique.</li>
            <li>I purchased my brother an entire shave set and a sample pack of blades the other day for his birthday and told him to try the Feather blades after he felt comfortable with his technique.</li>
            <li>My beard is full but not super densely packed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a couple shaves, they are more tame and seem much like my other blades.</li>
            <li>love them, no pulling or tugging just clean cutting.</li>
            <li>I first tried Derby blades and also some random blades that came with my razor, but they were just ok.  </li>
            <li>one shortcoming of a feather blade is that it does so quickly and needs to be switched out but compared to mock three mock for Talk five whatever the new razors are, this seems to be a far cheaper choice and obviously less commercial.</li>
            <li>The Feather blades just glided right through my beard, requiring minimal passes for the closest shave ever, with no irritation!  </li>
            <li>I bought a couple of the highly rated blades, and definitely prefer this one.  </li>
            <li>I have tried and used a bunch of different brands and have found that these blades work very well, the sharpest that I have used so far and last the longest.</li>
            <li>My first clean against-the-grain pass in ages resulted in far less injury than any similar attempt with any other razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Razor sharp just got a whole new definition for me.</li>
            <li>My stubble/growth is moderate - and while using the Feather initially is tough (as a new shaver) and prone to nick due to inexperience, its a far superior blade in my experience compared to the Mekur blade.</li>
            <li>just tread carefully on first use, I didn&#x27;t expect that since the Merkur blade was pretty dull by comparison.</li>
            <li>So if you find the shave unbearable try again later with a new blade and see if it is the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Expect cuts you didn&#x27;t feel, especially if you&#x27;re a new transitioner from cartridges.</li>
            <li>I used the Merker blade that came with my razor for about a week before getting my new pack of feather blades in, and I can say that I think the feather are definitely sharper.</li>
            <li>Derby there was always a loud &amp;#34;carbonated drink near my ear&amp;#34; popping as I could hear the individual hairs being cut.</li>
            <li>I used the Dorco blades prior and they are inferior compared to the Feathers, and last much longer.  </li>
            <li>I might look for a mid-grade blade for daily shaving, but this is still cheaper than most disposable cartridges which can clog and have that slow dragging feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Super sharp, no drag with properly lubed face.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new to safety razor shaving go slowly, make sure you have a soap that lathers well, use extra protection (i.e.- use baby or olive oil on face after hot water and before soaping) and don&#x27;t press too firmly.  </li>
            <li>Really not as sharp as everyone thinks they are.</li>
            <li>Other times, it&#x27;s exactly what</li>
            <li>They require a little more attention to detail to shave with than other blades.  </li>
            <li>Husband reports very sharp blades, gets a full week of shaving from one on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>I would wait however (if you are new to DE shaving) until you have practiced with a few others first</li>
            <li>/&gt;2-There is a rough approximation of blade sharpness (available on various sites online) that you want to match with the COARSNESS of your facial hair, NOT by how much facial hair you have (this point I did not understand until I ventured into DE blades).  </li>
            <li>I usually just clean up my neck area and have no problems with the merkur blades.</li>
            <li>Hd Classic Barber Pole Long Safety Razor.</li>
            <li>Okay I&#x27;m with a few other posters.  </li>
            <li>They are very smooth and are sharp enough to last you through multiple shaves if stored dry.</li>
            <li>To be completely honest, after seven shaves the Feather New Hi-Stainless blades were still as sharp as the generic ones from the local grocery that were at least twice the price.  </li>
            <li>It might be worth having a few around for special occasions, but probably not worth it for every day, especially if you&#x27;re into double-edge shaving in order to keep the costs down compared to modern cartridges.</li>
            <li>If you are an experienced shaver, then give these bad boys a try.</li>
            <li>It is an amazingly accurate instrument and the sharpness scale that is part and parcel of the instrument is based on the sharpness of an ordinary double edge razor blade and as fate would have it &amp;#34;Astra&amp;#34; razor blades were provided with  the unit to demonstrate the &amp;#34;zero point&amp;#34; of the instrument.</li>
            <li>Generally speaking there is no &amp;#34;free lunch&amp;#34; in the edge sharpness world</li>
            <li>also feel it is necessary to say that many of the negative reviews address different issues</li>
            <li>The only difference is that with this you save a hell of a lot of money compared to the now more common gillette (or similar) blades.</li>
            <li>I was content with my old blades for the last forty years and had no idea of all the options on line.  </li>
            <li>#34;too sharp&amp;#34;, and that you can cut your face up if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was about to give up and go back to my old cartridge razor when I read the reviews on the feathers and made the purchase.  </li>
            <li>Decided to back to the old ways of shaving.</li>
            <li>Have used safety razors for 20 yrs now , these blades are the sharpest and longest lasting so far.</li>
            <li>Took me a couple of years to be able to have enough technique to use them without really irritating my fairly sensitive  skin.</li>
            <li>Not recommended as a first if you&#x27;re recently switching to wet shaving.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly new to double edge safety razors and these are my second blades coming from merkur.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to try a new double edge blade, look no further than these quality feather blades.</li>
            <li>These blades are super sharp and has a safety disposer in the case so you don&#x27;t have loose blades in the trash</li>
            <li>Still way less money than disposable razors, and you&#x27;ll feel the difference on your first pass.</li>
            <li>They are exceptionally sharp and the edge really lasts.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve got a reputation for being sharp, but I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference.  </li>
            <li>I was amazed how much sharper they are than other blades.  </li>
            <li>However, they are ridiculously sharp and do not allow for much error.  </li>
            <li>Any nicks have been due to getting used to shaving with a real razor, not the blades.  </li>
            <li>Having used the Sharp Super Chrome, the Derby and the Wilkenson Swords, I felt I had mastered the art of wet shaving.  </li>
            <li>so I rate them a little higher.</li>
            <li>They took a little getting used to (you get nicks easily at first)</li>
            <li>This one worked great for me, with much less tug than a few others I tried, especially Derby brand, though I have relatively thick hair.</li>
            <li>The old blades left some substantial razor burn, especially after the second pass going against the grain.  </li>
            <li>Just follow your normal wet shaving prep + routine</li>
            <li>I had been so eager with trying out a different DE blades, because I had been using crummy, generic blades from retailers (ahem... major pharmacy chain).  </li>
            <li>This problem does not occur with other blades, just this particular brand.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend if your new to wet shaving.  </li>
            <li>If your new to wet shaving try a Derby or Gilette silvers.  </li>
            <li>If you are new to wet shaving try Merkur or just take your time if you dont</li>
            <li>I knew this going in,  but I was surprised it actually took that long.</li>
            <li>I have not had a single cut so far.</li>
            <li>The steel is ultra thin, yet strong at the same time because I can use it up to  about five or six times in a row before changing.</li>
            <li>You will not likely find a high quality blade like this with such an sharp and durable edge.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read that the general consensus on Feather blades were they were scary sharp and kind of pricy.</li>
            <li>and it is still sharper than any of my other blades when they were new.</li>
            <li>People said to sharp for new users.  </li>
            <li>The only other DE blade I&#x27;ve tried are the Merkur blades and they work pretty well too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve yet to nick myself while shaving with the Feather&#x27;s, but maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m being really careful as some Amazon reviewers are touting these as some miracle, Japanese steel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In comparison to the crummy blades, the Feather&#x27;s feel like a much thinner blade and last a little longer.  </li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re simply not as wicked sharp as a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a very sharp blade, noticeably more sharp than a Derby or 7O&#x27;Clock green.  </li>
            <li>The blades are a little more stiff than some of the other big wig primo razors, and they don&#x27;t keep their edge as long as some I&#x27;ve tried, but I come back to them when I want to feel baby, baby soft with the closest shave in the universe.</li>
            <li>I am not going to get into whether or not these are the sharpest blades around that is sort of a given, nobody seems to contest that, the good and bad reviews alike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to begin reviewing this item by saying,  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Nothing good or bad just not for me.</li>

            <li> Great blades!very close shave!will twofer them for sure!</li>
            <li> Feathers are good blades, but imho they are not the best available.  </li>
            <li> I do advise to do a pre-shave oil or pre-shave regime before shaving with any good quality blade including this one.</li>
            <li> I noticed with this thing my skin wasn&#x27;t looking too good, so I switched to Gillete 7 o clock razors.</li>
            <li> That was a mistake because now I know why my face wasn&#x27;t looking good before, the razor burn with this</li>
            <li> a good lather).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> googling brings up reviews suggesting the blades are good for 3-4 shaves, so maybe I&#x27;m using them after their peak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , good blades though.</li>
            <li> I can get about 5 good shaves out of one.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m trying others but will keep a good supply of these as a benchmark to judge the others.</li>
            <li> what it is).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get a good two weeks out a blade, Could probably push it to a month if I tried to.</li>
            <li> a good product.</li>
            <li> So they&#x27;re still a good bargain</li>
            <li> I think I found a good way to pick a razor blade, I will share it with fellow</li>
            <li> If you buy good shaving cream, a foaming brush, have some aftershave, and have practiced DE shaving for a week (using the blade that came with your razor)</li>
            <li> Good product-</li>
            <li> I just loved the package and the way it was presented.</li>
            <li> That might be true on both accounts, but they are the best blades I&#x27;ve ever used and</li>
            <li> Great blades very smooth, and I get</li>
            <li> They also are at the very top of the cost spectrum.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are the sharpest and give me the best results with minimal burn using a Merkur 34C. Good for 4-5 excellent shaves, but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with sharpness and comfort.</li>
            <li> the best blade i have used so far.no nicks,no complaints.well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Good deal, and they give me a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> A very nice deal and prompt customer  support.. pleased to use the product .have  </li>
            <li> I get a good five days from one blade, no face scrapping, a good refreshing shave.</li>
            <li> Excellent Items, Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Just opened and used the first blade....proceed with care, but it is THE BEST BLADE I&#x27;e ever used!</li>
            <li> and I will purchase more!</li>
            <li> try many before buying one in bulk!</li>
            <li> These have worked out amazingly well.  </li>
            <li> blades are of the highest quality, are packaged well in packs of 5, and if my beard was a bit coarser, they would be amazing.</li>
            <li> A great smooth shave.</li>
            <li> These blades are amazing.</li>
            <li> I also use prorazo preshave cream and post balm and it feels amazing.</li>
            <li> Really amazing.</li>
            <li> They are amazing cut like butter.  </li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t shave for a week or so, they still work great, but understandably aren&#x27;t quite as smooth.</li>
            <li> Amazing difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just saw a pack of 8 fusion cartridges at a popular discount retail chain for about $28.  </li>
            <li> I think that speaks for itself, I have never had any blade that was good for more than a week, and pushing it at that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> each his own, what works for me may not work at all for you...</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best and sharpest blades you can find.  </li>
            <li> A variety pack really helps you decide which is best for your face.</li>
            <li> Some people say you can use these blades for a couple of shaves, honestly i don&#x27;t bother at like 40cents or so per blade</li>
            <li> Great blades, nice close  comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Totally satisfied with this purchase, good quality razor blades.</li>
            <li> The blades I own and have tried before using the Feather include Derby, Gillette, and Astra.</li>
            <li> Braun does a nice job here.</li>
            <li> The package has a built-in blade disposal which is nice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller packed the product nicely, it came from Thailand</li>
            <li> With a fresh Feather loaded and the Progress set to its maximum wickedness I got an incredible 3 pass shave even on the hardest areas for me (neck &amp; jaw line).</li>
            <li> a nice day</li>
            <li> all blades, your mileage may vary, so find a 5-pack before purchasing this (or a sampler that includes a Feather) to be sure the blade is good for your face.</li>
            <li> used every kind of electric and disposable blade out there and have been rewarded with lots of nicks and razor burns.  </li>
            <li> These razors really are the best made out there.</li>
            <li> They had a nice edge to them.</li>
            <li> Once you get used to shaving with these blades they&#x27;re spectacular.</li>
            <li> I was going to give up on DE shaving, but these blades and the Feather Popular Razor(TTO) saved the day.</li>
            <li> Well, with the Derby blades I never was able to get a good shave and almost threw in the towel on DE shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> No razor burn and a nice close shave.  </li>
            <li> Feathers ard good too, just  more money.</li>
            <li> The razors are really nice  though.</li>
            <li> I started with the Merkurs, which kind of tugged and pulled.</li>
            <li> I have been using persona and have really liked them as well.</li>
            <li> nothing amazing, make sure you have a good lather before attempting to shave with these.</li>
            <li> They are good razors that give you a good clean shave</li>
            <li> First impressions is very good</li>
            <li> Well worth the extra cost, though it is best to shop around for the best deal.</li>
            <li> Pair this blade with a good shave cream (I like Taylor of Old Bond Street the best) and you have a winning combination.</li>
            <li> Sharpest may be fine in one razor and not as good in another, even though it&#x27;s sharper.</li>
            <li> These are the best safety razor blades I have used so far.</li>
            <li> I use them in my shavette and they are by far the best blades I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Wow these feather blades are awesome..</li>
            <li> these really are the best blades available.</li>
            <li> In fact, these blades \\&quot;skip\\&quot; much more frequently than their legendary sharpness would imply.</li>
            <li> These were exactly what I was looking for at a great price.</li>
            <li> No nicks, no cuts, and a very, very smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> They are very smooth on my skin</li>
            <li> Very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Brand new, these blades will provide an incredibly close shave.  </li>
            <li> bought the inexpensive Feather Popular Safety Razor - which is 20 bucks at most - and it does the job fine.</li>
            <li> Having used them for a couple weeks now, I like them, and will probably be buying more of them.</li>
            <li> I prefer Astras more though</li>
            <li> satisfied.</li>
            <li> These blades are much better quality than the ones I got with my Merkur safety razor.  </li>
            <li> These razors also hold an edged better than Merkur, Wilkinson, etc..</li>
            <li> Ok so to debunk the hype about feather razors.</li>
            <li> I love these razors.</li>
            <li> I recommend them to any person who wants to shave with one blade - experienced or newbie.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found a better blade yet.  </li>
            <li> I love these blades.  </li>
            <li> Not my favorite razor blade</li>
            <li> Of course everyone&#x27;s best blade may be different</li>
            <li> If you are looking for the best shave possible, this may be the blade for you.  </li>
            <li> These blades have worked great for me, I get really close shaves using these in my setup.</li>
            <li> and I nicked my skin more often than I wanted.</li>
            <li> the feathers are simply the best.</li>
            <li> Spend the extra money and buy the best.</li>
            <li> Thus, a shopping trip for better accoutrements.  </li>
            <li> They deliver a close smooth shave every day!</li>
            <li> (don&#x27;t use these if you are a novice), you&#x27;ll love these.</li>
            <li> I have since found a better blade...</li>
            <li> Best double edge razor shave</li>
            <li> I love these blades.</li>
            <li> I find I get better shaves from them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that I have to pay more attention to the grain of my beard with this blade to avoid any irritation.  </li>
            <li> But product was delivered as described and I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> Simply the best razor blades you&#x27;ll ever find, period!</li>
            <li> manufactures many of the blades we use.</li>
            <li> I also love that these blades are a dime a dozen by comparison of the cartridges in the stores.</li>
            <li> However if I shave with one day stubble, I get more irritation and shave bumps.</li>
            <li> I have to practice more.</li>
            <li> Love these blades.</li>
            <li> Be sure to check out the suppliers.  </li>
            <li> DO believe this are my newest favorite with my others being Personna</li>
            <li> I love the blades....</li>
            <li> I will order more when the time comes.</li>
            <li> but if done properly they are the best I have seen.</li>
            <li> Outstanding service.</li>
            <li> They are, but don&#x27;t think better when you think sharper.</li>
            <li> I consider myself having excellent technique and proper prep, and I still managed to cut myself almost every time I used these.</li>
            <li> After more experience I realized the mistake I was making and it had to do with pressure - even the slightest bit of pressure and you risk</li>
            <li> Now that I know the key about pressure I shave with my Progress set to 5.5 (maximum aggressiveness) - this gave me excellent but</li>
            <li> But, I am glad I tried them.  </li>
            <li> Well these are definitely the best de blades I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I buy more blades</li>
            <li> but i seem to get a better shave if i add just a touch of pressure.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m learning more as I get into de shaving.</li>
            <li> Obviously not a deal breaker as I gave this product 5 stars, but it&#x27;s something to keep in mind when choosing which blade works best for you.</li>
            <li> These blades are so much better than the blades I was using, it makes them look like butter knives.  </li>
            <li> granted the Feathers are the second best blade I have used, but I will not be opening another pack of these... they&#x27;ll just go into my obsolete blade graveyard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It goes without saying that it is much more enjoyable and faster to shave with the Crystals...</li>
            <li> I have better that 42$ for a flashlight, razor that vibrates</li>
            <li> All of those worked much better with my razor.  </li>
            <li> and you will be rewarded with a fantastic shave!</li>
            <li> There are many blades to choose from, but there is no reason to use anything but Feather on your face.</li>
            <li> Truly phenomenal.</li>
            <li> These blades make it even better.</li>
            <li> I love these blades.  </li>
            <li> shaves out of one blade before I feel a notable difference.</li>
            <li> I love them in my Merkur 34C, as it&#x27;s not known as an aggressive razor.</li>
            <li> Simply the BEST shave EVER!</li>
            <li> ; because anything more than the slightest bit of pressure makes my face look like it was shaved by Ramsey Bolton.  </li>
            <li> I love the blades..</li>
            <li> With one of these, it is better to have your morning coffee after you finish shaving.</li>
            <li> inconsistency in terms of sharpness, some in a pack are better than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> think if you are worried about nicking tier 3 would be at your top and tier 1 would be at your bottom of choices.</li>
            <li> I have been able to use these blades for 4 shaves before switching blades.  </li>
            <li> Blades seem more flexible which to me helps the blade angle.</li>
            <li> I get more shaves per blade, and better shaves, compared to the cheaper bulk packs.</li>
            <li> Reviewed as being better than the blades included with the razor</li>
            <li> The Feather blade worked better [FOR ME] than all the others with the next best being a Shark blade.  </li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t for everyone, as most people will tell you.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found better ones here in the US.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more razor blades when I run out.</li>
            <li> I personally love them.</li>
            <li> Still using them because I haven&#x27;t found any better for me.</li>
            <li> I love these razor blades.</li>
            <li> Like many guys, I&#x27;ve read the reviews about these blades and was hesitant to try them.  </li>
            <li> Wilkinson Swords and Astra SP&#x27;s were more forgiving in this regard, perhaps because of their coating.  </li>
            <li> The PolSilver was my favorite until I tried Feather.</li>
            <li> I have had equally satisfying shaves with both the Feather and Personna.  </li>
            <li> They were ok.  </li>
            <li> These blades are fantastic!  </li>
            <li> Also, using sharper blades does not make you more</li>
            <li> They cut so much better, easier, almost no irritation at all.  </li>
            <li> Some blades are more flexible</li>
            <li> There is no &#x27;one ultimate blade&#x27; that everyone will love best.</li>
            <li> You will not be able to ascertain whether this is the blade for you, or not.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These blades give a great shave, but aren&#x27;t very forgiving if mistakes are made with your technique.</li>
            <li> I use this shaving method in part because I do not have to throw away cartridges every time I change the blade, I would feel better if my razor blades were package in paper &amp;#34;box&amp;#34; that would be better for the environment to dispose.</li>
            <li> After sampling many (Dorco, Wilkinson, Gilette, Bic, et al.)</li>
            <li> but I get more shaves, and closer shaves, than I ever did before.  </li>
            <li> I have used Derby and Personna and this blade comes out on top.</li>
            <li> These blades are just okay and</li>
            <li> So far, so good!</li>
            <li> As I continued my research into shaving with double-edged blades, I came across these beautiful Japanese feather blades and found that they cut my beard with amazing ease.</li>
            <li> Nice and clean shave, and</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them for the experienced shaver.</li>
            <li> This is easily the best way to get a close shave with a regular double-edged razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I believe that I have pretty good shaving technique</li>
            <li> Blades (along with a good razor - like the De 89) are everything to enjoying a good, close shave without medical intervention - and I give credit to Feather for helping to accomplish that.</li>
            <li> The blades give the best shave that I have had in quite a long time.</li>
            <li> Still, the blades are very good and, overall I am pleased with the value.</li>
            <li> and these babies work great in my new safety razor.  </li>
            <li> It is a good blade, but they are only good for two shaves, for me anyway.</li>
            <li> Overall these blades are fantastic and will be the best complement to your shaving kit!</li>
            <li> Though I&#x27;m sure if you take your time and adjust your technique it should be fine.</li>
            <li> I found the derby blades to give me just as close a shave a bit more comfortably.</li>
            <li> get a better shave than a cheap razor</li>
            <li> It is the sharpest and most comfortable blade made, and the price is all but identical to any competitors.</li>
            <li> you are sampling blades to find the one that gives the most comfortable shave, I do believe you need to try these.\\</li>
            <li> My razor came with some &amp;#34;Shark&amp;#34; blades which were ok, but when i ran out i gave these a try, and i must say these are fantastic.</li>
            <li> Much better than the cheap Derbys I tried before.</li>
            <li> Well, he called me this morning and said he tried the Feather on his first shave and was very pleased.</li>
            <li> Well, he called me this morning and said he tried the Feather on his first shave and was very pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I switched, and I am wondering what I can do with my Art of Shaving Power Fusion Razors with light.</li>
            <li> All you have to do is decide which is more important to you.</li>
            <li> Awesome blades!--forget the fortune spent on Gillette Fusion</li>
            <li> These are the sharpest, most durable, and comfortable blades I have used to date.</li>
            <li> Not much to say, tried sample packs of blades, like these the best.</li>
            <li> They are defiantly the sharpest, and that (if your careful) will give you the best shave of your life.</li>
            <li> Feathers were more prone to give me some razor burn if I wasn&#x27;t precise with my blade angle.  </li>
            <li> Because of this, technique/lather/aftershave become more important.</li>
            <li> Great blade in old school razors like DE Gillette&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Most of the reviews and answers to questions indicated that the Feather New Hi-Stainless blades were good for four,</li>
            <li> No razor burn, clean cuts, very smooth.</li>
            <li> Awesome and unbelievably sharp</li>
            <li> Lord blades are much better in my opinion, but each face and blade combo is unique...</li>
            <li> I had assumed that this was due to some super-manly neck hair and did my best.</li>
            <li> They are wicked sharp and will give you an excellent shave, but be awake when you use them.</li>
            <li> Wilkinson sword is more middle road and work great</li>
            <li> Care needs to be taken as you can easily give yourself razor burn and cut nicks with these things</li>
            <li> So, I can easily recommend the seller....</li>
            <li> These blades make it so easy, it&#x27;s almost effortless.</li>
            <li> You can easily slice yourself up.  </li>
            <li> I know feelings run strong on the topic, so I tread</li>
            <li> Shave preparation is also very important in getting a clean, close comfortable shave</li>
            <li> The shave is excellent, the blades are cheaper, and I enjoy the shaving experience a little better.  </li>
            <li> I am quickly becoming a huge fan of both the distributor and the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Now, I wait till i have almost a full beard before I shave so someone that shaves every day will probably get more out of a blade than I do.</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp and a great price.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best shaving experience I&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li> They give me hands down the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had and zero irritation.</li>
            <li> The best part is they seem to stay sharp for between 10 - 15 shaves!  </li>
            <li> Excellent shave, very sharp and arrived before they were promised.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, long-lasting blades at an excellent price.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re completely new to DE safety razors, I might still recommend Derby blades just because they&#x27;re fine for training and anything to help your confidence is a good thing.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re completely new to DE safety razors, I might still recommend Derby blades just because they&#x27;re fine for training and anything to help your confidence is a good thing.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> and you should be fine.</li>
            <li> This morning I shaved with one for the first time and it definitely is the sharpest and best blade of the four brands I have used.</li>
            <li> Goes fine with Merkur Razor.</li>
            <li> Feather blades are a fine tool that should be respected.</li>
            <li> If you respect the blade and take your time, you will be fine even as a beginner.</li>
            <li> Smooth and easy shave.</li>
            <li> I have fine curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Super close shave !</li>
            <li> Super sharpe, you cant buy sharper blades better know what your doing if your buy feather.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, light, and the perfect shave.  </li>
            <li> Now I won&#x27;t tell you that I never slice my face anymore, but I now have a much more pleasant time using a double edge razor.</li>
            <li> In the early turn of the millennium I switched to the safety razor, and found it to be the most amazing shaving experience I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> They are the only ones I will use because the give me a close and comfortable shave at a great price.</li>
            <li> you cut yourself with your double edged razor, you&#x27;re probably used to shaving with cartridge razors, which require pressure - a double edged razor should glide across your happy face, trimming the happy whiskers away</li>
            <li> oh so smooth and nick free feeling.</li>
            <li> No doubt about it, these blades are among the sharpest available.</li>
            <li> tried Derby, Astra, But will stay with Feather.&lt;br /&gt;About myself - using safety blades since 1977, experienced Russian, Iranian, Turkish, Czech, Bulgarian, Polish and some others.</li>
            <li> Use light pressure.</li>
            <li> Feathers with Merkur T handle will make a smooth shave with no razor burns or irritation.</li>
            <li> Great product especially  for the price !  </li>
            <li> Ive tried using no pressure on the razor and light pressure on the razor with these blades and they still leave me with a visible 5&#x27;o clock shadow.</li>
            <li> Smooth shave</li>
            <li> I get five comfortable</li>
            <li> Silky smooth shaving with these Feather ones.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been shaving with this combo for three months and really enjoy the experience of this combo.</li>
            <li> Feather blades are great and the only ones I use.</li>
            <li> With or against the grain is equally smooth and friction-less&lt;br /&gt;+ /-</li>
            <li> No irritation, no pull  just a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Fear them not, and enjoy.</li>
            <li> sound.</li>
            <li> I was using cheap blades from CVS before these</li>
            <li> these are the sharpest de blades available.  </li>
            <li> Overall, these blades are great.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for the sharpest DE blades available, these won&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> The shave is smooth, and lasts quite some time.</li>
            <li> The quality of shave is far superior.</li>
            <li> As a regular Derby and Wilkinson user, I kept promising myself that I would try a Feather blade to see if it lived up to its legendary status with my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great straight razor for shaving, fast delivery</li>
            <li> Feather blades are far superior.</li>
            <li> so my preparation to get a soft beard is good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I did notice a bit more stinging all over my face when I did a pass with a styptic, but I think this is related to how closely the razor passed over my face, so that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li> nothing else, buy the best blades, and get a shave as close to a straight razor shave as possible.</li>
            <li> nice sharp and good quality blades&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Very worth it.  </li>
            <li> The Feathers aren&#x27;t heads and shoulders better than my go-to Wilkersons, so although I might buy some more Feathers every now and then just to change things up, I&#x27;ll probably stick with Wilkersons as my main blades.</li>
            <li> While in relation to other DE blades feathers are indeed costlier, in relation to Cartridges, they are incredibly inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> Fine, but nothing special with a premium price.</li>
            <li> They just slice thru the stubble so cleanly and nick free.</li>
            <li> These scrape off the hair, but doesn&#x27;t leave me with the smooth clean shave.  </li>
            <li> I would almost go as far as saying that if you&#x27;re not an experienced DE shaver, hone your skills with something else first.</li>
            <li> You put literally a quarter of the pressure that you would normally use to shave, and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> Razors came on time,they are original and they are the sharpest in the business.</li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s not a lot of room for error, make sure you&#x27;ve got the hang of DE shaving first before getting these.</li>
            <li> A much closer shave, my skin is so healthy and smooth, and I rarely cut myself!</li>
            <li> I clean my razor after EVERY use and flip the blade.</li>
            <li> Definitely sold on feather blades, good for 6-8 shaves if you have a light beard.</li>
            <li> Get it nice and hot either by taking a shower before shaving, or putting a hot towel on your face to soften the hair.</li>
            <li> are clean</li>
            <li> But if you like a clean shavin BBS face then these blades are it.</li>
            <li> The Razors are fine; great quality, and extremely sharp.  </li>
            <li> Overall \\&quot;Feathers\\&quot; is a good economical solution for a clean smooth shave.</li>
            <li> My face feels great, minimal to no burn</li>
            <li> My first two shaves I cut myself in a couple spots two to three times per shave, and since then it has been nick free and cut free shaves in the six weeks since I started.</li>
            <li> Reputed to be the sharpest blade available, it has never failed to give me a close, comfortable shave with no irritation.  </li>
            <li> , the Feather is giving me the best shave with the least amount of pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like the Astra and Gillette razor blades but find myself using the Astra more often</li>
            <li> A true gentleman&#x27;s shave.</li>
            <li> In my opinion they aren&#x27;t quite as good as the personnas, but they are so close, I think that is a personal preference.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While I&#x27;m still no blademaster, I will increase my rating to a full 5-stars because as my abilities improve so does my appreciation for how well these blades perform in comparison to some others I&#x27;ve used and continue to use in the rotation.</li>
            <li> and I really recommend this product over using the garbage and money draining razors sold in most stores.</li>
            <li> I have also tried Gillette Silver Blue, Astra Superior Platinum, and Wilkinson razors.</li>
            <li> Just enough pressure to place the razor to the face (with good skin stretching technique) is used and let the razor do the work and this blade performs quite well.</li>
            <li> Then I decided to try these, since I kept hearing such good reviews on Feather blades.  </li>
            <li> Have had many shaves off of one blade and much cheaper than buying disposables.</li>
            <li> Much moreso than the cheaper brands, and worth it for a cleaner, smoother, and more comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> These blades work well, but go easy on your first use</li>
            <li> Go easy if your a first time safety razor user.</li>
            <li> I challenge anyone that has done any research on shaving double-edge razors to find one that is more all-around consistent and cleaner than these!</li>
            <li> These are great but they are super sharp,  like the sharpest you can get.  </li>
            <li> No they wont knick your face if you dont shave aggressively or quickly.</li>
            <li> I have neosporin on my face now to heal quickly.</li>
            <li> HI-STAINLESS has gained a loyal customer here.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different razor blades for use with my Merkur Safety Razor and the Feather razor blades are the best that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Sure, they&#x27;re better than the store brand I was buying at Wegmans (the only one offered amongst a wall of disposables), but not superlatively so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Merkur Super Platinum blades for months</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and smooth, more so than ever before</li>
            <li> I ONLY TAKE THE TIME TO WRITE THEM WHEN I FIND TRUELY EXCEPTIONAL PRODUCTS...</li>
            <li> It was after one particular shave where I rushed a bit, the burn healed in a day and I learned something more about DE shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use William&#x27;s Mug Shave Soap (found at a pharmacy for about a dollar), a Tweezerman brush (cheap but effective), and a Parker 99R razor (has the fancy butterfly close, but otherwise is very standard).</li>
            <li> I use them in my Fatboy, Redtip and super speeds.</li>
            <li> The thinner blade allows a much closer shave in my opinion and while I don&#x27;t get as many shaves out of a Feather blade as others, I still find the closeness factor to be worth it.</li>
            <li> They were seldom comfortable for more than one pass on my neck which is fairly sensitive unless I focused on my technique.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, the best blades I have purchased, highly recommend for all DE shavers</li>
            <li> After shaving with high quality electric razors for most of my life I decided to take another shot at using a blade (and hoping they wouldn&#x27;t rip my face apart like in my teens).  </li>
            <li> There are other very good brands that come out of the package and shave very well without the worry about nicks.  </li>
            <li> With the right touch, a close clean shave can be obtained.</li>
            <li> Sharp, smooth, and surprisingly forgiving.</li>
            <li> Great price considering quality, although they don&#x27;t last more than 2, possibly 3 shaves.</li>
            <li> I get a consistently close, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> The price difference from these and other brands is not that much more honestly.  </li>
            <li> I use this with the Merkur Long Handle, good combo.</li>
            <li> To each his own as far as brands of blades go, but the Feathers are by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve found that these sharper blades not only give a better, more even, longer lasting shave, but they also draw across the skin more easily, reducing cuts (assuming you get</li>
            <li> Great product, sharp!</li>
            <li> Fender Blues have always been a favorite they are nice and sharp and and worth the price</li>
            <li> Contrary to popular belief that these blades will mangle your face, the opposite is true, the sharper the blade</li>
            <li> Long weekend camping trip - no problem, took everything off (face and head) nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li> After my first shave with these blades I was hooked!  </li>
            <li> More sturdy and far greener!</li>
            <li> They are very sharp and I got a very nice shave with them.  </li>
            <li> dont have much experience with safety razor blades, but these see just fine.</li>
            <li> Although most safety razor experts suggest changing the blade out every shave, I often get several good, smooth, no-knick shaves out of a single blade.</li>
            <li> but after a few days shaving is great.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased three different blades so far and the FEATHER blades are the best for the price so far.</li>
            <li> So is it worth paying two or three times the price to have a sharper blade for 2 out of 7 days?  </li>
            <li> (where you rarely nick yourself).  </li>
            <li> I get about 3-4 days worth of</li>
            <li> Nice plus is the prices offered for multiple packages make these blades economical.</li>
            <li> Naturally, when I ran out of blades, I ordered more of the Feather</li>
            <li> favorite razor blades so far.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice so much while I was shaving on my first pass along the growth, it was more so after I washed my face off after the first pass.</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t see the need for a second pass, but of course I did so anyway.</li>
            <li> Get a safety razor and start shaving closer and more comfortably while saving money at the same time</li>
            <li> It took 2 weeks to get but worth it</li>
            <li> I get better shaves from cheaper blades (thus far Wilkinson Sword is my favourite).</li>
            <li> well worth the price premium.</li>
            <li> Going back to old school shaving has been a joy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;+ Container comes with built in razor disposal to safely dispose of old razor blades&lt;br</li>
            <li> They glide over skin with no friction when shaving a days worth of growth.</li>
            <li> But they work far better than anything else I have come across.</li>
            <li> Shipping took a while but worth the wait.</li>
            <li> With Feather, there&#x27;s a soft and more &amp;</li>
            <li> The blades arrived from Thailand and took forever to arrive, but it was worth the wait.  </li>
            <li> well worth it</li>
            <li> Well worth the money</li>
            <li> Cuts great, but very sharp!</li>
            <li> Pricier than other blades but worth it, they seem to be able to stand up to more shaves while still performing well before needing to be changed.</li>
            <li> I found the Feather blades to work the best on problem areas like my chin and under the neck, where other blades wouldn&#x27;t get close enough or would cause razor burns</li>
            <li> This was the first brand I purchased, I got lucky.</li>
            <li> Good sharp blade.</li>
            <li> Good blades that are sharp and well made.</li>
            <li> Of course, I nicked myself and bleeded for first 3 shaves, after that my skin got adjusted and my shaving skill improved, now I am able to get a smooth shave which last for 2 to 3 days.</li>
            <li> These are razor blades, nothing to get too excited about, really.  </li>
            <li> Good sharp blade.</li>
            <li> they are really sharp and hold an edge a good while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten pretty good about not cutting myself, and irritation is minimal.  </li>
            <li> Looking for something a little better, I began prowling Amazon and found good reviews for the Feather New Hi-Stainless.&lt;br /&gt;WHAT</li>
            <li> Both handles are great and many know it comes down to the trying different blades and</li>
            <li> Also keeping the angle right will help.</li>
            <li> The Feather blade just cut it right</li>
            <li> the bottom of this review to go right to Amazon&#x27;s page for the 100</li>
            <li> S-H-A-R-P is right.  </li>
            <li> And the price is right.</li>
            <li> I know, another positive review for this product is redundant, but these are undoubtedly the best blades I&#x27;ve used thus far.</li>
            <li> The second and third time, I was much more careful and got the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had in my life.</li>
            <li> This brand and type of blade came with my new razor last Christmas and have loved the close shave ever since.  </li>
            <li> otherwise, I feel pretty strongly that personnas are my absolute favorite de blades.&lt;br /&gt;they&#x27;re incredibly smooth, and also sharp.  </li>
            <li> There is absolutely no difference in terms of how &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; or nice the shaving experience is with an old fashion safety razor (+ these blades) and a top of the line gillette blade with lasers and vibrators and missiles.</li>
            <li> I was new to the DE world and bought 100 Derby razor blades because they were ridiculously cheap.  </li>
            <li> Amazing blade&lt;br /&gt;Shipping took a very long time&lt;br</li>
            <li> They were shipped super fast and packaged almost too well.  </li>
            <li> but if you have sensitive skin like me you might want to go with a more gentle blade.</li>
            <li> I will most likely return to the tried and true (and much cheaper) Derby after I deplete my supply of Feathers.</li>
            <li> Use a very light touch, short strokes and fewer</li>
            <li> I like the shave from the blades and the price is very reasonable,  but they ship from out of the country and shipping takes quite a while.  </li>
            <li> These are certainly the best double edge blades that I have tried, and I have sampled quite a few.  </li>
            <li> No other blade compared to the Crystal Platinum blades (my friend tried every blade in the sampler also, and w/o me bringing it up, he said the same thing... that there was no comparison to the Crystals), so I went through 100 of the Crystal&#x27;s, and when it came time to buy more, I thought I&#x27;d try the Feather instead because it had such good reviews</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent months listening to my boss brag about how amazing these blades are.</li>
            <li> I like Gillette brand cases better, but I assume that the individual wrapping of the blades keeps the edges honed longer.  </li>
            <li> I got a good 4 shaves out of this blade do to having a heavy beard the first shave.</li>
            <li> As a first time  DE shaver these were my first pick</li>
            <li> these razors consistently impress me with their accuracy and comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a Double Edge Razor one is supposed to let the weight of the razor do most of the work.</li>
            <li> but I do not feel the need to change the blade more often than every second week or so.</li>
            <li> These just feel like they&#x27;re pulled at my hair from the first stroke.</li>
            <li> My derby extra do a much better job</li>
            <li> Keep in mind, some of the reviewers who discuss the price of the blade will often brag how they can get another brand blade to last 3 weeks or more.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used these blades, my face was bleeding everywhere</li>
            <li> However, the thought of taking out a second mortgage to buy razor blades was not so appealing.  </li>
            <li> The generic blades were okay...</li>
            <li> I get irritation from the first shave on these blades, I only start getting irritation after three or more days with the Derby Extra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> any case, it&#x27;s a decent product and the third-party seller got them to me quickly.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly how I want a shave to feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like many before have written, all razor blades are not the same for every person.</li>
            <li> and of course they gave me the nicks and cuts on those first two shaves.</li>
            <li> Thus, my recommendation is if you know how to shave, but the Feather blades first and be done with it.</li>
            <li> Thus, my recommendation is if you know how to shave, but the Feather blades first and be done with it.</li>
            <li> I am sure you won&#x27;t turn your head back to either Cartridge or electric shaving.</li>
            <li> Love the blades and will be a customer for the next forty years , I HOPE !  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I tried them, and I&#x27;ll use the ones I now have, but when I run out, I&#x27;ll be going back to the Kai blades.&lt;br /&gt;That</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE - Shaved with my first Feather in a vintage Gillette Slim Adjustable -</li>
            <li> Been using this blade consistently for about two years</li>
            <li> When I first started (about 6 months into it)</li>
            <li> Pull the adams apple skin to the side and shave it that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first shave with these blades is like you&#x27;re just wiping the hair off.</li>
            <li> First shave made a believer out of me.</li>
            <li> Yes they get pretty darn close</li>
            <li> you just have to plan ahead and make sure you order well before the blades are actually needed.</li>
            <li> This item (Feather Razor blades) is exactly as described, and well packaged.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price, and it shipped pretty quick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> pretty good blade for a few days of shaving</li>
            <li> I switched back to the 5 bladed disposable head shaving blade system I have used for many years.</li>
            <li> in all, now that I have some confidence into this seller and these blades, I&#x27;m definitely going to be ordering some more.</li>
            <li> It was my first time shaving with a Feather blade</li>
            <li> thanks to Prime!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to Derby Extras, they were more consistent for a weeks use for every blade.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand it myself, you&#x27;d think the sharper they are, the more likely you are to cut yourself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been DE shaving for 2 weeks and didn&#x27;t cut myself the first time using this blade.  </li>
            <li> Like prev reviews have said, you do NOT want this to be the first blade you use.</li>
            <li> First time safety razor user.  </li>
            <li> and I would not start out with them as your first blade.</li>
            <li> , if you order, make sure you factor in enough lead time for processing and delivery.</li>
            <li> The razors were exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> MUCH better than the Derby blades that initially came w/ my Edwin Jagger</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve settled on the Personnas, which are pretty inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;To re-iterate, though, I&#x27;d encourage anyone to try a sampler first.</li>
            <li> Personally, my first passes were butter-smooth and irritation-free.</li>
            <li> Had been using Merkur double edge blades in Merkur and Gillette adjustable razors and the Feather blades are better yet.  </li>
            <li> These blades do cause SLIGHTLY more irritation against the skin from the sharpness, which is most noticeable when I go over hairless part of my face, like the upper cheek (maybe hair lifts the razor slightly above the skin?)  </li>
            <li> Due to them being so incredibly sharp, no pressure is required while shaving, just let the razor glide along and do what it does best, cut hair like it&#x27;s butter.</li>
            <li> Im obviously nit picking:)</li>
            <li> Im never going back to gillette (and similar) razors ever again, I&#x27;ve tried a few and yes the shaving is really close and nice, but so is with a good safety razor and good blades such as this one.</li>
            <li> So far seems to give a good shave for a fairly long time.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Shark super chrome instead.</li>
            <li> wait to get them, but I plan to try some other, more readily available, brands to see if there is an alternative that doesn&#x27;t require as much advance order planning as these.</li>
            <li> they are very sharp and they deliver a very smooth and close shave!</li>
            <li> The blades are super sharp and provide a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> These blades give a marginally better shave than a few of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried, but I don&#x27;t feel that they are significantly sharper or shave more comfortably than lower cost alternatives.</li>
            <li> I was using those fine, but then I saw a few more of these laying around</li>
            <li> A friend said that shipping from Thailand to the US can be cost effective if the shipper uses drop shipping, where the package is combined with other packages as part of a bulk shipment to save money.</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp.</li>
            <li> To be quite honest it&#x27;s been my experience that Derby should get the face chewing warning and trust me; it&#x27;s not because Derby&#x27;s are sharp.  </li>
            <li> Nice and sharp.</li>
            <li> Nice sharp razors.  </li>
            <li> However, to be fair this could have been due to my skin having to get used to the new style of shaving</li>
            <li> It is designed to be super sharp and it sure is.  </li>
            <li> and they still work OK for me, but I like the feeling of that fresh blade on my face--no drag</li>
            <li> And in no time you will be shaving as fast as before only deeper and more</li>
            <li> After years of Gillette blades, most recently the Power Fusion, I decided to try these blades in the Feather Stainless Steel Razor.  </li>
            <li> I just had my first shave with these blades and there is absolutely no&lt;</li>
            <li> I have to do multiple passes to get rid of hairs and it irritated my skin and my skin was becoming even darker as it was adjusting to get the cuts healed.</li>
            <li> Particularly true if you are sensitive to razor burn.</li>
            <li> My manly stubble has felled many less worthy blades.  </li>
            <li> When reading this review, the Crystal Brand isn&#x27;t available anymore, but they are the exact same blade as Israeli Personna, so whenever you read Crystal, you can substitute Israeli Personna...</li>
            <li> Cuts down ( no pun intended)  on the multiple passes for a great shave.</li>
            <li> intend to buy a large stock of Feather blades once these ones run out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have an adjustment curve (especially when one comes from those supermarket multi-bladed contraptions) and it will require both a good shaving soap such as the Crabtree &amp; Evelyn Sienna and a top Double Blade safety razor such as the Feather; however, the end result is well worth it.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cheaper, but not when considering the amount of blades I&#x27;ll go through in a certain amount</li>
            <li> They cut the hair clean off with no drag or hesitation whatsoever.</li>
            <li> These razors are great for those with tough beards.</li>
            <li> Yah they cost a little more but they&#x27;re worth every penny.</li>
            <li> These blades are economical of course but you have to be very careful when shaving with them, they can cut you easily under the jaw line or whenever shaving the neck area.</li>
            <li> These are very aggressive blades.</li>
            <li> They are also much sharper.  </li>
            <li> shipping was fast too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a real shave.</li>
            <li> I really do like this blade.</li>
            <li> , I can only get two comfortable shaves from one blade.</li>
            <li> Item came fast.</li>
            <li> I thought my technique was just off: the shave wasn&#x27;t very close</li>
            <li> really like those too),  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think they are a &amp;#34;wreaking ball&amp;#34; but you do need to be more careful.  </li>
            <li> so I really have to watch what I&#x27;m doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I had to wait much longer than I intended.</li>
            <li> All the forums pointed me to do straight edge razor shave.</li>
            <li> I have never shaved with a straight razor before, however I have no complaints about the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> They arrived unbelievably fast.</li>
            <li> This is more to rate the vendor and the fast service an product expected at a reasonable price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying out straight razor shaving after years of cartridges.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now considering buying a Merkur Slant to get as close as a straight razor shave as I can get.</li>
            <li> That blade may not exist or I may need to switch to a straight razor but its what im looking for</li>
            <li> I save so much money by using these and not the modern razors.</li>
            <li> With the Feathers, I pay 3x as much attention (because I have too), and I still get cut about 10x as much as the Crystals... all for a lower quality shave than I was used to with the Crystals.</li>
            <li> I just received the blades a couple of days ago, so I didn&#x27;t really have a chance to use them until this morning.</li>
            <li> I am not a novice safety razor user and I would advise anyone who is a beginner to use these with caution as they do not require much pressure to nick yourself.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> They are some of the sharpest blades available which actually add to their comfort.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than what I had been using</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have much to compare too though.</li>
            <li> I use a straight razor to shave 90% of the time</li>
            <li> But like anything, if you go too fast and rush, or put too much pressure, then yes, you will probably end up needing a blood transfusion.</li>
            <li> But these.... I don&#x27;t know how much experience I&#x27;m going to need and</li>
            <li> how much pre shave oil and shaving leather</li>
            <li> Just guide the razor&#x27;s head along your face with no pressure against the skin and be rewarded with a close, comfortable shave that needs only 2 passes.  </li>
            <li> Ordered Pacific Shaving Company blade oil to see if it really extends blade life.</li>
            <li> But for anyone who cares about a close shave, Feather brand is a must.sive equipment, and just switching to Razor has made this much of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you are ready for these blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel that these offer a very close shave</li>
            <li> After the first few trips across my face it would be more than willing to attest to that through the blood.</li>
            <li> No matter what safety razor you may wield, you can be assured if you put a Feather in it, you are that much closer to that BBS or DFS all of us are trying to achieve.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It is, after all, the blade itself that is doing the work - safety razors are really just blade</li>
            <li> at least 4 or 5 good shaves out of one blade for a fraction of what those cartridge things cost.</li>
            <li> With the Feathers, almost zero sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a fairly rough beard and kind of sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Sometimes you&#x27;ll get a good sharp blade then the next one out of the package is duller than the one you just replaced.</li>
            <li> Super light and very sharp.</li>
            <li> they really are the sharpest blades, apply a very minimal amount of pressure and you won&#x27;t believe how smooth your face can be!</li>
            <li> This is a unique area of my neck where I get nervous to use a double edge razor.</li>
            <li> Sharp and retains edge for more than one or two face shaves.</li>
            <li> Take off the top layer of skin sharp.</li>
            <li> the negatives made me hesitate for a bit before trying them, it was actually the overwhelming number of positive reviews that finally got me to make the attempt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I felt very comfortable using a safety razor after only a few shaves but had not received my Feather blades in the mail yet</li>
            <li> High quality blades for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> In other words, I get fewer shaves, that are very clean, from one razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife remarked that my face was as smooth two days later as it normally is after a normal shave with Derby-</li>
            <li> A Merkur blade lasts me around 3-4 days before pulling, this blade will last a full 7 days.</li>
            <li> After finding a nice safety razor on Amazon I started using the generic blades from my local grocery store and was puzzled that I couldn&#x27;t find the old Wilkinson Sword or Remington blades I remember from my youth</li>
            <li> Blades have to be sharp or you won&#x27;t get a good shave, these are not &#x27;scary sharp, whatever that means.  </li>
            <li> So, even though they&#x27;re more expensive, they&#x27;re a better value because each blade shaves for much</li>
            <li> What the big boys say is true.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li> shaves out of each blade, not bad when they only cost $0.17 each.</li>
            <li> Make sure you have your shaving technique down</li>
            <li> No need for that little our Vera strip that comes with the those blades or getting stuck all the time when you have too much hair in between too many blades and having to force those hairs out of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very sharp and smooth on the skin!</li>
            <li> Very sharp and not for beginners or aggressive razors, unless your ok with blood.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I notices that the sharper the blade I used, the better the shave and the LESS irritation.  </li>
            <li> so I can make the cut more or less agressive.  </li>
            <li> Shaving with a traditional Double Edge safety razor is an art neglected by most.</li>
            <li> Been using a safety razor as my main shaving instrument for a while.</li>
            <li> Only last about 1 shave each where I had others that lasted more.</li>
            <li> 99R. I have yet to try with my older Mehaz.</li>
            <li> All these years I was a loyal customer to one and only one brand - Gillette Mach 3 cartridges and Gillette foam can for shaving cream .</li>
            <li> Like the blade disposal pocket too, that&#x27;s a clever design</li>
            <li> Now, I understand every face is different and various brands work better for some and not for others.  </li>
            <li> Slowly I increased the aggressiveness of my Progress to get to the coveted BBS (baby butt smooth) shave that is free of irritation and nicks</li>
            <li> Using a duller blade will cause you to go over and over the same area, which will more than likely lead to  a nick or cut.</li>
            <li> he&#x27;s been a Gillette guy from many years and wanted to switch to safety razors, so I read reviews of different products and finally decided to give all these in a shaving kit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather spend the extra few cents a shave and have a really good experience.</li>
            <li> But, with these in it, I can get by with 2 passes, and most likely not have to shave the next night.</li>
            <li> Used many different brands they are the sharpest plus last the longest.</li>
            <li> These are the best double edge razors money can buy - and they aren&#x27;t expensive.</li>
            <li> so one might say that Feathers are 40% sharper than most standard double edge razor blades.</li>
            <li> For anyone thinking about getting into shaving with a classic safety razor, everywhere you look will tell you that feather blades are not for beginners.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They last for several shaves, much more than any Fusion or disposable.</li>
            <li> The only thing that makes using a Feather different than most is the sensitivity of your blade angle.  </li>
            <li> I recommend them highly.</li>
            <li> I tend to feel these are highly over hyped.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this seller, and this brand of blades.</li>
            <li> As close a shave I have ever had with a blade, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these to anyone looking for a high quality blade and a close shave.</li>
            <li> highly recommend getting alum as well since de razors can nick at times.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this blade.</li>
            <li> I am not in military services or neither I am a president, so shaving once in 3 days works perfectly fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;During</li>
            <li> but honestly I dont think these blades are sharp enough.</li>
            <li> There is definitely a lot going for them compared to the Kai&#x27;s; they&#x27;re less money, you can get them through Prime, they come in a cool (and safe) dispenser and it can also be used to dispose of your old blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li> While I do not find it unbelievably super sharp as I have read in so many other reviews, I did find it gave me a VERY CLEAN/SMOOTH shave.</li>
            <li> a blade for a quick shaver, or someone new to double edged safety razor shaving, as these blades demand respect and control.</li>
            <li> This is especially true if you have a tough beard.</li>
            <li> if I hadn&#x27;t tried all the other crappy brands out there I would have rated these a 1 next to the Crystals, but I know these are actually quite a comfortable blade compared to most.</li>
            <li> Ive used: derby, rapira stainless, perm sharp supers, shark super chrome, lord stainless, lord platinum class,</li>
            <li> and I thought I was being careful and light.</li>
            <li> Just be careful and enjoy.</li>
            <li> the Japanese-made Feather razor blades are available for wet shavers.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a shave this close since the old barber shop days where they used a straight razor.</li>
            <li> I had to set my adjustable razor to 4 with these blades, opposed to my normal 8-9.</li>
            <li> After a few months I have gotten used to the sharpness and am now able to turn the setting up to 7 with no problems.  </li>
            <li> initially - but worth sticking with.</li>
            <li> So I guess they are worth the extra cost!</li>
            <li> It normally takes me about 3 shaves to go through a blade.</li>
            <li> Use a good shave oil (thin one, not a thick one like Art of Shaving, because it tends to clog the razor), shave soap, and let the weight of the razor work for you.</li>
            <li> With these especially, shaving cream is a must, but still worth it.</li>
            <li> second blade currently in use on its 3 rd shave and its shaving strong.</li>
            <li> The quality, the lack of nicking yourself, the smoothness that comes with such a sharp blade, made my shave superior and actually decrease the time it took to shave.</li>
            <li> only issue is that these blades cut right on through any imperfections on your face.  </li>
            <li> I have read many of the reviews on these blades both positive and negative,</li>
            <li> I shave with a Murker Classic, and my facial hair is pretty toughnna</li>
            <li> /&gt;I can echo what others have said about a very smooth shave with VERY little irritation.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t imagine I&#x27;ll buy another brand, since these are cheap, sharp, and hold their edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are sharp and require a light touch, but any wetshaving system requires care in terms of pressure used.  </li>
            <li> The steel feels smooth against my skin, and they are razor sharp.  </li>
            <li> So sharp I could use against the hair growth and get a baby butt smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I simply enjoy a brand new everytime i shave, I&#x27;m still saving like 70%+ of what i used to spend on the other type of blades.</li>
            <li> Drop in a new Feather and</li>
            <li> My new De 89 came with a pack of Derby blades.</li>
            <li> New Hi-Stainless blades.  </li>
            <li> Feather razor blades truly live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> They seem to live up to the hype of the reviews.</li>
            <li> I recommend everyone who is new to the DE world to purchase a sampler pack and find a blade that works for their face.  </li>
            <li> I do not recommend these to new users of a safety razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to DE shaving but have yet to have any nick at all with them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting about 7, 3 pass shaves with each blade before I basically decide to go to a new one.</li>
            <li> I would encourage anyone who is trying new razors to get a variety pack and see how you like them before purchasing in quantity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These gave me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had, and they will be my new mainstay from here on out.</li>
            <li> Im relatively new to DE shaving and have experimented around.</li>
            <li> Super sharp, makes your shave much easier.</li>
            <li> I only had to perform 2 passes (with the grain and cross the grain) for a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, since you only have 1 blade, it also means that when you rinse it to get rid of the tiny hairs, it gets rinsed super quick (unlike the multiblade blades which tend to get some hair stuck despite constant flush)</li>
            <li> Since my tester is based on the sharpness of a commonly available standard blade I had to adjust downward the standard 50 gram weight of the instrument&#x27;s measurement piston in order to measure the Feathers.</li>
            <li> They also last longer (At least 5 good shaves for me, versus at tops 3</li>
            <li> I may have had too high an expectation after all the rave reviews I&#x27;d read online, but I&#x27;m tempering that opinion with the fact I&#x27;m far from a shaving</li>
            <li> The Feather razors are much better suited for going against the grain, as they require very little effort to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These blades are very sharp and work fine.</li>
            <li> I used to re-lather, then shave again against the grain with most ordinary blades.</li>
            <li> Recently had my first shave with a safety razor.</li>
            <li> I got them excited at how sharp they&#x27;re supposed to be.</li>
            <li> From the reviews I read I was excited to receive these because of the claims of how sharp they are supposed to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When I first started shaving, I used a double bladed pick blade.</li>
            <li> Always soak your current razor / blade in hot water before using.</li>
            <li> Different blades work better in different razors on different faces.</li>
            <li> These things are super sharp and with patience and a steady hand, you will reap the rewards of a BBS shave.</li>
            <li> Snap in half and use it in the Dovo Shavette handle for fine detail shaving.  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> They work great in my double edge razor and last around 3-4 shaves and I have thick hair.</li>
            <li> Probably worth the long (3 weeks)</li>
            <li> he just love this blades and the price is just unbelievable</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Double edge safety razors continue to blow any modern overpriced razors out of the water!</li>
            <li> they were too harsh for my face causing major razor burn but installed in my micro touch one they worked much better.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp and oiled to stay rust free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a safety razor for a few years now, and I had felt completely happy with my usual Derby HD blades until now.</li>
            <li> so even though sometimes you have to do 2 passes to obtain a close shave (since this razor only has 1 blade, compared to gillete&#x27;s which usually have 3-4 and effectively does 3-4 passes per pass)</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp so be careful!</li>
            <li> Because of this, I have recently switched from using cheap disposable single edge &amp;#34;fusion-type&amp;#34; razors to a new Edwin Jagger De89bl.</li>
            <li> Still a little nervous to try them In the aggressive Merkur Futur, which is not forgiving in the least, but it won&#x27;t be long before I do, and I&#x27;m confident that if I set aside the time, and not rush, I will be thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li> get more cuts with these vs my other blades the first few uses.</li>
            <li> once they dull a bit, I get a better shave with no cuts.</li>
            <li> Super sharp.  </li>
            <li> They are super sharp.  </li>

            <li> I did not have any major cuts, but an occasional nick that amazingly healed in a day or less (presumably because it was so small and clean).</li>
            <li> I decided to start DE shaving using Derby razor blades, which is a decent blade, especially if you&#x27;re new to it.</li>
            <li> With these feather blades I have cut myself many times when the blade will literally get caught in my hair and then break free cutting me.</li>

            <li> So I ordered 20 Feather blades, and was pleasantly surprised to find them to be the sharpest blades I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I use nothing but the old school safety razors these days.</li>
            <li> So far after 5 shaves on the feather and still almost zero pulling...</li>
            <li> Sensitive Skin Pre Shave Cream (also use as post</li>
            <li> On the practical side, the multi-blade razors leave stray hairs in some places (near the nostrils and in the corners of the mouth); these do not.  </li>
            <li> I have to set the razor to 5 to feel that it was &amp;#34;aggressive&amp;#34; enough for me, but once set I did find it did give me a very CLOSE shave without getting a lot (not any to tell the truth)</li>
            <li> I DO like these feathers (so far) however.</li>
            <li> it turns out they missed it by nearly a week.  </li>
            <li> things I will say, I was surprised when the blades arrived from Thailand.</li>
            <li> Derby is by far cheaper.</li>
            <li> Convenient case that holds old blades.</li>
            <li> Definitely made me improve my technique as you really can&#x27;t feel if you&#x27;ve cut yourself.</li>
            <li> but these we&#x27;re the sharpest by far.</li>
            <li> I have used Feather razors with Muhle and Ikon heads, open and closed combs, many different shaving creams and techniques.  </li>
            <li> I use these in my Shaving Factory Double Edge Safety Razor and in my Dovo Shavette straight razor handle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d get at least one, if not two or more, cuts on my face/neck using the Derby blades.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The blades are much better than the Van Der Hagen blades that came with my razor at least.</li>
            <li> Of course nearly everything you read about feather razor blades  </li>
            <li> Recently  I bought an inexpensive  &amp;#34;edge sharpness tester&amp;#34; for my straight razors.</li>
            <li> He told me he wants me to reorder them next time</li>
            <li> my son uses the old style razor blades ans</li>
            <li> Talk about wow</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I&#x27;ve tried Merkur blades direct from the factory, Meijer brand, Shark, and Derby HD.</li>
            <li> So there is a possibility that your fixed safety razor cuts agressively</li>
            <li> But if your into old school shaving, ya gotta try these.</li>
            <li> Actually, that is kind of undeserved.</li>
            <li> Though expensive I have gotten a really good shave from these razors.</li>
            <li> This is the sharpest blade out there, and if you have issues with razor burn or a generally thick beard you will love shaving with a feather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If your new to wet shaving you may want to get them in a sampler pack first to see if they are for you.</li>
            <li> Skinned half of my shin off the first time I used it haha, but its a substantial improvement over the standard-issue Merkur blade that came with my safety razor....</li>
            <li> Good blades, but they seem to dull faster than other blades that I have used (i.e. Shark).  </li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers, I switched to double edge safety razors from Gillette Fusion 5 blades cartridge razors and have never looked back.</li>
            <li> I purchased my brother an entire shave set and a sample pack of blades the other day for his birthday and told him to try the Feather blades after he felt comfortable with his technique.</li>
            <li> I purchased my brother an entire shave set and a sample pack of blades the other day for his birthday and told him to try the Feather blades after he felt comfortable with his technique.</li>
            <li> My beard is full but not super densely packed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a couple shaves, they are more tame and seem much like my other blades.</li>
            <li> love them, no pulling or tugging just clean cutting.</li>
            <li> I first tried Derby blades and also some random blades that came with my razor, but they were just ok.  </li>
            <li> one shortcoming of a feather blade is that it does so quickly and needs to be switched out but compared to mock three mock for Talk five whatever the new razors are, this seems to be a far cheaper choice and obviously less commercial.</li>
            <li> The Feather blades just glided right through my beard, requiring minimal passes for the closest shave ever, with no irritation!  </li>
            <li> I bought a couple of the highly rated blades, and definitely prefer this one.  </li>
            <li> I have tried and used a bunch of different brands and have found that these blades work very well, the sharpest that I have used so far and last the longest.</li>
            <li> My first clean against-the-grain pass in ages resulted in far less injury than any similar attempt with any other razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Razor sharp just got a whole new definition for me.</li>
            <li> My stubble/growth is moderate - and while using the Feather initially is tough (as a new shaver) and prone to nick due to inexperience, its a far superior blade in my experience compared to the Mekur blade.</li>
            <li> just tread carefully on first use, I didn&#x27;t expect that since the Merkur blade was pretty dull by comparison.</li>
            <li> So if you find the shave unbearable try again later with a new blade and see if it is the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Expect cuts you didn&#x27;t feel, especially if you&#x27;re a new transitioner from cartridges.</li>
            <li> I used the Merker blade that came with my razor for about a week before getting my new pack of feather blades in, and I can say that I think the feather are definitely sharper.</li>
            <li> Derby there was always a loud &amp;#34;carbonated drink near my ear&amp;#34; popping as I could hear the individual hairs being cut.</li>
            <li> I used the Dorco blades prior and they are inferior compared to the Feathers, and last much longer.  </li>
            <li> I might look for a mid-grade blade for daily shaving, but this is still cheaper than most disposable cartridges which can clog and have that slow dragging feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Super sharp, no drag with properly lubed face.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to safety razor shaving go slowly, make sure you have a soap that lathers well, use extra protection (i.e.- use baby or olive oil on face after hot water and before soaping) and don&#x27;t press too firmly.  </li>
            <li> Really not as sharp as everyone thinks they are.</li>
            <li> Other times, it&#x27;s exactly what</li>
            <li> They require a little more attention to detail to shave with than other blades.  </li>
            <li> Husband reports very sharp blades, gets a full week of shaving from one on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I would wait however (if you are new to DE shaving) until you have practiced with a few others first</li>
            <li> /&gt;2-There is a rough approximation of blade sharpness (available on various sites online) that you want to match with the COARSNESS of your facial hair, NOT by how much facial hair you have (this point I did not understand until I ventured into DE blades).  </li>
            <li> I usually just clean up my neck area and have no problems with the merkur blades.</li>

            <li> Okay I&#x27;m with a few other posters.  </li>
            <li> They are very smooth and are sharp enough to last you through multiple shaves if stored dry.</li>
            <li> To be completely honest, after seven shaves the Feather New Hi-Stainless blades were still as sharp as the generic ones from the local grocery that were at least twice the price.  </li>
            <li> It might be worth having a few around for special occasions, but probably not worth it for every day, especially if you&#x27;re into double-edge shaving in order to keep the costs down compared to modern cartridges.</li>
            <li> If you are an experienced shaver, then give these bad boys a try.</li>
            <li> It is an amazingly accurate instrument and the sharpness scale that is part and parcel of the instrument is based on the sharpness of an ordinary double edge razor blade and as fate would have it &amp;#34;Astra&amp;#34; razor blades were provided with  the unit to demonstrate the &amp;#34;zero point&amp;#34; of the instrument.</li>
            <li> Generally speaking there is no &amp;#34;free lunch&amp;#34; in the edge sharpness world</li>
            <li> also feel it is necessary to say that many of the negative reviews address different issues</li>
            <li> The only difference is that with this you save a hell of a lot of money compared to the now more common gillette (or similar) blades.</li>
            <li> I was content with my old blades for the last forty years and had no idea of all the options on line.  </li>
            <li> #34;too sharp&amp;#34;, and that you can cut your face up if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was about to give up and go back to my old cartridge razor when I read the reviews on the feathers and made the purchase.  </li>
            <li> Decided to back to the old ways of shaving.</li>
            <li> Have used safety razors for 20 yrs now , these blades are the sharpest and longest lasting so far.</li>
            <li> Took me a couple of years to be able to have enough technique to use them without really irritating my fairly sensitive  skin.</li>
            <li> Not recommended as a first if you&#x27;re recently switching to wet shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly new to double edge safety razors and these are my second blades coming from merkur.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to try a new double edge blade, look no further than these quality feather blades.</li>
            <li> These blades are super sharp and has a safety disposer in the case so you don&#x27;t have loose blades in the trash</li>
            <li> Still way less money than disposable razors, and you&#x27;ll feel the difference on your first pass.</li>
            <li> They are exceptionally sharp and the edge really lasts.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve got a reputation for being sharp, but I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference.  </li>
            <li> I was amazed how much sharper they are than other blades.  </li>
            <li> However, they are ridiculously sharp and do not allow for much error.  </li>
            <li> Any nicks have been due to getting used to shaving with a real razor, not the blades.  </li>
            <li> Having used the Sharp Super Chrome, the Derby and the Wilkenson Swords, I felt I had mastered the art of wet shaving.  </li>
            <li> so I rate them a little higher.</li>
            <li> They took a little getting used to (you get nicks easily at first)</li>
            <li> This one worked great for me, with much less tug than a few others I tried, especially Derby brand, though I have relatively thick hair.</li>
            <li> The old blades left some substantial razor burn, especially after the second pass going against the grain.  </li>
            <li> Just follow your normal wet shaving prep + routine</li>
            <li> I had been so eager with trying out a different DE blades, because I had been using crummy, generic blades from retailers (ahem... major pharmacy chain).  </li>
            <li> This problem does not occur with other blades, just this particular brand.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend if your new to wet shaving.  </li>
            <li> If your new to wet shaving try a Derby or Gilette silvers.  </li>
            <li> If you are new to wet shaving try Merkur or just take your time if you dont</li>
            <li> I knew this going in,  but I was surprised it actually took that long.</li>
            <li> I have not had a single cut so far.</li>
            <li> The steel is ultra thin, yet strong at the same time because I can use it up to  about five or six times in a row before changing.</li>
            <li> You will not likely find a high quality blade like this with such an sharp and durable edge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that the general consensus on Feather blades were they were scary sharp and kind of pricy.</li>
            <li> and it is still sharper than any of my other blades when they were new.</li>
            <li> People said to sharp for new users.  </li>
            <li> The only other DE blade I&#x27;ve tried are the Merkur blades and they work pretty well too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve yet to nick myself while shaving with the Feather&#x27;s, but maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m being really careful as some Amazon reviewers are touting these as some miracle, Japanese steel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In comparison to the crummy blades, the Feather&#x27;s feel like a much thinner blade and last a little longer.  </li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re simply not as wicked sharp as a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a very sharp blade, noticeably more sharp than a Derby or 7O&#x27;Clock green.  </li>
            <li> The blades are a little more stiff than some of the other big wig primo razors, and they don&#x27;t keep their edge as long as some I&#x27;ve tried, but I come back to them when I want to feel baby, baby soft with the closest shave in the universe.</li>
            <li> I am not going to get into whether or not these are the sharpest blades around that is sort of a given, nobody seems to contest that, the good and bad reviews alike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to begin reviewing this item by saying,  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Nothing good or bad just not for me.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend trying these blades in a less aggressive safety razor.</li>
            <li> I have very thick facial hair and have had difficulties with many other blades.  </li>
            <li> These blades are very sharp and don&#x27;t seem to dull easily.</li>
            <li> You, the reader may have a different experience due to the toughness of your beard or from how frequently you shave.</li>
            <li> I bought the hype behind all the 5 star reviews but must say that while yes, they are super sharp for the first shave, shaves from day 2 forward are rough, the blade drags and irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> New double edge shavers may want to start out with Derby or a less aggressive blade and then move to these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t find these to be nearly as unforgiving as other reviewers may suggest</li>
            <li> I have been using a DE blade for about 4 years now due to sensitive</li>
            <li> On the other hand I find really sharp blades to be very forgiving, because they require no pressure, they will cut the hair, all you must do is guide.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found out that the key to wet shaving in general is preparing your face.</li>
            <li> For someone who doesn&#x27;t have thick hair follicles, this slight irritation comes without any benefits (since a duller blade can cut the hair just fine).  </li>
            <li> Like I mentioned earlier in the review, you really need to have your DE shaving technique down for any really sharp blades.  </li>
            <li> I also find that they do not last very long, maybe only 2-3 shaves.</li>
            <li> If you rinse them off after every shave and let them dry, they last for several weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing these might be overkill for people with less extreme hair, but really you just have try different blades until you find one you like.</li>
            <li> I found these no better then a much cheaper shark line of blades?  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it was necessary to wait so long before trying the Feather blades either.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it was necessary to wait so long before trying the Feather blades either.</li>
            <li> Feathers arent as long lasting as sharks</li>
            <li> As another reviewer pointed out, these will cut anything off your face that isn&#x27;t flat (i.e. pimple, razor bump, mole, nose, etc)</li>
            <li> They last a long time as well.</li>
            <li> these are sharper than any blades you have had, so go slow at first until you get the hang of the angle and pressure required.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Those who caution against the feather for new users are a little too nervous.</li>
            <li> You really should have your technique down for ANY of the really sharp blades.  </li>
            <li> so I really need a sharp blade that can hold it&#x27;s edge and this blade has not let me down.  </li>
            <li> If the blade is not sharp enough, the razor can go into the hair follicle but can&#x27;t fully chop the tree down.</li>
            <li> They last and last- a pack of 20 will last over a year if you shave every other day like I do.</li>
            <li> so my facial hair grows out a bit longer, but these blades are sharp and durable enough to withstand multiple uses even on that longer</li>
            <li> Granted, I only tried about three other different brands, but they all left me with irritated skin, razor bumps and weepers.  </li>
            <li> however they dont last very long.</li>
            <li> Very long lasting.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why anyone would waste their time and money on those popular razors with the ungodly expensive refill cartridges that are on the market.</li>
            <li> I was a little red first few times</li>
            <li> If you feel that other brands seem to get noticeably dull while you are first using them, try these!</li>
            <li> use feathers no weekends, or in the am if I only have time for a single pass.  </li>
            <li> My problem is my whiskers are hard as nails and therefore tough to get a super close shave especially in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> The Feathers are a bit sharper than the Astras and Wilkersons that I&#x27;ve been using, and the Feathers last about the same number of shaves as the other blades.</li>
            <li> These razors are simply sharper and last longer than other razors on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was having to make several multiple passes in all directions with the other blades.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Puertorican with thick black hair that grows extremely quick.  </li>
            <li> Is there really a need for a hard plastic &amp;#34;box&amp;#34; to hold 5 blades?  </li>
            <li> While finding double edged safety blades is very simple via Amazon, ordering from HappyMart required a little extra patience...</li>
            <li> imagine also that the Grand Canyon is a dangerous place if you stand too close to the edge.  </li>
            <li> Derby is a distant second</li>
            <li> Not much I can say about it except it became my the only blade company I use.&lt;br /&gt;Had</li>
            <li> My prior experience with double edge razors was through use of a few different cheaper razors i.e., the Gillette adjustable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just gone back to wet shaving.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Merkur 20C Long</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time too.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> BUT you do have to be careful not to go over the same spot too often</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not lush</li>
            <li> So I won&#x27;t dock any stars since they told me it would take that long.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have that problem with the Feathers as long as my angle is sufficient.</li>
            <li> and I have extremely sensitive skin that turns red and looks terrible when I don&#x27;t have a good shave.  </li>
            <li> expensive doesn&#x27;t always mean better, far from it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But that is to be expected when I am doing the equivalent of sawing through a rainforest with a single edge razor (my facial hair is like wire,</li>
            <li> These blades last a long time and they&#x27;re incredibly sharp.</li>
            <li> These razors are really sharp and last a grip.</li>
            <li> They are just too sharp and are not designed for my facial hair.</li>
            <li> Finally I received my Feather blades in the mail, which took about a month to arrive due to shipping from Thailand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a shave from any other blade where I felt the next day that I did not have to shave.</li>
            <li> I would replace a Derby blade every other day, but a Feather will last me a week to 10 days.</li>
            <li> Sharks arent as sharp as feathers but they last a lot longer.</li>
            <li> I reccomend this to everyone, whether veteran de shaver, or novice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be intimidated by how sharp  they are..</li>
            <li> what took multiple passes with other blades&lt;</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any other double edge blades</li>
            <li> Feather seems to have a diabolical reputation as being so sharp that an accident with one might send an unsuspecting shaver to the ER with multiple flesh wounds.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so sharp that when shaving I&#x27;ve sliced off tiny razorbumps</li>
            <li> Sharp but don&#x27;t last mor than one shave.</li>
            <li> Quality design, individually wrapped, incredibly sharp.</li>
            <li> These things are super sharp and thin.</li>
            <li> To the people who noted that this is a sharp razor blade and consider that a negative, I would also like to point out that your front steps can also be very slippery, especially when wet.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been shaving with these for very long</li>
            <li> I have very rough facial hair</li>
            <li> If you are careless, you&#x27;ll get these also with these blades, but with careful shaving these give a smooth, close shave without nicks and burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving them three stars mainly because of the unbelievably slow shipping.  </li>
            <li> Since I am skeptical to switch to straight edge razor and keeping in mind the long religious procedure I have to undergo every time I shave, I took the shortest alternative route which is double edge shaving.</li>
            <li> This is a single package of 10 blades.</li>
            <li> my somewhat limited experience in DE razor</li>
            <li> Makes single blade shaving a pleasure.</li>
            <li> These razors are seriously sharp so be extra careful if you&#x27;re not used to double-edged shaving with a safety razor.</li>
            <li> but when I find myself in a time bind I revert to my dad&#x27;s old safety razor and, usually, Astra blades.</li>
            <li> you loose concentration</li>
            <li> Was immensely let down compared to my derby blades.</li>
            <li> regret spending the money on these, for me, these were a big let down.</li>
            <li> Once I re-learn how to navigate a double edge razor without pressing down, I might achieve that shaving Nirvana.</li>
            <li> With these blades only the lightest touch is needed to mow down whiskers.</li>
            <li> If these last just a week of shaving legs per blade its 5 months of shaving for less than $8.</li>
            <li> The first time I shaved with this blade I had a small blemish on my face that the Merkur blade usually would have never bothered.  </li>
            <li> Handle Black Double Edge Safety</li>
            <li> the 5&#x27;s are suppose to be in a yellow package and the 10&#x27;s in a black..</li>
            <li> I have tried several other brands and none are as sharp as these.</li>
            <li> If you think you&#x27;re man enough to dare and try one of these blades, remember to not put any pressure on it when you shave, just use the weight of the blade or slightly redue the weight of the blade to shave.</li>
            <li> Not only are they sharp but they stay sharp.</li>
            <li> While they ARE very sharp, I have not found them to be dangerous as many reviews suggest.</li>
            <li> Stay sharp for a long time.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t hold their edge quite as long as some other brands</li>
            <li> being a relative newcomer to wet shaving I decided to buy two makes of blade based on previous reviews and experiment, these and the Merkur blades.</li>
            <li> Put this blade into my new razor and started to shave, thought the blade was in wrong and not touching my on the first swipe</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of how much better these could be than other blades I have been using, so I bought this small pack to try.  </li>
            <li> So while the shaving experience overall has improved dramatically, I still end up with little nicks on my face if I have a pimple or two.  </li>
            <li> They are a little sharper, yes, but if you use proper technique, you shouldn&#x27;t have to worry about scraping skin and flesh off your face, as some of these reviews have stated.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find how inconsistent they are - some were so dull, I couldn&#x27;t shave with them.</li>
            <li> I have recently tried persona red in my merkur and they work at least as well for me.</li>
            <li> I have tried a couple of other brands but they didn&#x27;t stay sharp as long as these.</li>
            <li> If I use a blade for the third, fourth or even fifth time (I tried to make it a work week), it loses it edge and will drag and nick on me.</li>
            <li> If you have jumped into the finer arts of shaving, give these blades a try but be warned, be careful.  </li>
            <li> Yes you should be careful.</li>
            <li> On the rare case I cut myself which is like one or 2 careless times</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t drag at all.  </li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and purchase a sample pack in order to try out a few different types.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for 3 years now.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful using them.  </li>
            <li> They will burn if you aren&#x27;t careful.  </li>
            <li> got a 100-blade sampler pack a few years back, and tried every blade in it.</li>
            <li> Just *be careful*  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this with the Shave Secret shaving oil with which you don&#x27;t really seem to need to add shaving cream, the blade does the work.</li>
            <li> Without a doubt theses are the sharpest blades for DE Wet shaving.  </li>
            <li> There should be absolutely no fear of beginners using these blades.  </li>
            <li> As a relative novice, I can&#x27;t use them without destroying my face.  </li>
            <li> No, really.  </li>
            <li> Also will wear out a few days earlier for that reason.&lt;br /&gt;Tier</li>
            <li> although one must be careful with these.</li>
            <li> I started DE wet shaving just after Christmas and was re-learning how to shave.  </li>
            <li> These are allegedly the sharpest blades out there.</li>
            <li> After all the hype, I expected a closer and easier shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different blades.  </li>
            <li> I use the lightest touch imaginable with my razor, paying careful attention to the angle of the shaving head at all times.  </li>
            <li> Be careful.</li>
            <li> Even when I am careful I have still been cut.</li>
            <li> have been into wet shaving with double edge blades for a few years now, have a vintage Gillette Slim and a Merkur Progress (Mergress) with a custom knob.</li>
            <li> about whether to go ATG, or not certain about every aspect of a wet shave, don&#x27;t use these.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is actually quicker  to shave, as you spend less time rinsing!</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are a bit expensive compared to most other decent blades, but they&#x27;re incredibly less expensive than cartridges.  </li>
            <li> I have a tough bread that grows fast, With other blade I would get two or maybe three shaves, with these Feather blades</li>
            <li> Also remember that different razors may have different cutting angles, guards/combs etc, and trying a new razor with a new blade may mean relearning your shaving angles.  </li>
            <li> Most of my nicks are due to impatience or trying to shave using bad technique.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the blades pictured but received the Feather blades in a black and grey package.</li>
            <li> I tested a few other brands of razor blades that I had acquired over the years and found them to be very similar in sharpness to the Astras but then turned my thoughts to Feathers.</li>
            <li> I am a 30 year old Indian male with dark skin and medium tough beard.</li>
            <li> (I will admit the minimal burn is from where I have shaved against the grain on my neck which I don&#x27;t even dare to do with other blades.  </li>
            <li> noting that this is a sharp razor blade and to be careful about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Careful, sharp.</li>
            <li> Other than the week with the other blade, these were the blades I used to learn how to wet shave with.</li>
            <li> Late last year, I was tired of disposal blades and wanted to try a \\&quot;real razor\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Yes, these are sharp blades -</li>
            <li> - they are extremely sharp and take a bit of getting used to.</li>
            <li> almost too sharp to use on the detail work.</li>
            <li> They are sharp of course, but I get a smoother shave than with other double-sided razors I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Feathers give me NO irritation, because theres no resistance, they are so sharp they cut hair without pulling</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shopping around you will probably hear that these Platinum coated FEATHER blades are extremely sharp.</li>
            <li> The feather blades are as sharp as people claim them to be.</li>
            <li> After that I just use what ever other blades I&#x27;ve got on had.</li>
            <li> I felt like these blades were so sharp that my shave was just effortless.</li>
            <li> I was scared off by the reviews of how sharp these feathers are.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re sharp.</li>

            <li> Deadly sharp.</li>

            <li> By the way, I hear KAI blades are also extremely sharp, and being made in Japan like Feather</li>

            <li> but im looking for a blade that is so sharp that people would think i had laser hair removal done on my face.</li>
            <li> IMHO, the feather may actually be safer for the same reason that a sharp knife is safer than a dull knife---you&#x27;re less likely to push too hard.</li>
            <li> I have a safety razor and use these blades to shave almost every other day.</li>
            <li> MY OTHER REVIEWS...</li>
            <li> This is a sharp blade.  </li>
            <li> Almost too sharp.</li>
            <li> On the second pass, I usually shave across or against the grain.</li>
            <li> Feather tugs and pulls, unlike other blades (Wilkinson Sword has no problem).</li>
            <li> I get one shave per edge, and I shave every other day</li>
            <li> This was a part of Christmas gift to my husband with other three items including:&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everything I read said the Feather blades are the sharpest out there (sometimes too sharp for some people).</li>
            <li> They sharp.  </li>
            <li> Sharp sharp sharp.</li>

            <li> They are so sharp , I had to check if I had a blade in my razor.</li>

            <li> Amazingly, ridiculously sharp.  </li>
            <li> I will admit, they are way too sharp a blade for me to handle.  </li>
            <li> I have 5 other name brands in my cabinet</li>
            <li> I would caution that these are extremely sharp blades</li>

            <li> verry sharp will cut u</li>
            <li> But the 4 shaves are ULTRA sharp.  </li>
            <li> If you shaved with Feathers and thought they were sharper than other blades you were correct.</li>
            <li> but they are sharp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of issues with other blades tugging my stubble and just not quite preforming to my preference.</li>
            <li> I used the razor blades - they are really really sharp.</li>
            <li> They are a bit pricier than other options, but nothing seems to work as well as these blades for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Of course, your usage and skin will differ, so consider buying small quantities of multiple brands before buying in bulk.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t do that with any other razor I&#x27;ve tried.</li>

            <li> They&#x27;re certainly sharp.</li>
            <li> If your face has revealed it&#x27;s manhood, you can be trusted with sharp blades.  </li>

            <li> They seem to be really sharp, Which may be why I don&#x27;t like them, no disrespect to the manufacturer, they are just not for me.</li>
            <li> These blades exceeded my expectations and they provide an extremely close shave.</li>
            <li> They are sharp and they don&#x27;t pull or tug on my beard.</li>
            <li> Feathers are SHARP.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The blades are made with precision and let me repeat, SHARP.</li>
            <li> and therefore this blade may be too sharp for your shaving style.  </li>
            <li> If you want an insanely sharp blade, then you need to try these Feathers.</li>
            <li> Oh yea, they are sharp too.</li>
            <li> Extremely sharp blades (so pay attention)</li>
            <li> Samurai sharp</li>
            <li> In other words, fault the safety razor, not the blade.</li>
            <li> Yes, you do have to be careful and have your technique down.  </li>
            <li> It tends to give a slightly closer shave, can handle even two day stubble with no real issues/pulling and retains its edge longer.</li>
            <li> They are all plenty sharp enough to cut the clumsy or over aggressive user.</li>
            <li> The safety razor I use is mild, so I was able to get a close shave without cutting the crap out of my face.</li>
            <li> No right answers on this test.</li>
            <li> My safety razor came with a Merkur blade which stayed sharp for a week and a half before I thought about changing blades.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sharp, and they leave me with less irritation than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a close shave, this blades are dull, they pull the facial hair instead of cut it.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is the paper wrappers are hard to open.</li>
            <li> Finally received about 4 days late and it was because ground mail all the way from Thailand took about a month.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These blades are expensive but I found some cheaper places online where you can buy much cheaper than Amazon.</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t have any expensive equipment, and just switching to Razor has made this much of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I find this oil to be a bit thick, and am currently just using it up)&lt;br</li>
            <li> These blades seem to be love them or hate them.</li>
            <li> I suspect I have thick facial hair as well</li>
            <li> Because of this, you don&#x27;t have to press down at all with the razor - letting the weight of it do all the work.  </li>
            <li> I had to adjust my razor down quite a bit to keep my face intact when switching to Feathers, but in doing</li>
            <li> and they won&#x27;t let you down.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have your technique down, don&#x27;t even bother with these.  </li>
            <li> Now using a blade that has the reputation of being the sharpest on the market, behooves the shaver to get their technique down, or suffer the consequences.</li>
            <li> Yes they are Sharp!.</li>
            <li> They are sharp!</li>
            <li> Incredibly sharp!</li>
            <li> Was a little sketchy about buying them for all the people who say they&#x27;re too sharp or you might cut yourself, but they just glide.</li>
            <li> Sharp is the word!</li>
            <li> have not experienced the problems others have described with being so sharp they are more prone to cutting themselves.</li>
            <li> Get a lot of shaves because of them being sharp!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cut pretty bad by the Feathers, and I&#x27;ve even been cut on the flat of my cheak where I&#x27;ve never been cut by another blade.</li>
            <li> Blades seem a little dull, so one blade only lasts me about one week.</li>
            <li> but they work well and are very sharp.</li>
            <li> Very sharp.</li>
            <li> Very sharp.  </li>
            <li> They have a reputation as being very sharp.</li>
            <li> but I find that they are very sharp and often knick my neck (probably my fault).</li>
            <li> Very sharp razor.</li>
            <li> These are very sharp, precision blades.</li>
            <li> Very sharp blades.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp de blades for the money.  </li>
            <li> As others have noted, these blades are indeed very sharp.</li>
            <li> ...if you&#x27;re looking for a very sharp blade...this is it.  </li>
            <li> Thus, the sharpest the blade the less pressure it will take to achieve that close shave - and the less chance of getting nicked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I experience a lot less irritation with them.</li>
            <li> Even the slight mole on my neck, which I have resigned to just get nicked when I shave has come through unscathed.  </li>
            <li> and I get wayyyyyy less bumps if any.  </li>
            <li> are with much less irritation than I get from these.</li>
            <li> The longer I use the safety razor, the less I cut myself.</li>
            <li> After using the blades, I can say they work as well as the previous ones I bought and the blades say Made in Japan.</li>
            <li> Ordered feather razor blades because previous experience.</li>
            <li> the less likey</li>
            <li> I have crazy sensitive skin and this blade was my last resort.  </li>
            <li> Break in half to use with a shavette as well.</li>
            <li> And they leave me with a slight burn after my shave, which I don&#x27;t get with the Merkur blades.</li>
            <li> To put that in perspective though i would kill a Gillette Mach 3 turbo, vibrating, 5 blade cartridge of doom in about a shave and a half.</li>
            <li> I find I can use less passes, and so my skin is less irritated.  </li>
            <li> these blades are \\&quot;too sharp\\&quot; for your face, I&#x27;d suggest getting a less aggressive safety razor, rather than going for a duller blade.</li>
            <li> This is a no pressure shaving blade,press down just a little</li>
            <li> I must admit, I was a little apprehensive about trying these out, due to all the comments about their sharpness!  </li>
            <li> First let me say that if you were like me, you are eager but afraid to try these blades out.  </li>
            <li> I am a little suspicious however about how this very sharp edge will hold up under use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a very coarse or particularly heavy beard, but my hair does grow weird in all directions, especially on my neck area and chin.  </li>
            <li> I was a little afraid to try these blades, as I have heard they are so sharp, they can be rough on you if you are new to DE shaving.  </li>
            <li> After a few times you&#x27;ll have it down.</li>
            <li> all comments like this blade is too dull for me, this one is too sharp and cut my face...and don&#x27;t be discouraged to use sharp blades.  </li>
            <li> there is any negative, it is that these are really sharp -- really really sharp.  </li>
            <li> these blade are real sharp.</li>
            <li> I know this brand is a trusted name and takes no shortcuts (little blade humor).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m doing some little product testing all the time but</li>
            <li> a little bit of glue from the packaging smear on the blade, but not allways</li>
            <li> #34;How little pressure can I apply?&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Part of that might be due to excessive pressure being applied to the razor when shaving.</li>
            <li> Purchased these blades bases on the reviews and thought I would save a little money.  </li>
            <li> Once you get the motions down and have a little experience with the process, there&#x27;s no better choice than switching to these Feather razors.</li>
            <li> Seriously destroy me face.</li>
            <li> from the wife when I started wet-shaving a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> I use these razors everyday to shave before work.</li>
            <li> and I had uneven</li>
            <li> Buy some of a few brands and see what works for you.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve probably sampled a few others that slip my mind.</li>
            <li> I had trouble shaving before now</li>
            <li> But get a few months of experience under your belt and you can handle these.</li>
            <li> Note I shave my head and face everyday.</li>
            <li> Like using a sharp knife, a sharp razor blade eliminates the need to press down or use any unnecessary force.  </li>
            <li> Very Sharp!</li>
            <li> Very sharp!</li>
            <li> Very sharp!</li>
            <li> These razors are very sharp!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to this type of shaving and was somewhat disappointed with shave the merkur blade gave and was about to switch back to my disposable razors again when i decided to try another brand of blades.</li>
            <li> I have read where others have a hard time with how sharp these blades are and that they get all chopped up.</li>
            <li> (ie each hair is thick but they are spread out from each other).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them in my agressive and tame razors and I have to say I have never gotten a smoother shave.</li>
            <li> And I mean sharp.  </li>
            <li> They are ninja sharp, and unless you are used to a safety razor, start in the shallow end and get some Derby blades.  </li>
            <li> Just a little shocking after so many 2 day shipments</li>
            <li> There is something atavistic in putting raw blade to your face every morning.</li>
            <li> They scrape your face leaving it raw and exposed.</li>
            <li> I got a sample pack with some Feather blades and with these I must have nicked myself about 5 - 7 times and my face was nearly raw after each shave.</li>
            <li> These blades had a lot of hype to live up to, and I have to say I wasn&#x27;t disappointment.</li>
            <li> So, the bottom line is don&#x27;t be afraid to try out these blades, even if you&#x27;re new to DE shaving.  </li>
            <li> These were crazy stupid good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to shaving with a safety razor, and have had very few problems cutting myself with these.  </li>
            <li> and you are nicking yourself very little.</li>
            <li> Just be forewarned.. they are oh so sharp!!!</li>
            <li> To much pressure or a bad angle</li>
            <li> There is no better blade on the market.  </li>
            <li> I have been using these razors exclusively for the past 6 months now.</li>
            <li> It was the usual $7 for a horrible stainless steel blade that barely lasts for 1 shave.</li>
            <li> I did not have a case or small zipper bag for my razor</li>
            <li> but I find them no better, even inferior to than the Derby blades that I get for like $0.08 each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ill use Feather occasionally</li>
            <li> These blades are sharper than the Derby and Astra blades I usually use.  </li>
            <li> I usually do but the grain on my neck basically swirls</li>
            <li> I usually get 4 days out of a blade, I&#x27;ve pushed it to 7</li>
            <li> Tried these solely because of past experience in a jumbo variety bag of DE razors.</li>
            <li> They are by far the smoothest cutting blades I&#x27;ve sampled and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what everyone is warning about.</li>
            <li> I had about 9 small cuts in my neck as soon as I was done using these.</li>
            <li> This week I loaded a Feather from the pack that had been sitting in the medicine cabinet for the past month, checked my health insurance coverage and started</li>
            <li> I could never safely make an against-the-grain pass on my neck.</li>
            <li> After using two packages of blades, the shave is no better than my Gillete Sensor.</li>
            <li> These are by far, the sharpest and cleanest cutting blades around.</li>
            <li> One small mistake has you reaching for the tissue.</li>
            <li> was using the Merkur blades that came with my Merkur razor, and these seem to stand up just as well if not better.</li>
            <li> will buy these again and will recommend these to the very few friends that shave.</li>
            <li> All I have to say is &amp;#34;WOW!!&amp;#34; I was cutting through 3 days of growth (average thickness) and these blades cut through it like nothing with no skin irritation and I managed to walk away with only 1 knick (just below my nose) where I pushed the edge of the blade in too hard while placing it under my nose.</li>
            <li> Feathers are almost scary sharp, but they are also not terribly smooth.  </li>
            <li> Started out with a Derby blade, after a poor first pass i was very disappointed with the amount of irritation and hair left on my face.</li>
            <li> Using the cartridge blades was never very pleasant with a 3-4 day growth.  </li>
            <li> Dull blade with thick hair give much worse irritation than sharp blade with thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I use these almost every morning - I can get 2-3 shaves with each side of the blade before it gets annoyingly dull.</li>
            <li> - so its a hard blade to shave with</li>
            <li> This in turn prevents you from slicing up your face to compensate for dull blades.  </li>
            <li> Hardly ever &#x27;ve managed to cause bleeding or irritation with Feathers.</li>
            <li> For my face, I find these hard to beat.</li>
            <li> In fact I&#x27;d wager I cut myself with those because they were dull after 1/2 my face</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that they get dull</li>
            <li> For me, they cut cleaner compared to others I&#x27;ve used (Merkur, Personna, Derby, and Astra) but do seem to dull a bit faster.</li>
            <li> They may start out with a sharper, finer edge, but they dull faster and have to be replaced sooner.  </li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t for the fact that I could hear the blade cutting hair I couldn&#x27;t tell that blade was actually shaving (in some areas).  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re just starting out, don&#x27;t be afraid.</li>
            <li> That experience was not good - and usually resulted in my face looking like I had used it to stop an electric fan.  </li>
            <li> In the same way, I imagine that it would be dangerous to stab yourself with a samurai sword.  </li>
            <li> Of late, I started noticing razor burns in my neck and chin</li>
            <li> sucks</li>
            <li> The blades last a few shaves (I have nasty thick facial hair and tend to nick blades like Gillette Fusion cartridges).</li>
            <li> No matter how thick of a lather or</li>
            <li> I have a thick beard, but these slide through it with zero force.  </li>
            <li> I knew I had thick hair on my head because the barber always gets sweaty trying to cut it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been reluctant to try these, as I can be a little sloppy or in a rush sometimes, but they&#x27;re a lot easier to work with</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp and do not nick or cut my skin unless I use them at the wrong angle.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews about how scary sharp they were, so I had to try some.  </li>
            <li> and they always point out how hard it is too cut (it has broken scissors in the past).  </li>
            <li> These are serious razors.</li>
            <li> Seriously, they cut hair like butter.</li>
            <li> NOT TRUE!!!  </li>
            <li> It is also possible (as with any brand) that you have just gotten a bad blade.  </li>
            <li> I am sorry to say that I wasted $6 for this junk.</li>
            <li> Crazy sharp!</li>
            <li> I have a tough beard and after using these blades I&#x27;ll use no others.  </li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m just a perfectionist with a tough beard.beard.</li>
            <li> I guess my beard is just too tough.  </li>
            <li> I read about people cutting their faces up all over the place with DE razors, and especially with Feather blades, but I wonder what the heck they are doing so wrong because I don&#x27;t find this to be at all difficult.</li>

            <li> Scraping with the feather is both unnecessary and</li>
            <li> I have to play a game when I use them: &amp;</li>
            <li> Some blades worse than others.</li>
            <li> I ordered these after being disappointed with some other brands like the Wilkinson Sword blades.  </li>
            <li> I have used a variety of their other products and never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> seriously, these feathers make merkur look like the bottom of a chicken coop.  </li>
            <li> Before getting into the world of Safety Razor shaving I read a lot of review regarding razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;Being a woodworker I know that using a dull blade or cutting tool can lead to poor quality products and is dangerous for the operator.  </li>
            <li> Night and day compared to the crap I typically buy at CVS.</li>
            <li> Now, compare that to the cost of shaving with those flashy and overhyped</li>
            <li> Well sorry</li>
            <li> unfortunately, after trying for a month to make a safety razor work with my face, I can&#x27;t get the system to work for me.  </li>
            <li> It is for the lousy seller -</li>
            <li> And do they need to be wrapped in plastic with a pull string that is difficult to find the end of without my glasses?  </li>
            <li> Yes...they are expensive.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let that shy you away.</li>
            <li> I suspect alot of reviews posted here are fake as these so clled blades are not even a par with the cheapest products found in the the US.</li>

            <li> be afraid of feather razors.</li>
            <li> The feather blades are even smoother cutting than the Merkur.</li>
            <li> and she uses Feather blades for her razor cutting, so</li>
            <li> Maybe not for the rookie, but nothing to be afraid of once you&#x27;ve honed your technique for a while.</li>
            <li> disappointed with the difficulty of drawing the blade across the skin and the easiness of cutting myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I bought these after having a bad experience with another seller and the Bic blades.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s cheap!&lt;br /&gt;It shaves my ugly mug without leaving stubble</li>
            <li> hate the case on these though.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> There is no better blade on the market.  I just had my first shave with these blades and there is absolutely no&lt;br /&gt;comparison.  They are incredible.</li>
            <li> 20 blades for about the same price as no-name house blades at CVS or Walgreens. That&#x27;s a no-brainer choice. I just switched to a safety razor, and on-line reviews I read recommended the Feather brand blades. Having used them for a couple weeks now, I like them, and will probably be buying more of them.</li>
            <li> Crazy sharp! Worth the money!</li>
            <li> Shipping took awhile but the product is solid</li>
            <li> These are very aggressive blades. I found the derby blades to give me just as close a shave a bit more comfortably.</li>
            <li> get a better shave than a cheap razor</li>
            <li> get more cuts with these vs my other blades the first few uses. once they dull a bit, I get a better shave with no cuts. lasts up to two weeks.</li>
            <li> Good sharp blade. I prefer Astras more though</li>
            <li> I use these almost every morning - I can get 2-3 shaves with each side of the blade before it gets annoyingly dull. Yes, these are sharp blades - if you&#x27;re using a double edged razor, that is what you want!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you cut yourself with your double edged razor, you&#x27;re probably used to shaving with cartridge razors, which require pressure - a double edged razor should glide across your happy face, trimming the happy whiskers away smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then you can put your happy aftershave on and walk away... satisfied. (HA! Gotcha.)</li>
            <li> These blades work well, but go easy on your first use - they are extremely sharp and take a bit of getting used to.</li>
            <li> Excellent Items, Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> These blades are much better quality than the ones I got with my Merkur safety razor.  They are also much sharper.  If you are looking for replacement blades for any safety razor, I would recommend these.</li>
            <li> I have been using these razors exclusively for the past 6 months now. I recently went on a trip and only took carry-on so I was subjected to whatever blade I could find at the local pharmacy. It was the usual $7 for a horrible stainless steel blade that barely lasts for 1 shave. It was the 1st time in quite awhile I had to go without the Feather Hi-Stainless blades. This is the experience that sparked this review. I have never had a closer shave than I get with these blades. I used to re-lather, then shave again against the grain with most ordinary blades. That is until I discovered these. They just slice thru the stubble so cleanly and nick free. Just be forewarned.. they are oh so sharp!!! I had to set my adjustable razor to 4 with these blades, opposed to my normal 8-9. After a few months I have gotten used to the sharpness and am now able to turn the setting up to 7 with no problems.  These razors also hold an edged better than Merkur, Wilkinson, etc..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was such a relief to return home to these blades... my face is back to that oh so smooth and nick free feeling.</li>
            <li> they make box cutters look dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;seller also included a gratis magazine of another brand of blades.  shipping was fast too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but seriously, these feathers make merkur look like the bottom of a chicken coop.  almost too sharp to use on the detail work.</li>
            <li> Very good blade, not what I excepted.</li>
            <li> No doubt about it, these blades are among the sharpest available. They also are at the very top of the cost spectrum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple shaves, they are more tame and seem much like my other blades. So is it worth paying two or three times the price to have a sharper blade for 2 out of 7 days?  Only you can decide that.  It might be worth having a few around for special occasions, but probably not worth it for every day, especially if you&#x27;re into double-edge shaving in order to keep the costs down compared to modern cartridges.</li>
            <li> being a relative newcomer to wet shaving I decided to buy two makes of blade based on previous reviews and experiment, these and the Merkur blades. My stubble/growth is moderate - and while using the Feather initially is tough (as a new shaver) and prone to nick due to inexperience, its a far superior blade in my experience compared to the Mekur blade. It tends to give a slightly closer shave, can handle even two day stubble with no real issues/pulling and retains its edge longer. A Merkur blade lasts me around 3-4 days before pulling, this blade will last a full 7 days. It takes some getting used to - so its a hard blade to shave with initially - but worth sticking with.</li>
            <li> These blades are great. They are very smooth and are sharp enough to last you through multiple shaves if stored dry. I recommend them highly.</li>
            <li> I have only been using a DE safety razor for about 6 months or so. I was using Kroger blades, but decided to give these a try for something sharper/thinner. So far, so good! These blades give me a great, close shave.</li>
            <li> I like these best.  They are sharp of course, but I get a smoother shave than with other double-sided razors I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate the case on these though.  Each individual blade is wrapped individually and not held inside by anything.  This means, the wrapped blades can fall out in your dopp kit.  Used blades go in a slot on the back and they stay in place though.  I like Gillette brand cases better, but I assume that the individual wrapping of the blades keeps the edges honed longer.  Whatever the reasons, these give me best shaves in my double-sided razor.</li>
            <li> Ok so to debunk the hype about feather razors. Yes they are Sharp!. No they wont knick your face if you dont shave aggressively or quickly. Also keeping the angle right will help. I love these razors. It is what I expect from a Japanese product. Though expensive I have gotten a really good shave from these razors. I do advise to do a pre-shave oil or pre-shave regime before shaving with any good quality blade including this one. That will prevent the blade from nicking and causing skin irritation. I got a good 4 shaves out of this blade do to having a heavy beard the first shave. second blade currently in use on its 3 rd shave and its shaving strong. You&#x27;ll get prob 4-7 shaves per blade depending on your skin, pre-shave regime, and your facial hairs toughness.&lt;br /&gt;Dont be afraid of feather razors. As a first time  DE shaver these were my first pick and I dont regret it. And I am a novice at this type of shaving!</li>
            <li> You will not likely find a high quality blade like this with such an sharp and durable edge.</li>
            <li> I noticed with this thing my skin wasn&#x27;t looking too good, so I switched to Gillete 7 o clock razors. I was using those fine, but then I saw a few more of these laying around so I wanted to use them and just get them out of the way. That was a mistake because now I know why my face wasn&#x27;t looking good before, the razor burn with this is TERRIBLE. I have no problem when using my Gillete 7 o clock razors with my merkur. Anyway, just thought I&#x27;d let everyone know my experience with this product. I have neosporin on my face now to heal quickly.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and smooth on the skin!</li>
            <li> Well deserved reputation for being the sharpest blade you can get. Use a very light touch, short strokes and fewer and you&#x27;ll be fine. Took me a couple of years to be able to have enough technique to use them without really irritating my fairly sensitive  skin.</li>
            <li> These razors are really sharp and last a grip.</li>
            <li> These are the best blades.</li>
            <li> I got my start shaving with Gillette Rubie and Sputnik blades (two brands, same blade really) when I lived in Russia.  I was always impressed by the smoothness of the shave but disappointed with the difficulty of drawing the blade across the skin and the easiness of cutting myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naturally, I was apprehensive after reading all the reviews of super-sharp blades.  I figured I&#x27;d slice my nose off.  However, I&#x27;ve found that these sharper blades not only give a better, more even, longer lasting shave, but they also draw across the skin more easily, reducing cuts (assuming you get a good lather).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I intend to buy a large stock of Feather blades once these ones run out.  I recommend them to any person who wants to shave with one blade - experienced or newbie.  Very worth it.  It&#x27;s a real shave.</li>
            <li> from a surgical blade company out of japan.  these razors consistently impress me with their accuracy and comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not a blade for a quick shaver, or someone new to double edged safety razor shaving, as these blades demand respect and control.</li>
            <li> Recently had my first shave with a safety razor. Started out with a Derby blade, after a poor first pass i was very disappointed with the amount of irritation and hair left on my face. Made switch to a Feather, never looked back.&lt;br /&gt;Feathers give me NO irritation, because theres no resistance, they are so sharp they cut hair without pulling it.&lt;br /&gt;FEATHER HI-STAINLESS has gained a loyal customer here.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found a better blade yet.  My manly stubble has felled many less worthy blades.  Derby is a distant second and then Astra after that.  If you feel that other brands seem to get noticeably dull while you are first using them, try these!</li>
            <li> If you use a double-edged razor for shaving, then this is the ONLY razor you should be buying. It is the sharpest and most comfortable blade made, and the price is all but identical to any competitors.</li>
            <li> Shaving with a traditional Double Edge safety razor is an art neglected by most. There is something atavistic in putting raw blade to your face every morning. And when it comes to making blades, the Japanese are still unsurpassed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shopping around you will probably hear that these Platinum coated FEATHER blades are extremely sharp. Yes they are. They are the sharpest. By far. And that is a very good thing.&lt;br /&gt;When shaving with a Double Edge Razor one is supposed to let the weight of the razor do most of the work. Thus, the sharpest the blade the less pressure it will take to achieve that close shave - and the less chance of getting nicked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It depends on one&#x27;s bristles but I do not feel the need to change the blade more often than every second week or so. This is a single package of 10 blades. I bought the 3-pack. Thus, these 30 blades will probably last me well over 6 months. Now, compare that to the cost of shaving with those flashy and overhyped Gillettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have an adjustment curve (especially when one comes from those supermarket multi-bladed contraptions) and it will require both a good shaving soap such as the Crabtree &amp; Evelyn Sienna and a top Double Blade safety razor such as the Feather; however, the end result is well worth it. And in no time you will be shaving as fast as before only deeper and more satisfying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Treat yourself to the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WITH MY HIGHEST RECOMMENDATIONS!</li>
            <li> I really do like this blade. The feather blades are as sharp as people claim them to be. But (yeah, there is a but), I can only get two comfortable shaves from one blade. If I use a blade for the third, fourth or even fifth time (I tried to make it a work week), it loses it edge and will drag and nick on me. So, what I do, is use them for Monday when my beard has grown in over the weekend and on Tuesday. After that I just use what ever other blades I&#x27;ve got on had. You, the reader may have a different experience due to the toughness of your beard or from how frequently you shave. It is a good blade, but they are only good for two shaves, for me anyway.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent months listening to my boss brag about how amazing these blades are. These blades had a lot of hype to live up to, and I have to say I wasn&#x27;t disappointment. I felt like these blades were so sharp that my shave was just effortless. I only had to perform 2 passes (with the grain and cross the grain) for a smooth shave. These blades complimented my Edwin Jagger DE89LBI.</li>
            <li> these blade are real sharp. one would expect the best shave ever. I shave wtg. xtg and atg with this blade and didnt nick or cut myself. well ofcouse i was extra careful.&lt;br /&gt;i would buy the 100 pack once i run out of this.</li>
            <li> Item came fast. Great blades. Stay sharp for a long time.</li>
            <li> For ladies, this is an excellent blade for shaving legs and underarms. My safety razor came with a Merkur blade which stayed sharp for a week and a half before I thought about changing blades. The feather blades are even smoother cutting than the Merkur. If these last just a week of shaving legs per blade its 5 months of shaving for less than $8. Never buying another Venus razor again!</li>
            <li> From my experience, these are the best blades out there.  They are exceptionally sharp and the edge really lasts.  I love these blades.  They were shipped super fast and packaged almost too well.  If you have jumped into the finer arts of shaving, give these blades a try but be warned, be careful.  They are sharp!</li>
            <li> Just can&#x27;t beat these.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite razor blade but they work well and are very sharp.</li>
            <li> I tend to feel these are highly over hyped. I got them excited at how sharp they&#x27;re supposed to be. Was immensely let down compared to my derby blades. These just feel like they&#x27;re pulled at my hair from the first stroke. My derby extra do a much better job and I experience a lot less irritation with them. With these feather blades I have cut myself many times when the blade will literally get caught in my hair and then break free cutting me. No matter how thick of a lather or what angle I use I can&#x27;t get these to work well for me. Seriously destroy me face. I will not be giving these another shot. Not even the remaining blades I have left.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different razor blades for use with my Merkur Safety Razor and the Feather razor blades are the best that I have tried.  Using this blade, my razor and Proraso shaving soap, I can achieve a close shave that doesn’t leave my skin irritated.</li>
            <li> First let me say that if you were like me, you are eager but afraid to try these blades out.  I am not going to get into whether or not these are the sharpest blades around that is sort of a given, nobody seems to contest that, the good and bad reviews alike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to begin reviewing this item by saying,  \\&quot;if you are sampling blades to find the one that gives the most comfortable shave, I do believe you need to try these.\\&quot;  I would wait however (if you are new to DE shaving) until you have practiced with a few others first (where you rarely nick yourself).  You really should have your technique down for ANY of the really sharp blades.  I have read many of the reviews on these blades both positive and negative, the negatives made me hesitate for a bit before trying them, it was actually the overwhelming number of positive reviews that finally got me to make the attempt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say there is a reason for the number of reviews on these blades.  They are amazing!!!  I have never had a smoother shave, not just in how it cuts but how the blade glides over the skin.  If it wasn&#x27;t for the fact that I could hear the blade cutting hair I couldn&#x27;t tell that blade was actually shaving (in some areas).  I believe that I have pretty good shaving technique and I have yet to suffer a nick with this blade (knock on wood).  Even the slight mole on my neck, which I have resigned to just get nicked when I shave has come through unscathed.  My face feels great, minimal to no burn (I will admit the minimal burn is from where I have shaved against the grain on my neck which I don&#x27;t even dare to do with other blades.  This is now my go to blade.  My search for my best blade has ended here. Of course everyone&#x27;s best blade may be different I do believe this is a blade to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also feel it is necessary to say that many of the negative reviews address different issues, that may or may not apply to every user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Price.  While in relation to other DE blades feathers are indeed costlier, in relation to Cartridges, they are incredibly inexpensive.  I just saw a pack of 8 fusion cartridges at a popular discount retail chain for about $28.  My feeling on this is just a matter of priority.  If you are looking for the best shave possible, this may be the blade for you.  Keep in mind, some of the reviewers who discuss the price of the blade will often brag how they can get another brand blade to last 3 weeks or more.  I think that speaks for itself, I have never had any blade that was good for more than a week, and pushing it at that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Butchering the face while shaving.  Like I mentioned earlier in the review, you really need to have your DE shaving technique down for any really sharp blades.  To much pressure or a bad angle and I can see these blades doing some damage.  On the other hand I find really sharp blades to be very forgiving, because they require no pressure, they will cut the hair, all you must do is guide.  Also remember that different razors may have different cutting angles, guards/combs etc, and trying a new razor with a new blade may mean relearning your shaving angles.  Shave preparation is also very important in getting a clean, close comfortable shave so please keep that in mind as well.  It is also possible (as with any brand) that you have just gotten a bad blade.  So if you find the shave unbearable try again later with a new blade and see if it is the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a list of what I am using at the time of this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.

            <li> These blades have worked great for me, I get really close shaves using these in my setup. I get about 3-4 days worth of shaves out of each blade, not bad when they only cost $0.17 each.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Derbys for about a year and decided to upgrade. The first time I used these blades, my face was bleeding everywhere and I didn&#x27;t even notice until after I finished. The second and third time, I was much more careful and got the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had in my life.</li>
            <li> I started out using Derby blades when I converted to DE Safety Razor. I thought my technique was just off: the shave wasn&#x27;t very close and I nicked my skin more often than I wanted. I was scared off by the reviews of how sharp these feathers are. But they are very popular and customers swear by them. I took the plunge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never look back. These have changed my entire safety razor shaving experience. A much closer shave, my skin is so healthy and smooth, and I rarely cut myself! I guess you have to find the best razor for you, and the thousands of reviews don&#x27;t lie: the feathers are simply the best. Will never try another blade again. Match made in heaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes they&#x27;re sharp. Yes you should be careful. I did not have a case or small zipper bag for my razor and I accidentally cut my finger very badly when I put my hand in my toiletry bag.</li>
            <li> Not much I can say about it except it became my the only blade company I use.&lt;br /&gt;Had tried Derby, Astra, But will stay with Feather.&lt;br /&gt;About myself - using safety blades since 1977, experienced Russian, Iranian, Turkish, Czech, Bulgarian, Polish and some others. Feather beats them all. Try it , you won&#x27;t regret.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with a safety razor for years and have tried just about every blade out there. Astra&#x27;s, Derby&#x27;s, Sharks, drug store brands etc.. you just can&#x27;t beat the sharpness and consistency of a Feather. Yah they cost a little more but they&#x27;re worth every penny. My experiences with other brands has shown consistency to be the biggest issue. Sometimes you&#x27;ll get a good sharp blade then the next one out of the package is duller than the one you just replaced. Drop in a new Feather and you know you&#x27;re going to get a great shave every time!</li>
            <li> Very sharp. Best blades I have bought.</li>
            <li> The Feathers are a bit sharper than the Astras and Wilkersons that I&#x27;ve been using, and the Feathers last about the same number of shaves as the other blades. The Feathers aren&#x27;t heads and shoulders better than my go-to Wilkersons, so although I might buy some more Feathers every now and then just to change things up, I&#x27;ll probably stick with Wilkersons as my main blades.</li>
            <li> After shaving with high quality electric razors for most of my life I decided to take another shot at using a blade (and hoping they wouldn&#x27;t rip my face apart like in my teens).  However, the thought of taking out a second mortgage to buy razor blades was not so appealing.  After finding a nice safety razor on Amazon I started using the generic blades from my local grocery store and was puzzled that I couldn&#x27;t find the old Wilkinson Sword or Remington blades I remember from my youth (yes, I&#x27;m that old).  The generic blades were okay... at best.  Looking for something a little better, I began prowling Amazon and found good reviews for the Feather New Hi-Stainless.&lt;br /&gt;WHAT A DIFFERENCE!  No nicks, no cuts, and a very, very smooth shave.  Most of the reviews and answers to questions indicated that the Feather New Hi-Stainless blades were good for four, maybe five shaves - I am getting six or seven shaves from each blade.  To be completely honest, after seven shaves the Feather New Hi-Stainless blades were still as sharp as the generic ones from the local grocery that were at least twice the price.  I&#x27;m a convert and look forward to placing my next order.</li>
            <li> Husband reports very sharp blades, gets a full week of shaving from one on a daily basis. He changes them every Sunday but, could probably go longer if needed.</li>
            <li> These have worked out amazingly well.  I don&#x27;t imagine I&#x27;ll buy another brand, since these are cheap, sharp, and hold their edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t run into any of the concerns/worries other reviewers did.  If you&#x27;re just starting out, don&#x27;t be afraid.</li>
            <li> These razors are one of my favs. Works great with Merkur, and are a great deal. Spend the extra money and buy the best.</li>
            <li> Deadly sharp. Use caution but know that you&#x27;ll get an awesome shave.</li>
            <li> These are great but they are super sharp,  like the sharpest you can get.  If you have sensitive skin like I do they are overkill and will iratate your skin.  Wilkinson sword is more middle road and work great and I get wayyyyyy less bumps if any.  On the rare case I cut myself which is like one or 2 careless times the wilkinson isn&#x27;t bad.  But if you have a leather skinned face and steel hairs feather might be what you need.  But too sharp for me.</li>
            <li> Before I ordered these I read all the reviews. I am used to using the Derby Extra blades. From the reviews I read I was excited to receive these because of the claims of how sharp they are supposed to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I regret spending the money on these, for me, these were a big let down. I will use them since they&#x27;ve been bought and paid for but I find them no better, even inferior to than the Derby blades that I get for like $0.08 each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all honesty I don&#x27;t see that these are any sharper than the Derby blades and the shaves I get from the Derby blades are with much less irritation than I get from these. I get irritation from the first shave on these blades, I only start getting irritation after three or more days with the Derby Extra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More expensive doesn&#x27;t always mean better, far from it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To each his own, what works for me may not work at all for you...</li>
            <li> These are the best blades I&#x27;ve found, but be warned! These blades are NOT for the newbies! They are ninja sharp, and unless you are used to a safety razor, start in the shallow end and get some Derby blades.  If you are an experienced shaver, then give these bad boys a try.</li>
            <li> In accordance with an agreement with my wife to stay clean-shaven, I&#x27;m doing it every morning now.  Thus, a shopping trip for better accoutrements.  Feather brand blades were included with the safety razor as a gift (hint?) from the wife when I started wet-shaving a few years ago.  They&#x27;ve got a reputation for being sharp, but I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference.  Sure, they&#x27;re better than the store brand I was buying at Wegmans (the only one offered amongst a wall of disposables), but not superlatively so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some googling brings up reviews suggesting the blades are good for 3-4 shaves, so maybe I&#x27;m using them after their peak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, it&#x27;s a decent product and the third-party seller got them to me quickly.  I&#x27;ll probably try another well-reviewed blade next time.</li>
            <li> These are great blades.</li>
            <li> I use these razors everyday to shave before work. They deliver a close smooth shave every day! Each blade lasts about 4 to 5 days. Give these blades a chance!</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best and sharpest blades you can find.  I use them exclusively.</li>
            <li> these really are the best blades available. I use others that are cheaper (astra -i really like those too),  but if you want the closest shave, and KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING (don&#x27;t use these if you are a novice), you&#x27;ll love these.</li>
            <li> These were crazy stupid good. Night and day compared to the crap I typically buy at CVS.</li>
            <li> Very Sharp! Use light pressure. I was a little red first few times and I thought I was being careful and light. A variety pack really helps you decide which is best for your face. I like Asco and Big Ben blades.  Ill use Feather occasionally, good blades though.</li>
            <li> Took a while for the order to get to me, but arrived about a week earlier than stated arrival date.  These blades are sharper than the Derby and Astra blades I usually use.  I can get about 5 good shaves out of one.</li>
            <li> Awesome and unbelievably sharp so give these blades the respect they deserve and be careful!</li>
            <li> Razor sharp just got a whole new definition for me. Been using a safety razor as my main shaving instrument for a while. My razor came with some &amp;#34;Shark&amp;#34; blades which were ok, but when i ran out i gave these a try, and i must say these are fantastic. Im never going back to gillette (and similar) razors ever again, I&#x27;ve tried a few and yes the shaving is really close and nice, but so is with a good safety razor and good blades such as this one. There is absolutely no difference in terms of how &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; or nice the shaving experience is with an old fashion safety razor (+ these blades) and a top of the line gillette blade with lasers and vibrators and missiles. The only difference is that with this you save a hell of a lot of money compared to the now more common gillette (or similar) blades. Some people say you can use these blades for a couple of shaves, honestly i don&#x27;t bother at like 40cents or so per blade I simply enjoy a brand new everytime i shave, I&#x27;m still saving like 70%+ of what i used to spend on the other type of blades. On the plus side, since you only have 1 blade, it also means that when you rinse it to get rid of the tiny hairs, it gets rinsed super quick (unlike the multiblade blades which tend to get some hair stuck despite constant flush) so even though sometimes you have to do 2 passes to obtain a close shave (since this razor only has 1 blade, compared to gillete&#x27;s which usually have 3-4 and effectively does 3-4 passes per pass) it is actually quicker  to shave, as you spend less time rinsing!</li>
            <li> Great product, sharp!</li>
            <li> Incredibly sharp! Cuts down ( no pun intended)  on the multiple passes for a great shave. Beats the Derby&#x27;s. Nice plus is the prices offered for multiple packages make these blades economical.</li>
            <li> Best and sharpest blades IMO. The only blades I use to shave</li>
            <li> Recently I became re-interested in using a double edged razor by watching probably every one of Geofatboy&#x27;s Youtube videos on shaving techniques, different razors, soaps and bowls. Because of this, I have recently switched from using cheap disposable single edge &amp;#34;fusion-type&amp;#34; razors to a new Edwin Jagger De89bl. He and others all rave about how sharp the Feather blades are. My prior experience with double edge razors was through use of a few different cheaper razors i.e., the Gillette adjustable. That experience was not good - and usually resulted in my face looking like I had used it to stop an electric fan.  My new De 89 came with a pack of Derby blades. I was surprised to find how inconsistent they are - some were so dull, I couldn&#x27;t shave with them. So I ordered 20 Feather blades, and was pleasantly surprised to find them to be the sharpest blades I have ever used. Because of this, you don&#x27;t have to press down at all with the razor - letting the weight of it do all the work.  This in turn prevents you from slicing up your face to compensate for dull blades.  Now I won&#x27;t tell you that I never slice my face anymore, but I now have a much more pleasant time using a double edge razor. Once I re-learn how to navigate a double edge razor without pressing down, I might achieve that shaving Nirvana. Blades (along with a good razor - like the De 89) are everything to enjoying a good, close shave without medical intervention - and I give credit to Feather for helping to accomplish that.</li>
            <li> best shave yet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after Crystals, Israeli Blues and Merkurs, the Feather is giving me the best shave with the least amount of pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I notice a number of reviews noting that this is a sharp razor blade and to be careful about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I imagine also that the Grand Canyon is a dangerous place if you stand too close to the edge.  In the same way, I imagine that it would be dangerous to stab yourself with a samurai sword.  To the people who noted that this is a sharp razor blade and consider that a negative, I would also like to point out that your front steps can also be very slippery, especially when wet.</li>
            <li> These blades are as sharp as promised. In fact, they are so sharp that they are a hazard to use in the shower without a mirror.  Thus, using these blades adds 5 minutes to my morning prep - they&#x27;re great to use weekends when I&#x27;m not pressed for time.  Weekdays I stick with the disposables.  My philosophy can be expressed as follows:&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s the difference between a good shave and a great shave?&lt;br /&gt;About four hours.</li>
            <li> Just the ones I wanted. They are perfect.</li>
            <li> These blades are great for an old-fashioned safety razor- and they&#x27;re cheaper than those terrible disposeables. They last and last- a pack of 20 will last over a year if you shave every other day like I do.</li>
            <li> One has to ask, &amp;#34;Is there such a thing as a blade that is too sharp?&amp;#34;  If so, I believe I found it here.  It is designed to be super sharp and it sure is.  Having used the Sharp Super Chrome, the Derby and the Wilkenson Swords, I felt I had mastered the art of wet shaving.  After a week of using the Feather, I&#x27;m still dizzy from the loss of blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consider yourself warned.</li>
            <li> No muss, no fuss, no hair. It&#x27;s a razor blade, and as such, does its job as succinctly as it can.</li>
            <li> These are good razors that give a great shave. Simple as that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They aren&#x27;t the miracle blades or the monsters that could slit your throat that some have said in reviews. Just follow your normal wet shaving prep + routine and you should be fine. Just another good blade.</li>
            <li> Will not be purchasing these again. Only last about 1 shave each where I had others that lasted more.</li>
            <li> Good shave , holds edge</li>
            <li> Great shave with the Parker 99R. I have yet to try with my older Mehaz.</li>
            <li> The blades give the best shave that I have had in quite a long time.</li>
            <li> Good blades that are sharp and well made.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and an excellent price!</li>
            <li> Great blades, nice close  comfortable shave. I get a good five days from one blade, no face scrapping, a good refreshing shave.</li>
            <li> These blades are every bit as good as all the reviews said they would be.  They are very sharp and I got a very nice shave with them.  I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Feather blades are some of the sharpest blades out there. I have since found a better blade...Lord blades are much better in my opinion, but each face and blade combo is unique...</li>
            <li> Best double edge razor shave I&#x27;ve had.  (Also has a premium price, but quality sometimes does.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this with a non-adjustable butterfly style razor.  No nicks ever.  Doesn&#x27;t drag at all.  Does a great job on my chin, which is sometimes a problem for less-sharp blades.  This is exactly how I want a shave to feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, these blades cost about 50 cents to 65 cents per blade.  I might look for a mid-grade blade for daily shaving, but this is still cheaper than most disposable cartridges which can clog and have that slow dragging feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great choice for a premium double edge razor blade.</li>
            <li> Late last year, I was tired of disposal blades and wanted to try a \\&quot;real razor\\&quot;.  This brand and type of blade came with my new razor last Christmas and have loved the close shave ever since.  Naturally, when I ran out of blades, I ordered more of the Feather New Hi-Stainless blades.  Highly recommended.  Only caution . . . these are sharper than any blades you have had, so go slow at first until you get the hang of the angle and pressure required.  I did not have any major cuts, but an occasional nick that amazingly healed in a day or less (presumably because it was so small and clean).</li>
            <li> Totally satisfied with this purchase, good quality razor blades.</li>
            <li> Feather blades are really, really sharp. I like double edged blades because they are biodegradable. You&#x27;re not always having to throw plastic into the waste-stream every time you discard a blade. If you rinse them off after every shave and let them dry, they last for several weeks.</li>
            <li> I love these blades. Much better than the cheap Derbys I tried before. Was a little sketchy about buying them for all the people who say they&#x27;re too sharp or you might cut yourself, but they just glide.</li>
            <li> Tried as my 2nd type of razor. This one worked great for me, with much less tug than a few others I tried, especially Derby brand, though I have relatively thick hair. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I use nothing but the old school safety razors these days. I find I get better shaves from them. These are my preferred blades. I clean my razor after EVERY use and flip the blade. I find I can get at least 4 or 5 good shaves out of one blade for a fraction of what those cartridge things cost.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and not for beginners or aggressive razors, unless your ok with blood.&lt;br /&gt;My favorite razor blades so far.</li>
            <li> Razors are sharp and get the job done well. Great price for the quality. Would recommend for those who want a sharper blade.</li>
            <li> I would nick my chin if I don&#x27;t pay close enough attention, so be cautious when using these blades. Very sharp!</li>
            <li> Just opened and used the first blade....proceed with care, but it is THE BEST BLADE I&#x27;e ever used!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Merkur Super Platinum blades for months and I decided to give the Feathers a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are WAY sharper than the Merkur blades.  I don&#x27;t think they are a &amp;#34;wreaking ball&amp;#34; but you do need to be more careful.  The first time I shaved with this blade I had a small blemish on my face that the Merkur blade usually would have never bothered.  The Feather blade just cut it right off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that I have to pay more attention to the grain of my beard with this blade to avoid any irritation.  I usually do but the grain on my neck basically swirls so I really have to watch what I&#x27;m doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can echo what others have said about a very smooth shave with VERY little irritation.  Putting after shave on with my Merkur blades would result in some sting all over my face and neck.  With the Feathers, almost zero sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a fairly rough beard and kind of sensitive skin so I really need a sharp blade that can hold it&#x27;s edge and this blade has not let me down.  After about three shaves with the Merkur blades I would start to get pulling.  So far after 5 shaves on the feather and still almost zero pulling...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The associated shaving products I use are:&lt;br /&gt;-Merkur Futur razor&lt;br /&gt;-Proraso Sensitive Skin Pre Shave Cream (also use as post shave)&lt;br /&gt;-Old Taylor of Bond Street Shave Cream - Lavender Scent</li>
            <li> Like many before have written, all razor blades are not the same for every person. Personally, these blades do not work for me, but that is no fault of the blades. They are just too sharp and are not designed for my facial hair. And I mean sharp.  Super sharp.  Like don&#x27;t-ignore-this-and-go-all-willy-nilly-on-your-face-with-these kinda sharp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are of the highest quality, are packaged well in packs of 5, and if my beard was a bit coarser, they would be amazing. Do yourself a favor and purchase a sample pack in order to try out a few different types. If that sampler tells you that the Feathers are your blade of choice, then by all means purchase this item. You will not regret it!</li>
            <li> Finally received about 4 days late and it was because ground mail all the way from Thailand took about a month.  But product was delivered as described and I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> Feather razor blades truly live up to the hype. Like many other reviewers, I switched to double edge safety razors from Gillette Fusion 5 blades cartridge razors and have never looked back. I read a lot of reviews on Feather blades and decided I would try them after I mastered my technique for shaving with a DE safety razor. Fortunately, I felt very comfortable using a safety razor after only a few shaves but had not received my Feather blades in the mail yet so I had to wait much longer than I intended. My first two shaves I cut myself in a couple spots two to three times per shave, and since then it has been nick free and cut free shaves in the six weeks since I started. The blades I own and have tried before using the Feather include Derby, Gillette, and Astra. I did not care for the Derby at all, and of course they gave me the nicks and cuts on those first two shaves. However, to be fair this could have been due to my skin having to get used to the new style of shaving so I may give them another try in the&lt;br /&gt;near future. I really like the Astra and Gillette razor blades but find myself using the Astra more often so I rate them a little higher. Finally I received my Feather blades in the mail, which took about a month to arrive due to shipping from Thailand. This morning I shaved with one for the first time and it definitely is the sharpest and best blade of the four brands I have used. I didn&#x27;t notice so much while I was shaving on my first pass along the growth, it was more so after I washed my face off after the first pass. I honestly didn&#x27;t see the need for a second pass, but of course I did so anyway. I sometimes do three passes, one along, one sideways, and one against. With the Feather I only did one along and one against the growth. It did not seem at all necessary however, and I didn&#x27;t even hear any hair being cut on the second pass like I always do with the other blades. My skin feels soft and smooth, more so than ever before and that is not an exaggeration. I cannot believe how close the shave was and it felt good too. And best of all, I did not nick or cut myself at all. I don&#x27;t think it was necessary to wait so long before trying the Feather blades either. I purchased my brother an entire shave set and a sample pack of blades the other day for his birthday and told him to try the Feather blades after he felt comfortable with his technique. Well, he called me this morning and said he tried the Feather on his first shave and was very pleased. I read about people cutting their faces up all over the place with DE razors, and especially with Feather blades, but I wonder what the heck they are doing so wrong because I don&#x27;t find this to be at all difficult. Thus, my recommendation is if you know how to shave, but the Feather blades first and be done with it. There is no need to try every blade made in my opinion, just the sharpest. By the way, I hear KAI blades are also extremely sharp, and being made in Japan like Feather I don&#x27;t doubt it.eration. I cannot believe how close the shave was and it felt good too.

            <li> I was looking for a close shave, this blades are dull, they pull the facial hair instead of cut it.</li>
            <li> Simply the best razor blades you&#x27;ll ever find, period!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these blades for close to a year now and I must say it is the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. I work in an OR where I deal with optical microsurgery and Feather manufactures many of the blades we use. I know this brand is a trusted name and takes no shortcuts (little blade humor). The steel is ultra thin, yet strong at the same time because I can use it up to  about five or six times in a row before changing. Some people may think thats a small number but remember its only one blade, not five or eight or whatever number they&#x27;re up to now. I also love that these blades are a dime a dozen by comparison of the cartridges in the stores. For what I spend on eight cartridges in the store, I can get twenty Feather razors for the same price. I don&#x27;t know why anyone would waste their time and money on those popular razors with the ungodly expensive refill cartridges that are on the market. Get a safety razor and start shaving closer and more comfortably while saving money at the same time</li>
            <li> Feathers with Merkur T handle will make a smooth shave with no razor burns or irritation. I am a 30 year old Indian male with dark skin and medium tough beard. All these years I was a loyal customer to one and only one brand - Gillette Mach 3 cartridges and Gillette foam can for shaving cream . Of late, I started noticing razor burns in my neck and chin I started researching on how to prevent it. All the forums pointed me to do straight edge razor shave. Since I am skeptical to switch to straight edge razor and keeping in mind the long religious procedure I have to undergo every time I shave, I took the shortest alternative route which is double edge shaving. Till now I am having good results. Of course, I nicked myself and bleeded for first 3 shaves, after that my skin got adjusted and my shaving skill improved, now I am able to get a smooth shave which last for 2 to 3 days. However if I shave with one day stubble, I get more irritation and shave bumps. I am not able to have a daily shave with this. May be I have to practice more. I am not in military services or neither I am a president, so shaving once in 3 days works perfectly fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;During the switch from Gillette to Feathers, I purchased Braun 7 series electric shave and used it for two months. Somehow my skin was not getting adjusted to Barun and I had uneven shaves with patches left in neck.I have to do multiple passes to get rid of hairs and it irritated my skin and my skin was becoming even darker as it was adjusting to get the cuts healed.Now I am using my braun to remove hairs from my Adams apple. This is a unique area of my neck where I get nervous to use a double edge razor. Braun does a nice job here. Overall \\&quot;Feathers\\&quot; is a good economical solution for a clean smooth shave. Once you start using feather I am sure you won&#x27;t turn your head back to either Cartridge or electric shaving. Happy shaving.</li>
            <li> Love these blades. Best quality blades I&#x27;ve used. Nice and clean shave, and they stay sharp longer then other blades I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Great product especially  for the price !  I was content with my old blades for the last forty years and had no idea of all the options on line.  Love the blades and will be a customer for the next forty years , I HOPE !  Bulldog</li>
            <li> I have never shaved with a straight razor before, however I have no complaints about the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> Sharp and retains edge for more than one or two face shaves. Great blades. Expect cuts you didn&#x27;t feel, especially if you&#x27;re a new transitioner from cartridges.</li>
            <li> No razor burn, clean cuts, very smooth. Great shaving experience. Definetely a good bang for the buck. And at a good price too.</li>
            <li> If there&#x27;s a sharpness scale I&#x27;m unsure but in my book these are the sharpest blades I&#x27;ve had in my razor, I threw the brand that came with my razor out after my third shave with these.  This is a no pressure shaving blade,press down just a little and you&#x27;ll be reaching for your styptic pencil.</li>
            <li> I like the shave from the blades and the price is very reasonable,  but they ship from out of the country and shipping takes quite a while.  They may last a shave or two longer than the generic blades at the drug store however.</li>
            <li> A great smooth shave.</li>
            <li> After years of Gillette blades, most recently the Power Fusion, I decided to try these blades in the Feather Stainless Steel Razor.  The shave is excellent, the blades are cheaper, and I enjoy the shaving experience a little better.  On the practical side, the multi-blade razors leave stray hairs in some places (near the nostrils and in the corners of the mouth); these do not.  I&#x27;m glad I switched, and I am wondering what I can do with my Art of Shaving Power Fusion Razors with light.</li>
            <li> The only blades I use for my zmerkur razor. Super sharp, no drag with properly lubed face. Pricier than other blades but worth it, they seem to be able to stand up to more shaves while still performing well before needing to be changed.</li>
            <li> These are the best blades around. Surgical sharp I think thse will work with any type of beard hair with no problem.</li>
            <li> Very good blades indeed. They cut the hair clean off with no drag or hesitation whatsoever. However I do personally find that I experience irritation from shaving with these because of the sharpness. They are good razors that give you a good clean shave but if you have sensitive skin like me you might want to go with a more gentle blade. I will probably switch off with other blades to give my face a rest.</li>
            <li> After years of using Kai blades, I decided to finally give Feathers a chance. There is definitely a lot going for them compared to the Kai&#x27;s; they&#x27;re less money, you can get them through Prime, they come in a cool (and safe) dispenser and it can also be used to dispose of your old blades.&lt;br /&gt; On the flip side, they&#x27;re just not as good, IMO. They&#x27;re sharp, but not as sharp. They last 2-3 shaves, but the Kai&#x27;s last me 4-5. They&#x27;re cheaper, but not when considering the amount of blades I&#x27;ll go through in a certain amount time.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m glad I tried them, and I&#x27;ll use the ones I now have, but when I run out, I&#x27;ll be going back to the Kai blades.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the shipping and everything involving the order was perfect, just found the product wanting.</li>
            <li> These blades last a long time and they&#x27;re incredibly sharp. I only have to change my blade about once a month and I shave every day. Talk about a money saver!</li>
            <li> Feathers are the best!!!  Be sure to check out the suppliers.  Some not so good.  Great blades!  Close shaves.  No burn.  Very sharp.  A true gentleman&#x27;s shave.</li>
            <li> They arrived unbelievably fast. These are the &amp;#34;Yellow Label Platinum Coated&amp;#34; blades even though section shows both the (Yellow) Platinum and (Black/Gray) non-Platinum blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been into wet shaving with double edge blades for a few years now, have a vintage Gillette Slim and a Merkur Progress (Mergress) with a custom knob. Both handles are great and many know it comes down to the trying different blades and soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have given handles, blades and brushes as gifts and have given Feather Blades, but NEVER bought or tried them myself. So, this order is for&lt;br /&gt;ME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will come back to rate the blade…  This is more to rate the vendor and the fast service an product expected at a reasonable price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - Shaved with my first Feather in a vintage Gillette Slim Adjustable - While I do not find it unbelievably super sharp as I have read in so many other reviews, I did find it gave me a VERY CLEAN/SMOOTH shave. I have to set the razor to 5 to feel that it was &amp;#34;aggressive&amp;#34; enough for me, but once set I did find it did give me a very CLOSE shave without getting a lot (not any to tell the truth) nicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DO believe this are my newest favorite with my others being Personna&#x27;s that I get from my local drug store with store branding. I DO like these feathers (so far) however. They seem to live up to the hype of the reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying out straight razor shaving after years of cartridges.  These blades are very sharp and don&#x27;t seem to dull easily.</li>
            <li> I love the blades....I ordered the blades pictured but received the Feather blades in a black and grey package. I would have sent them back but it took a month for me to receive them. I needed blades, so I kept them. For $7.50 for 20 blades, really can&#x27;t best it. If it was the yellow pack I would have given it a 5 instead of a 4. I will order more when the time comes. Hopefully it will be the yellow pack.</li>
            <li> When I first started shaving, I used a double bladed pick blade. In the early turn of the millennium I switched to the safety razor, and found it to be the most amazing shaving experience I&#x27;ve had. However the blade I used where the and Mark that were so conveniently at the Art of shaving and those blades aren&#x27;t the sharpest in the world. As I continued my research into shaving with double-edged blades, I came across these beautiful Japanese feather blades and found that they cut my beard with amazing ease. The quality, the lack of nicking yourself, the smoothness that comes with such a sharp blade, made my shave superior and actually decrease the time it took to shave. This is easily the best way to get a close shave with a regular double-edged razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one shortcoming of a feather blade is that it does so quickly and needs to be switched out but compared to mock three mock for Talk five whatever the new razors are, this seems to be a far cheaper choice and obviously less commercial. No need for that little our Vera strip that comes with the those blades or getting stuck all the time when you have too much hair in between too many blades and having to force those hairs out of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A safety razor with a feather blade is the perfect way to go. No tricks, no gimmicks, just a good experience.</li>
            <li> I have a tough beard and after using these blades I&#x27;ll use no others.  They are super sharp.  They took a little getting used to (you get nicks easily at first) but after a few days shaving is great.  The package has a built-in blade disposal which is nice.</li>
            <li> Product is as advertised.</li>
            <li> These things are sharp. Take off the top layer of skin sharp. I&#x27;ve used them in my agressive and tame razors and I have to say I have never gotten a smoother shave. Care needs to be taken as you can easily give yourself razor burn and cut nicks with these things but if done properly they are the best I have seen. I&#x27;ve never had a shave from any other blade where I felt the next day that I did not have to shave. These are awesome.</li>
            <li> These blades provide me with the closest shave I&#x27;ve yet gotten with a double-edged safety razor. The blade glides across the skin, effortlessly plowing through stubble. Great blades.</li>
            <li> While finding double edged safety blades is very simple via Amazon, ordering from HappyMart required a little extra patience...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would order from them again I n a heartbeat.  Outstanding service. Retailers here could learn a thing or two!</li>
            <li> These are razor blades, nothing to get too excited about, really.  The quality is good and these are a great value.  I&#x27;m giving them three stars mainly because of the unbelievably slow shipping.  They took over a month to arrive.  I know they were described as taking a month to ship but I hoped they were using a conservative estimate.  it turns out they missed it by nearly a week.  Still, the blades are very good and, overall I am pleased with the value.</li>
            <li> These are the best safety razor blades I have used so far. The blades are sharp and do not nick or cut my skin unless I use them at the wrong angle. The longer I use the safety razor, the less I cut myself. I recommend these blades to anyone looking to save money and get into using a safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One things I will say, I was surprised when the blades arrived from Thailand. I was concerned that they might be fakes. After using the blades, I can say they work as well as the previous ones I bought and the blades say Made in Japan. A friend said that shipping from Thailand to the US can be cost effective if the shipper uses drop shipping, where the package is combined with other packages as part of a bulk shipment to save money.</li>
            <li> Skinned half of my shin off the first time I used it haha, but its a substantial improvement over the standard-issue Merkur blade that came with my safety razor....just tread carefully on first use, I didn&#x27;t expect that since the Merkur blade was pretty dull by comparison. Like the blade disposal pocket too, that&#x27;s a clever design feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller packed the product nicely, it came from Thailand I believe but no complaints on the packaging or shipping.</li>
            <li> Good blades but I had to wait a month for them</li>
            <li> Sharp is the word! Used with my Muhle 41 it is a beast until the 3rd shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a DE shaver for three plus years and never going back to the multi-bladed face-tuggers.  With that said, you name the brand of razor blade and I&#x27;ve probably tried it.  Now, I understand every face is different and various brands work better for some and not for others.  Nonetheless, once I found &amp;#34;Feather&amp;#34;, there was no going back to anything else.  Been using this blade consistently for about two years and nothing compares in my opinion.  Give them a try and remember to let the weight of the razor do the work.</li>
            <li> These razors are seriously sharp so be extra careful if you&#x27;re not used to double-edged shaving with a safety razor. However, once you&#x27;ve nicked yourself a time or two and learned the ropes, these will be your best friend. After shaving with these for a while, even high-end disposables will &#x27;tug&#x27; and hurt. These are serious razors. I get around 5 shaves from one blade, but your mileage may vary. Always soak your current razor / blade in hot water before using.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend these at all. They have a reputation as being very sharp. They are, but don&#x27;t think better when you think sharper. They scrape your face leaving it raw and exposed. I consider myself having excellent technique and proper prep, and I still managed to cut myself almost every time I used these. I highly recommend Shark super chrome instead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for 3 years now. When I first started (about 6 months into it) I got a sample pack with some Feather blades and with these I must have nicked myself about 5 - 7 times and my face was nearly raw after each shave. I use a Merkur Progress razor and had it set to 1.5 or 2 at that time and even on 1 I still nailed myself with the Feathers. After more experience I realized the mistake I was making and it had to do with pressure - even the slightest bit of pressure and you risk nicks and razor burn with even the mildest razors, most forgiving blades and the best shave prep and forget about BBS results unless you like your skin peeled off as well. This is especially true if you have a tough beard. Add to this all the unlearning I had to do that came from shaving with cartridge razors. Once I discovered this key I instantly stopped nicking myself and getting \\&quot;razor rash.\\&quot; Slowly I increased the aggressiveness of my Progress to get to the coveted BBS (baby butt smooth) shave that is free of irritation and nicks but I still wasn&#x27;t getting as close as I wanted with the blades I was using. I realized it was no longer my technique but blade sharpness and time to attempt the Feather again. My beard is full but not super densely packed. My problem is my whiskers are hard as nails and therefore tough to get a super close shave especially in sensitive areas. Now that I know the key about pressure I shave with my Progress set to 5.5 (maximum aggressiveness) - this gave me excellent but not quite BBS perfect shaves with any blade I have. With a fresh Feather loaded and the Progress set to its maximum wickedness I got an incredible 3 pass shave even on the hardest areas for me (neck &amp; jaw line). I&#x27;m now considering buying a Merkur Slant to get as close as a straight razor shave as I can get. Keep in mind that the Progress is no slouch set on 5.5 and loaded with a Feather and you can definitely get a BBS shave with this combo - I&#x27;m just a perfectionist with a tough beard.beard.</li>
            <li> I have purchased three different blades so far and the FEATHER blades are the best for the price so far.</li>
            <li> These blades are amazing. Very sharp! You have to know how to shave with one of these or else you will cut your face off. Do not try to shave your adam&#x27;s apple. You will cut it off! Pull the adams apple skin to the side and shave it that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first shave with these blades is like you&#x27;re just wiping the hair off. I&#x27;d say you can get 4 good shaves out of each blade. I&#x27;ll NEVER go back to the mach or quatro. The quality of shave is far superior. I figured out that if you leave your razor submerged in barbacide it stays sharper longer not to mention sterile.</li>
            <li> I was a little afraid to try these blades, as I have heard they are so sharp, they can be rough on you if you are new to DE shaving.  But, I am glad I tried them.  In my opinion they aren&#x27;t quite as good as the personnas, but they are so close, I think that is a personal preference.  Very nice blades.</li>
            <li> A very nice deal and prompt customer  support.. pleased to use the product .have  a nice day</li>
            <li> Well these are definitely the best de blades I&#x27;ve ever used. Hardly ever &#x27;ve managed to cause bleeding or irritation with Feathers. I&#x27;m doing some little product testing all the time but eventually &#x27;ve always returned to Feather, the best.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good product.  I read the reviews about how scary sharp they were, so I had to try some.  Blades have to be sharp or you won&#x27;t get a good shave, these are not &#x27;scary sharp, whatever that means.  They don&#x27;t seem any sharper than the Wilkinson Sword blades I use ally use.  For the price difference I&#x27;ll probably stay w/the Wilkinson&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Good blade,right for the price. Goes fine with Merkur Razor.</li>
            <li> As a regular Derby and Wilkinson user, I kept promising myself that I would try a Feather blade to see if it lived up to its legendary status with my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I discovered is that the shave itself is about the same from all three blades to me, but the Feather blade holds its sharpness longer. I would replace a Derby blade every other day, but a Feather will last me a week to 10 days. So, even though they&#x27;re more expensive, they&#x27;re a better value because each blade shaves for much longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all blades, your mileage may vary, so find a 5-pack before purchasing this (or a sampler that includes a Feather) to be sure the blade is good for your face.</li>
            <li> I guess my beard is just too tough.  These scrape off the hair, but doesn&#x27;t leave me with the smooth clean shave.  Going to try another brand or maybe go back to the 5 Blade Gillette I was using before.</li>
            <li> Good sharp blade. I may have had too high an expectation after all the rave reviews I&#x27;d read online, but I&#x27;m tempering that opinion with the fact I&#x27;m far from a shaving connoisseur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not experienced the problems others have described with being so sharp they are more prone to cutting themselves. In that regard I consider these blades similar to the others I&#x27;ve used. They&#x27;re sharp. If you don&#x27;t trust yourself with the tool, don&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I buy more blades I will likely buy the Feather make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update Dec 2, 2015&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;m still no blademaster, I will increase my rating to a full 5-stars because as my abilities improve so does my appreciation for how well these blades perform in comparison to some others I&#x27;ve used and continue to use in the rotation.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of how much better these could be than other blades I have been using, so I bought this small pack to try.  I was amazed how much sharper they are than other blades.  It felt like I had no blade in the razor and was just gliding the head over my face.  Best of all, this resulted in the closest shave I&#x27;ve had with zero irritation.  First shave made a believer out of me.</li>
            <li> Ordered feather razor blades because previous experience. Excellent shave, very sharp and arrived before they were promised. Definitely sold on feather blades, good for 6-8 shaves if you have a light beard.</li>
            <li> What can I say?  These blades are sharp.  You have to be careful using them.  They will burn if you aren&#x27;t careful.  They give you a great and close shave if used with caution.  I get five shaves out of them.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> they really are the sharpest blades, apply a very minimal amount of pressure and you won&#x27;t believe how smooth your face can be!</li>
            <li> Would definitely, and will, buy again! Sharp, smooth, and surprisingly forgiving. Great price considering quality, although they don&#x27;t last more than 2, possibly 3 shaves.</li>
            <li> Im going to probably surprise a lot of people here but honestly I dont think these blades are sharp enough. Ive tried using no pressure on the razor and light pressure on the razor with these blades and they still leave me with a visible 5&#x27;o clock shadow. Smooth shave yes but im looking for a blade that is so sharp that people would think i had laser hair removal done on my face. That blade may not exist or I may need to switch to a straight razor but its what im looking for so I must continue my quest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**update** A lot of people say to not use any pressure on DE blades to get the best closest shave. \\&quot;Let the weight of the razor work for you\\&quot; they say. Well sorry but i seem to get a better shave if i add just a touch of pressure. So ive taken my review of these blades from a 3 to a 4. Yes they get pretty darn close however they dont last very long. I get around 4 good shaves from them. Now, I wait till i have almost a full beard before I shave so someone that shaves every day will probably get more out of a blade than I do. Overall ive gone with 2 diff blades: sharks and feathers. Sharks arent as sharp as feathers but they last a lot longer. Feathers arent as long lasting as sharks but theyre sharper. All you have to do is decide which is more important to you. Sharpness or life.</li>
            <li> These are the best blades I&#x27;ve ever used in my razor. Ever. Seriously, they cut hair like butter. I started wet shaving a couple of months ago with Merkur blades, and had horrible problems with ingrown hairs. Switched over to Feather&#x27;s and I&#x27;m glad I did. There&#x27;s nothing smoother than a Feather with good technique. I&#x27;ve found out that the key to wet shaving in general is preparing your face. Get it nice and hot either by taking a shower before shaving, or putting a hot towel on your face to soften the hair. The softer the hair, the easier these blades take it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price on these also!</li>
            <li> It took 2 weeks to get but worth it</li>
            <li> Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m learning more as I get into de shaving. What the big boys say is true. Different blades work better in different razors on different faces. Sharpest may be fine in one razor and not as good in another, even though it&#x27;s sharper. Go figure. Particularly true if you are sensitive to razor burn. I have recently tried persona red in my merkur and they work at least as well for me. A sampler pack may be a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok they are the sharpest. I&#x27;ve just gone back to wet shaving. I am not an expert. I have now tried Merkur (came with razor), derby extra, and feather. Feather is the sharpest. The derby and the Merkur were both satisfactory. Derby is by far cheaper. I&#x27;m probably going to go with the feather because it does give a noticeably closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those who caution against the feather for new users are a little too nervous. They are all plenty sharp enough to cut the clumsy or over aggressive user. IMHO, the feather may actually be safer for the same reason that a sharp knife is safer than a dull knife---you&#x27;re less likely to push too hard. Scraping with the feather is both unnecessary and maybe risky.&lt;br /&gt;I used them in the Merkur 34c and they worked great.</li>
            <li> Razors came on time,they are original and they are the sharpest in the business. Super close shave ! and the price is unbeatable !</li>
            <li> I ordered these after being disappointed with some other brands like the Wilkinson Sword blades.  The old blades left some substantial razor burn, especially after the second pass going against the grain.  The Feather razors are much better suited for going against the grain, as they require very little effort to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is that these blades cut right on through any imperfections on your face.  It will sheer off any pimples you have, even with the minimum amount of applied force.  So while the shaving experience overall has improved dramatically, I still end up with little nicks on my face if I have a pimple or two.  Obviously not a deal breaker as I gave this product 5 stars, but it&#x27;s something to keep in mind when choosing which blade works best for you.</li>
            <li> These blades are so much better than the blades I was using, it makes them look like butter knives.  I have been using the same blade for a month and it is still sharper than any of my other blades when they were new.</li>
            <li> I have a safety razor and use these blades to shave almost every other day. I save so much money by using these and not the modern razors. Replacement cartridges are so expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was great and I really recommend this product over using the garbage and money draining razors sold in most stores.</li>
            <li> nice sharp and good quality blades&lt;br /&gt;I do not have enough experience with it to say more&lt;br /&gt;sometimes a little bit of glue from the packaging smear on the blade, but not allways</li>
            <li> When reading this review, the Crystal Brand isn&#x27;t available anymore, but they are the exact same blade as Israeli Personna, so whenever you read Crystal, you can substitute Israeli Personna... or you can just cut and paste the revised link @ the bottom of this review to go right to Amazon&#x27;s page for the 100 pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a 100-blade sampler pack a few years back, and tried every blade in it. No other blade compared to the Crystal Platinum blades (my friend tried every blade in the sampler also, and w/o me bringing it up, he said the same thing... that there was no comparison to the Crystals), so I went through 100 of the Crystal&#x27;s, and when it came time to buy more, I thought I&#x27;d try the Feather instead because it had such good reviews and it wasn&#x27;t in my sampler. I made the mistake of buying 30 Feathers rather than just trying 5... granted the Feathers are the second best blade I have used, but I will not be opening another pack of these... they&#x27;ll just go into my obsolete blade graveyard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Crystal Platinums shave noticably closer and don&#x27;t cut me like the Feather brand... I&#x27;ve been cut pretty bad by the Feathers, and I&#x27;ve even been cut on the flat of my cheak where I&#x27;ve never been cut by another blade. With the Crystals, I would only get nicked when I wasn&#x27;t paying attention at all. With the Feathers, I pay 3x as much attention (because I have too), and I still get cut about 10x as much as the Crystals... all for a lower quality shave than I was used to with the Crystals. It goes without saying that it is much more enjoyable and faster to shave with the Crystals... if I hadn&#x27;t tried all the other crappy brands out there I would have rated these a 1 next to the Crystals, but I know these are actually quite a comfortable blade compared to most. I shave with a Murker Classic, and my facial hair is pretty toughnna Double Edge Razor Blades]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CHECK OUT MY OTHER REVIEWS...

            <li> It took me about 8 shaves before I got the hang of using these blades in my Merkur Futur. These things are super sharp and with patience and a steady hand, you will reap the rewards of a BBS shave.</li>
            <li> Great straight razor for shaving, fast delivery, best shave I have better that 42$ for a flashlight, razor that vibrates</li>
            <li> Cuts great, but very sharp!</li>
            <li> These blades are very sharp and work fine. No negatives at all and I will purchase more!</li>
            <li> Great blades very smooth, and I get 3 good close shaves each side of the blade.</li>
            <li> Great quality safety blades. Close shave every time</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp so be careful! I love em too!! Get a lot of shaves because of them being sharp! So I guess they are worth the extra cost!</li>
            <li> A great shave.  I have tried many razors and the feather has been the best shave.  I would not recommend if your new to wet shaving.  This is a sharp blade.  If your new to wet shaving try a Derby or Gilette silvers.  That is my opinion.  Best bet , buy a sampler pack and see what works best for your face and razor.</li>
            <li> I have tried a couple of other brands but they didn&#x27;t stay sharp as long as these. I have a tough bread that grows fast, With other blade I would get two or maybe three shaves, with these Feather blades I get five comfortable, close shaves out of each blade!</li>
            <li> The Razors are fine; great quality, and extremely sharp.  They arrived safely, in good condition, and with a very nice note from the seller thanking me.  BUT, the freaking things were shipped from Thailand!!  It took forever for the blades to arrive!  So, I can easily recommend the seller....you just have to plan ahead and make sure you order well before the blades are actually needed.</li>
            <li> Almost too sharp. I had to adjust my razor down quite a bit to keep my face intact when switching to Feathers, but in doing so I&#x27;ve virtually ended my days of razor burn.</li>
            <li> Amazing blade&lt;br /&gt;Shipping took a very long time&lt;br /&gt;Worth the wait!</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp. Convenient case that holds old blades. Shipping takes forever</li>
            <li> These did not work well for me.  I think it may be that these don&#x27;t work well with my Mehaz razor.  I have also tried Gillette Silver Blue, Astra Superior Platinum, and Wilkinson razors. All of those worked much better with my razor.  The Feather blades grabbed and did not give a close shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gillete 7&#x27;Oh clock, and man the difference is incredible. Silky smooth shaving with these Feather ones.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy these again and will recommend these to the very few friends that shave.</li>
            <li> This item (Feather Razor blades) is exactly as described, and well packaged. Can&#x27;t beat the price, and it shipped pretty quick.&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is that I forgot to order the razor itself in time.&lt;br /&gt;There are no complaints with the blades. I highly recommend this seller, and this brand of blades.</li>
            <li> Really not as sharp as everyone thinks they are. On the second pass, I usually shave across or against the grain. Feather tugs and pulls, unlike other blades (Wilkinson Sword has no problem). Maybe it&#x27;s just my beard (my neck has some of the craziest growth patterns), but I will not be using these blades in the future. I get better shaves from cheaper blades (thus far Wilkinson Sword is my favourite).</li>
            <li> These blades give a marginally better shave than a few of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried, but I don&#x27;t feel that they are significantly sharper or shave more comfortably than lower cost alternatives. In fact, these blades \\&quot;skip\\&quot; much more frequently than their legendary sharpness would imply. I will most likely return to the tried and true (and much cheaper) Derby after I deplete my supply of Feathers.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the Merkur 38 HD, which came with a Merkur blade. I&#x27;m new to this type of shaving and was somewhat disappointed with shave the merkur blade gave and was about to switch back to my disposable razors again when i decided to try another brand of blades. I choose  Feather&#x27;s based on the reviews i read; I can assure you these blades will definitely keep you using DE safety razors. Super sharp, makes your shave much easier. Contrary to popular belief that these blades will mangle your face, the opposite is true, the sharper the blade the less likey you will cut your self. Using a duller blade will cause you to go over and over the same area, which will more than likely lead to  a nick or cut. Use the sharpest blade you can find and in my opinion it&#x27;s the Feather blades.</li>
            <li> I have a tough beard and sensitive skin, this blade coupled with nice doubled edge razor, handles my beard well.  I get one shave per edge, and I shave every other day, I imagine if I was a daily shaver then the blades would probably last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have used every kind of electric and disposable blade out there and have been rewarded with lots of nicks and razor burns.  If you are careless, you&#x27;ll get these also with these blades, but with careful shaving these give a smooth, close shave without nicks and burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor gives me the best shave I&#x27;ve had in 40 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a recent convert to DE shaving.  I use a Merkur 180 and have tried several brands of blades.  The Feather blade is the best I have found yet.  Reputed to be the sharpest blade available, it has never failed to give me a close, comfortable shave with no irritation.  I usually get 4 days out of a blade, I&#x27;ve pushed it to 7 and they still work OK for me, but I like the feeling of that fresh blade on my face--no drag whatsoever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried reading some of the reviews I have seen on these blades, that my bathroom would look like a crime scene after shaving with the Feather.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  After a solid month of Feather-only daily shaves, no cuts or nicks, and only a handful of miniscule weepers shaving my neck ATG.  Just pay attention to what you are doing and you will be rewarded with a fantastic shave!</li>
            <li> For my face, I find these hard to beat. They&#x27;re sharp, and they leave me with less irritation than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li> I ordered a Merkur safety razor and a 20-pack of these Feather blades months ago, and I&#x27;m still going through the pack! Granted, I don&#x27;t shave super-often so my facial hair grows out a bit longer, but these blades are sharp and durable enough to withstand multiple uses even on that longer hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase. Hands down the best shaving experience I&#x27;ve had and I don&#x27;t see anything that needs changing here.</li>
            <li> Wow...watch out.  S-H-A-R-P is right.  Brand new, these blades will provide an incredibly close shave.  A well coordinated pass or two is all you&#x27;ll need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cuts beautifully up thru the 5th shave or so before I notice dulling.  I also try to limit strokes and use each side of the blade evenly.  Just *be careful*  If you&#x27;re new to safety razor shaving go slowly, make sure you have a soap that lathers well, use extra protection (i.e.- use baby or olive oil on face after hot water and before soaping) and don&#x27;t press too firmly.  After a few times you&#x27;ll have it down.</li>
            <li> since reading that blades are an individual choice, i bought a variety pack here on amazon and found these to be the sharpest and longest lasting among my favorites. Merkur would be my second pick.</li>
            <li> This was a part of Christmas gift to my husband with other three items including:&lt;br /&gt;Organic Grapeseed Oil (ASIN: B004LK6DR4)&lt;br /&gt;Merkur 20C Long Handle Black Double Edge Safety Razor(ASIN: B005RZDEEC)&lt;br /&gt;100% Silvertip Badger Bristle Shaving Brush (ASIN: B002UB3BF8)&lt;br /&gt;And he absolutely loved this! he&#x27;s been a Gillette guy from many years and wanted to switch to safety razors, so I read reviews of different products and finally decided to give all these in a shaving kit.&lt;br /&gt;These blades are expensive but I found some cheaper places online where you can buy much cheaper than Amazon.</li>
            <li> - Some of the sharpest I&#x27;ve used&lt;br /&gt;- They don&#x27;t hold their edge quite as long as some other brands</li>
            <li> Excellent! These blades are wonderful and make your face smooth like the undercarriage of a Barbie. Definitely made me improve my technique as you really can&#x27;t feel if you&#x27;ve cut yourself. I&#x27;ve been using this with the Shave Secret shaving oil with which you don&#x27;t really seem to need to add shaving cream, the blade does the work. The vendor is spledificous as well! GILETTE CAN EAT A ROTTING CHINCHILLA CARCUS! :D</li>
            <li> pretty good blade for a few days of shaving</li>
            <li> These blades are very nice, unfortunately, after trying for a month to make a safety razor work with my face, I can&#x27;t get the system to work for me.  I end up looking like I got in a fight with a grass line trimmer.  I switched back to the 5 bladed disposable head shaving blade system I have used for many years.</li>
            <li> I have crazy sensitive skin and this blade was my last resort.  It cuts through my whiskers literally like butter with no burn.  I also use prorazo preshave cream and post balm and it feels amazing.</li>
            <li> I bought these after having a bad experience with another seller and the Bic blades. Everything I read said the Feather blades are the sharpest out there (sometimes too sharp for some people). Rather than order another 100 blades on a whim, I ordered 20 to try out.  I just received the blades a couple of days ago, so I didn&#x27;t really have a chance to use them until this morning. All I have to say is &amp;#34;WOW!!&amp;#34; I was cutting through 3 days of growth (average thickness) and these blades cut through it like nothing with no skin irritation and I managed to walk away with only 1 knick (just below my nose) where I pushed the edge of the blade in too hard while placing it under my nose. Don&#x27;t worry, I&#x27;m gonna live.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, now that I have some confidence into this seller and these blades, I&#x27;m definitely going to be ordering some more. The price is unreal.</li>
            <li> Without a doubt theses are the sharpest blades for DE Wet shaving.  It normally takes me about 3 shaves to go through a blade.</li>
            <li> As close a shave I have ever had with a blade, highly recommend. I use this with the Merkur Long Handle, good combo.</li>
            <li> I have tried 2 types of blades. Both we&#x27;re good but these we&#x27;re the sharpest by far. Gives an excellent shave with no problems.</li>
            <li> They sharp.  Break in half to use with a shavette as well.</li>
            <li> Never going back to multiple blade razors again!</li>
            <li> I just shaved with one of these blades this morning and it did not disappoint. It was my first time shaving with a Feather blade and it gave me the closest shave ever with my Merkur safety razor. I am not a novice safety razor user and I would advise anyone who is a beginner to use these with caution as they do not require much pressure to nick yourself. I would recommend these to anyone looking for a high quality blade and a close shave.</li>
            <li> Sharp sharp sharp. Although most safety razor experts suggest changing the blade out every shave, I often get several good, smooth, no-knick shaves out of a single blade.</li>
            <li> These blades are incredibly sharp. I use them in my Merkur 38 Hd Classic Barber Pole Long Safety Razor. I replace the blades after two shaves, though could probably go a third - I just haven&#x27;t even tried that yet...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been shaving with this combo for three months and really enjoy the experience of this combo.</li>
            <li> There are many blades to choose from, but there is no reason to use anything but Feather on your face. Best quality steel and manufacturing control.</li>
            <li> These are the only blades I will buy. Have tried others but keep coming back to these. Well worth the extra cost, though it is best to shop around for the best deal.</li>
            <li> I have used Feather razors with Muhle and Ikon heads, open and closed combs, many different shaving creams and techniques.  These razors are simply sharper and last longer than other razors on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there is any negative, it is that these are really sharp -- really really sharp.  There are other very good brands that come out of the package and shave very well without the worry about nicks.  Feather blades are a fine tool that should be respected.</li>
            <li> Works as described.  Excellent quality and prompt delivery thanks to Prime!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m by no means a shaving aficionado but I&#x27;ve used a variety of shaving methods. Even with DE Razor shaving I&#x27;ve tried Derby, Astra and Merkur blades. I&#x27;ve read that the general consensus on Feather blades were they were scary sharp and kind of pricy. That might be true on both accounts, but they are the best blades I&#x27;ve ever used and well worth the price premium. My wife is a hairdresser and she uses Feather blades for her razor cutting, so I already knew the company&#x27;s reputation of making quality products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Feather blades in my Merkur HD #34C and the blade feels like butter gliding across your face. I found the Feather blades to work the best on problem areas like my chin and under the neck, where other blades wouldn&#x27;t get close enough or would cause razor burns and/or nicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice is Amazon sells a lot of budget blades, and I&#x27;ve used a lot of them, but it seems you get what you pay for. I&#x27;d rather spend the extra few cents a shave and have a really good experience.</li>
            <li> So far seems to give a good shave for a fairly long time.</li>
            <li> Truly phenomenal. I use these in my Shaving Factory Double Edge Safety Razor and in my Dovo Shavette straight razor handle. They are so sharp  I decided to look at them with a jewelers loop.  Compared to Gellette, the difference is obvious.  The best part is they seem to stay sharp for between 10 - 15 shaves!  Snap in half and use it in the Dovo Shavette handle for fine detail shaving.  I have a thick beard, but these slide through it with zero force.  Really amazing.</li>
            <li> WOW! These blades are the best. Going back to old school shaving has been a joy. These blades make it even better. I have tried the others, Personna and Tiger are my favorites. Feather blades are far superior. They are so sharp , I had to check if I had a blade in my razor. I will be using Feather blades from now on.</li>
            <li> I love these blades.  I get a consistently close, smooth shave.  While they ARE very sharp, I have not found them to be dangerous as many reviews suggest.</li>
            <li> These were exactly what I was looking for at a great price. I will purchase this in the future when I need to refill.</li>
            <li> Great shave every time with these. They are very smooth on my skin and I can get about 3-4 shaves out of one blade before I feel a notable difference. Yes they are more expensive but try them out and you will understand why. These are the best blades I have found for my skin.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been shaving with these for very long but I find that they are very sharp and often knick my neck (probably my fault). User error aside I&#x27;m happy with my purchase because these allow me to have a good line for my beard.</li>
            <li> Works well. Very sharp and oiled to stay rust free.</li>
            <li> Holy Close. I&#x27;ve been reluctant to try these, as I can be a little sloppy or in a rush sometimes, but they&#x27;re a lot easier to work with than I was lead to believe. I love them in my Merkur 34C, as it&#x27;s not known as an aggressive razor. But, with these in it, I can get by with 2 passes, and most likely not have to shave the next night. Still a little nervous to try them In the aggressive Merkur Futur, which is not forgiving in the least, but it won&#x27;t be long before I do, and I&#x27;m confident that if I set aside the time, and not rush, I will be thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li> I order this back in December and its now February, never seen this, last time I will ever order these!</li>
            <li> Tried these solely because of past experience in a jumbo variety bag of DE razors. These razors really are the best made out there. Not just sharp, but the smoothness of the edge is even throughout 4-5 shaves.</li>
            <li> Awesome blades!--forget the fortune spent on Gillette Fusion Cartridges--- the Feather Blades deliver the closest shave I have ever had when used  with a Mercurer safety razor!.</li>
            <li> I bought the hype behind all the 5 star reviews but must say that while yes, they are super sharp for the first shave, shaves from day 2 forward are rough, the blade drags and irritates my skin. I&#x27;m going back to Derby Extras, they were more consistent for a weeks use for every blade.</li>
            <li> Very sharp razor. I use when growth goes over 2 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d heard about these razors and how sharp they were. I decided to start DE shaving using Derby razor blades, which is a decent blade, especially if you&#x27;re new to it. Once you get the motions down and have a little experience with the process, there&#x27;s no better choice than switching to these Feather razors. You put literally a quarter of the pressure that you would normally use to shave, and the results are amazing. These blades make it so easy, it&#x27;s almost effortless. I&#x27;d get at least one, if not two or more, cuts on my face/neck using the Derby blades. With Feather, not one. I don&#x27;t understand it myself, you&#x27;d think the sharper they are, the more likely you are to cut yourself. But these seem to only cut the hair, and they do it well. A great product, this is what I&#x27;ll be using from now on!</li>
            <li> This is the best shave I have ever had. I reccomend this to everyone, whether veteran de shaver, or novice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be intimidated by how sharp  they are.. Just be careful and enjoy.</li>
            <li> Sharp and Durable what else can you say? Definitely a great value!  These razors will be in my rotation for years!</li>
            <li> i wasent to happy with these blades i have sensitve skin and shave everyother day and i always ended up with cuts</li>
            <li> They had a nice edge to them. Fast delivery. I am quickly becoming a huge fan of both the distributor and the manufacturer. It takes a lot to impress me but very impressed</li>
            <li> Best blades I have used. Take your time to avoid nicks. It cuts through the hairs with no effort at all.</li>
            <li> Feather blades are great and the only ones I use. Why the 2 star rating? It is for the lousy seller - I purchased them on May 29th and they still have not arrived. I ran out and  purchased replacement from Classic Shaving that arrived in less than a week. Use another seller!</li>
            <li> Used many different brands they are the sharpest plus last the longest. Minimum nicks as well. Next time will get 50 pk.</li>
            <li> + Can cut in one pass what took multiple passes with other blades&lt;br /&gt;+ I have sensitive skin and I didn&#x27;t find these to be nearly as unforgiving as other reviewers may suggest&lt;br /&gt;+ Night and day difference from Merkur blades...like comparing a razor to a butter knife&lt;br /&gt;+ Container comes with built in razor disposal to safely dispose of old razor blades&lt;br /&gt;+ Cuts through a course beard without any tug or pull, literally one pass can do the trick&lt;br /&gt;+ With or against the grain is equally smooth and friction-less&lt;br /&gt;+ /- As another reviewer pointed out, these will cut anything off your face that isn&#x27;t flat (i.e. pimple, razor bump, mole, nose, etc)</li>
            <li> The blades are good, just not for my skin/face type.</li>
            <li> I used the Merker blade that came with my razor for about a week before getting my new pack of feather blades in, and I can say that I think the feather are definitely sharper. Other than the week with the other blade, these were the blades I used to learn how to wet shave with. Did I nick myself. Yes. Several times. However, I never needed stitches or a hospital visit, and I have been known to nick myself with a disposable as well. If you respect the blade and take your time, you will be fine even as a beginner.</li>
            <li> Okay I&#x27;m with a few other posters.  These aren&#x27;t &#x27;cut your face off&#x27; blades.  I&#x27;ve been DE shaving for 2 weeks and didn&#x27;t cut myself the first time using this blade.  There should be absolutely no fear of beginners using these blades.  To be quite honest it&#x27;s been my experience that Derby should get the face chewing warning and trust me; it&#x27;s not because Derby&#x27;s are sharp.  In fact I&#x27;d wager I cut myself with those because they were dull after 1/2 my face and I was trying to force the issue.  That&#x27;s not an issue for Feather blades.  They are by far the smoothest cutting blades I&#x27;ve sampled and I plan to stick with these until the manufacturer stops making them.  They give me hands down the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had and zero irritation.</li>
            <li> Not for the beginner. Go easy if your a first time safety razor user. Once you get used to shaving with these blades they&#x27;re spectacular.</li>
            <li> These are certainly the best double edge blades that I have tried, and I have sampled quite a few.  They are some of the sharpest blades available which actually add to their comfort.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than what I had been using and these babies work great in my new safety razor.  I haven&#x27;t tried any other double edge blades and I probably won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I tried a bunch and this is the sharpest! I also use a Feather razor with this blade and will never use anything else! Simply the BEST shave EVER!</li>
            <li> These things are super sharp and thin. They work great in my double edge razor and last around 3-4 shaves and I have thick hair.</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp. Only complaint is the paper wrappers are hard to open. There is some sticky stuff on the blades. I don&#x27;t really have much to compare too though. The blades are much better than the Van Der Hagen blades that came with my razor at least.</li>
            <li> Ive used: derby, rapira stainless, perm sharp supers, shark super chrome, lord stainless, lord platinum class, Wilkinson sword...etc. Feathers beat them all in quality, sharpness, and if you know what you&#x27;re doing, smoothness.</li>
            <li> Like prev reviews have said, you do NOT want this to be the first blade you use. Make sure you have your shaving technique down and you are nicking yourself very little. The blades are super sharp and provide a very smooth shave. Best blades I&#x27;ve used without question.</li>
            <li> First time safety razor user.  Read mixed reviews on the Feather brand.  People said to sharp for new users.  NOT TRUE!!!  They are amazing cut like butter.  No irritation, no pull  just a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> These are SHARP blades.  Amazingly, ridiculously sharp.  I will admit, they are way too sharp a blade for me to handle.  As a relative novice, I can&#x27;t use them without destroying my face.  I have to play a game when I use them: &amp;#34;How little pressure can I apply?&amp;#34; because anything more than the slightest bit of pressure makes my face look like it was shaved by Ramsey Bolton.  But I can&#x27;t blame the blade for that.  That&#x27;s on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you need the sharpest, baddest blade out there, these are the blades for you.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a novice, and don&#x27;t have the best technique yet (like me) then you may have to work your way up to these blades.</li>
            <li> I love the blades..I was going to give up on DE shaving, but these blades and the Feather Popular Razor(TTO) saved the day. What I don&#x27;t understand is the packaging difference between 5 and 10 blade packages..the 5&#x27;s are suppose to be in a yellow package and the 10&#x27;s in a black..that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m finding..everything is in yellow..anyone have any thoughts?</li>
            <li> These blades are very good.  However, they are ridiculously sharp and do not allow for much error.  With one of these, it is better to have your morning coffee after you finish shaving.</li>
            <li> Blades seem a little dull, so one blade only lasts me about one week.</li>
            <li> Feather seems to have a diabolical reputation as being so sharp that an accident with one might send an unsuspecting shaver to the ER with multiple flesh wounds. Actually, that is kind of undeserved. They shave very well with almost no feedback in the form of drag so, yes, be careful. And they leave me with a slight burn after my shave, which I don&#x27;t get with the Merkur blades. But that abates in an hour and there is always after shave or shave balm.  I shave in the shower so my preparation to get a soft beard is good. It&#x27;s the last detail of my routine. I&#x27;m trying others but will keep a good supply of these as a benchmark to judge the others.</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp and a great price.</li>
            <li> I know, another positive review for this product is redundant, but these are undoubtedly the best blades I&#x27;ve used thus far.</li>
            <li> Great blades at a great price.  These are known to be the sharpest blades out there and they won&#x27;t let you down.</li>
            <li> These are the best razor I have ever had. Very smooth shave. I have 5 other name brands in my cabinet and I&#x27;ll be giving them to someone who can use them. This is the only brand I will ever buy.</li>
            <li> Great razors for a great price. These razors are great for those with tough beards. A must add for your DE shaving arsenal.</li>
            <li> These are very sharp, precision blades. I highly recommend them for the experienced shaver. I use these with my Merkur Futur and find this a great combo. Smooth and easy shave. I would caution that these are extremely sharp blades and I would not start out with them as your first blade. If you do use caution and prepare for some cuts.</li>
            <li> Great blades they are really sharp and hold an edge a good while. I have tried several other brands and none are as sharp as these.</li>
            <li> These are the sharpest, most durable, and comfortable blades I have used to date. I have read where others have a hard time with how sharp these blades are and that they get all chopped up. Part of that might be due to excessive pressure being applied to the razor when shaving. With these blades only the lightest touch is needed to mow down whiskers. Just enough pressure to place the razor to the face (with good skin stretching technique) is used and let the razor do the work and this blade performs quite well.</li>
            <li> These are the best double edge razors money can buy - and they aren&#x27;t expensive. I tried a variety pack before and nothing even compares.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, long-lasting blades at an excellent price. Probably worth the long (3 weeks) wait to get them, but I plan to try some other, more readily available, brands to see if there is an alternative that doesn&#x27;t require as much advance order planning as these.</li>
            <li> Feather are the sharpest of blades, wish they had the ceramic coating of Derby, they would put others out of business.</li>
            <li> I had been so eager with trying out a different DE blades, because I had been using crummy, generic blades from retailers (ahem... major pharmacy chain).  I have been using a DE blade for about 4 years now due to sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In comparison to the crummy blades, the Feather&#x27;s feel like a much thinner blade and last a little longer.  The only other DE blade I&#x27;ve tried are the Merkur blades and they work pretty well too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve yet to nick myself while shaving with the Feather&#x27;s, but maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m being really careful as some Amazon reviewers are touting these as some miracle, Japanese steel.</li>
            <li> Like what everyone else says... these blades are sharp. I&#x27;ve been using Merkur blades and on a whim I&#x27;d thought I&#x27;d try these. They are so sharp that any amount of pressure will slice through anything. If you think you&#x27;re man enough to dare and try one of these blades, remember to not put any pressure on it when you shave, just use the weight of the blade or slightly redue the weight of the blade to shave. You will be shoocked at how sharp these are.</li>
            <li> Shaving with a feather is like replacing your DE razor with a laser that effortlessly cuts through your beard.  No, really.  This is the sharpest blade out there, and if you have issues with razor burn or a generally thick beard you will love shaving with a feather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is how I rate razors:&lt;br /&gt;Tier 1: Feather&lt;br /&gt;Tier 2: Personas/Astras: Almost like a feather in sharpness, but not quite there.  Also will wear out a few days earlier for that reason.&lt;br /&gt;Tier 3: Derby/Wilkinson : shaves by pulling hairs.  perfect for those that are looking for a rash on their face from razor burn.  inconsistency in terms of sharpness, some in a pack are better than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if you are worried about nicking tier 3 would be at your top and tier 1 would be at your bottom of choices.</li>
            <li> Excellent blades. Very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, the best blades I have purchased, highly recommend for all DE shavers</li>
            <li> verry sharp will cut u</li>
            <li> I have been able to use these blades for 4 shaves before switching blades.  But the 4 shaves are ULTRA sharp.  I&#x27;ve gotten pretty good about not cutting myself, and irritation is minimal.  I have fine curly hair.  Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I thought this information might be of interest to feather razor users. Of course nearly everything you read about feather razor blades  speaks to the initial sharpness of the blade so I decided to find out, scientifically,  if this was just hype or fact. I use a straight razor to shave 90% of the time but when I find myself in a time bind I revert to my dad&#x27;s old safety razor and, usually, Astra blades. So let&#x27;s get to the &amp;#34;science&amp;#34;. Recently  I bought an inexpensive  &amp;#34;edge sharpness tester&amp;#34; for my straight razors. It is an amazingly accurate instrument and the sharpness scale that is part and parcel of the instrument is based on the sharpness of an ordinary double edge razor blade and as fate would have it &amp;#34;Astra&amp;#34; razor blades were provided with  the unit to demonstrate the &amp;#34;zero point&amp;#34; of the instrument. I tested a few other brands of razor blades that I had acquired over the years and found them to be very similar in sharpness to the Astras but then turned my thoughts to Feathers. I had to order the Feathers and after about three weeks  they arrived. If you shaved with Feathers and thought they were sharper than other blades you were correct. Since my tester is based on the sharpness of a commonly available standard blade I had to adjust downward the standard 50 gram weight of the instrument&#x27;s measurement piston in order to measure the Feathers. The bottom line is this - Astras are a reading of &amp;#34;zero&amp;#34; grams pressure on the instrument&#x27;s measurement scale and Feathers are -20 grams (30 grams instrument piston weight) so one might say that Feathers are 40% sharper than most standard double edge razor blades. I am a little suspicious however about how this very sharp edge will hold up under use. Generally speaking there is no &amp;#34;free lunch&amp;#34; in the edge sharpness world but I haven&#x27;t conducted any comprehensive tests yet so I have not yet formed a solid opinion concerning edge durability.</li>
            <li> These are very good quality razor blades... they are very sharp and they deliver a very smooth and close shave!</li>
            <li> Perfectly aggressive blade for the under-aggro safety razor</li>
            <li> Not much to say, tried sample packs of blades, like these the best. I ordered them, received them, and use them. They glide over skin with no friction when shaving a days worth of growth. When I don&#x27;t shave for a week or so, they still work great, but understandably aren&#x27;t quite as smooth. But that is to be expected when I am doing the equivalent of sawing through a rainforest with a single edge razor (my facial hair is like wire, sucks I know, but it is what it is).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get a good two weeks out a blade, Could probably push it to a month if I tried to. To put that in perspective though i would kill a Gillette Mach 3 turbo, vibrating, 5 blade cartridge of doom in about a shave and a half.</li>
            <li> Careful, sharp. Blades seem more flexible which to me helps the blade angle. I get more shaves per blade, and better shaves, compared to the cheaper bulk packs. Still way less money than disposable razors, and you&#x27;ll feel the difference on your first pass.</li>
            <li> dont have much experience with safety razor blades, but these see just fine.</li>
            <li> For anyone thinking about getting into shaving with a classic safety razor, everywhere you look will tell you that feather blades are not for beginners.&lt;br /&gt;I love them, no pulling or tugging just clean cutting. although one must be careful with these. one slip and you wont know you cut yourself until the shaving cream starts to turn red and sting.</li>
            <li> Very sharp blades.  Watch out or you will get a nick or cut until you get the feel for these blades. New double edge shavers may want to start out with Derby or a less aggressive blade and then move to these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you order, make sure you factor in enough lead time for processing and delivery. Took around a month from order to delivery.</li>
            <li> Reviewed as being better than the blades included with the razor but I disagree.</li>
            <li> I was new to the DE world and bought 100 Derby razor blades because they were ridiculously cheap.  I have very rough facial hair and I have extremely sensitive skin that turns red and looks terrible when I don&#x27;t have a good shave.  Well, with the Derby blades I never was able to get a good shave and almost threw in the towel on DE shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided a sampler pack of razor blades and tried them all.  Among the sampler pack was a Feather blade.  The Feather blade worked better [FOR ME] than all the others with the next best being a Shark blade.  I recommend everyone who is new to the DE world to purchase a sampler pack and find a blade that works for their face.  You&#x27;ll be just like me which is HAPPY!</li>
            <li> These are great blades. I have used Merkur exclusively and thought I&#x27;d try these out. I&#x27;m not sure what everyone is warning about. They are a little sharper, yes, but if you use proper technique, you shouldn&#x27;t have to worry about scraping skin and flesh off your face, as some of these reviews have stated. I have not had a single cut so far. Use a good shave oil (thin one, not a thick one like Art of Shaving, because it tends to clog the razor), shave soap, and let the weight of the razor work for you. You should have no problems. But like anything, if you go too fast and rush, or put too much pressure, then yes, you will probably end up needing a blood transfusion. I think that is the case with any razor you use.</li>
            <li> I finally converted to a safety razor - I bought a couple of the highly rated blades, and definitely prefer this one.  Long weekend camping trip - no problem, took everything off (face and head) nice and smooth.  Using the cartridge blades was never very pleasant with a 3-4 day growth.  Very glad I made the switch!</li>
            <li> I like these razor blades but they are sharp. Any blemishes or bumps on the skin will probably bleed. It goes with the shaving experience. I like the price point and I think they last me about 15 shaves per blade...a good product.</li>
            <li> The razors were exactly what I needed.  Very sharp, light, and the perfect shave.  I would buy this again if needed.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t for everyone, as most people will tell you.  No blade is.  But they work far better than anything else I have come across.</li>
            <li> Best blade I have ever used!  Lasts a long time too.&lt;br /&gt;Note:  Shipping took a while but worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!! I migrated from Gillette&#x27;s Fusion, and I am loving it!!!! Way cheaper and last longer.</li>
            <li> These razors are very sharp!  Installed in my Edwin Jagger 89 they were too harsh for my face causing major razor burn but installed in my micro touch one they worked much better.  No razor burn and a nice close shave.  I would highly recommend trying these blades in a less aggressive safety razor.</li>
            <li> I have tried various blades and have never some across anything quite like these Feather blades. They are defiantly the sharpest, and that (if your careful) will give you the best shave of your life. I&#x27;ve had a lot of issues with other blades tugging my stubble and just not quite preforming to my preference. Overall these blades are fantastic and will be the best complement to your shaving kit!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly new to double edge safety razors and these are my second blades coming from merkur. I usually just clean up my neck area and have no problems with the merkur blades. But these.... I don&#x27;t know how much experience I&#x27;m going to need and how much pre shave oil and shaving leather its going to take to work out. I had about 9 small cuts in my neck as soon as I was done using these. I do not recommend these to new users of a safety razor.</li>
            <li> I waited a while before reviewing the seller/product. I wanted to use the razor blades that were ordered and see how they performed. I used the razor blades - they are really really sharp. I haven&#x27;t found better ones here in the US. I will be ordering more razor blades when I run out. Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about these blades. I&#x27;m new to DE shaving but have yet to have any nick at all with them. They last a long time as well. I&#x27;m getting about 7, 3 pass shaves with each blade before I basically decide to go to a new one. It&#x27;s not that they get dull but they&#x27;re simply not as wicked sharp as a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These will be the only blades my Merkur will see.</li>
            <li> My husband says these are great blades. He told me he wants me to reorder them next time he needs blades.</li>
            <li> These blades are great. I use them in my shavette and they are by far the best blades I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> They are a bit pricier than other options, but nothing seems to work as well as these blades for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are sharp and require a light touch, but any wetshaving system requires care in terms of pressure used.  I find I can use less passes, and so my skin is less irritated.  Of course, your usage and skin will differ, so consider buying small quantities of multiple brands before buying in bulk.  I have a box of 100 Derby blades I dearly regret buying from when I started.</li>
            <li> Super sharpe, you cant buy sharper blades better know what your doing if your buy feather. If you are new to wet shaving try Merkur or just take your time if you dont you will pay for it. I speak from experience...</li>
            <li> These blades seem to be love them or hate them. I personally love them. They are not for the novice shaver by any means but for those of us that know how to work our faces with a DE razor, these blades are incredible. I shave against the grain daily without any irritation. I couldn&#x27;t do that with any other razor I&#x27;ve tried. Pair this blade with a good shave cream (I like Taylor of Old Bond Street the best) and you have a winning combination.</li>
            <li> Was told by a friend that these were some of the best razors and he had tried many.  They last for several shaves, much more than any Fusion or disposable.</li>
            <li> Very sharp de blades for the money.  Still using them because I haven&#x27;t found any better for me.</li>
            <li> I love these razor blades. They are the only ones I will use because the give me a close and comfortable shave at a great price.</li>
            <li> Like many guys, I&#x27;ve read the reviews about these blades and was hesitant to try them.  I started DE wet shaving just after Christmas and was re-learning how to shave.  I had visions of my face getting sliced off my skull and permanent damage caused by a daily grooming product.  Such silliness.  This week I loaded a Feather from the pack that had been sitting in the medicine cabinet for the past month, checked my health insurance coverage and started shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like ANY razor blade, proper handling and technique avoids any mishaps with a Feather.  It is a very sharp blade, noticeably more sharp than a Derby or 7O&#x27;Clock green.  But that is what makes it a safer blade to use in my opinion.  Like using a sharp knife, a sharp razor blade eliminates the need to press down or use any unnecessary force.  Just guide the razor&#x27;s head along your face with no pressure against the skin and be rewarded with a close, comfortable shave that needs only 2 passes.  The only thing that makes using a Feather different than most is the sensitivity of your blade angle.  Feathers were more prone to give me some razor burn if I wasn&#x27;t precise with my blade angle.  Wilkinson Swords and Astra SP&#x27;s were more forgiving in this regard, perhaps because of their coating.  But this lesson wasn&#x27;t fatal, nor did my face fall off.  It was after one particular shave where I rushed a bit, the burn healed in a day and I learned something more about DE shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are a bit expensive compared to most other decent blades, but they&#x27;re incredibly less expensive than cartridges.  I can get 5 shaves out of a blade, 2 passes each shave.  So they&#x27;re still a good bargain and they are quality blades.  Fear them not, and enjoy.</li>
            <li> I switched from Derby, which are not one of the sharpest blades, to Feather, which are ninja sword sharp.  Care must be taken when using these, or you will end up looking like the Joker (Heath Ledger, not Nicholson).  The safety razor I use is mild, so I was able to get a close shave without cutting the crap out of my face.</li>
            <li> MUCH better than the Derby blades that initially came w/ my Edwin Jagger</li>
            <li> my son uses the old style razor blades ans he just love this blades and the price is just unbelievable</li>
            <li> Tried lots of blades. The PolSilver was my favorite until I tried Feather. These are the sharpest and give me the best results with minimal burn using a Merkur 34C. Good for 4-5 excellent shaves, but that&#x27;s just me. Ordered Pacific Shaving Company blade oil to see if it really extends blade life. I have used a variety of their other products and never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> I know feelings run strong on the topic, so I tread lightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my medium weight, medium coarse beard I have had equally satisfying shaves with both the Feather and Personna.  As a matter of course,  with each I get three shaves and replace the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is purely personal preference.  No right answers on this test. Buy some of a few brands and see what works for you.  I&#x27;ve settled on the Personnas, which are pretty inexpensive.  Feathers ard good too, just  more money.</li>
            <li> High quality blades for a reasonable price. As others have noted, these blades are indeed very sharp. I have been using them for a couple of years now, and I will continue to buy them in the future.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re certainly sharp. I would encourage anyone who is trying new razors to get a variety pack and see how you like them before purchasing in quantity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feathers have a great reputation, and I like them. For me, they cut cleaner compared to others I&#x27;ve used (Merkur, Personna, Derby, and Astra) but do seem to dull a bit faster. In other words, I get fewer shaves, that are very clean, from one razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To re-iterate, though, I&#x27;d encourage anyone to try a sampler first. (Look to the variety of 1 and 5 star reviews for these razors on Amazon as evidence.)</li>
            <li> These are the sharpest blades ever and get a bbs shave everytime. The blades last a few shaves (I have nasty thick facial hair and tend to nick blades like Gillette Fusion cartridges). Amzing shave and amazing price!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality blade. This was the first brand I purchased, I got lucky. I&#x27;ll try others just to have a variety, but this will always be in my arsenal.</li>
            <li> Feather blades are the best razor blades I have ever used. I&#x27;ve been using a safety razor for a few years now, and I had felt completely happy with my usual Derby HD blades until now. Having tried Feather, I&#x27;m never going back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How Feather is Different:&lt;br /&gt;-With Derby there was always a loud &amp;#34;carbonated drink near my ear&amp;#34; popping as I could hear the individual hairs being cut. With Feather, there&#x27;s a soft and more &amp;#34;bacon frying in the next room&amp;#34; sound. I could instantly hear the difference. Talk about wow factor.&lt;br /&gt;-With Derby I could never safely make an against-the-grain pass on my neck. I had assumed that this was due to some super-manly neck hair and did my best. With Feather, my against-the-grain neck pass felt about as rough as and old with-the-grain pass on Derby. Amazing difference.&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;ve tried Merkur blades direct from the factory, Meijer brand, Shark, and Derby HD. I&#x27;ve probably sampled a few others that slip my mind. None come even close to Feather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the Warnings:&lt;br /&gt;-Most people say Feather is &amp;#34;too sharp&amp;#34;, and that you can cut your face up if you&#x27;re not careful. Personally, my first passes were butter-smooth and irritation-free. My first clean against-the-grain pass in ages resulted in far less injury than any similar attempt with any other razor.&lt;br /&gt;-I did notice a bit more stinging all over my face when I did a pass with a styptic, but I think this is related to how closely the razor passed over my face, so that&#x27;s a good thing. My wife remarked that my face was as smooth two days later as it normally is after a normal shave with Derby- my shave with the Feather was just that thorough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My kit:&lt;br /&gt;-To give you some context for how I&#x27;m using the Feather. I use William&#x27;s Mug Shave Soap (found at a pharmacy for about a dollar), a Tweezerman brush (cheap but effective), and a Parker 99R razor (has the fancy butterfly close, but otherwise is very standard). So I don&#x27;t have any expensive equipment, and just switching to Razor has made this much of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re completely new to DE safety razors, I might still recommend Derby blades just because they&#x27;re fine for training and anything to help your confidence is a good thing. But for anyone who cares about a close shave, Feather brand is a must.sive equipment, and just switching to Razor has made this much of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re completely new to DE safety razors, I might still recommend Derby blades just because they&#x27;re fine for training and anything to help your confidence is a good thing. But for anyone who cares about a close shave, Feather brand is a must.</li>
            <li> I found these no better then a much cheaper shark line of blades?  Fine, but nothing special with a premium price.</li>
            <li> Had been using Merkur double edge blades in Merkur and Gillette adjustable razors and the Feather blades are better yet.  Am a convert.  Very pleased with sharpness and comfort.</li>
            <li> I tried the Derby blades which came with my razor.  They were ok.  Next I tried the Gillette silver blue razors.  They too were just ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was about to give up and go back to my old cartridge razor when I read the reviews on the feathers and made the purchase.  These blades are fantastic!  They give a great shave.  Spots I had trouble shaving before now are clean shaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend getting alum as well since de razors can nick at times.  Most of my nicks are due to impatience or trying to shave using bad technique.  Having alum cleans up the nicks.</li>
            <li> The blades arrived from Thailand and took forever to arrive, but it was worth the wait.  After trying Merkur, Astra, and Wilkinson-Feather is the sharpest and give the best shave. BUT you do have to be careful not to go over the same spot too often otherwise there will be a burning sensation afterwards in that area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From my somewhat limited experience in DE razor I think I found a good way to pick a razor blade, I will share it with fellow Amazonians:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1-Ignore all comments like this blade is too dull for me, this one is too sharp and cut my face...and don&#x27;t be discouraged to use sharp blades.  If your face has revealed it&#x27;s manhood, you can be trusted with sharp blades.  Also, using sharper blades does not make you more manly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2-There is a rough approximation of blade sharpness (available on various sites online) that you want to match with the COARSNESS of your facial hair, NOT by how much facial hair you have (this point I did not understand until I ventured into DE blades).  I knew I had thick hair on my head because the barber always gets sweaty trying to cut it and they always point out how hard it is too cut (it has broken scissors in the past).  I suspect I have thick facial hair as well but it&#x27;s not lush (ie each hair is thick but they are spread out from each other).  I notices that the sharper the blade I used, the better the shave and the LESS irritation.  Why is this so? If the blade is not sharp enough, the razor can go into the hair follicle but can&#x27;t fully chop the tree down. Instead, it pulls it up, along with the skin, which then gets cut/irritated by the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) If this is the case, why shouldn&#x27;t everyone use these blades?  These blades do cause SLIGHTLY more irritation against the skin from the sharpness, which is most noticeable when I go over hairless part of my face, like the upper cheek (maybe hair lifts the razor slightly above the skin?)  For someone who doesn&#x27;t have thick hair follicles, this slight irritation comes without any benefits (since a duller blade can cut the hair just fine).  Because of this, technique/lather/aftershave become more important. If you buy good shaving cream, a foaming brush, have some aftershave, and have practiced DE shaving for a week (using the blade that came with your razor) you are ready for these blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take home point: if you feel the razor get &amp;#34;stuck&amp;#34; or pulls your hair when it is going with the grain, you need a sharper blade.  Dull blade with thick hair give much worse irritation than sharp blade with thick hair.  You probably don&#x27;t need sharp blades if your hair is thin/soft though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to shaving with a safety razor, and have had very few problems cutting myself with these.  Any nicks have been due to getting used to shaving with a real razor, not the blades.  I feel that these offer a very close shave, I don&#x27;t see any reason to try anything else</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Puertorican with thick black hair that grows extremely quick.  I first tried Derby blades and also some random blades that came with my razor, but they were just ok.  Then I decided to try these, since I kept hearing such good reviews on Feather blades.  Wow! They cut so much better, easier, almost no irritation at all.  The price difference from these and other brands is not that much more honestly.  I&#x27;m guessing these might be overkill for people with less extreme hair, but really you just have try different blades until you find one you like.</li>
            <li> They seem to be really sharp, Which may be why I don&#x27;t like them, no disrespect to the manufacturer, they are just not for me.</li>
            <li> I just started shaving with a safety razor and have been trying out different blades. These blades exceeded my expectations and they provide an extremely close shave. Also, they were shipped to me with prompt service!</li>
            <li> I was using cheap blades from CVS before these and I will never go back. They are sharp and they don&#x27;t pull or tug on my beard. Feather blades are the way to go.</li>
            <li> Purchased these blades bases on the reviews and thought I would save a little money.  I used the Dorco blades prior and they are inferior compared to the Feathers, and last much longer.  Going on my 3rd week on the same blade and shave every 2 days.  No ingrown hairs either.  Will definitely be purchasing them from now on.</li>
            <li> Everyone is going to have a different face with different specs and preferences. Some blades are more flexible, some of them last a while- so on, so forth. There is no &#x27;one ultimate blade&#x27; that everyone will love best. That being said, there is one thing that can&#x27;t be denied... Feathers are SHARP. The blades are a little more stiff than some of the other big wig primo razors, and they don&#x27;t keep their edge as long as some I&#x27;ve tried, but I come back to them when I want to feel baby, baby soft with the closest shave in the universe. Sometimes, this closeness of shave is just too close... Other times, it&#x27;s exactly what you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are made with precision and let me repeat, SHARP. They&#x27;re so sharp that when shaving I&#x27;ve sliced off tiny razorbumps I didn&#x27;t even know I had without even feeling it whatsoever. Due to them being so incredibly sharp, no pressure is required while shaving, just let the razor glide along and do what it does best, cut hair like it&#x27;s butter.</li>
            <li> These are allegedly the sharpest blades out there. I believe it.  After the first few trips across my face it would be more than willing to attest to that through the blood. They are all I use now. Cheaper and sharper than the multi-blade cartridges, if you&#x27;re using double edge blades give these a try.</li>
            <li> The sharpest blades...period.  Maybe not for the rookie, but nothing to be afraid of once you&#x27;ve honed your technique for a while.</li>
            <li> read the reviews folks.  these are the sharpest de blades available.  If you don&#x27;t have your technique down, don&#x27;t even bother with these.  You will not be able to ascertain whether this is the blade for you, or not.&lt;br /&gt;I use feathers no weekends, or in the am if I only have time for a single pass.  otherwise, I feel pretty strongly that personnas are my absolute favorite de blades.&lt;br /&gt;they&#x27;re incredibly smooth, and also sharp.  These are incredibly sharp.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;proper&amp;#34; lather, and are &amp;#34;on the fence&amp;#34; about whether to go ATG, or not certain about every aspect of a wet shave, don&#x27;t use these.&lt;br /&gt;The moment you loose concentration, don&#x27;t ge tthe perfect blade angle, or what ever, you will bleed.&lt;br /&gt;for those that are experienced, and prefer the sharpest posssible blade, they&#x27;re the best.</li>
            <li> Before getting into the world of Safety Razor shaving I read a lot of review regarding razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;Being a woodworker I know that using a dull blade or cutting tool can lead to poor quality products and is dangerous for the operator.  I know woodworking is very different than shaving but this lesson is transferable.  However, I do use a Merkur Progress Double Edge Safety Razor #500.  It&#x27;s adjustable so I can make the cut more or less agressive.  So there is a possibility that your fixed safety razor cuts agressively and therefore this blade may be too sharp for your shaving style.  Though I&#x27;m sure if you take your time and adjust your technique it should be fine.</li>
            <li> Perfect.Super light and very sharp.Have had many shaves off of one blade and much cheaper than buying disposables.Will definitely stay using.</li>
            <li> If you want an insanely sharp blade, then you need to try these Feathers. I would almost go as far as saying that if you&#x27;re not an experienced DE shaver, hone your skills with something else first. These blades give a great shave, but aren&#x27;t very forgiving if mistakes are made with your technique.</li>
            <li> These are the BEST blades for a DE razor user.  Not for beginners per say.  You can easily slice yourself up.  But get a few months of experience under your belt and you can handle these.</li>
            <li> Great razors out of Japan.  The steel feels smooth against my skin, and they are razor sharp.  Much moreso than the cheaper brands, and worth it for a cleaner, smoother, and more comfortable shave.  With these especially, shaving cream is a must, but still worth it.</li>
            <li> great price,good product and delivered on time in mailbox.</li>
            <li> After all the hype, I expected a closer and easier shave.  After using two packages of blades, the shave is no better than my Gillete Sensor.</li>
            <li> Sharp but don&#x27;t last mor than one shave. Note I shave my head and face everyday.</li>
            <li> Looking for a close shave?  Don&#x27;t buy these.</li>
            <li> I have tried and used a bunch of different brands and have found that these blades work very well, the sharpest that I have used so far and last the longest.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been DE shaving for about three weeks now.  I&#x27;ve tried a few different blades.  I read the reviews regarding &amp;#34;Feather&amp;#34; razor blades and ordered the 20 count offer.  I must admit, I was a little apprehensive about trying these out, due to all the comments about their sharpness!  After my first shave with these blades I was hooked!  My next order will be for the 100 count!  Granted, I only tried about three other different brands, but they all left me with irritated skin, razor bumps and weepers.  I don&#x27;t have a very coarse or particularly heavy beard, but my hair does grow weird in all directions, especially on my neck area and chin.  I was having to make several multiple passes in all directions with the other blades.  The Feather blades just glided right through my beard, requiring minimal passes for the closest shave ever, with no irritation!  Yes, you do have to be careful and have your technique down.  I use the lightest touch imaginable with my razor, paying careful attention to the angle of the shaving head at all times.  So, the bottom line is don&#x27;t be afraid to try out these blades, even if you&#x27;re new to DE shaving.  Take your time, pay attention to your technique and you&#x27;ll be rewarded with the best shave ever!</li>
            <li> Good blades, but they seem to dull faster than other blades that I have used (i.e. Shark).  They may start out with a sharper, finer edge, but they dull faster and have to be replaced sooner.  I went through an order of 50 blades and was happy, so still consider these very good blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would prefer that they not use plastic in their packaging.  Is there really a need for a hard plastic &amp;#34;box&amp;#34; to hold 5 blades?  And do they need to be wrapped in plastic with a pull string that is difficult to find the end of without my glasses?  I use this shaving method in part because I do not have to throw away cartridges every time I change the blade, I would feel better if my razor blades were package in paper &amp;#34;box&amp;#34; that would be better for the environment to dispose.</li>
            <li> Yes...they are expensive. But if your into old school shaving, ya gotta try these. They may last about 3-4 shaves. But if you like a clean shavin BBS face then these blades are it. Oh yea, they are sharp too. Be careful. Don&#x27;t let that shy you away. Great blade in old school razors like DE Gillette&#x27;s.  I use them in my Fatboy, Redtip and super speeds. Great shave. Does well in Merkur Slant too for me.  If your new to wet shaving you may want to get them in a sampler pack first to see if they are for you.</li>
            <li> I am a wet-shaving, Double Edge, traditional shaver.  After sampling many (Dorco, Wilkinson, Gilette, Bic, et al.) blades, I tried the Feather and this thing is like a surgical scalpel!  Extremely sharp blades (so pay attention) but I get more shaves, and closer shaves, than I ever did before.  Awesome product!</li>
            <li> To each his own as far as brands of blades go, but the Feathers are by far my favorite. The thinner blade allows a much closer shave in my opinion and while I don&#x27;t get as many shaves out of a Feather blade as others, I still find the closeness factor to be worth it.</li>
            <li> Feather Japan tops about 4 weeks to ship this.  I knew this going in,  but I was surprised it actually took that long. The razors are really nice  though. And the price is right. So I won&#x27;t dock any stars since they told me it would take that long. Just a little shocking after so many 2 day shipments</li>
            <li> Good product- well worth it</li>
            <li> I have very thick facial hair and have had difficulties with many other blades.  I tried the Feathers based on the continued praise they receive on Reddit. That praise is well-earned.  These gave me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had, and they will be my new mainstay from here on out.</li>
            <li> Nice sharp razors.  Makes single blade shaving a pleasure.</li>
            <li> Decided to back to the old ways of shaving. Put this blade into my new razor and started to shave, thought the blade was in wrong and not touching my on the first swipe but the whiskers were totally gone. Wow these feather blades are awesome..</li>
            <li> Fender Blues have always been a favorite they are nice and sharp and and worth the price</li>
            <li> Best shave I ever had!</li>
            <li> Since it would be unwise to shave with a katana or even wakizashi, thank goodness the Japanese-made Feather razor blades are available for wet shavers. These are by far, the sharpest and cleanest cutting blades around. No matter what safety razor you may wield, you can be assured if you put a Feather in it, you are that much closer to that BBS or DFS all of us are trying to achieve. Now using a blade that has the reputation of being the sharpest on the market, behooves the shaver to get their technique down, or suffer the consequences. Overall, these blades are great. With the right touch, a close clean shave can be obtained. Happy shaving...</li>
            <li> Have used safety razors for 20 yrs now , these blades are the sharpest and longest lasting so far. I was so happy , i sent 20 to my dad and he is now recommending to his friends.</li>
            <li> These will slice your face to pieces</li>
            <li> These were the second blades I ever tried. I started with the Merkurs, which kind of tugged and pulled. I don&#x27;t have that problem with the Feathers as long as my angle is sufficient. Just buy them. You know you want them.</li>
            <li> First impressions is very good</li>
            <li> Feathers are good blades, but imho they are not the best available.  Feathers are almost scary sharp, but they are also not terribly smooth.  They require a little more attention to detail to shave with than other blades.  I also find that they do not last very long, maybe only 2-3 shaves.</li>
            <li> Great blades. Perfect blend of sharpness, longevity and value.</li>
            <li> These blades are super sharp and has a safety disposer in the case so you don&#x27;t have loose blades in the trash</li>
            <li> I just loved the package and the way it was presented. I will order again. And shipping was excellent. Thanks</li>
            <li> These took forever to ship to the U.S. but they&#x27;re great blades. Samurai sharp so there&#x27;s not a lot of room for error, make sure you&#x27;ve got the hang of DE shaving first before getting these. Not only are they sharp but they stay sharp. Well worth the money</li>
            <li> the best blade i have used so far.no nicks,no complaints.well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I am sorry to say that I wasted $6 for this junk. I suspect alot of reviews posted here are fake as these so clled blades are not even a par with the cheapest products found in the the US.</li>
            <li> The sharpest of the bunch. Very long lasting. Double edge safety razors continue to blow any modern overpriced razors out of the water! More sturdy and far greener!</li>
            <li> Excellent blade...if you&#x27;re looking for a very sharp blade...this is it.  I have used Derby and Personna and this blade comes out on top.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Derbys, Sharks, and Personnas, and Feather blades are orders of magnitude sharper/better. They also last longer (At least 5 good shaves for me, versus at tops 3 adequate shaves using other blades).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If these blades are \\&quot;too sharp\\&quot; for your face, I&#x27;d suggest getting a less aggressive safety razor, rather than going for a duller blade. In other words, fault the safety razor, not the blade. It is, after all, the blade itself that is doing the work - safety razors are really just blade holders!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the inexpensive Feather Popular Safety Razor - which is 20 bucks at most - and it does the job fine. It is a non-aggressive safety razor. I started out with this safety razor, and I never had the beginner issues of face cuts and such. Same with the Feather blades - use no pressure at all and you should be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If nothing else, buy the best blades, and get a shave as close to a straight razor shave as possible.</li>
            <li> These are not to be trifled with. Paired w/ &#x27;56 Gillette Redtip these are incredible aggressive. They were seldom comfortable for more than one pass on my neck which is fairly sensitive unless I focused on my technique. They are wicked sharp and will give you an excellent shave, but be awake when you use them. One small mistake has you reaching for the tissue.</li>
            <li> Lots of razors for the price. Good deal, and they give me a nice close shave. Would recommend these razors.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sharp.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheap!&lt;br /&gt;It shaves my ugly mug without leaving stubble behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using the Merkur blades that came with my Merkur razor, and these seem to stand up just as well if not better.</li>
            <li> The best and closest shave I have ever had. So sharp I could use against the hair growth and get a baby butt smooth shave. I haven&#x27;t had a shave this close since the old barber shop days where they used a straight razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several sample packs and always come back to Feather&#x27;s! I have pretty sensitive skin and these are the best for me.</li>
            <li> These razors are the sharpest and last the longest than any others on the market today! I challenge anyone that has done any research on shaving double-edge razors to find one that is more all-around consistent and cleaner than these! Once you have tried these you will never go back to a lesser shaving experience.I have never had a cut or any rash on my face since using these razors!!!!</li>
            <li> Great, beastly blades. Not recommended as a first if you&#x27;re recently switching to wet shaving. Literally surgical quality! These and Astra SP&#x27;s are my go-to blades, but of course this will vary with the user... try many before buying one in bulk!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for the sharpest DE blades available, these won&#x27;t disappoint. Great blades...I get about 5 shaves from each blade, but depending on your beard, your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li> Whooooooo! Really great blades. I have been using persona and have really liked them as well. Im relatively new to DE shaving and have experimented around. Ive done Derby, Crown also, and neither come close to Persona, and now Feather. At this point, I would have to grade both equal, as I have only used Feather for a week. Highly recommend this blade. I like the fact that they are packaged in individual containers with 10 blades in each. The Persona come in a box of 100. Easier to pack for trips etc. Im obviously nit picking:)</li>
            <li> These blades are economical of course but you have to be very careful when shaving with them, they can cut you easily under the jaw line or whenever shaving the neck area. This problem does not occur with other blades, just this particular brand. Even when I am careful I have still been cut. Some blades worse than others. These blades are just okay and nothing amazing, make sure you have a good lather before attempting to shave with these.</li>
            <li> Quality design, individually wrapped, incredibly sharp.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to try a new double edge blade, look no further than these quality feather blades. The shave is smooth, and lasts quite some time.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend or not recommend these because they didn&#x27;t work for my face as well as my Astra platinums do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing good or bad just not for me. For now its astra platinums.</li>
            <li> Great blades!very close shave!will twofer them for sure!</li>
