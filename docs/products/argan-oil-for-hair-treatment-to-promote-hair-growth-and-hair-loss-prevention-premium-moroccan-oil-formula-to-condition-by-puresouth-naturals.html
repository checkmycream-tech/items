            <li>This is a nice, generous sized bottle of Argan Oil.</li>
            <li>Absorbs nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film, doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy.</li>
            <li>I love to smooth this all over my skin and my hair after a warm shower, it soaks in very nicely and does not leave a greasy film or have an overpowering perfume smell.  </li>
            <li>I mostly use oils on my skin and this one is really nice.  </li>
            <li>So impressed by how great my skin feels by using just a few drops.  </li>
            <li>It is also a great oil to use before hot ironing it.</li>
            <li>Now I like to use oils like this one with a nice light scent and not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>Shiny, healthy looking hair.</li>
            <li>I had just patted the top layer of my hair with my hands, not all the layers.</li>
            <li>I make sure to run my hands through the under sides of my hair now and haven&#x27;t had any more troubles.</li>
            <li>Love Aragan Oil of Morocco for Skin and hair.  </li>
            <li>Love it for the face and hair, my daughter loves using it on her hair.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love Argan Oil, wished I had started using it sooner.  </li>
            <li>Argan Oil is making my skin feel softer and more hydrated.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Oh how I love Argan oil.  </li>
            <li>so yes I would rcommend this if you want softer smoother looking skin :)</li>
            <li>I love the benefits that this oil has been doing my skin and hair.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased to have found this brand of Morocco oil and love that it is organic.</li>
            <li>The packaging is nice and simple but tasteful and the oil is so good!</li>
            <li>Very good consistency and leaves skin and hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I accidentally used too much in my hair and it was really greasy, but I think that I have found the perfect amount.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is absolutely amazing as an all over moisturizer and right now</li>
            <li>I love the way it soaks into my skin quickly and gives me the results that I would like to see.  </li>
            <li>this is very nice for dry skin, it most definitly smooths your skin,  on my face  </li>
            <li>I have noticed a huge improvement in the dryness in my skin.</li>
            <li>This Argon oil of Morocco is so fantastic.</li>
            <li>When I use it, my hair is sleek and smooth and just feels a lot healthier.  </li>
            <li>Like that this is fragrance free</li>
            <li>It is important to me too that this product is paraben free, alcohol free and chemical free.  </li>
            <li>worked great to add extra moisture and softness.  </li>
            <li>Nice applicator to prevent too much from pouring out.</li>
            <li>And most of the time, I&#x27;m right.</li>
            <li>I use a rotating hot iron and since I have been using this Argan oil, my hair SHIMMERS afterwards!!</li>
            <li>This oil has been a great use to keep my daughters curly hair from getting too dry and frizzy at the beginning of winter.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just right!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for over a week &amp; the bottle is still practically full.</li>
            <li>I have been using this Argon oil in my hair and on my pregnant belly for stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for the hair if you use the right amount, but I think there are other things I would rather use on my skin - except if you&#x27;re pregnant.  </li>
            <li>it reduced the appearance of fine lines around the eyes and as you get older you get those creases here</li>
            <li>I put it on right after I get out of the shower</li>
            <li>The Argan oil was the right balance.</li>
            <li>So far this really seems to keep my stomach moisturized better than anything else.</li>
            <li>I have had several different brands and this one is amazing!</li>
            <li>I think everyone will really like this!</li>
            <li>I will be buying more for her in the future!</li>
            <li>Really digging this Argan Oil!</li>
            <li>, just don&#x27;t use to much!  </li>
            <li>My hair looks and feels so much healthier now!</li>
            <li>I actually got this as a gift for my mom and she is loving it so far.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a nice smell like other Moroccan oils that I have used, but it really doesn&#x27;t smell like anything</li>
            <li>I feel my dry skin more smoother and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how that can be because supposedly they are both &amp;#34;100% pure argan oil&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I usually buy the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; brand - the one in the turquoise package I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re familiar with.</li>
            <li>This oil has made a huge difference in only a matter of days.</li>
            <li>The bottle didn&#x27;t say how much to use</li>
            <li>And I really like the 2 oz bottle</li>
            <li>Highly recommend trying it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this oil for your hair-</li>
            <li>I love that it is odorless, I don&#x27;t like heavy scents.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a week now, and my hair is so soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>(Just to be clear, I do NOT have a beard.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve used it in my hair after I get out of the shower and before applying my curly hair products.....</li>
            <li>After two, TWO, applications of this Argan Oil they are soft and supple again.</li>
            <li>I recommend this oil for glowing skin that is soft and luxurious.</li>
            <li>so I used about half a dropper full after washing my hair or a couple of drops on the ends on the days I didn&#x27;t wash.  </li>
            <li>It adds shine to my hair but also stops flyaways which can be a real problem in dry climates.  </li>
            <li>I have the most unruly, thick, coarse, frizzy hair ever!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thinner and weighed my hair down a little more.</li>
            <li>- it lasts a lot longer than you would think because you use only a tiny bit at a time - AND the small bottle is easy to drop in my purse to carry it with me.</li>
            <li>In other cold snaps we have dealt with static and frizz, this year I put a small drop of this oil in her hair a couple times a week and her curls have never looked better!</li>
            <li>It is made of 100% pure organic Aryan, unlike those department store oils that are watered down and contain synthetic fillers and chemicals.</li>
            <li>So far I have been using it on some dry spots and in my hair.</li>
            <li>Much to my surprise, this little bottle of Argan oil has truly come to my rescue.</li>
            <li>I would really only use this for skin areas that you want to stay a little oily or need some intense moisture</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I would really only use this for skin areas that you want to stay a little oily or need some intense moisture</li>
            <li> If you are looking for some natural moisture for these long cold winter months look no further, you are going to love this Moroccan Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> I find that a little really goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using in on my hands daily to help prevent the dry, cracked skin that always happens to me in the colder weather.  </li>
            <li> I have some dry heels that I plan to use this on next.</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate, I have been using this product for a few days</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling healthy and soft especially in the frigid polar vortex temperatures I live in half the year!</li>
            <li> At this time of year my skin is so dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> It took away my dry skin in one application.  </li>
            <li> my skin feels dry, my hair lacks shine and my hands are scratchy.  </li>
            <li> This all-natural, chemical and fragrance-free Moroccan Argan oil is just what I need for my dry skin and hair.</li>
            <li> A little goes a VERY long way, so this bottle should last a long time.</li>
            <li> I used to always have dry cracks on the side creases of my nose but not anymore!</li>
            <li> One recent morning, I did not follow my usual routine applying the oil &amp; later I noticed that my hair did look greasy.</li>
            <li> And it does not make my hair look unwashed dirty and oily like most other oils do!</li>
            <li> Not only does it immediately tame the frizzes, but the long term results are that my hair is noticeably smoother and softer!</li>
            <li> Her hair is less frizzy and healthier looking than it has been in a long time.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t cover the smell of my shampoo and other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of other serums and they either make my hair too oily or the frizz returns in a few hours.</li>
            <li> My cuticles were a mess before this came in.</li>
            <li> It holds up to the other name brand ones I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> I rub it on my face neck and hands every morning after my shower and add a little to the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> If you have coarse thick frizzy hair, you need this!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I mostly use oils on my skin and this one is really nice.  I&#x27;ve gone through quite a few lotions and balms.  Now I like to use oils like this one with a nice light scent and not greasy at all.  I think everyone will really like this!</li>
            <li> This Argon oil of Morocco is so fantastic. I did some research on this argan oil to find out where it comes from. This oil is made by hand in the heart of Morocco from Aryan trees. It is made of 100% pure organic Aryan, unlike those department store oils that are watered down and contain synthetic fillers and chemicals. At this time of year my skin is so dry and flaky. I apply the Aryan oil on my face, throat, arms, legs, practically all over my body. I feel my dry skin more smoother and refreshed. This oil does not leave any oily or greasy residues. I also use it on my hair. I put just a few drops on my damp hair and massage it gently, before blow drying. The results? Shiny, healthy looking hair. I love that it is odorless, I don&#x27;t like heavy scents. thank you for a great product. I give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Argon oil in my hair and on my pregnant belly for stretch marks.  I find that a little really goes a long way.  I accidentally used too much in my hair and it was really greasy, but I think that I have found the perfect amount.  When I use it, my hair is sleek and smooth and just feels a lot healthier.  It doesn&#x27;t have a nice smell like other Moroccan oils that I have used, but it really doesn&#x27;t smell like anything so it doesn&#x27;t cover the smell of my shampoo and other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great at staying oily on my skin, which is GREAT for my growing belly but not so great on the face.  I would really only use this for skin areas that you want to stay a little oily or need some intense moisture help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I think it&#x27;s a good product and would probably get it again.  It&#x27;s great for the hair if you use the right amount, but I think there are other things I would rather use on my skin - except if you&#x27;re pregnant.  So far this really seems to keep my stomach moisturized better than anything else.</li>
            <li> This oil is wonderful.  It took away my dry skin in one application.  Definitely a must have!  I was so sad that I accidentally knocked over my bottle and spilled about half of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is definitely a must have!  Get it!</li>
            <li> A must have for beautiful hair! (Just to be clear, I do NOT have a beard. At all. I used this on my crazy hair.) I have the most unruly, thick, coarse, frizzy hair ever! Drives me crazy. I&#x27;m on a constant quest to find something to fix my hair. Argan oil is the answer! I always say \\&quot;no way is this going to work\\&quot;. And most of the time, I&#x27;m right. Much to my surprise, this little bottle of Argan oil has truly come to my rescue. Not only does it immediately tame the frizzes, but the long term results are that my hair is noticeably smoother and softer! Add to that I put a few drops of the oil on my face at night before bed, and I can see a difference in my skin as well! If you have coarse thick frizzy hair, you need this! And if you don&#x27;t, you can still use this to soften your hair or your skin! My advice: buy more than one!</li>
            <li> I actually got this as a gift for my mom and she is loving it so far. Every time she gets out of the shower, she runs the oil through her hair and we can all tell what a difference it is making. Her hair is less frizzy and healthier looking than it has been in a long time. I will be buying more for her in the future! Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> This is a nice, generous sized bottle of Argan Oil. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a week &amp; the bottle is still practically full. I use Argan Oil on my hair. I have thick, coarse hair. By adding Argan Oil to my daily routine, my hair is softer &amp; shinier. I apply a few drops to my hands, then rub it on my hands for a moment. Then I run my hands into my dampened hair. When I&#x27;m finished, I massage what&#x27;s left on my hands onto my finger nails. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hands greasy at all. One recent morning, I did not follow my usual routine applying the oil &amp; later I noticed that my hair did look greasy. I wasn&#x27;t as thorough about running my hands through my hair that day. I had just patted the top layer of my hair with my hands, not all the layers. I make sure to run my hands through the under sides of my hair now and haven&#x27;t had any more troubles.</li>
            <li> Really digging this Argan Oil! Never having used argan oil more than what is added by the shampoo makers I was a bit nervous to take the plunge! But it isn&#x27;t that hard to get the hang of this stuff. So far I have been using it on some dry spots and in my hair. Results have been good! I do have thinner hair so I use very little there so I don&#x27;t overload it.</li>
            <li> Love Aragan Oil of Morocco for Skin and hair.  Virtually no smell and is not greasy, just don&#x27;t use to much!  Love it for the face and hair, my daughter loves using it on her hair.</li>
            <li> Take my review with a grain of salt because I&#x27;m a bit of a connessieur of argan oil. I usually buy the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; brand - the one in the turquoise package I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re familiar with. This  . . . is not that. It&#x27;s thinner and weighed my hair down a little more. I don&#x27;t know how that can be because supposedly they are both &amp;#34;100% pure argan oil&amp;#34;. I still gave it 4 stars because I did not use this on a beard. I&#x27;m a woman and used it on my hair thinking oil was oil was oil. Nope!</li>
            <li> excelente! Great!&lt;br /&gt;Thks.</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate, I have been using this product for a few days and I love it.  I drop just a few drops on my hair after I wash it and before I style it.  It adds shine to my hair but also stops flyaways which can be a real problem in dry climates.  I use the rest on my hands and I already notice a difference.  Will be buying more!</li>
            <li> I love Argan Oil, wished I had started using it sooner.  So impressed by how great my skin feels by using just a few drops.  Using this not just on my face, but also on my hair and hands.  Usually no matter what I use during the cold weather season my skin feels dry, my hair lacks shine and my hands are scratchy.  Argan Oil is making my skin feel softer and more hydrated.  Like that this is fragrance free so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with my cologne.  It is important to me too that this product is paraben free, alcohol free and chemical free.  It comes with a 100% Money Back offer.  Highly recommend trying it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic, high-quality stuff!! I&#x27;m still learning all the ways I can use this.  So far, I&#x27;ve used it in my hair after I get out of the shower and before applying my curly hair products.....worked great to add extra moisture and softness.  I&#x27;m using in on my hands daily to help prevent the dry, cracked skin that always happens to me in the colder weather.  And I&#x27;m using it on my skin in areas where I get dryer patches.  Really love this stuff!!  I bet there are tons of uses I haven&#x27;t even tried yet!</li>
            <li> I have curly over worked hair that tends to get frizzy with louisiana humidity!  I apply a small amount if the argan oil to my hair in the mornin and it keeps the friz away all day! And it does not make my hair look unwashed dirty and oily like most other oils do!</li>
            <li> This argan oil is great.  It holds up to the other name brand ones I&#x27;ve used in the past.  It leaves my skin feeling healthy and soft especially in the frigid polar vortex temperatures I live in half the year!</li>
            <li> I am an Argan Oil junkie. I love this stuff. For my skin, for my hair, for the tough skin on my feet.  I love it. I have had several different brands and this one is amazing! I love it! The packaging is nice and simple but tasteful and the oil is so good! Not too thin or thick- it&#x27;s just right! I highly recommend this oil for your hair- I put it on right after I get out of the shower and I use this instead of conditioner. Keeps my hair sleek and shiny- It is also a great oil to use before hot ironing it. I use a rotating hot iron and since I have been using this Argan oil, my hair SHIMMERS afterwards!! I LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I have wavy/curly hair that frizzes on the ends. I&#x27;ve tried lots of other serums and they either make my hair too oily or the frizz returns in a few hours. The Argan oil was the right balance. Good price too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a week now, and my hair is so soft and shiny! My hair is so dry and frizzy it desperately needed this! The bottle didn&#x27;t say how much to use so I used about half a dropper full after washing my hair or a couple of drops on the ends on the days I didn&#x27;t wash.  My hair looks and feels so much healthier now!</li>
            <li> Oh how I love Argan oil.  If you have never tried it, wait no longer.  This stuff is absolutely amazing as an all over moisturizer and right now I know I need all of the moisture I can get with the cold dry weather.  I love to smooth this all over my skin and my hair after a warm shower, it soaks in very nicely and does not leave a greasy film or have an overpowering perfume smell.  If you are looking for some natural moisture for these long cold winter months look no further, you are going to love this Moroccan Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> My cuticles were a mess before this came in. After two, TWO, applications of this Argan Oil they are soft and supple again. I have been using it on my daughter&#x27;s curly hair and it is wonderful for that also. A little goes a VERY long way, so this bottle should last a long time. I have some dry heels that I plan to use this on next. I would definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> this is very nice for dry skin, it most definitly smooths your skin,  on my face  it reduced the appearance of fine lines around the eyes and as you get older you get those creases here and there, it makes your pours appear smaller , so yes I would rcommend this if you want softer smoother looking skin :)</li>
            <li> Very  impressed with Argan oil. I had a few friends rave about this but I it took forever for me to decide to order. I am so sad I waited this long I love it! I rub it on my face neck and hands every morning after my shower and add a little to the ends of my hair. I have noticed a huge improvement in the dryness in my skin. I used to always have dry cracks on the side creases of my nose but not anymore! With the winter weather I am so glad I have this to save me from horrible dryness. My hair is also a lot smoother and looks shiny after straightening it even!</li>
            <li> I love the benefits that this oil has been doing my skin and hair.  I decided to use it for my hands and feet after the shower and they are noticeably softer.  I love the way it soaks into my skin quickly and gives me the results that I would like to see.  I recommend this oil for glowing skin that is soft and luxurious.</li>
            <li> Living in south Louisiana has made my daughter&#x27;s hair and my hair a total nightmare from humidity. We are constantly putting something in our hair to combat frizz and every day we are damaging our hair with heat from the straightener. This oil has made a huge difference in only a matter of days. Our hair is noticeably softer and smoother. It makes dealing with my daughter&#x27;s hair a breeze. When treating our hair we have had the great side effect softer hands. My nails and hands are softer too! I recommende this product to every one!</li>
            <li> I started using Morocco oil on my face and neck about 3 months ago.  I have been very pleased with how well my skin has reacted to the Morocco oil.  My skin has great color and clarity.  Friends that see me often are commenting on the smoothness and sheen of my skin.  I am pleased to have found this brand of Morocco oil and love that it is organic.</li>
            <li> This oil has been a great use to keep my daughters curly hair from getting too dry and frizzy at the beginning of winter.  In other cold snaps we have dealt with static and frizz, this year I put a small drop of this oil in her hair a couple times a week and her curls have never looked better!</li>
            <li> This all-natural, chemical and fragrance-free Moroccan Argan oil is just what I need for my dry skin and hair. Absorbs nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film, doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy. I use it daily and sometimes twice a day on my hair ends. And I really like the 2 oz bottle - it lasts a lot longer than you would think because you use only a tiny bit at a time - AND the small bottle is easy to drop in my purse to carry it with me.</li>
            <li> Wonderful oil for skin and hair. Very good consistency and leaves skin and hair soft and smooth. Nice applicator to prevent too much from pouring out.</li>
