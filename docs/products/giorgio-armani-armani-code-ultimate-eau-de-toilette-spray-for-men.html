            <li>I have and have smelled scents that smell nice</li>
            <li>I am loving it.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and is not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Your lady will have very good things to say about Giorgio Armani as well, and hell, we all know that pleasing the ladies is what life is all about, right?</li>
            <li>Smells really good as well like the original Code.</li>
            <li>Excellent for boy friend and male friend.</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>More compliments every time I have it on.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found many that qualify in the categories I mentioned.</li>
            <li>Perfume and cologne is way overpriced as it is, but this is the best price I found on the net.</li>
            <li>If you Love Armani Code as I do (and my lady friend), don&#x27;t expect that since this is the &amp;#34;Ultimate&amp;#34; that you will like the scent.</li>
            <li>and so glad I decided to make the purchase.</li>
            <li>This one is on top of my favorites list.</li>
            <li>Almost all women love it.</li>
            <li>I get SO MANY compliments on this ...</li>
            <li>I would describe Giorgio Armani&#x27;s Armani Code Ultimate as the perfect cologne that every gentleman should have in their collection.</li>
            <li>it smell great and it last all day which is very important for me</li>
            <li>Infinitely times better than the original.</li>
            <li>Definitely a masculin scent which when not overdone will smell great on anyone.</li>
            <li>i do enjoy this spray.</li>
            <li>best armani code yet, if you love the black version you&#x27;ll def enjoy this, highly recommend it to anyone, i got compliments for this every time i went out, smell is amazing not to strong and it lasts long.</li>
            <li>not too sweet, not too strong - just right.</li>
            <li>I really recommend it &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased with the masculine fragrance and the result from using it for the first time.</li>
            <li>This new fragrance is all Code but with a more refine not overly sweet scent.</li>
            <li>Really sexy masculine cologne.</li>
            <li>With me saying that this scent is in that rare category for me.</li>
            <li>it is more of the true smell than the regular code.</li>
            <li>It is certainly true that before buying ANY cologne, you must try a test spray or two at your favorite men&#x27;s counter and then walk around taking care of business for several hours.  </li>
            <li>if you like the armani code you will love the ultimate.</li>
            <li>However, if I had to choose between the original and the ultimate, I would prefer the original.</li>
            <li>Giorgo Amani simply makes colognes and other toiletries that smell good on a man, period!  </li>
            <li>I liked it and other people did as well.  </li>
            <li>Code Ultimate has a beautiful sweet, rich scent but then dry down to a nice dark scent that lure people in out of curiosity.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s there to say, it has a nice scent, not too strong or weak and</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why this Code Ultimate is my new favorite.</li>
            <li>Highly suggested, but try it first if you can.</li>
            <li>I will purchase another bottle very soon.  </li>
            <li>then I know it&#x27;s a real winner</li>
            <li>i really like this one from giorgio</li>
            <li>It is much harsher than Armani Code.</li>
            <li>Im very selective and picky when it comes to perfumes.  </li>
            <li>Having Armani Eau de Nuit which is intense</li>
            <li>When I look for colognes I look for longevity and of course a unique grab your attention instantly type scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never bought cologne online before and will definitely never be doing it again unless its from Macys or the Original manufacturer.    </li>
            <li>Not only is the scent light bodied and fit for everyday wear if desired.</li>
            <li>but it just doesn&#x27;t last or the scent is nice but just average.</li>
            <li>i have bought has smelt absolutely delicious and with a few pumps of the spray has lasted on my shirt at least until i get back at the end of the day and often for 2-3 days.    </li>
            <li>I have been using the Giorgio Amani Code but this new twist to my previous favorite truly deserves its ultimate in its name.</li>
            <li>I have had the previous Armani code, and did not like it as it was too light.  </li>
            <li>But every single dollar worth.</li>
            <li>In fact, I have only received positive comments.</li>
            <li>This is much better than Armani code, it seems to last longer and be a little stronger smelling.  </li>
            <li>Tried it at a dept store and was surprised that it lasted all day.</li>
            <li>Armani is a little pricey but good stuff is not cheap!  </li>
            <li>The general fragrance is smoothing and inviting.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so undesirable that I personally wouldn&#x27;t get near anyone who has it on them.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Smell didn&#x27;t last very long maybe an hour or so</li>
            <li> Ive used multiple Giorgio Armani product such as Armani Code Black, Armani Sport Code and even Armani Code Ultimate.</li>
            <li> Every single bottle of Armani Code</li>
            <li> Still usable.. but not much different from the previous version.</li>
            <li> Product was as expected.</li>
            <li> and  I have 6 other colognes</li>
            <li> so if you want the &amp;#34;it&amp;#34; cologne this one belongs in your collection hands down.</li>
            <li> Please do not allow the cutie pie behind the counter to spray a white piece of cardboard and hand it to you as a sample unless of course, that piece of cardboard resembles your skin!  </li>
            <li> Save yourself the trouble and Armani Code</li>
            <li> Not sure I care what anyone else thinks.</li>
            <li> So far I have never been disappointed with any Armani Cologne.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately a little expensive.</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst purchase I made in a while.&lt;br /&gt;It has horrible feminine scent weighed more toward ladies perfume</li>
            <li> Ultimately Weak Fragrance being sold here.</li>
            <li> Their response was, sorry you don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> Sadly it&#x27;s overpriced.</li>
            <li> and there was a faint undertone that made me feel like i was wearing a knockoff.</li>
            <li> I complained to the that I was very disappointed with the difference.</li>
            <li> I bought this one based on reviews, but am disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Really sexy masculine cologne. Excellent for boy friend and male friend. I just love it. Great cologne. Excellent buy and gift</li>
            <li> I am always getting complements on the smell of it from women. So far I have never been disappointed with any Armani Cologne.</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst purchase I made in a while.&lt;br /&gt;It has horrible feminine scent weighed more toward ladies perfume and it&#x27;s so undesirable that I personally wouldn&#x27;t get near anyone who has it on them.&lt;br /&gt;This type of product should not be marketed at all in my opinion.</li>
            <li> best armani code yet, if you love the black version you&#x27;ll def enjoy this, highly recommend it to anyone, i got compliments for this every time i went out, smell is amazing not to strong and it lasts long.</li>
            <li> Armani Code Ultimate is a must buy.  I will purchase another bottle very soon.  Code Ultimate has a beautiful sweet, rich scent but then dry down to a nice dark scent that lure people in out of curiosity. This juice is perfect for the evening time, dates, and the fall season.  I get about 12 hours of longevity (2 or 3 sprays) and amazing projection.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what happend to the fragrance, but it smells like bug spray. Had to throw away and would never order again.</li>
            <li> Every time that my boyfriend use it I fall in loved... It smell so good I really recommend it &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> I have had the previous Armani code, and did not like it as it was too light.  I bought this one based on reviews, but am disappointed.  Still usable.. but not much different from the previous version.</li>
            <li> Smells good. I wear it because I like the way I smell. Not sure I care what anyone else thinks.</li>
            <li> I tested this product aboard a cruise ship this year.  I liked it and other people did as well.  When the price dropped in my Amazon cart, i bought it and am happy i did.  More compliments every time I have it on.  Test it on yourself because just like all products like this, it smells different on different people.  I am pleased and am happy I purchased.</li>
            <li> When I look for colognes I look for longevity and of course a unique grab your attention instantly type scent. I haven&#x27;t found many that qualify in the categories I mentioned. I have and have smelled scents that smell nice but it just doesn&#x27;t last or the scent is nice but just average. With me saying that this scent is in that rare category for me. When I buy a cologne and I want to spray it on when I&#x27;m going to sleep then I know it&#x27;s a real winner so if you want the &amp;#34;it&amp;#34; cologne this one belongs in your collection hands down.</li>
            <li> Bought this item only on the Armani name and reputation. Couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased with the masculine fragrance and the result from using it for the first time.</li>
            <li> This scent is  the BOMB ! All the women are  holding their hugs longer.  I am loving it. I would recommend  this cologne&lt;br /&gt;to every men,  who like to smell.</li>
            <li> i really like this one from giorgio it smell great and it last all day which is very important for me and i like that. it is more of the true smell than the regular code. if you like the armani code you will love the ultimate.</li>
            <li> This is much better than Armani code, it seems to last longer and be a little stronger smelling.  I have gotten a lot of compliments wearing this.  It smells nice and is not overpowering.  You could wear it at work on for a night on the town.</li>
            <li> Perfume and cologne is way overpriced as it is, but this is the best price I found on the net.</li>
            <li> Smells really good as well like the original Code. However, if I had to choose between the original and the ultimate, I would prefer the original.</li>
            <li> Very nice cologne you won&#x27;t regret it</li>
            <li> If you Love Armani Code as I do (and my lady friend), don&#x27;t expect that since this is the &amp;#34;Ultimate&amp;#34; that you will like the scent. It is much harsher than Armani Code. I complained to the that I was very disappointed with the difference. Their response was, sorry you don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Got several compliments when I wore this. Smells really good.</li>
            <li> Tried it at a dept store and was surprised that it lasted all day. Just arrived from amazon and so glad I decided to make the purchase. Definitely a masculin scent which when not overdone will smell great on anyone. Highly suggested, but try it first if you can.</li>
            <li> Giorgo Amani simply makes colognes and other toiletries that smell good on a man, period!  It is certainly true that before buying ANY cologne, you must try a test spray or two at your favorite men&#x27;s counter and then walk around taking care of business for several hours.  If you still like it, then it is for you!  Please do not allow the cutie pie behind the counter to spray a white piece of cardboard and hand it to you as a sample unless of course, that piece of cardboard resembles your skin!  Armani is a little pricey but good stuff is not cheap!  Your lady will have very good things to say about Giorgio Armani as well, and hell, we all know that pleasing the ladies is what life is all about, right?</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with this one. Im very selective and picky when it comes to perfumes.  This one is on top of my favorites list.</li>
            <li> Almost all women love it. Infinitely times better than the original. Best signature scent in the world. For all seasons. Day and night. Just perfect. Absolutely delicious. I want this stuff in a 6.7 oz bottle. It smells absolutely delicious.. A compliment getter. Thierry Mugler A*Men is on the same level. I can recommend them both.  One of the best fragrances ever made. Sadly it&#x27;s overpriced. Unfortunately a little expensive. But every single dollar worth.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s there to say, it has a nice scent, not too strong or weak and no one was offended by it...lol.</li>
            <li> These is the best that ever had I can not stop wearing it, the girls want to it me when I have it on me I love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Giorgio Amani Code but this new twist to my previous favorite truly deserves its ultimate in its name. This new fragrance is all Code but with a more refine not overly sweet scent. I have had no compliants from family, friends or strangers. In fact, I have only received positive comments. That&#x27;s why this Code Ultimate is my new favorite.</li>
            <li> Ive used multiple Giorgio Armani product such as Armani Code Black, Armani Sport Code and even Armani Code Ultimate. Every single bottle of Armani Code i have bought has smelt absolutely delicious and with a few pumps of the spray has lasted on my shirt at least until i get back at the end of the day and often for 2-3 days.    This cologne does not meet the mark. Smell didn&#x27;t last very long maybe an hour or so and there was a faint undertone that made me feel like i was wearing a knockoff. I&#x27;ve never bought cologne online before and will definitely never be doing it again unless its from Macys or the Original manufacturer.    Take it from me. Save yourself the trouble and Armani Code Ultimately Weak Fragrance being sold here.</li>
            <li> Having Armani Eau de Nuit which is intense I had my doubts if this had really different smell and it does have, both colognes are great, Armani rocks!</li>
            <li> Product was as expected. Did not come in damaged. Will probably buy this product again from the same seller. Thank you!</li>
            <li> not too sweet, not too strong - just right. I get SO MANY compliments on this ... and  I have 6 other colognes</li>
            <li> i do enjoy this spray. a fascinating scent. Armani has done wonders with this one. yet I think that the price should be a bit lower</li>
            <li> I would describe Giorgio Armani&#x27;s Armani Code Ultimate as the perfect cologne that every gentleman should have in their collection. Not only is the scent light bodied and fit for everyday wear if desired. The general fragrance is smoothing and inviting.</li>
            <li> My husbands fave cologne</li>
            <li> I totally recommend this product.</li>
    </ol>
