            <li>This is a very good cream for those pesky wrinkles that appear on your face and neck.  </li>
            <li>Because of the blueberry extract that&#x27;s been added, it&#x27;s a very good anti-oxidant for the skin and for treating wrinkles.  </li>

            <li>A GOOD PRODUCT AND IT-S</li>
            <li>/&gt;After going to bed with the serum and night cream on, I did wake up with a smoother feel to my skin, but that&#x27;s where the good</li>
            <li>It has a bluish color and smells good.  </li>
            <li>for this price, I am delighted.</li>
            <li>maybe not $20 good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it has some great benefits with dedicated use, but here&#x27;s the problem:  </li>
            <li>It has a very strong smell which I don&#x27;t find pleasant</li>
            <li>LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>I like it better!</li>
            <li>My skin looks great and my fine lines are diminishing.</li>
            <li>amazing-</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;Yes To\\&quot; line is amazing.  </li>

            <li>NICE</li>
            <li>I really liked the way this product felt on my skin.  </li>
            <li>It smells kind of medicine like</li>
            <li>So now I have this blueberry night cream which has pleasant, non overwhelming smell and seems to be ok with my skin</li>
            <li>This could be a bonus for those who don&#x27;t like very strong smelling beauty products.</li>
            <li>And while the rest of the YES product&#x27;s smell wonderful, this one nearly makes me nauseous.</li>
            <li>To products tend to have a very pleasant smell, I was surprised at this product&#x27;s lack of smell.  </li>
            <li>To me, this is a very light cream, so I use it during the day.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy the softness and light, airy feeling of the Blueberries LIne!!</li>
            <li>that felt immediately better with this stuff on.</li>
            <li>I would like it a lot better if they would change the fragrance in it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the Yes</li>
            <li>To brand and have switched most of my bath and beauty products to their line</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nothing else had worked but this has :)</li>
            <li>Absolutely, Love all Yes To Products that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I like this product because from date that I use it, my skin looks brighter and better.</li>
            <li>OKAY.</li>
            <li>skin looks better than it ever did.</li>
            <li>I plan to buy it again and also try some more of their products.</li>
            <li>My skin immediately began to look and feel more hydrated.  </li>
            <li>If it smelled better and had SPF 15</li>
            <li>The Yes to Carrots body wash smells better.</li>
            <li>Love all the Blueberry products.  </li>
            <li>This product works better than products that I have used that cost 5 times more.</li>
            <li>I am hoping to see better looking skin</li>
            <li>the more I use it</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m using this as more of a preventive than a treatment.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad that I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>and I love those also,  </li>
            <li>I love the results of this in the morning after sleeping in it, my face looks restored and is still moist, but not oily.</li>
            <li>love this cream.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of it.</li>
            <li>and I would most like purchase it again</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels so much better since I&#x27;ve started using yes to blueberries.</li>
            <li>Plus it smells great, too...not an overpowering blueberry scent, but a nice light scent that is kind of fruity, but not obviously so.</li>
            <li>The cream is smooth, has a nice scent and rubs in easily.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty good stuff</li>
            <li>The best part is that it does not cause breakouts for me at all like most other creams have done.  </li>
            <li>I gave this product 3 stars only because as a moisturizer it IS very good.</li>
            <li>Also, it does seem to create a barrier and eventually gets absorbed and leaves a nice glow in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Just okay, nothing special, didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
            <li>I love many of the YES line of items, including the facial wipes (tomato, cucumber, grapefruit- all good), shower gel, &amp; (carrots) hand cream .  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product to improve the fine lines on my face.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it, smells pretty good too.</li>
            <li>and Yes to Tomatoes, but was surprised (pleasantly) that they have  Yes to blueberries as well.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is very moisturizing, I love the feel!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a heck of a lot cheaper than most \\&quot;night treatment\\&quot; creams, and so far I love it!</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and soaks into the skin without leaving it feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>if any, goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li>I liked how my face feels very supple in the morning.</li>
            <li>i liked how my face feels very supple in the morning.</li>
            <li>Works great along with the daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Good product and my skin under my eyes looks smooth and it&#x27;s holding back the hands of time.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and keeps my face soft.</li>
            <li>I went to Ulta to get some (well, somewhat) professional advice about what kind of lotion I should use.</li>
            <li>, it does not smell like a sweet blueberry body lotion, maybe that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s for night time use.  </li>
            <li>I love the whole line.</li>
            <li>Not greasy, light, yet very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>My skin now looks refreshed, young and healthy.    </li>
            <li>Along with the serum in this line, helps to leave my face looking dewy and fresh.</li>
            <li>She uses it for the eye area to keep it fresh and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>and it has not triggered any breakouts for me, which is why I tried it and grabbed something more natural and plant based because my skin is very sensitive and acne prone, but I feel this is an ideal night cream for acne prone skin that has actually helped calm my skin and keep it clear.</li>
            <li>It would be better without fragrance but not a big deal and worth the moisturizing without breakouts.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to go back to Target and see if I can buy another bottle or two at the discount price since this ended up being such a great skin care investment</li>
            <li>It made my skin feel very soft and seemed a good consistency for my dry winter skin.  </li>
            <li>The product seems a bit pricey for the amount that&#x27;s in the bottle, but hey, you&#x27;re always going to pay extra for the more healthful beauty products.</li>
            <li>The first one was, I was looking for products with blueberry in them and stumbled upon yes to blueberries, which I didnt even know existed.  </li>
            <li>Natural ingredients and cruelty free.  </li>
            <li>does moisturize well and leaves a nice smooth feeling, but I can&#x27;t get past the scent.</li>
            <li>After 3 days of use, I can see a difference in my skin when I first get up in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Seems to work well - haven&#x27;t used long yet, but so far it seems to be really good</li>
            <li>I am new to the whole night cream thing, having just turned 30 last August, but in that time I have tried a bunch and after doing a lot of reading, am trying to phase out most of the chemicals in my life and replace products with more natural ones.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, so I try to stay away from &#x27;retexturizing&#x27; products that contain some kind of acid that will ultimately cause a reaction.  </li>
            <li>so I guess I am just used to the scent of this line, which is very mild to me, especially after it absorbs into your skin</li>
            <li>I spent a lot of money of high priced so called &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; products and find this one works the best for my very dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I love every single item I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I use it morning and night; it&#x27;s rich enough for a night cream right before bed and light enough for a moisturizer before putting on makeup.  </li>
            <li>This is the only \\&quot;natural\\&quot; overnight cream I&#x27;ve tried that really leaves my face feeling smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I would really like to return it.  </li>
            <li>My skin really looks</li>
            <li>The scent is intense.</li>
            <li>But it has so much fragrance that it triggers my migraines.  </li>
            <li>Not too much smell,</li>
            <li>The whole</li>
            <li>chose to rate this product at 4 stars instead of 5 because I expected it to smell better than it does.  </li>
            <li>Smell quite overpowering especially near the eye.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice much wrinkle reducing</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s clear and the fine lines I was starting to notice are gone.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s really softened and smoothed my skin and appears to have really helped clear up some lingering acne issues.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is the scent, it&#x27;s strong at first, thankfully it fades pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>So if you still have some acne problems, I highly recommend this product for a night time moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This line came highly recommended to me….too</li>
            <li>The scent is fruity( lemony), and can be a little overwhelming upon application.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick but absorbs easily and quickly.</li>
            <li>She normally uses department store brands like Shiseido and LaMer, but wanted to try this after seeing it on an ad.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for a very long time for a product for aging skin that actually made my skin look better and didn&#x27;t cost a fortune.  </li>
            <li>, you have it right, the same ingredients!!</li>
            <li>Has tightened my loose eyelids and firmed them up tremendously.</li>
            <li>I usually never notice scents in lotions or creams, but for whatever reason, this face cream triggers me.</li>
            <li>This works better than any other non toxic facial cream I have used.</li>
            <li>Just a tip if you are combating blemishes like I am--I often layer a salicylic night peel on my skin first, let the peel set in for about 5 minutes, and then moisturize with the Yes to Blue Berries night cream, so that&#x27;s the method that&#x27;s worked wonders for me!</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s almost like strong dead flowers).</li>
            <li>I also can see the results of using natural things on my skin instead of using the other brands products (full of chemical products inside)</li>
            <li>I tried the Yes to Blueberries night cream because I wanted something natural for my 50-ish skin.</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t advise getting this if you have sensitive skin and allergies.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why the company adds so much fragrance, especially since they take measures to be an eco and health-friendly product.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance in it makes my eyes water if I rub it anywhere near my eyes and if I rub my face and it gets close to my eyes, they water uncontrollably.</li>
            <li>This makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>It rubs completely into the skin leaving no residue.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I woke up in the morning after putting it on the night before and my skin was soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>This makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>You will be able to feel it on your face, as it is rather thick, but I don&#x27;t mind that.</li>
            <li>Instead, I usually just stick to using mosturizing/cleansing wipes which do the job fine.  </li>
            <li>Third and final reason, which seems to highlight all the previous points is that I&#x27;ve been pleased with Yes to _ products and my satisfaction with their line keeps me a believer.</li>
            <li>The only reason I am not giving five stars is the scent is a little strong</li>
            <li>This may not be a very expensive product, however it is a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The only other facial cream that I can recall that I can say that was fine</li>
            <li>In the summer, this stuff can be tough to use because it is a little bit thicker and may make you sweat more easily, but as it&#x27;s a night cream, it&#x27;s not too big of an issue, though you may sweat it all off.  </li>
            <li>, it takes some extra time to rub it into the skin, but as soon as you have rubbed it down to an even light white layer, leave it alone.  </li>
            <li>I also prefer natural products whenever possible.  </li>
            <li>I started to notice the fine lines that would lead to crow&#x27;s feet around the tops of my cheeks and some lines across my forehead just from having poor skin texture that left creases from normal expressions.  </li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way with this, just a little dab will do you, but it absorbs very well and quite naturally, your skin will soak it right up.</li>
            <li>On the verge of 36, I was searching for a anti wrinkle cream for my sensitive, sebborhic dermatitis prone, dry and oil skin.</li>
            <li>Pump only half way though as too much comes out.</li>
            <li>I tend to get very dry sensitive skin in the winter, but not when I use this at night.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Plus it smells great, too...not an overpowering blueberry scent, but a nice light scent that is kind of fruity, but not obviously so.</li>
            <li> The cream is smooth, has a nice scent and rubs in easily.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty good stuff</li>
            <li> The best part is that it does not cause breakouts for me at all like most other creams have done.  </li>
            <li> I gave this product 3 stars only because as a moisturizer it IS very good.</li>
            <li> Also, it does seem to create a barrier and eventually gets absorbed and leaves a nice glow in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Just okay, nothing special, didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
            <li> I love many of the YES line of items, including the facial wipes (tomato, cucumber, grapefruit- all good), shower gel, &amp; (carrots) hand cream .  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product to improve the fine lines on my face.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it, smells pretty good too.</li>
            <li> and Yes to Tomatoes, but was surprised (pleasantly) that they have  Yes to blueberries as well.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is very moisturizing, I love the feel!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a heck of a lot cheaper than most \\&quot;night treatment\\&quot; creams, and so far I love it!</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and soaks into the skin without leaving it feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> if any, goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li> I liked how my face feels very supple in the morning.</li>
            <li> i liked how my face feels very supple in the morning.</li>
            <li> Works great along with the daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Good product and my skin under my eyes looks smooth and it&#x27;s holding back the hands of time.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and keeps my face soft.</li>
            <li> I went to Ulta to get some (well, somewhat) professional advice about what kind of lotion I should use.</li>
            <li> , it does not smell like a sweet blueberry body lotion, maybe that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s for night time use.  </li>
            <li> I love the whole line.</li>
            <li> Not greasy, light, yet very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> My skin now looks refreshed, young and healthy.    </li>
            <li> Along with the serum in this line, helps to leave my face looking dewy and fresh.</li>
            <li> She uses it for the eye area to keep it fresh and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> and it has not triggered any breakouts for me, which is why I tried it and grabbed something more natural and plant based because my skin is very sensitive and acne prone, but I feel this is an ideal night cream for acne prone skin that has actually helped calm my skin and keep it clear.</li>
            <li> It would be better without fragrance but not a big deal and worth the moisturizing without breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to go back to Target and see if I can buy another bottle or two at the discount price since this ended up being such a great skin care investment</li>
            <li> It made my skin feel very soft and seemed a good consistency for my dry winter skin.  </li>
            <li> The product seems a bit pricey for the amount that&#x27;s in the bottle, but hey, you&#x27;re always going to pay extra for the more healthful beauty products.</li>
            <li> The first one was, I was looking for products with blueberry in them and stumbled upon yes to blueberries, which I didnt even know existed.  </li>
            <li> Natural ingredients and cruelty free.  </li>
            <li> does moisturize well and leaves a nice smooth feeling, but I can&#x27;t get past the scent.</li>
            <li> After 3 days of use, I can see a difference in my skin when I first get up in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Seems to work well - haven&#x27;t used long yet, but so far it seems to be really good</li>
            <li> I am new to the whole night cream thing, having just turned 30 last August, but in that time I have tried a bunch and after doing a lot of reading, am trying to phase out most of the chemicals in my life and replace products with more natural ones.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so I try to stay away from &#x27;retexturizing&#x27; products that contain some kind of acid that will ultimately cause a reaction.  </li>
            <li> so I guess I am just used to the scent of this line, which is very mild to me, especially after it absorbs into your skin</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of money of high priced so called &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; products and find this one works the best for my very dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love every single item I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I use it morning and night; it&#x27;s rich enough for a night cream right before bed and light enough for a moisturizer before putting on makeup.  </li>
            <li> This is the only \\&quot;natural\\&quot; overnight cream I&#x27;ve tried that really leaves my face feeling smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I would really like to return it.  </li>
            <li> My skin really looks</li>
            <li> The scent is intense.</li>
            <li> But it has so much fragrance that it triggers my migraines.  </li>
            <li> Not too much smell,</li>
            <li> The whole</li>
            <li> chose to rate this product at 4 stars instead of 5 because I expected it to smell better than it does.  </li>
            <li> Smell quite overpowering especially near the eye.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice much wrinkle reducing</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s clear and the fine lines I was starting to notice are gone.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s really softened and smoothed my skin and appears to have really helped clear up some lingering acne issues.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the scent, it&#x27;s strong at first, thankfully it fades pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> So if you still have some acne problems, I highly recommend this product for a night time moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This line came highly recommended to me….too</li>
            <li> The scent is fruity( lemony), and can be a little overwhelming upon application.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick but absorbs easily and quickly.</li>
            <li> She normally uses department store brands like Shiseido and LaMer, but wanted to try this after seeing it on an ad.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for a very long time for a product for aging skin that actually made my skin look better and didn&#x27;t cost a fortune.  </li>
            <li> , you have it right, the same ingredients!!</li>
            <li> Has tightened my loose eyelids and firmed them up tremendously.</li>
            <li> I usually never notice scents in lotions or creams, but for whatever reason, this face cream triggers me.</li>
            <li> This works better than any other non toxic facial cream I have used.</li>
            <li> Just a tip if you are combating blemishes like I am--I often layer a salicylic night peel on my skin first, let the peel set in for about 5 minutes, and then moisturize with the Yes to Blue Berries night cream, so that&#x27;s the method that&#x27;s worked wonders for me!</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s almost like strong dead flowers).</li>
            <li> I also can see the results of using natural things on my skin instead of using the other brands products (full of chemical products inside)</li>
            <li> I tried the Yes to Blueberries night cream because I wanted something natural for my 50-ish skin.</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t advise getting this if you have sensitive skin and allergies.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why the company adds so much fragrance, especially since they take measures to be an eco and health-friendly product.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance in it makes my eyes water if I rub it anywhere near my eyes and if I rub my face and it gets close to my eyes, they water uncontrollably.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> It rubs completely into the skin leaving no residue.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I woke up in the morning after putting it on the night before and my skin was soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> You will be able to feel it on your face, as it is rather thick, but I don&#x27;t mind that.</li>
            <li> Instead, I usually just stick to using mosturizing/cleansing wipes which do the job fine.  </li>
            <li> Third and final reason, which seems to highlight all the previous points is that I&#x27;ve been pleased with Yes to _ products and my satisfaction with their line keeps me a believer.</li>
            <li> The only reason I am not giving five stars is the scent is a little strong</li>
            <li> This may not be a very expensive product, however it is a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The only other facial cream that I can recall that I can say that was fine</li>
            <li> In the summer, this stuff can be tough to use because it is a little bit thicker and may make you sweat more easily, but as it&#x27;s a night cream, it&#x27;s not too big of an issue, though you may sweat it all off.  </li>
            <li> , it takes some extra time to rub it into the skin, but as soon as you have rubbed it down to an even light white layer, leave it alone.  </li>
            <li> I also prefer natural products whenever possible.  </li>
            <li> I started to notice the fine lines that would lead to crow&#x27;s feet around the tops of my cheeks and some lines across my forehead just from having poor skin texture that left creases from normal expressions.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way with this, just a little dab will do you, but it absorbs very well and quite naturally, your skin will soak it right up.</li>
            <li> On the verge of 36, I was searching for a anti wrinkle cream for my sensitive, sebborhic dermatitis prone, dry and oil skin.</li>
            <li> Pump only half way though as too much comes out.</li>
            <li> I tend to get very dry sensitive skin in the winter, but not when I use this at night.  </li>
            <li> I wish they could have come up with something a little less sweet for an overnight cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ridiculously thick, and I could feel it on my face like a mask right through to morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Before trying this, I had been using Roc deep wrinkle night cream and that made me break out so badly, so this time I opted for a more natural night cream and this one seems to be a keeper.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of trouble with facial products that seem to make my skin soft but also make me break out.</li>
            <li> I noticed other people complaining about the smell, but personally that does not bother me a single bit, it smells the same as the Yes to Blueberries facial wipes</li>
            <li> Hard to get, they don&#x27;t always have it in stock in Subscribe and Save, but that price is much lower than store.</li>
            <li> normally not sensitive to scent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this a lot lately trying to get my changing skin to calm down.</li>
            <li> The smell is weird at first, as some people have said, but it&#x27;s only noticeable initially and then it fades to nothing.  </li>
            <li> That is reason enough to choose this over other products.</li>
            <li> I had some irritated spots on my face (itchy, dry)</li>
            <li> (so my skin can get disgustingly dry) and</li>
            <li> Hate to leave a poor review as I think YES makes some good stuff, but for moisturizing mature skin this falls very short.</li>
            <li> And I have never been a \\&quot;dry skin\\&quot; person, always combination to oily, but this stuff seems to even keep breakouts at bay!</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon the Yes to Blueberries line while looking for skincare that would help with my itchy dry irritated skin I&#x27;d been having due to an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> Most of the time, even to this day, I don&#x27;t use any creams on my face as I had a bad experience with them over the years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30, so not worried about incredibly deep wrinkles yet, but I started using anti-oxidant heavy creams in my 20s because I am often outdoors and my skin takes a beating.  </li>
            <li> The products is pretty thick, so I find that using a dime-sized amount, or maybe even a little less, is sufficient to cover my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> There are at least a few reasons why I purchased this particular cream.  </li>
            <li> In the past, I had always had trouble finding the right cream for my face that wouldn&#x27;t irritate me and would actually mosturize it without causing unnecessary or additional chaos.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use very much as a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> (just like all the other Yes to products).  </li>
            <li> Because the other</li>
            <li> but once it&#x27;s on your face it definitely coats, not sure if I would like that in the summer.</li>
            <li> Also, the scent is light enough to not be annoying.</li>
            <li> well, it&#x27;s winter now and with the dry air and harsh wind</li>
            <li> I intended to get the Yes to Carrots day cream because I heard a lot of positive reviews on that, but they failed to have that in stock.</li>
            <li> It can be a little too moisturizing after using it for a while causing a pimple or two, so I only apply a thin layer and sometimes only every other day.      </li>
            <li> You definitely don&#x27;t want to use it during the day, it&#x27;s too thick, and takes a while to soak into your skin.</li>
            <li> but it does have a bit of an odd smell.</li>
            <li> I do wake to see a slight difference each morning, skin is quite supple...</li>
            <li> I started using this product along with the Intensive Repair Serum after being diagnosed with acne rosacea and the prescription drug that was prescribed only made things worse for me.  </li>
            <li> My skin was so dried out from the prescription that it chaffed.      </li>
            <li> I tried the YES product a few months ago, was using Boots from Target (which I also like)</li>
            <li> but it took me a few minutes</li>
            <li> the smell is okay...not fruity nor harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> It does have a little thick feeling (but spreads easily and seems to go a long way), but the worst part to me is the smell.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell, just lacks much of a smell at all.  </li>
            <li> Not sure about the wrinkle reducing effect as another reviewer mentioned but</li>
            <li> ot get past the smell of the lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed as I really thought I would like this based on its hydrating properties.</li>
            <li> BIT HARD TO TAKE ON</li>
            <li> Love actual blueberries but this night cream smells horrible - like it&#x27;s gone bad.  </li>
            <li> I like the texture at least.  </li>
            <li> It is thick and as soon as you put it on, it feels like a protective barrier on your skin.</li>
            <li> Anyways, one of the people suggested that I use Yes to Blueberries Night Cream, and instead of helping my skin gain moisture, it trigger an allergic reaction, dried out my skin, and get me a horrible itch in the back of my throat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced anything like it.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced anything like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it one night, but it smells awful...</li>
            <li> bad it turned out disappointing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells awful -- nothing like blueberries, to say the least.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I can take putting something so horrible smelling on my face.</li>
            <li> The night cream is all but the worst of it.&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Say yes to consumer awareness!!! Like the same ingredients in every box with different labels, check it out for yourself, read grapefruit, then tomatoe, then etc, guess what yes, you have it right, the same ingredients!!</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon the Yes to Blueberries line while looking for skincare that would help with my itchy dry irritated skin I&#x27;d been having due to an allergic reaction. I saw great reviews for this, so decided to give it a try. It&#x27;s a heck of a lot cheaper than most \\&quot;night treatment\\&quot; creams, and so far I love it! It is thick and as soon as you put it on, it feels like a protective barrier on your skin. I had some irritated spots on my face (itchy, dry) that felt immediately better with this stuff on. You definitely don&#x27;t want to use it during the day, it&#x27;s too thick, and takes a while to soak into your skin. And I have never been a \\&quot;dry skin\\&quot; person, always combination to oily, but this stuff seems to even keep breakouts at bay! Plus it smells great, too...not an overpowering blueberry scent, but a nice light scent that is kind of fruity, but not obviously so.</li>
            <li> This is the only \\&quot;natural\\&quot; overnight cream I&#x27;ve tried that really leaves my face feeling smooth and moisturized. Also, the scent is light enough to not be annoying. The product seems a bit pricey for the amount that&#x27;s in the bottle, but hey, you&#x27;re always going to pay extra for the more healthful beauty products.</li>
            <li> There are at least a few reasons why I purchased this particular cream.  The first one was, I was looking for products with blueberry in them and stumbled upon yes to blueberries, which I didnt even know existed.  I knew about Yes to Carrot, Yes to Cucumber and Yes to Tomatoes, but was surprised (pleasantly) that they have  Yes to blueberries as well.  Second, I didn&#x27;t mind having a night cream.  In the past, I had always had trouble finding the right cream for my face that wouldn&#x27;t irritate me and would actually mosturize it without causing unnecessary or additional chaos.  Most of the time, even to this day, I don&#x27;t use any creams on my face as I had a bad experience with them over the years.  Instead, I usually just stick to using mosturizing/cleansing wipes which do the job fine.  The only other facial cream that I can recall that I can say that was fine was Yes to Carrots facial cream (daytime).  So now I have this blueberry night cream which has pleasant, non overwhelming smell and seems to be ok with my skin (just like all the other Yes to products).  Third and final reason, which seems to highlight all the previous points is that I&#x27;ve been pleased with Yes to _ products and my satisfaction with their line keeps me a believer.</li>
            <li> I started using this product along with the Intensive Repair Serum after being diagnosed with acne rosacea and the prescription drug that was prescribed only made things worse for me.  My skin was so dried out from the prescription that it chaffed.      This moisturizer has restored the moister back to my skin.  My skin now looks refreshed, young and healthy.    It can be a little too moisturizing after using it for a while causing a pimple or two, so I only apply a thin layer and sometimes only every other day.      I&#x27;ve tried Yes to carrots as well and I have to say that this company has a wonderful product line.  I love every single item I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I tried the Yes to Blueberries night cream because I wanted something natural for my 50-ish skin. It does have a little thick feeling (but spreads easily and seems to go a long way), but the worst part to me is the smell. It has a very strong smell which I don&#x27;t find pleasant (it&#x27;s almost like strong dead flowers). However, if I use it at night and go to bed I wake up and the smell has gone and my face does seem to be smoother. I would like it a lot better if they would change the fragrance in it.</li>
            <li> I am new to the whole night cream thing, having just turned 30 last August, but in that time I have tried a bunch and after doing a lot of reading, am trying to phase out most of the chemicals in my life and replace products with more natural ones. I LOVE the Yes To brand and have switched most of my bath and beauty products to their line and this is no exception. The cream is smooth, has a nice scent and rubs in easily. You will be able to feel it on your face, as it is rather thick, but I don&#x27;t mind that.</li>
            <li> I like it and have been using it for about 2 years.  It smells nice and keeps my face soft.</li>
            <li> It is the best moisturizer that I have used! I have thyroid problems (so my skin can get disgustingly dry) and this works great.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing else had worked but this has :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it one night, but it smells awful...I think the blueberries were rancid.  However, I do believe it might help, thus 3 stars.  I like the texture at least.  I would really like to return it.  I don&#x27;t know if I can take putting something so horrible smelling on my face.</li>
            <li> I love many of the YES line of items, including the facial wipes (tomato, cucumber, grapefruit- all good), shower gel, &amp; (carrots) hand cream .  Not so with this blueberry line. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that moisturizing, let alone &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34;. And while the rest of the YES product&#x27;s smell wonderful, this one nearly makes me nauseous. Hate to leave a poor review as I think YES makes some good stuff, but for moisturizing mature skin this falls very short.</li>
            <li> Absolutely, Love all Yes To Products that I have tried.  I really enjoy the softness and light, airy feeling of the Blueberries LIne!!</li>
            <li> I liked this night cream but it does have a bit of an odd smell. It did absorb well and was very good to my sensative skin.</li>
            <li> I like the odour, the sensation on my skin and everything on Yes to products. I also can see the results of using natural things on my skin instead of using the other brands products (full of chemical products inside)</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so I try to stay away from &#x27;retexturizing&#x27; products that contain some kind of acid that will ultimately cause a reaction.  I also prefer natural products whenever possible.  I&#x27;ve been using this cream for almost a year now, and I can visibly see a difference.  I&#x27;m 30, so not worried about incredibly deep wrinkles yet, but I started using anti-oxidant heavy creams in my 20s because I am often outdoors and my skin takes a beating.  I started to notice the fine lines that would lead to crow&#x27;s feet around the tops of my cheeks and some lines across my forehead just from having poor skin texture that left creases from normal expressions.  In the summer, this stuff can be tough to use because it is a little bit thicker and may make you sweat more easily, but as it&#x27;s a night cream, it&#x27;s not too big of an issue, though you may sweat it all off.  In the winter, it&#x27;s absolutely perfect.  I tend to get very dry sensitive skin in the winter, but not when I use this at night.  My skin really looks amazing- it&#x27;s clear and the fine lines I was starting to notice are gone.  I don&#x27;t see why I should wait to get deep wrinkles before addressing the smaller things that cause them.  The bottle lasts for a while.  Considering the effectiveness, the price is a steal.  The smell is weird at first, as some people have said, but it&#x27;s only noticeable initially and then it fades to nothing.  For how awesome my skin looks, it could smell like a zoo and I&#x27;d probably still use it.</li>
            <li> This is a very good cream for those pesky wrinkles that appear on your face and neck.  I use it morning and night; it&#x27;s rich enough for a night cream right before bed and light enough for a moisturizer before putting on makeup.  It goes on smoothly and soaks into the skin without leaving it feeling greasy.  Because of the blueberry extract that&#x27;s been added, it&#x27;s a very good anti-oxidant for the skin and for treating wrinkles.  You don&#x27;t need to use very much as a little goes a long way.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like this product because from date that I use it, my skin looks brighter and better. I hope it gonna work for every body.</li>
            <li> A GOOD PRODUCT AND IT-S NICE TO MY ATOPIC EKSEM.&lt;br /&gt;LITTLE BIT HARD TO TAKE ON BUT OKAY.&lt;br /&gt;SMELLS OKAY.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this cream. On the verge of 36, I was searching for a anti wrinkle cream for my sensitive, sebborhic dermatitis prone, dry and oil skin. I like this cream a lot. It&#x27;s thick but absorbs easily and quickly. Along with the serum in this line, helps to leave my face looking dewy and fresh.</li>
            <li> I went to Ulta to get some (well, somewhat) professional advice about what kind of lotion I should use. I intended to get the Yes to Carrots day cream because I heard a lot of positive reviews on that, but they failed to have that in stock. Anyways, one of the people suggested that I use Yes to Blueberries Night Cream, and instead of helping my skin gain moisture, it trigger an allergic reaction, dried out my skin, and get me a horrible itch in the back of my throat. The scent is intense. I washed it off and I can still smell it.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t advise getting this if you have sensitive skin and allergies.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Yes To\\&quot; line is amazing.  Natural ingredients and cruelty free.  I&#x27;m so glad Amazon carries it because it is difficult to find in stores.  I&#x27;ve been using the Blueberries items at night and my 50+ skin looks better than it ever did.</li>
            <li> I really liked the way this product felt on my skin.  It made my skin feel very soft and seemed a good consistency for my dry winter skin.  But it has so much fragrance that it triggers my migraines.  I don&#x27;t know why the company adds so much fragrance, especially since they take measures to be an eco and health-friendly product.  I&#x27;m disappointed as I really thought I would like this based on its hydrating properties.</li>
            <li> To me, this is a very light cream, so I use it during the day.  Not too much smell, if any, goes on smooth.  Pump only half way though as too much comes out.</li>
            <li> This may not be a very expensive product, however it is a great moisturizer. I have a lot of trouble with facial products that seem to make my skin soft but also make me break out. I am 58 and I still have problem with acne. Since I have been using this cream, it has not made me break out not once. So if you still have some acne problems, I highly recommend this product for a night time moisturizer. You will not regret it. It also has a pleasant scent. I plan to buy it again and also try some more of their products.</li>
            <li> I purchased the entire moisturizing portion of this line yesterday morning, including the serum, the eye cream, the eye roller, the day cream, and the night cream.  I started using the line as soon as I got it home.  I&#x27;m sure it has some great benefits with dedicated use, but here&#x27;s the problem:  I can&#x27;t stand to keep using it!  The night cream is all but the worst of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After going to bed with the serum and night cream on, I did wake up with a smoother feel to my skin, but that&#x27;s where the good ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells awful -- nothing like blueberries, to say the least.  It&#x27;s ridiculously thick, and I could feel it on my face like a mask right through to morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ll go back to synthetic-heavy lines like L&#x27;Oreal.  I do know I will NOT continue using Yes To Blueberries.  I&#x27;m stopping on my way home from work, today, and getting something else.</li>
            <li> Great product. Makes my skin feel great at night! Hard to get, they don&#x27;t always have it in stock in Subscribe and Save, but that price is much lower than store.</li>
            <li> I usually never notice scents in lotions or creams, but for whatever reason, this face cream triggers me. The fragrance in it makes my eyes water if I rub it anywhere near my eyes and if I rub my face and it gets close to my eyes, they water uncontrollably. I&#x27;ve never experienced anything like it.&lt;br /&gt;It does moisturize well and leaves a nice smooth feeling, but I can&#x27;t get past the scent. I use it anyways because I already paid for it and to me it&#x27;s a bit pricy, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product! My skin immediately began to look and feel more hydrated.  People began asking me, &amp;#34;What have you done, you look younger&amp;#34; I have become a big fan of the Yes to Carrots product line (and tomatoes, and blueberries, etc etc!)</li>
            <li> I liked how my face feels very supple in the morning. This makes my skin so soft. I&#x27;ve never experienced anything like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this a lot lately trying to get my changing skin to calm down. Just like the bottle says apply this at night and be amazed in the morning. My only complaint is the scent, it&#x27;s strong at first, thankfully it fades pretty quickly. Have others using it too now!</li>
            <li> This lotion is very moisturizing, I love the feel!  It smells kind of medicine like, it does not smell like a sweet blueberry body lotion, maybe that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s for night time use.  If it smelled better and had SPF 15 I would wear it for day time as well!</li>
            <li> The only reason I am not giving five stars is the scent is a little strong otherwise it is perfect.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a very long time for a product for aging skin that actually made my skin look better and didn&#x27;t cost a fortune.  I found it in Yes to Blueberries.  My skin is tighter and brighter and I have only been using the product for about 20 days.  The whole Yes to Blueberries line is now sitting on my vanity shelf.  I wouldn&#x27;t go a day without it.  One thing to note, it takes some extra time to rub it into the skin, but as soon as you have rubbed it down to an even light white layer, leave it alone.  It will absorb into skin in about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom who is in her 50s and takes care do her skin.  She normally uses department store brands like Shiseido and LaMer, but wanted to try this after seeing it on an ad.  She uses it for the eye area to keep it fresh and hydrated.  It has a bluish color and smells good.  Mom asked me to buy another, so it got her approval.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to improve the fine lines on my face.  After 3 days of use, I can see a difference in my skin when I first get up in the morning.  Specifically what I notice is that my skin is softer and smoother.  The products is pretty thick, so I find that using a dime-sized amount, or maybe even a little less, is sufficient to cover my face and neck.  It rubs completely into the skin leaving no residue.&lt;br /&gt;I chose to rate this product at 4 stars instead of 5 because I expected it to smell better than it does.  It doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell, just lacks much of a smell at all.  Because the other Yes To products tend to have a very pleasant smell, I was surprised at this product&#x27;s lack of smell.  This could be a bonus for those who don&#x27;t like very strong smelling beauty products.</li>
            <li> Love actual blueberries but this night cream smells horrible - like it&#x27;s gone bad.  I thought perhaps I received a one off dud, but reading the reviews, it seems like I am not the only one who feels this way.  This line came highly recommended to me….too bad it turned out disappointing.  The Yes to Carrots body wash smells better.</li>
            <li> heard about this product on Dct. Oz show over a year ago. have been using it ever since. It is as promised. A good moisturizer at a great price.</li>
            <li> Just okay, nothing special, didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
            <li> Love all the Blueberry products.  This product works better than products that I have used that cost 5 times more.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get this if you have scent allergies/scent sensitivity. Smell quite overpowering especially near the eye. It gets stars for not having parabens and being rated well on EWG.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for two weeks now. I do wake to see a slight difference each morning, skin is quite supple...for this price, I am delighted. The scent is fruity( lemony), and can be a little overwhelming upon application. But this fades within 20 minutes or so. I am hoping to see better looking skin the more I use it...will let you know.</li>
            <li> I tried the YES product a few months ago, was using Boots from Target (which I also like) but YES is cheaper and I like it better! Good product and my skin under my eyes looks smooth and it&#x27;s holding back the hands of time.</li>
            <li> This truly does moisturize the skin.  I have noticed a difference.  Not sure about the wrinkle reducing effect as another reviewer mentioned but I have been using this for about a month so I will wait and see.  Also, it does seem to create a barrier and eventually gets absorbed and leaves a nice glow in the morning.  The best part is that it does not cause breakouts for me at all like most other creams have done.  Amazing that it can moisturize that well and not cause acne.  While it does have a floral scent, it does not bother me as some others reviewers stated.  It would be better without fragrance but not a big deal and worth the moisturizing without breakouts.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This works better than any other non toxic facial cream I have used. My skin looks great and my fine lines are diminishing.</li>
            <li> This stuff moisturizes well, it&#x27;s winter now and with the dry air and harsh wind it&#x27;s keeping me from having to coat myself in Vaseline and hide like Quasimodo. It&#x27;s just a regular cream but once it&#x27;s on your face it definitely coats, not sure if I would like that in the summer. I don&#x27;t notice much wrinkle reducing but I&#x27;m using this as more of a preventive than a treatment. Bottom line it&#x27;s pretty good stuff maybe not $20 good but if you get it on sale it&#x27;s worth it, smells pretty good too.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 3 stars only because as a moisturizer it IS very good. I woke up in the morning after putting it on the night before and my skin was soft and refreshed. But that darn smell!&lt;br /&gt;Im normally not sensitive to scent but it took me a few minutes ot get past the smell of the lotion. I wish they could have come up with something a little less sweet for an overnight cream.</li>
            <li> i liked how my face feels very supple in the morning. the texture is creamy. the smell is okay...not fruity nor harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Not greasy, light, yet very moisturizing.  I have it on re-order every two months.  Works great along with the daily moisturizer.  I spent a lot of money of high priced so called &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; products and find this one works the best for my very dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is a really great product, I&#x27;m really happy with this and I do not often recommend products unless they truly work for me! I found it on sale at Target for about $6 and I&#x27;m so glad that I decided to try it. I noticed other people complaining about the smell, but personally that does not bother me a single bit, it smells the same as the Yes to Blueberries facial wipes and I love those also,  so I guess I am just used to the scent of this line, which is very mild to me, especially after it absorbs into your skin, I do not notice the smell at all. A little bit goes a long way with this, just a little dab will do you, but it absorbs very well and quite naturally, your skin will soak it right up. It is not greasy at all and it has not triggered any breakouts for me, which is why I tried it and grabbed something more natural and plant based because my skin is very sensitive and acne prone, but I feel this is an ideal night cream for acne prone skin that has actually helped calm my skin and keep it clear. I have combination skin with acne and dryness and this has helped heal both, the dryness also! I love the results of this in the morning after sleeping in it, my face looks restored and is still moist, but not oily. Before trying this, I had been using Roc deep wrinkle night cream and that made me break out so badly, so this time I opted for a more natural night cream and this one seems to be a keeper. I&#x27;m going to go back to Target and see if I can buy another bottle or two at the discount price since this ended up being such a great skin care investment that&#x27;s really softened and smoothed my skin and appears to have really helped clear up some lingering acne issues. Just a tip if you are combating blemishes like I am--I often layer a salicylic night peel on my skin first, let the peel set in for about 5 minutes, and then moisturize with the Yes to Blue Berries night cream, so that&#x27;s the method that&#x27;s worked wonders for me!</li>
            <li> Works very well. I will purchase this product again. Has tightened my loose eyelids and firmed them up tremendously. love this cream.</li>
            <li> This works well at bed time, but it&#x27;s way too greasy for day time.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin so soft. I love the feel of it. I am also very happy with the fact that there is no animal testing. That is reason enough to choose this over other products.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well - haven&#x27;t used long yet, but so far it seems to be really good and I would most like purchase it again</li>
            <li> This product is great! I love the whole line. My skin looks and feels so much better since I&#x27;ve started using yes to blueberries.</li>
