            <li>br /&gt;I am very impressed with how well this product is working for my tween</li>
            <li>This spot zinger is wonderful!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s best.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Worked great for me-would give it a try!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells great; a citrusy scent rather than a medicinal smell.</li>
            <li>This product is great.  </li>
            <li>and it works great for both of us.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for getting rid of blemishes.</li>
            <li>lol...</li>
            <li>The smell of this product is amazing, it reminds me of a mojito!  </li>
            <li>Smells good too, and a great price through amazon.</li>
            <li>or so that felt very refreshing.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>As others have stated, this product works well, smells nice, and is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>and I feel this cream will come in handy.</li>
            <li>You know how &amp;#34;they&amp;#34; tell you that if you have acne, you should leave it alone and it will go away on its own?</li>
            <li>It also smells really nice unlike some acne treatment products.</li>
            <li>I look like Rudolph, honestly.</li>
            <li>I was honestly speechless.</li>
            <li>As an added bonus, it smells really nice</li>
            <li>have used it many times with good results.</li>
            <li>Olay is a brand I own and buy.</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love this stuff!!</li>
            <li>I have been using Alba&#x27;s salicylic acid acne treatment and have not been happy with it, so I was willing to give this product a try</li>
            <li>I am very fortunate not to suffer with blemishes too often</li>
            <li>so glad to have this on had for her to use</li>
            <li>It feels lovely going on.</li>
            <li>ok well yell maybe I did intend</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>We will be buying this from now on, and no where is the price better than Amazon..</li>
            <li>Anyone who&#x27;s had to battle zits knows you don&#x27;t contaminate the product by touching the skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it work any better than the rest?</li>
            <li>I love this newer product from Oil Of Olay.  </li>
            <li>and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>I like it a LOT better than the Alba product, or the Neutrogena product I had used before that.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad it does.</li>
            <li>I think this is an okay product, but the 10 minute claim is not realistic.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It worked most of the time when I felt a breakout coming on, but wasn&#x27;t able to stop them all.  </li>
            <li>more effectively.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love all of their products.</li>
            <li>and when I run out I will be buying more.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was the pleasant scent of this cream.</li>
            <li>Did not buy my original tube from Amazon because I did not realize they carried it!</li>
            <li>but this one is a white cream with a very pleasant light scent.  </li>
            <li>So far this product has proven to work great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-small packaging and easy to use</li>
            <li>I do not notice a strong scent to this product, so I don&#x27;t know what could be causing the itch.</li>
            <li>quality; Olay does a good job of protecting their brand by making decent</li>
            <li>It had a warm feeling for the first 15 minutes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a Clean and Clear version of this product for years and it works great</li>
            <li>It feels fine on my skin and is a product I will keep on</li>
            <li>It is important for me that it is easy to apply and it is.</li>
            <li>No annoying smell either.  </li>
            <li>It goes on with a light touch and blends in well.  </li>
            <li>It is important for me that a product like this does not irritate my skin and this does not.</li>
            <li>It is important for me that a product like this works and it works well.</li>
            <li>Prior to receiving this I had been using another brand that I was happy with.</li>
            <li>It is important for me that it does not have any strong odor and this has a mild scent.  </li>
            <li>I use the fresh aloe juice on my skin which removes age spots, blemishes (yet, I still get them!)</li>
            <li>They disappeared and I was happy to see that my skin wasn&#x27;t dry and flaky afterwards.  </li>
            <li>The scent is really lovely and the price is extremely reasonable.</li>
            <li>I had resorted to Philosophy Clear Days Ahead, which is a great treatment as well, but it costs about 3 times as much as this product and is consistently out of stock.  </li>
            <li>It is best on smaller areas and acne, not larger zones.</li>
            <li>I also never saw any sign that redness or irritation of the blemishes went away as quickly as the product advertises.  </li>
            <li>it lessened the redness and my spot was gone reasonably quickly.  </li>
            <li>But I hope that anyone who has super-sensitive skin like I do will try the real, fresh aloe treatment as it really works, and avoid anything that has silicon or chemicals in it, as this product does.</li>
            <li>But I hope that anyone who has super-sensitive skin like I do will try the real, fresh aloe treatment as it really works, and avoid anything that has silicon or chemicals in it, as this product does.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and am allergic to chemicals, fragrances and more.</li>
            <li>I went back to my Clean and Clear product instead which proved more effective.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty excited about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It, like other salicylic acid products, is pretty effective in healing blemishes more quickly.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t sound very &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; to me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And also, this has a very pleasing lightly minty citrusy fragrance.</li>
            <li>Olay Fresh Effects</li>
            <li>I used this on my daughter&#x27;s face with success.  </li>
            <li>It feels cooling and soothing and fresh.</li>
            <li>I recommend Olay Fresh Effect</li>
            <li>This is totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>A nice solution for those occasional blemishes we all get.  </li>
            <li>This stuff was not only pretty effective at battling those &amp;#34;under the skin&amp;#34; pre-pimples that seem to threaten me monthly, but also did the trick with my husband&#x27;s already-there zits.</li>
            <li>This has a really pleasant scent (the Alba product smells like alcohol) and it is an opaque white color, as opposed to clear, which probably accounts for some of the &amp;#34;blurring&amp;#34; effect that the product claims.</li>
            <li>This product contains salicylic acid which has been out a very long time and has been proven effective against acne.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle and non-drying.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought with al the &amp;#34;leaf extracts&amp;#34; this product would be fine, but for sensitive skin like mine, it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li>I love trying new skin care products and as a regular of spot treatment creams I was excited to try this Oil of Olay product.</li>
            <li>Stick with it though and be consistent with the application.</li>
            <li>Works but not noticing anything better or faster than similar products.</li>
            <li>By the next day, one more application cleared the spots altogether.  </li>
            <li>Really!???</li>
            <li>I will go back to using my own real, natural liquid aloe that I grow myself in a pot in the windowsill, and &amp;#34;fillet&amp;#34; the leaves and run the gel through the blender, and store in the refrigerator for up to a month.</li>
            <li>, pre-cancerous red sun spots and more.</li>
            <li>This product contains the standard 2% of Salicylic Acid found in most products of this type.</li>
            <li>The skin on my chest and hands are also much softer now and more &amp;#34;elastic&amp;#34; with no dry spots as before.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like giving negative reviews, and I received this product as a free offer for an honest review.</li>
            <li>This spot treatment works pretty fast.</li>
            <li>For me, that tends to me in my T Zone, I have combination skin; dry in most areas with an oily T Zone.</li>
            <li>It has certainly worked for me, and I recommend it.</li>
            <li>The smell is good, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your face even using it multiple times a day.</li>
            <li>and  I didn&#x27;t care for them that much</li>
            <li>My wife said that this product really works.</li>
            <li>I think having the concentrated application really made a difference.</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t beat the price ($6-ish).</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t really do anything.</li>
            <li>It was not oily or gel-like, but very creamy like a lotion.</li>
            <li>It really works and is gentle, causing no drying or flaking.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for acne flare ups, but gentle enough to use everyday or even on your whole face.</li>
            <li>but it really dries out my skin in the affected area.  </li>
            <li>I have had skin problems my whole life</li>
            <li>Show us real, unretouched pictures.</li>
            <li>very good&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works fast &amp; not drying.</li>
            <li>I found this preparation to work very well.</li>
            <li>I really like that this is a cream because of the control one has while applying it to the skin</li>
            <li>but this cream really improved the texture of the skin immediately even on non-blemished areas.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is nice since the bottle shape and tip help to target a specific area instead of covering your entire face.  </li>
            <li>so I am always willing to try something new and see if it works with my skin type.</li>
            <li>so I went back to my original cleansing routine and just used this cream where I needed it.</li>
            <li>That isn&#x27;t to say they don&#x27;t work, they do, this has a large percentage of Salicylic Acid in it (2.0%) which help control acne (this is also the same percentage in Olay&#x27;s deep scrub as well, which includes a lot more product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even though it states it will improve the look of blemishes within ten minutes, I can’t say that claim is true.</li>
            <li>and it is safe enough for her to use daily</li>
            <li>The main difference is that this is a cream formula as opposed to a gel formula, which is what the majority of the products out on the market are now.</li>
            <li>even the most perfect skin has a teeny tiny little irritating spot/blemish/zit!  </li>
            <li>But sometimes I need a little bit more.</li>
            <li>Overall very happy with the results, especially since it also seems to dry out my skin less.</li>
            <li>This Olay Clear Skin Spot Zinger works really well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and so far I really like it.</li>
            <li>Again I am going to continue to use a few more days to see if I can spot a change...</li>
            <li>I mean, let&#x27;s be honest:</li>
            <li>The fine print says they are “digitally simulated to reflect actual results achieved in product testing”.  </li>
            <li>I have discontinued my makeup for a while to test to see if that&#x27;s what the problem is (I&#x27;m using a new foundation)</li>
            <li>My initial impression of Olay Fresh Effects Clear Skin Spot Zinger.  </li>
            <li>After using this on it every day, twice a day, it&#x27;s nearly gone!</li>
            <li>The Olay Spot Zinger has been even better at stopping them and it doesn&#x27;t have the off smell or white residue that the other has.  </li>
            <li>My fianc&amp;eacute; started using this stuff just over a month ago and noticed considerable reduction in facial acne within 72 hours of consistent use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had some success with this product, although it&#x27;s kind of hard to measure as sometimes your skin just naturally recovers quicker from a blemish than it does at other times.</li>
            <li>Clear Skin Spot Zinger 2-in-1</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t clear up.</li>
            <li>since it does have silicone in it, a clear film starts to develop that will need to be scrubbed off</li>
            <li>This tinted cream contains 2% salicylic acid, which is a milder treatment than the more common benzoyl peroxide.  </li>
            <li>before and after pictures use photoshop, they aren&#x27;t real, although the &amp;#34;real women focus group&amp;#34; makes it subconsciously seem like it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had hoped that the &amp;#34;fresh effects&amp;#34; would work naturally, but this was not the case.</li>
            <li>narrow opening helps in a precise application.</li>
            <li>I have used other Olay products before to varying degrees of success.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We have to be very careful what we use on her due to her allergies and being bothered by so many items on the markets that are overly scented.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is making them seem smaller, and since my skin is very dry, I expected to see a more drying effect, but didn&#x27;t notice that at all.  </li>
            <li>Not too harsh, yet strong enough.  </li>
            <li>Other people have reviewed the product in depth, so I&#x27;ll just add my own small amount of &amp;#</li>
            <li>You will notice changes and improvements rather quickly, in just a few days.</li>
            <li>I normally apply Salicylic Acid sparingly to my skin because I have dry, sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I tried the Olay Fresh Effects Clear Skin face wipes in place of my usual face cleansing wipes</li>
            <li>so I recommend using it as directly on the blemish as possible.</li>
            <li>it is gentle and does not really sting when you use</li>
            <li>would recommend this product especially to people who have sensitive skin like I do.</li>
            <li>It creates a matte effect on the skin and does not dry with any sort of residue.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;I really appreciate it for the little sebaceous bumps that I seem to get every once in a while</li>

            <li> I also never saw any sign that redness or irritation of the blemishes went away as quickly as the product advertises.  </li>
            <li> it lessened the redness and my spot was gone reasonably quickly.  </li>
            <li> But I hope that anyone who has super-sensitive skin like I do will try the real, fresh aloe treatment as it really works, and avoid anything that has silicon or chemicals in it, as this product does.</li>
            <li> But I hope that anyone who has super-sensitive skin like I do will try the real, fresh aloe treatment as it really works, and avoid anything that has silicon or chemicals in it, as this product does.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and am allergic to chemicals, fragrances and more.</li>
            <li> I went back to my Clean and Clear product instead which proved more effective.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty excited about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It, like other salicylic acid products, is pretty effective in healing blemishes more quickly.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t sound very &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; to me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And also, this has a very pleasing lightly minty citrusy fragrance.</li>
            <li> Olay Fresh Effects</li>
            <li> I used this on my daughter&#x27;s face with success.  </li>
            <li> It feels cooling and soothing and fresh.</li>
            <li> I recommend Olay Fresh Effect</li>
            <li> This is totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> A nice solution for those occasional blemishes we all get.  </li>
            <li> This stuff was not only pretty effective at battling those &amp;#34;under the skin&amp;#34; pre-pimples that seem to threaten me monthly, but also did the trick with my husband&#x27;s already-there zits.</li>
            <li> This has a really pleasant scent (the Alba product smells like alcohol) and it is an opaque white color, as opposed to clear, which probably accounts for some of the &amp;#34;blurring&amp;#34; effect that the product claims.</li>
            <li> This product contains salicylic acid which has been out a very long time and has been proven effective against acne.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle and non-drying.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought with al the &amp;#34;leaf extracts&amp;#34; this product would be fine, but for sensitive skin like mine, it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> I love trying new skin care products and as a regular of spot treatment creams I was excited to try this Oil of Olay product.</li>
            <li> Stick with it though and be consistent with the application.</li>
            <li> Works but not noticing anything better or faster than similar products.</li>
            <li> By the next day, one more application cleared the spots altogether.  </li>
            <li> Really!???</li>
            <li> I will go back to using my own real, natural liquid aloe that I grow myself in a pot in the windowsill, and &amp;#34;fillet&amp;#34; the leaves and run the gel through the blender, and store in the refrigerator for up to a month.</li>
            <li> , pre-cancerous red sun spots and more.</li>
            <li> This product contains the standard 2% of Salicylic Acid found in most products of this type.</li>
            <li> The skin on my chest and hands are also much softer now and more &amp;#34;elastic&amp;#34; with no dry spots as before.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like giving negative reviews, and I received this product as a free offer for an honest review.</li>
            <li> This spot treatment works pretty fast.</li>
            <li> For me, that tends to me in my T Zone, I have combination skin; dry in most areas with an oily T Zone.</li>
            <li> It has certainly worked for me, and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> The smell is good, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your face even using it multiple times a day.</li>
            <li> and  I didn&#x27;t care for them that much</li>
            <li> My wife said that this product really works.</li>
            <li> I think having the concentrated application really made a difference.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t beat the price ($6-ish).</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t really do anything.</li>
            <li> It was not oily or gel-like, but very creamy like a lotion.</li>
            <li> It really works and is gentle, causing no drying or flaking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for acne flare ups, but gentle enough to use everyday or even on your whole face.</li>
            <li> but it really dries out my skin in the affected area.  </li>
            <li> I have had skin problems my whole life</li>
            <li> Show us real, unretouched pictures.</li>
            <li> very good&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works fast &amp; not drying.</li>
            <li> I found this preparation to work very well.</li>
            <li> I really like that this is a cream because of the control one has while applying it to the skin</li>
            <li> but this cream really improved the texture of the skin immediately even on non-blemished areas.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is nice since the bottle shape and tip help to target a specific area instead of covering your entire face.  </li>
            <li> so I am always willing to try something new and see if it works with my skin type.</li>
            <li> so I went back to my original cleansing routine and just used this cream where I needed it.</li>
            <li> That isn&#x27;t to say they don&#x27;t work, they do, this has a large percentage of Salicylic Acid in it (2.0%) which help control acne (this is also the same percentage in Olay&#x27;s deep scrub as well, which includes a lot more product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even though it states it will improve the look of blemishes within ten minutes, I can’t say that claim is true.</li>
            <li> and it is safe enough for her to use daily</li>
            <li> The main difference is that this is a cream formula as opposed to a gel formula, which is what the majority of the products out on the market are now.</li>
            <li> even the most perfect skin has a teeny tiny little irritating spot/blemish/zit!  </li>
            <li> But sometimes I need a little bit more.</li>
            <li> Overall very happy with the results, especially since it also seems to dry out my skin less.</li>
            <li> This Olay Clear Skin Spot Zinger works really well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and so far I really like it.</li>
            <li> Again I am going to continue to use a few more days to see if I can spot a change...</li>
            <li> I mean, let&#x27;s be honest:</li>
            <li> The fine print says they are “digitally simulated to reflect actual results achieved in product testing”.  </li>
            <li> I have discontinued my makeup for a while to test to see if that&#x27;s what the problem is (I&#x27;m using a new foundation)</li>
            <li> My initial impression of Olay Fresh Effects Clear Skin Spot Zinger.  </li>
            <li> After using this on it every day, twice a day, it&#x27;s nearly gone!</li>
            <li> The Olay Spot Zinger has been even better at stopping them and it doesn&#x27;t have the off smell or white residue that the other has.  </li>
            <li> My fianc&amp;eacute; started using this stuff just over a month ago and noticed considerable reduction in facial acne within 72 hours of consistent use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some success with this product, although it&#x27;s kind of hard to measure as sometimes your skin just naturally recovers quicker from a blemish than it does at other times.</li>
            <li> Clear Skin Spot Zinger 2-in-1</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t clear up.</li>
            <li> since it does have silicone in it, a clear film starts to develop that will need to be scrubbed off</li>
            <li> This tinted cream contains 2% salicylic acid, which is a milder treatment than the more common benzoyl peroxide.  </li>
            <li> before and after pictures use photoshop, they aren&#x27;t real, although the &amp;#34;real women focus group&amp;#34; makes it subconsciously seem like it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had hoped that the &amp;#34;fresh effects&amp;#34; would work naturally, but this was not the case.</li>
            <li> narrow opening helps in a precise application.</li>
            <li> I have used other Olay products before to varying degrees of success.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We have to be very careful what we use on her due to her allergies and being bothered by so many items on the markets that are overly scented.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is making them seem smaller, and since my skin is very dry, I expected to see a more drying effect, but didn&#x27;t notice that at all.  </li>
            <li> Not too harsh, yet strong enough.  </li>
            <li> Other people have reviewed the product in depth, so I&#x27;ll just add my own small amount of &amp;#</li>
            <li> You will notice changes and improvements rather quickly, in just a few days.</li>
            <li> I normally apply Salicylic Acid sparingly to my skin because I have dry, sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I tried the Olay Fresh Effects Clear Skin face wipes in place of my usual face cleansing wipes</li>
            <li> so I recommend using it as directly on the blemish as possible.</li>
            <li> it is gentle and does not really sting when you use</li>
            <li> would recommend this product especially to people who have sensitive skin like I do.</li>
            <li> It creates a matte effect on the skin and does not dry with any sort of residue.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;I really appreciate it for the little sebaceous bumps that I seem to get every once in a while</li>
            <li> Clear Skin Spot Zinger will continue to use this product over other options.</li>
            <li> packaging warned that this could cause dryness, and I will say that even with my drier, sensitive skin, I didn&#x27;t run into any issues... which I have with other spot treatments.</li>
            <li> My husband keeps his hair cut very near the scalp, and sometimes gets those little sort of ingrown hair bumps on his upper back neck.  </li>
            <li> It does seem to dry your skin out a little bit if you rub it into the surrounding skin too much</li>
            <li> It reduced the inflammation on a small spot on her nose very soon after application, and she no longer is bothered by the way it looks.  </li>
            <li> I sometimes get really big blind pimples, usually on the very top of my nose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll still keep this in my arsenal but will only use it for minor blemishes.</li>
            <li> She noted that as long as usage is applied consistently on a daily basis, the results do not deviate so I would recommend this to anyone wanting to get rid of and keep acne away as my lady will continue to use Olay products.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s not going to help anyone fight break-outs, but when you&#x27;re putting weird goop on your face to deal with an ugly lump, it&#x27;s nice to have a nice smell to make you feel less</li>
            <li> My daughter tried it on her acne and it worked nearly overnight to dry and tone down the redness of acne.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice as big of a reduction of pimples and redness compared to other spot-treatments I use regularly.</li>
            <li> far this Spot Zinger has not given her any issues at all with her breathing and has zapped the little blemishes she has been using them</li>
            <li> On smaller, less angry blemishes it seemed to work fine.  </li>
            <li> and I have dry skin</li>
            <li> I used this on them, and they helped dry them up too.  </li>
            <li> The salicylic acid seems to dry up any spots or acne that occurs, no matter how oily your skin</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the tube is pretty small.</li>
            <li> And...seriously...these little spots usually occur when you really need your skin to look</li>
            <li> Regardless of your age and skin condition, this stuff really does dry and help control/eliminate acne  and bumps without irritating the skin.  </li>
            <li> A day later, the little hair was sticking out (but still seemed ingrown)</li>
            <li> I do think it helped improve the pimples and helped them clear up a little quicker than if I had done nothing, but that was after using this a few times a day for a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> blemishes, which I did not really notice, but</li>
            <li> the before/after pictures on the Amazon product page are not real before/after pictures.</li>
            <li> I have been using it sparingly over the last few weeks</li>
            <li> This tiny little tube is one that I will keep on hand all of the time!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a lot either, as a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> For those with allergies or other concerns, the inactive ingredients are: Water, Ppg-15 Stearyl Ether, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Acrylamide/</li>
            <li> From reading the other reviews, it appear that it does work well for those people</li>
            <li> From reading the other reviews, it appear that it does work well for those people</li>
            <li> There is not any residue left behind or facial discoloration.</li>
            <li> active ingredient is Salicylic Acid 2%.</li>
            <li> That is just not right.</li>
            <li> They usually last at least a week to even two and they hurt like hell.</li>
            <li> Olay products have never let me down.</li>
            <li> is.&lt;br /&gt;It is a cream which gives less of an oily appearance than a gel and also seems to work</li>
            <li> but she has not had to because for her little issues it works so well that they are gone usually the next day or at least on their way to being gone and not bothering her anymore.</li>
            <li> It worked overnight on my little imperfection...</li>
            <li> This gets 4 stars just because of it&#x27;s promise to make things improve in as little as 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> while the product works, I have a few issues with the marketing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Laureth-7, Fragrance, Disodium Edta, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf</li>

            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-not messy and absorbs easily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite the harsh sounding ingredient of salicylic acid</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m supposed to be reviewing the Procter &amp; Gamble product, so I will say no more about aloe.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Olay Fresh Effects Clear Skin Spot Zinger 2-in-1 Salicylic Acid, Citrus/Mint&lt;br /&gt;I am very impressed with how well this product is working for my tween daughter.&lt;br /&gt;We have to be very careful what we use on her due to her allergies and being bothered by so many items on the markets that are overly scented.&lt;br /&gt;So far this Spot Zinger has not given her any issues at all with her breathing and has zapped the little blemishes she has been using them on.&lt;br /&gt;Am so glad to have this on had for her to use and it is safe enough for her to use daily but she has not had to because for her little issues it works so well that they are gone usually the next day or at least on their way to being gone and not bothering her anymore.</li>
            <li> I used this on my daughter&#x27;s face with success.  It reduced the inflammation on a small spot on her nose very soon after application, and she no longer is bothered by the way it looks.  No annoying smell either.  I will continue to use when she has any flare-ups.</li>
            <li> As others have stated, this product works well, smells nice, and is not overpowering. You will notice changes and improvements rather quickly, in just a few days. Stick with it though and be consistent with the application. You don&#x27;t need a lot either, as a little goes a long way. There is not any residue left behind or facial discoloration. Pimples and redness are both reduced. It is best on smaller areas and acne, not larger zones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some success with this product, although it&#x27;s kind of hard to measure as sometimes your skin just naturally recovers quicker from a blemish than it does at other times. However it does seem as though the skin healed quicker when treated daily with this cream.&lt;br /&gt;It smells great; a citrusy scent rather than a medicinal smell. It does seem to dry your skin out a little bit if you rub it into the surrounding skin too much so I recommend using it as directly on the blemish as possible. I use it at nighttime after cleansing my face. I tried the Olay Fresh Effects Clear Skin face wipes in place of my usual face cleansing wipes and  I didn&#x27;t care for them that much so I went back to my original cleansing routine and just used this cream where I needed it. For me, that tends to me in my T Zone, I have combination skin; dry in most areas with an oily T Zone. I am very fortunate not to suffer with blemishes too often but sometimes they appear and I feel this cream will come in handy.</li>
            <li> My wife said that this product really works. She put it on a couple of spots before going to bed and they were not noticeable by morning.</li>
            <li> You know how &amp;#34;they&amp;#34; tell you that if you have acne, you should leave it alone and it will go away on its own? They lie. I have this weird ... I don&#x27;t even know what to call it, sort of a whitehead maybe, that I&#x27;ve had on my forehead literally for at least a year. After using this on it every day, twice a day, it&#x27;s nearly gone! I&#x27;m pretty excited about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do use a salicylic acid face wash and lotion (Aveeno) but I&#x27;ve been using those for a while and this thing hadn&#x27;t changed a lick. I think having the concentrated application really made a difference. You really can&#x27;t beat the price ($6-ish). It also smells really nice unlike some acne treatment products. I&#x27;d recommend it for adults with acne as it&#x27;s also non-drying.</li>
            <li> My initial impression of Olay Fresh Effects Clear Skin Spot Zinger.  of It feels lovely going on. It feels cooling and soothing and fresh. It is also not overly drying. My face felt comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it didn&#x27;t really do anything. It didn&#x27;t help with zits or blackheads. They didn&#x27;t clear up. They didn&#x27;t decrease.</li>
            <li> I am still using this product, the one thing I&#x27;ve notices is my face has been itching. I have discontinued my makeup for a while to test to see if that&#x27;s what the problem is (I&#x27;m using a new foundation) I do not notice a strong scent to this product, so I don&#x27;t know what could be causing the itch. And it is a serious itch. I can&#x27;t tell the difference in how the blemish looks because of my skin tone, I am not usually red. Again I am going to continue to use a few more days to see if I can spot a change...no pun intended ok well yell maybe I did intend it.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 5/6/15- this does not seem to be helping me at all.</li>
            <li> I love trying new skin care products and as a regular of spot treatment creams I was excited to try this Oil of Olay product. The first thing I noticed was the pleasant scent of this cream. It was not oily or gel-like, but very creamy like a lotion. I didn&#x27;t notice as big of a reduction of pimples and redness compared to other spot-treatments I use regularly. This just didn&#x27;t work well with my skin.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  For some reason, it has been increasingly difficult to find a Salicylic Acid spot treatment that is in a cream/lotion formula, the few Salicylic Acid products that are out there are almost all gels.  I tried Neutrogena Naturals Acne Spot Treatment before, but do not like that one at all.  I had resorted to Philosophy Clear Days Ahead, which is a great treatment as well, but it costs about 3 times as much as this product and is consistently out of stock.  The smell of this product is amazing, it reminds me of a mojito!  This product claims to &amp;#34;blur&amp;#34; blemishes, which I did not really notice, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to anyway.  If you want to hide a blemish, put concealer on it!  Overall I recommend Olay Fresh Effect Clear Skin Spot Zinger will continue to use this product over other options.</li>
            <li> This spot zinger is wonderful! I have the occasional break-out and a dab of this clears it up within a day. It is very gentle and non-drying. I also have a few of those annoying little flesh-to-whitish-colored bumps called sebaceous hyperplasia and this spot zinger is definitely making them much less noticeable. I have only been using this for about 10 days but I am totally hooked! Did not buy my original tube from Amazon because I did not realize they carried it! But when I just came online to read reviews of this product my Google search brought me here. I will order this in the future from Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - buy this! It really works and is gentle, causing no drying or flaking. I love it!</li>
            <li> Works but not noticing anything better or faster than similar products. If you&#x27;re hoping for faster spot treatment, try something else.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this stuff!! It&#x27;s great for acne flare ups, but gentle enough to use everyday or even on your whole face. This is totally worth the money. My daughter and I both use it - she has oily skin and I have dry skin and it works great for both of us.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Clean and Clear version of this product for years and it works great but it really dries out my skin in the affected area.  That product is a gel but this one is a white cream with a very pleasant light scent.  It goes on with a light touch and blends in well.  My overall evaluation is that it works okay.  On smaller, less angry blemishes it seemed to work fine.  They disappeared and I was happy to see that my skin wasn&#x27;t dry and flaky afterwards.  I also tried it on some nastier blemishes and it didn&#x27;t seem to work at all.  I went back to my Clean and Clear product instead which proved more effective.  I also never saw any sign that redness or irritation of the blemishes went away as quickly as the product advertises.  I&#x27;ll still keep this in my arsenal but will only use it for minor blemishes.</li>
            <li> Regardless of your age and skin condition, this stuff really does dry and help control/eliminate acne  and bumps without irritating the skin.  My daughter tried it on her acne and it worked nearly overnight to dry and tone down the redness of acne.  I gave it a try on those nasty fleshy or whitish (sebaceous hyperplasia ) bumps I get now and then, even as an middle aged person.  It is making them seem smaller, and since my skin is very dry, I expected to see a more drying effect, but didn&#x27;t notice that at all.  Smells good too, and a great price through amazon. My husband keeps his hair cut very near the scalp, and sometimes gets those little sort of ingrown hair bumps on his upper back neck.  I used this on them, and they helped dry them up too.  A day later, the little hair was sticking out (but still seemed ingrown) and I tweezed  them out.  By the next day, one more application cleared the spots altogether.  We will be buying this from now on, and no where is the price better than Amazon..</li>
            <li> This tinted cream contains 2% salicylic acid, which is a milder treatment than the more common benzoyl peroxide.  The tube holds 0.5 oz.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a zit expert. I&#x27;m 46 and still get them, so I know what I&#x27;m talking about and while the product works, I have a few issues with the marketing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;first off, Targeted Takeover? Really!??? Anyone who&#x27;s had to battle zits knows you don&#x27;t contaminate the product by touching the skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The before and after pictures use photoshop, they aren&#x27;t real, although the &amp;#34;real women focus group&amp;#34; makes it subconsciously seem like it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it work any better than the rest? nope. 2% is 2%.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for getting rid of blemishes. It feels fine on my skin and is a product I will keep on using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I look matters at work when I am speaking in front of people. It is important for me that a product like this does not irritate my skin and this does not. It is important for me that it is easy to apply and it is. It is important for me that it does not have any strong odor and this has a mild scent.  It is important for me that a product like this works and it works well. I will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> My fianc&amp;eacute; started using this stuff just over a month ago and noticed considerable reduction in facial acne within 72 hours of consistent use.  She noted that as long as usage is applied consistently on a daily basis, the results do not deviate so I would recommend this to anyone wanting to get rid of and keep acne away as my lady will continue to use Olay products.</li>
            <li> Every now and then...lol...even the most perfect skin has a teeny tiny little irritating spot/blemish/zit!  And...seriously...these little spots usually occur when you really need your skin to look it&#x27;s best.  There are tons of zit zappers out there and I have used some...I like to be prepared for any and every emergency!  I love this newer product from Oil Of Olay.  It worked overnight on my little imperfection...it lessened the redness and my spot was gone reasonably quickly.  I had no irritation to this product at all.  This tiny little tube is one that I will keep on hand all of the time!</li>
            <li> I have been using Alba&#x27;s salicylic acid acne treatment and have not been happy with it, so I was willing to give this product a try and I am glad I did. I like it a LOT better than the Alba product, or the Neutrogena product I had used before that. This has a really pleasant scent (the Alba product smells like alcohol) and it is an opaque white color, as opposed to clear, which probably accounts for some of the &amp;#34;blurring&amp;#34; effect that the product claims. It does seem to lighten the color of any red spots that I have. It creates a matte effect on the skin and does not dry with any sort of residue. It, like other salicylic acid products, is pretty effective in healing blemishes more quickly. My only complaint is that the tube is pretty small. I wish they had an option for a  larger size.</li>
            <li> I have had skin problems my whole life so I am always willing to try something new and see if it works with my skin type. I have used other Olay products before to varying degrees of success. This one was a big winner for me! I noticed a change after 24 hours-to my surprise. It had a warm feeling for the first 15 minutes or so that felt very refreshing. Also the smell is great-one of my kids came into the room and said what smells so good?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worked great for me-would give it a try!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like giving negative reviews, and I received this product as a free offer for an honest review. Other people have reviewed the product in depth, so I&#x27;ll just add my own small amount of &amp;#34;two cents.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One reviewer listed all the ingredients and this is why I&#x27;m giving it only two stars. I have very sensitive skin and am allergic to chemicals, fragrances and more. I had hoped that the &amp;#34;fresh effects&amp;#34; would work naturally, but this was not the case. I especially disliked the silicon that is in the mix that &amp;#34;helps the product adhere to the skin.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the list of ingredients. Doesn&#x27;t sound very &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; to me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The active ingredient is Salicylic Acid 2%. For those with allergies or other concerns, the inactive ingredients are: Water, Ppg-15 Stearyl Ether, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Titanium Dioxide, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Talc, Stearyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Dimethiconol, Isohexadecane, Decylene Glycol, Steareth-21, Laureth-7, Fragrance, Disodium Edta, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought with al the &amp;#34;leaf extracts&amp;#34; this product would be fine, but for sensitive skin like mine, it&#x27;s not. I will go back to using my own real, natural liquid aloe that I grow myself in a pot in the windowsill, and &amp;#34;fillet&amp;#34; the leaves and run the gel through the blender, and store in the refrigerator for up to a month. I use the fresh aloe juice on my skin which removes age spots, blemishes (yet, I still get them!), pre-cancerous red sun spots and more. The skin on my chest and hands are also much softer now and more &amp;#34;elastic&amp;#34; with no dry spots as before. You can also drink the aloe juice to aid in digestion or constipation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m supposed to be reviewing the Procter &amp; Gamble product, so I will say no more about aloe. But I hope that anyone who has super-sensitive skin like I do will try the real, fresh aloe treatment as it really works, and avoid anything that has silicon or chemicals in it, as this product does. From reading the other reviews, it appear that it does work well for those people and I&#x27;m glad it does.or constipation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m supposed to be reviewing the Procter &amp; Gamble product, so I will say no more about aloe. But I hope that anyone who has super-sensitive skin like I do will try the real, fresh aloe treatment as it really works, and avoid anything that has silicon or chemicals in it, as this product does.

            <li> This product contains salicylic acid which has been out a very long time and has been proven effective against acne. So while this product does work for fighting acne, the thing that bothers me is the 10 minute claim. The statement “Improves the look of blemishes in just 10 minutes”. Well, I tried this on several blemishes and none of them looked “improved” in 10 minutes. I do think it helped improve the pimples and helped them clear up a little quicker than if I had done nothing, but that was after using this a few times a day for a couple of days.  I think this is an okay product, but the 10 minute claim is not realistic.&lt;br /&gt; I also resent that the before/after pictures on the Amazon product page are not real before/after pictures. The fine print says they are “digitally simulated to reflect actual results achieved in product testing”.  That is just not right. Show us real, unretouched pictures.</li>
            <li> Prior to receiving this I had been using another brand that I was happy with. It worked most of the time when I felt a breakout coming on, but wasn&#x27;t able to stop them all.  The Olay Spot Zinger has been even better at stopping them and it doesn&#x27;t have the off smell or white residue that the other has.  Overall very happy with the results, especially since it also seems to dry out my skin less.</li>
            <li> This gets 4 stars just because of it&#x27;s promise to make things improve in as little as 10 minutes.  That isn&#x27;t to say they don&#x27;t work, they do, this has a large percentage of Salicylic Acid in it (2.0%) which help control acne (this is also the same percentage in Olay&#x27;s deep scrub as well, which includes a lot more product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is nice since the bottle shape and tip help to target a specific area instead of covering your entire face.  The smell is good, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your face even using it multiple times a day.</li>
            <li> I sometimes get really big blind pimples, usually on the very top of my nose. I look like Rudolph, honestly. They usually last at least a week to even two and they hurt like hell. But I put this stuff on my pimple, whic. Was literally the size of my nose at its point, and it cleared up in 2 days! I was honestly speechless. It didn&#x27;t even have to bring it to a white head, it just totally vanished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-clears up spots within a few days&lt;br /&gt;-smells very good&lt;br /&gt;-small packaging and easy to use&lt;br /&gt;-not messy and absorbs easily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-after multiple uses, since it does have silicone in it, a clear film starts to develop that will need to be scrubbed off</li>
            <li> YES, MAMA! This stuff was not only pretty effective at battling those &amp;#34;under the skin&amp;#34; pre-pimples that seem to threaten me monthly, but also did the trick with my husband&#x27;s already-there zits. As an added bonus, it smells really nice which... I mean, let&#x27;s be honest: that&#x27;s not going to help anyone fight break-outs, but when you&#x27;re putting weird goop on your face to deal with an ugly lump, it&#x27;s nice to have a nice smell to make you feel less gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging warned that this could cause dryness, and I will say that even with my drier, sensitive skin, I didn&#x27;t run into any issues... which I have with other spot treatments. Whatever they&#x27;re doing, it works for me!</li>
            <li> This spot treatment works pretty fast. The salicylic acid seems to dry up any spots or acne that occurs, no matter how oily your skin is.&lt;br /&gt;It is a cream which gives less of an oily appearance than a gel and also seems to work more effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the harsh sounding ingredient of salicylic acid it is gentle and does not really sting when you use it.&lt;br /&gt;I really appreciate it for the little sebaceous bumps that I seem to get every once in a while that nothing else seems to make them go away.&lt;br /&gt;The narrow opening helps in a precise application.</li>
            <li> Olay products have never let me down. I love all of their products. This Olay Clear Skin Spot Zinger works really well.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it many times with good results. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> Olay is a brand I own and buy. I already use a cream to use at night from my dermatologist to help with my skin. But sometimes I need a little bit more. Even though it states it will improve the look of blemishes within ten minutes, I can’t say that claim is true. However, I have added it onto my night time regime and it does show improvement in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this and when I run out I will be buying more. I have been using it sparingly over the last few weeks and so far I really like it.</li>
            <li> This along with the Acne Hater Face Scrub and Swirl Mattifier has changed my life!  My face has cleared up dramatically.  I&#x27;ve tried everything and nothing has worked as well as this line.  You do have to use it as directed and not stray from a regimen.</li>
            <li> So far this product has proven to work great.  It works fast &amp; not drying.</li>
            <li> I found this preparation to work very well. I had four skin blemishes that I treated with the Spot Zinger. Three were gone within ten days. The fourth and largest is fading and should soon be gone also. It has certainly worked for me, and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product contains the standard 2% of Salicylic Acid found in most products of this type. The main difference is that this is a cream formula as opposed to a gel formula, which is what the majority of the products out on the market are now. And also, this has a very pleasing lightly minty citrusy fragrance. I really like that this is a cream because of the control one has while applying it to the skin (gels are more difficult to distribute). I normally apply Salicylic Acid sparingly to my skin because I have dry, sensitive skin but this cream really improved the texture of the skin immediately even on non-blemished areas. I don&#x27;t think this performed any miracles on my actual blemish by reducing it immediately (overnight it did, however) but I did feel a silkiness to the texture of my skin where I had applied the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product especially to people who have sensitive skin like I do. The scent is really lovely and the price is extremely reasonable. I have not seen this offered in my local CVS or Duane Reade but will be keeping an eye out for it.</li>
            <li> A nice solution for those occasional blemishes we all get.  Not too harsh, yet strong enough.  Small bottle, with narrow tip is very convenient for hitting the exact spot.  Also portable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good quality; Olay does a good job of protecting their brand by making decent products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works!</li>
