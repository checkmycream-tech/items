            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I can keep my nails looking nice for a weekend with this stuff.</li>
            <li>I do 1 coat of this, 2 coats of my polish, 1 more coat of this and then finish it off with China Glaze&#x27;s Good to Go topcoat.</li>
            <li>This helps it stay on there nicely.</li>
            <li>perfect if you have real nails and your polish flakes or peels ..</li>
            <li>I own a lot of China Glaze nail products and crackles.</li>
            <li>lol Has a very shiny coating to it and its soo cute!</li>
            <li>Most polish without this chips in about 3 days.  </li>
            <li>I ended up buying this and the top coat.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to love this product.</li>
            <li>I was unfortunately gifted with nails that make a slip-n-slide look sticky.</li>
            <li>I do love china glaze though</li>
            <li>i will be buying more off amazon...</li>
            <li>but I already love it.</li>
            <li>I love it and would buy it again.</li>
            <li>Not convinced of the &amp;#34;strong adhesion&amp;#34; claim of this product, and wouldn&#x27;t recommend the top coat either.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe more people don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just okay</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just me, because my nails seem to be thinner and more flexible than lots of people&#x27;s, but no matter what polish I wear, it always chips within a day.</li>
            <li>I put this on and then painted two top coats</li>
            <li>Love this nail polish.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it does just what it is supposed to do</li>
            <li>With the Seche Vite top coat I can go about two days.</li>
            <li>Works better than OPI &amp; CND Stickey for me.</li>
            <li>Love them all.</li>
            <li>I never have chips even after a week or more wearing these products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sticky and does NOT make your nail polish stay on any better.  </li>
            <li>Extended my manicure 3 days... fantastic!</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty amazing!</li>
            <li>im sure you could use it as a top coat as well</li>
            <li>I really love CHINA GLAZE nail filled.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product after reading some pretty good reviews.</li>
            <li>I think this product helps keep my nail polish from chipping so easily.</li>
            <li>Had strong hopes but its a no-go</li>
            <li>worked fine for me, but not for her.</li>
            <li>It goes on fine</li>
            <li>So I ordered this and received it quick!</li>
            <li>It does help the color polish to go on smoothly and with out running all over.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>This stuff isn&#x27;t what it&#x27;s made to sound like.  </li>
            <li>I learned that some people have naturally oily nails, just like hair and skin can be oily, and this would inhibit good adhesion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty excited about this!</li>
            <li>Makes my nail polish stick better and the drying time is fast.</li>
            <li>I do not like the top coat as much.</li>
            <li>Makes nail polish last, :) i love it</li>
            <li>Came very fast!  </li>
            <li>A very inexpensive and easy way to extend the wear of your nail polish.</li>
            <li>My 7 year old daughter&#x27;s nail polish never stays on more than 1 - 2 days.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it to try this.</li>
            <li>I love CG and I love that they have a wonderful base coat.</li>
            <li>so i hope you take my word that this product is soo worth it.</li>
            <li>I like the natural, shiny look; so I purchased the top coat with this.</li>
            <li>Just got this today and had to try it right away.</li>
            <li>First of all, this product came SUPER fast!</li>
            <li>I have weak and peel-prone nails, so maybe this works better for someone with good nails.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really seem to work any better than a clear coat under color</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with it because it made my manicure last longer; isn&#x27;t that enough?  </li>
            <li>Now lets hope it truly does help keep your polish on ;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been an obsessive nail biter since the day I first had teeth.  </li>
            <li>i love this stuff...makes my polish last longer...</li>
            <li>This one really helps the nail polish stay on both of us!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely buy more when the time comes.</li>
            <li>and I will definitely be buying the top coat.</li>
            <li>It looks great by itself and holds my regular nail polish for a long time.</li>
            <li>Other wise it went on nicely and dried fast.</li>
            <li>My nail polish last MUCH longer with no base coat!!!!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re kind of heavy handed like I am with my right hand</li>
            <li>Normal polish peels right off within a day or two.  </li>
            <li>With this stuff and Seche Vite top coat, I can got 7-8 days without a single chip!</li>
            <li>and I used the whole bottle</li>
            <li>(I was really hoping it would eventually work hehe)</li>
            <li>beauty stores charge too much for stuff like this.</li>
            <li>My nails chipped and broke just as fast</li>
            <li>I am very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>Company worked with me very well</li>
            <li>Fast shipping /</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing this item again and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It dries really fast</li>
            <li>Nail polish no longer stains my nails and is much easier to remove when I am ready.  </li>
            <li>I found this base coat to be more effective than most I have tried.  </li>
            <li>It was OK, but not any better or worse than the others.</li>
            <li>As far as base coats go, I have tried them all, and China Glaze Strong Adhesion is, by far, the best.</li>
            <li>I am attempting to grow my nails longer, now that I am getting older.  </li>
            <li>It was okay but not especially good.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product -</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really see a difference with or without a base coat, but if your nails stain easily then great product to use</li>
            <li>but  once the top of my polish became basically bullet-proof it became very clear that my only obstacle to a really long-lasting manicure was getting the damn stuff to actually stick to my natural nails.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t peel off easily like other ones do and my polish stays on longer.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t live without I recommend it to any nail  lover</li>
            <li>It is a good base coat before you apply the nail polish colored on top.</li>
            <li>Purchased this and top coat by same brand--have tried using them multiple times, and my nails chipped the next day each time.</li>
            <li>Last week (week of Jul/15/13) of my first time receiving it; the polish started to chip within 3-4 days.</li>
            <li>It looks like I got a professional manicure!</li>
            <li>It smooths out the slight ridges and chips in my nails, and it makes my polish go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s been a week and there are no signs of peeling to be found as of yet.  </li>
            <li>I think young kids have oilier nail beds than adults</li>
            <li>but my nail polish will peel off the whole entire nail.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m someone who can&#x27;t get nail polish to last more than a few hours without chipping.</li>
            <li>It is a good product, and would extend the life of polish, but maybe for a couple of days more than regular base coat.</li>
            <li>I loved this base coat it makes my nail polish go on smoothly and protects my nails.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what the advantage is versus using no base coat at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update June 2014: It might not be the product&#x27;s fault.</li>
            <li>Really keeps my manicure on for a long time.</li>
            <li>Many other base coats to choose from, this isn&#x27;t a good one.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s like sticky, so I just put my polish on my bare nails..</li>
            <li>Two days later is was almost completely off and peeled in sheets.</li>
            <li>And because i&#x27;m starting a new year, i want to stop spending study time painting my nails and actually study.</li>
            <li>true blue honest to god nail base</li>
            <li>This is definitely the thing to use whenever you are doing natural nails with regular polish.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly, keeps my nail polish on sans chips for days and I am not easy on my nails!</li>
            <li>and it dried so fast!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I typically wear pale sheer pink on my hands so that wear and chips are less obvious, I put this to the test with a cute new hot pink polish...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I love this product only because i&amp;#34;ve never used a base coat, or if it IS simply amazing.</li>
            <li>I, however, found that my nail polish not only chipped, but came off in large pieces after just a few days.</li>

            <li> As far as base coats go, I have tried them all, and China Glaze Strong Adhesion is, by far, the best.</li>
            <li> I am attempting to grow my nails longer, now that I am getting older.  </li>
            <li> It was okay but not especially good.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product -</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really see a difference with or without a base coat, but if your nails stain easily then great product to use</li>
            <li> but  once the top of my polish became basically bullet-proof it became very clear that my only obstacle to a really long-lasting manicure was getting the damn stuff to actually stick to my natural nails.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t peel off easily like other ones do and my polish stays on longer.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t live without I recommend it to any nail  lover</li>
            <li> It is a good base coat before you apply the nail polish colored on top.</li>
            <li> Purchased this and top coat by same brand--have tried using them multiple times, and my nails chipped the next day each time.</li>
            <li> Last week (week of Jul/15/13) of my first time receiving it; the polish started to chip within 3-4 days.</li>
            <li> It looks like I got a professional manicure!</li>
            <li> It smooths out the slight ridges and chips in my nails, and it makes my polish go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s been a week and there are no signs of peeling to be found as of yet.  </li>
            <li> I think young kids have oilier nail beds than adults</li>
            <li> but my nail polish will peel off the whole entire nail.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m someone who can&#x27;t get nail polish to last more than a few hours without chipping.</li>
            <li> It is a good product, and would extend the life of polish, but maybe for a couple of days more than regular base coat.</li>
            <li> I loved this base coat it makes my nail polish go on smoothly and protects my nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the advantage is versus using no base coat at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update June 2014: It might not be the product&#x27;s fault.</li>
            <li> Really keeps my manicure on for a long time.</li>
            <li> Many other base coats to choose from, this isn&#x27;t a good one.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s like sticky, so I just put my polish on my bare nails..</li>
            <li> Two days later is was almost completely off and peeled in sheets.</li>
            <li> And because i&#x27;m starting a new year, i want to stop spending study time painting my nails and actually study.</li>
            <li> true blue honest to god nail base</li>
            <li> This is definitely the thing to use whenever you are doing natural nails with regular polish.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly, keeps my nail polish on sans chips for days and I am not easy on my nails!</li>
            <li> and it dried so fast!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I typically wear pale sheer pink on my hands so that wear and chips are less obvious, I put this to the test with a cute new hot pink polish...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I love this product only because i&amp;#34;ve never used a base coat, or if it IS simply amazing.</li>
            <li> I, however, found that my nail polish not only chipped, but came off in large pieces after just a few days.</li>
            <li> Granted, I&#x27;m not dainty with my nails, but I&#x27;m not brutal on them either</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m supposed to de-grease my nails with alcohol first, and then base coats should adhere better.</li>
            <li> I am hard on my nails...and change polish pretty often...</li>
            <li> I did a google search for long lasting polish and China Glaze came up.  </li>
            <li> I never knew that polish could last so long without chipping.</li>
            <li> I can tell a big difference in how long my polish lasts now versus before I started using it.</li>
            <li> Also it actually makes my nail polish dry faster.</li>
            <li> This adhesion base coat really makes the polish stick, and doesn&#x27;t take too long to dry, even though I use it with color and then a top coat.</li>
            <li> No waiting around long to start my colored coat of nail polish.</li>
            <li> Smooths out ridges in my nails and polish holds a long while</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acrylic on my nails for so long that polish just does not stay on.</li>
            <li> Polish stays on long.</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews for this product and was hopeful that it might make my nail polish last longer than an hour.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews unless an item is awful or awesome</li>
            <li> --I&#x27;m used to nail polish lasting at least several days before it starts to chip--and even then, it will START to chip after about ... day 3-ish.</li>
            <li> Shipping was way faster than the expected time</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as well as i expected.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a nail polish or nail polish / base coat / top coat combination that actually works on my nails.</li>
            <li> Not sure why it peels off the next day..</li>
            <li> polish stays on longer than with a regular base coat, and it seems to smooth out the ridges in my nails, too.</li>
            <li> Love this long lasting base coat!</li>
            <li> I like this base coat more than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m sorry, but why must this be a certain number of words?  </li>
            <li> The base coat is strong, but it does take awhile to dry.</li>
            <li> Although, my polish does begin to chip off withing 24 hours, but this is MUCH BETTER than nothing, or the base coats I have tried.</li>
            <li> This base coat did not extend the life of my manicure any more than polish alone.</li>
            <li> I used this base coat with china glaze nail polish and inm out the door top coat and could not be happier.</li>
            <li> Used this base coat, put on the polish and then use their top coat.  </li>
            <li> I was very excited to recieve this base coat.  </li>
            <li> Everything else peels up in less than a day.</li>
            <li> My polish stays on like crazy, even at the tips where it always rubs off first.</li>
            <li> I almost feel the the strong adhesion worked over night even though its a base</li>
            <li> For me, the color nail polish coat adheres to this fine (why wouldn&#x27;t it?), but within a few days the base coat separates from the nail.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it but not to heavy handed people if you don&#x27;t mind applying nail polish twice a week.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t use this under my nail polish, I don&#x27;t use any base coat, every time I have tried it just makes my nail polish not go on smooth</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> It helped a little with making the polish last longer, but to me it doesn&#x27;t make a dramatic difference.</li>
            <li> my manicures held the same amount of time as they did with out this product not impressed may work for other people didn&#x27;t work for me though</li>
            <li> even the less expensive nail polishes I use over this base coat last longer than their normal lasting time.</li>
            <li> This is the one and only base coat that has ever worked on my natural nails to keep polish on.</li>
            <li> I love this base coat!</li>
            <li> My nail polish stays on a week longer than usual</li>
            <li> Not sure if it sat in the heat during shipment.</li>
            <li> It definitely makes polishes adhere to the nail bed longer than a regular base coat.  </li>
            <li> I started using this base coat last week and everyday since, it&#x27;s been a habit to try and peel the polish off, fortunately, no matter how i tried, i could not peel the polish off.</li>
            <li> If  you&#x27;ve tried other base coats and your nails still peel in the same day</li>
            <li> Having trouble with various base coats, I tried this one.  </li>
            <li> I had to go back to my Essie base instead of this.</li>
            <li> But I only use it to have something on my nails, I hate the feeling of nothing on my nails, so the day before I take my shower, I just put this on, then that evening I will take it off and do my nails</li>
            <li> This is the only base coat I can use.</li>
            <li> This base coat will even make the cheapest polishes last days longer.</li>
            <li> The only base coat I use</li>
            <li> I find myself using different base coats because this one just doesn&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
            <li> I had never really found a base coat</li>
            <li> I have a lot of problems with my nail polish just coming off randomly</li>
            <li> When i didn&#x27;t use a base coat, i used to sit i class everyday and peel my nail polish off.</li>
            <li> They usually get flaky at the tips after I wear nail polish, but after using this base coat, my nails continued to flake for over a month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really used a \\&quot;base coat\\&quot; before, but I heard they help!</li>
            <li> very disappointed I wasted my money on this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid.</li>
            <li> I was too crazy about before this one.</li>
            <li> Too bad.  </li>
            <li> (*No issues with seller--just disappointed in product.)</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s bad, but this base does NOT allow me to peel at all...</li>
            <li> I have never been disappointed in the china glaze brand.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use a base then this</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had this happen with the Adhesion base.</li>
            <li> I used it as my base coat for my toes and</li>
            <li> I will never buy another brand of base coat.</li>
            <li> so the base coat I used to use</li>
            <li> I can sit there and just peel this base coat off..</li>
            <li> Just not this base coat</li>
            <li> This base coat does not keep my polish on, and it creates not barrier for my darker polished.</li>
            <li> i needed a base coat that would work with every type of polish i have.</li>
            <li> It is my go to, base coat.</li>
            <li> I like this base coat.</li>

            <li> For me, the color nail polish coat adheres to this fine (why wouldn&#x27;t it?), but within a few days the base coat separates from the nail. I&#x27;m not sure what the advantage is versus using no base coat at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update June 2014: It might not be the product&#x27;s fault. I learned that some people have naturally oily nails, just like hair and skin can be oily, and this would inhibit good adhesion. I&#x27;m supposed to de-grease my nails with alcohol first, and then base coats should adhere better. When I get around to trying that I&#x27;ll post another update with my results.</li>
            <li> You need this if you are at home or taking a trip to the nail shop.  It definitely makes polishes adhere to the nail bed longer than a regular base coat.  I didn&#x27;t use a base then this I just used this and my polish lasted 7-10 days. Most polish without this chips in about 3 days.  This is definitely the thing to use whenever you are doing natural nails with regular polish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really used a \\&quot;base coat\\&quot; before, but I heard they help! So I ordered this and received it quick! I went to go do my nails and put on one coat and it dried so fast! No waiting around long to start my colored coat of nail polish. Now lets hope it truly does help keep your polish on ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been an obsessive nail biter since the day I first had teeth.  The only way to stop me from biting is if I wear polish.  Normal polish peels right off within a day or two.  I did a google search for long lasting polish and China Glaze came up.  I ended up buying this and the top coat.  So far it&#x27;s been a week and there are no signs of peeling to be found as of yet.  I&#x27;m pretty excited about this!</li>
            <li> Came very fast!  Although, my polish does begin to chip off withing 24 hours, but this is MUCH BETTER than nothing, or the base coats I have tried.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product. I was unfortunately gifted with nails that make a slip-n-slide look sticky. I had recently gotten a gel manicure (supposed to last up to 2 weeks) that chipped off within 3 days. I read the other reviews for this product and was hopeful that it might make my nail polish last longer than an hour. However, I don&#x27;t believe this product helped the polish adhere one bit. After applying the product as directed on the package, I set off to work, where I must wash my hands and don gloves before beginning my day. While drying my hands, I noticed my polish was already chipped and peeling. No hope for me I&#x27;m afraid.</li>
            <li> I love this base coat! Nail polish is usually chipping off within the first 3 days on my nails. I got 7 full days with NO chips!!! I highly recommend this product - I love ALL of the China Glaze nail polishes - great colors, great price, thank you Amazon for having everything I need!</li>
            <li> I think this product helps keep my nail polish from chipping so easily. I used it every time.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really seem to work any better than a clear coat under color does-for me anyway. I have weak and peel-prone nails, so maybe this works better for someone with good nails. I do love china glaze though, the polish never gooped up at all and I used the whole bottle (I was really hoping it would eventually work hehe)</li>
            <li> This is the one and only base coat that has ever worked on my natural nails to keep polish on. Everything else peels up in less than a day. I can keep my nails looking nice for a weekend with this stuff.</li>
            <li> polish stays on longer than with a regular base coat, and it seems to smooth out the ridges in my nails, too.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff...makes my polish last longer...i will be buying more off amazon...beauty stores charge too much for stuff like this.</li>
            <li> I just got this as a gift and have only used it once but I already love it. I have a lot of problems with my nail polish just coming off randomly and I haven&#x27;t had this happen with the Adhesion base. I love it and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful! I used it as my base coat for my toes and two weeks later it was still on there as if I had just polished them! That never happens. It always starts to chip after four days. Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My nails chipped and broke just as fast if not faster using this product. I even bought a China Glaze color to go with it. No dice.</li>
            <li> Purchased this and top coat by same brand--have tried using them multiple times, and my nails chipped the next day each time. Granted, I&#x27;m not dainty with my nails, but I&#x27;m not brutal on them either--I&#x27;m used to nail polish lasting at least several days before it starts to chip--and even then, it will START to chip after about ... day 3-ish. With these China Glaze polishes, the entire nail surface would peel off. When I sandwiched a color between the layers, same problem. Not convinced of the &amp;#34;strong adhesion&amp;#34; claim of this product, and wouldn&#x27;t recommend the top coat either. (*No issues with seller--just disappointed in product.)</li>
            <li> As far as base coats go, I have tried them all, and China Glaze Strong Adhesion is, by far, the best. My polish stays on like crazy, even at the tips where it always rubs off first. I will never buy another brand of base coat. I can&#x27;t believe more people don&#x27;t use it. Try it once and you&#x27;ll see for yourself, it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just okay, it doesn&#x27;t work with some nail polishes like Essie.  I had to go back to my Essie base instead of this.</li>
            <li> It does not lengthen the time polish is on my nails without chipping. Had strong hopes but its a no-go</li>
            <li> I like this base coat more than any other I&#x27;ve tried. It doesn&#x27;t peel off easily like other ones do and my polish stays on longer.</li>
            <li> This base coat is really great. My 7 year old daughter&#x27;s nail polish never stays on more than 1 - 2 days. I think young kids have oilier nail beds than adults so the base coat I used to use worked fine for me, but not for her. This one really helps the nail polish stay on both of us!</li>
            <li> Makes nail polish last, :) i love it&lt;br /&gt;it look great after the nail polish or for rhinestones its great</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a nail polish or nail polish / base coat / top coat combination that actually works on my nails. Maybe it&#x27;s just me, because my nails seem to be thinner and more flexible than lots of people&#x27;s, but no matter what polish I wear, it always chips within a day. This base coat did not extend the life of my manicure any more than polish alone. Perhaps it&#x27;s a coincidence, but my nails also took longer to recover after I removed this product. They usually get flaky at the tips after I wear nail polish, but after using this base coat, my nails continued to flake for over a month. I only wore it once.</li>
            <li> It is a good product, and would extend the life of polish, but maybe for a couple of days more than regular base coat. It does help the color polish to go on smoothly and with out running all over.</li>
            <li> I now just have 1 touch up a week and the polish lasts all week. I am going to try this brand again.</li>
            <li> It is a good base coat before you apply the nail polish colored on top. No need for another coat.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot . Really keeps my manicure on for a long time. I will be using this a lot.</li>
            <li> Did nothing to prolong manicure.  Many other base coats to choose from, this isn&#x27;t a good one.  Too bad.  I really love CHINA GLAZE nail filled.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re kind of heavy handed like I am with my right hand then be prepared to apply polish twice a week. Last week (week of Jul/15/13) of my first time receiving it; the polish started to chip within 3-4 days. This week (week of Jul/22/13) of not being so heavy handed my nail polish stayed on for a whole week. So I guess it depends on what you do with your hands. I&#x27;d recommend it but not to heavy handed people if you don&#x27;t mind applying nail polish twice a week. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> I found this base coat to be more effective than most I have tried.  I will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Smooths out ridges in my nails and polish holds a long while</li>
            <li> I love china glaze, but this isn&#x27;t great. I will put it on, the next day I will shower and when I get out, all my nails are peeling! I can sit there and just peel this base coat off.. But I only use it to have something on my nails, I hate the feeling of nothing on my nails, so the day before I take my shower, I just put this on, then that evening I will take it off and do my nails, I don&#x27;t use this under my nail polish, I don&#x27;t use any base coat, every time I have tried it just makes my nail polish not go on smooth, it&#x27;s like sticky, so I just put my polish on my bare nails.. Not sure why it peels off the next day.. But I really love china glaze polishes!! Just not this base coat</li>
            <li> Nails stick amazing and perfectly. this adhesive even works well for applying diamonds, bows, crowns , etc you get the idea</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product after reading some pretty good reviews. I, however, found that my nail polish not only chipped, but came off in large pieces after just a few days.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to recieve this base coat.  I am attempting to grow my nails longer, now that I am getting older.  I would never purchase this product agaian. This base coat does not keep my polish on, and it creates not barrier for my darker polished. I put this on and then painted two top coats and my nails were still stained red from the polish.  I am very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> Love this nail polish.</li>
            <li> My nail polish stays on a week longer than usual I love it! If you are debating about buying this product you should definitely get it here because the price is cheaper than in the stores (actually it&#x27;s sold out a lot of the time in stores).</li>
            <li> Works great. Company worked with me very well</li>
            <li> I love this product, it does just what it is supposed to do, i read others reviews and decided to take a chance, good choice!!</li>
            <li> Makes my nail polish stick better and the drying time is fast. I do 1 coat of this, 2 coats of my polish, 1 more coat of this and then finish it off with China Glaze&#x27;s Good to Go topcoat. It last for 7-9 days!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping / Great item! Very happy!</li>
            <li> I am hooked on this product. I never knew that polish could last so long without chipping. Polish lasts longer when it is China Glaze but even the less expensive nail polishes I use over this base coat last longer than their normal lasting time. I will be purchasing this item again and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I am hard on my nails...and change polish pretty often... In fact if my nail polish starts to lift, I peel it off...I know it&#x27;s bad, but this base does NOT allow me to peel at all...nails saved!!!</li>
            <li> This is. Really great base oat. I&#x27;m someone who can&#x27;t get nail polish to last more than a few hours without chipping. With the Seche Vite top coat I can go about two days. With this stuff and Seche Vite top coat, I can got 7-8 days without a single chip! Love this long lasting base coat!</li>
            <li> This is the only base coat I can use. I&#x27;ve had acrylic on my nails for so long that polish just does not stay on. This helps it stay on there nicely. If  you&#x27;ve tried other base coats and your nails still peel in the same day it&#x27;s worth it to try this.</li>
            <li> my manicures held the same amount of time as they did with out this product not impressed may work for other people didn&#x27;t work for me though</li>
            <li> I love CG and I love that they have a wonderful base coat. i needed a base coat that would work with every type of polish i have. This base coat will even make the cheapest polishes last days longer.</li>
            <li> First of all, this product came SUPER fast! I got it literally 2 days after ordering, so good job there. It helped a little with making the polish last longer, but to me it doesn&#x27;t make a dramatic difference. It was okay but not especially good.</li>
            <li> I had never really found a base coat I was too crazy about before this one. It dries really fast so I&#x27;m not waiting around to apply my color. I can tell a big difference in how long my polish lasts now versus before I started using it. I&#x27;ll definitely buy more when the time comes.</li>
            <li> I used this product followed by a coral color by China Glaze and it chipped the very next day. Two days later is was almost completely off and peeled in sheets. Not sure if it sat in the heat during shipment. Other wise it went on nicely and dried fast. Wish is lasted longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I love this product only because i&amp;#34;ve never used a base coat, or if it IS simply amazing. When i didn&#x27;t use a base coat, i used to sit i class everyday and peel my nail polish off. And because i&#x27;m starting a new year, i want to stop spending study time painting my nails and actually study. I started using this base coat last week and everyday since, it&#x27;s been a habit to try and peel the polish off, fortunately, no matter how i tried, i could not peel the polish off. I used this base coat with china glaze nail polish and inm out the door top coat and could not be happier. Now i won&#x27;t have to paint my nails every night but still have them looking gorgeous. Shipping was way faster than the expected time (I think it came in about three days) and the packaging was excellent. I usually don&#x27;t write reviews unless an item is awful or awesome so i hope you take my word that this product is soo worth it.</li>
            <li> I loved this base coat it makes my nail polish go on smoothly and protects my nails. It looks like I got a professional manicure!</li>
            <li> I have never been disappointed in the china glaze brand. This adhesion base coat really makes the polish stick, and doesn&#x27;t take too long to dry, even though I use it with color and then a top coat.</li>
            <li> Works better than OPI &amp; CND Stickey for me. Polish stays on long. Goes on smoothly. It is my go to, base coat.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, I use this every time I paint my nails, it works wonders! It smooths out the slight ridges and chips in my nails, and it makes my polish go on smoothly. Love it!</li>
            <li> I paint with oils and use chemicals all the time.  Used this base coat, put on the polish and then use their top coat.  It stays on.  It doesn&#x27;t chip in big flakes, your cant&#x27; bite it off either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hey finally did it ladies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A true blue honest to god nail base that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blow me over with a feather.</li>
            <li> perfect if you have real nails and your polish flakes or peels ..keeps it looking great longer.. i wouldn&#x27;t paint my nails without it</li>
            <li> Great product! Just got this today and had to try it right away. I also have the China Glaze to coat!  I own a lot of China Glaze nail products and crackles. Love them all. Always get lots of compliments! I recommend China Glaze products. I never have chips even after a week or more wearing these products.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s a great product I love it. I&#x27;ve been using it ever since and I can&#x27;t live without I recommend it to any nail  lover</li>
            <li> Great base coat.  This does a great job of helping the color coat stay on my nails but it also protects my nails and keeps them from yellowing.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly, keeps my nail polish on sans chips for days and I am not easy on my nails! Also it actually makes my nail polish dry faster.</li>
            <li> The only base coat I use</li>
            <li> It goes on fine but my nail polish will peel off the whole entire nail. It&#x27;s like it adheres to the polish but not my nail so it just comes off all at once. I find myself using different base coats because this one just doesn&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff isn&#x27;t what it&#x27;s made to sound like.  It&#x27;s sticky and does NOT make your nail polish stay on any better.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really see a difference with or without a base coat, but if your nails stain easily then great product to use</li>
            <li> This works great and I will definitely be buying the top coat. It looks great by itself and holds my regular nail polish for a long time. This product is amazing!</li>
            <li> Nail polish no longer stains my nails and is much easier to remove when I am ready.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Awesome base coat, keeps the color off my nails and helps the polish stay on for a while!</li>
            <li> I tried using this with almost every nail polish I have.... and no matter what, it would not work!!! My nail polish last MUCH longer with no base coat!!!! This stuff seems to make the nail polish come off faster! :&#x27;( very disappointed I wasted my money on this</li>
            <li> I like this base coat. It does not leave your nails shiny. I like the natural, shiny look; so I purchased the top coat with this. I do not like the top coat as much. The base coat is strong, but it does take awhile to dry.</li>
            <li> Having trouble with various base coats, I tried this one.  It was OK, but not any better or worse than the others.</li>
            <li> Extended my manicure 3 days... fantastic! (I&#x27;m sorry, but why must this be a certain number of words?  I&#x27;m happy with it because it made my manicure last longer; isn&#x27;t that enough?  Geez, Amazon!)</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty amazing! I&#x27;ve just recently discovered Seche Vite topcoat, which is a flipping MIRACLE product - but  once the top of my polish became basically bullet-proof it became very clear that my only obstacle to a really long-lasting manicure was getting the damn stuff to actually stick to my natural nails. I asked the googlemachine for suggestions, and taDAH! this popped up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I typically wear pale sheer pink on my hands so that wear and chips are less obvious, I put this to the test with a cute new hot pink polish... and I kept it on for 10 days! That is unheard of for my nails. Truly mind-blowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff! A very inexpensive and easy way to extend the wear of your nail polish.</li>
            <li> Its awesome, Its holds for a while, and It even looks good by itself! lol Has a very shiny coating to it and its soo cute!</li>
            <li> I almost feel the the strong adhesion worked over night even though its a base im sure you could use it as a top coat as well</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as well as i expected. It did make my manicure last longer but only by maybe a day.</li>
