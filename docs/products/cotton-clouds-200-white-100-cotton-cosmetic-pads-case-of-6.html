            <li>I&#x27;ve always bought them through the mfg but tried Amazon this time and everything was great</li>
            <li>When they stopped carrying them, I was so happy to find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s great when you find something that just works.</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>They are the absolute best.  </li>
            <li>is very cheap shipping too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I didn&#x27;t love the product; I wouldn&#x27;t be ordering it on line.</li>
            <li>I ordered enough bags to stick one in the band-aid box and am very happy with them for many purposes now.</li>
            <li>I love these pads, they do not shed like</li>
            <li>Love these cotton clouds.  </li>
            <li>Much better than the ones you buy at the drug store.  </li>
            <li>These Cotton Clouds are ok for makeup removal, toner application and nail polish removal.  </li>
            <li>but I was hoping they would stay together a bit better.  </li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>glad</li>
            <li>These are mch better than using cotton balls.</li>
            <li>A more affordable option and comparable in quality to a cult favorite used and recommended by many YouTube beauty &amp;#34;gurus.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I have ordered them directly from Cotton Clouds for a time and, finally, so happy to be able to order them from Amazon.</li>
            <li>The cotton is soft and the package was delivered as promised and in great condition.</li>
            <li>okay, I was just really excited when they said they were splittable wherever you wanted them to be.  </li>
            <li>hard to find in stores, happy to get a great price and fast delivery</li>
            <li>Love that they don&#x27;t leave fuzz on my nails or around my eyes when removing eye makeup and don&#x27;t soak up too much of my eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li>Cotton Clouds are the perfect size, super soft, and you can use as much or as little as you need by separating the layers.</li>
            <li>I cannot get them directly from the manufacturer any more, but have been buying them for years.</li>
            <li>I love the size and soft cottony feel .Cotton</li>
            <li>these don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;+ economical.</li>
            <li>I find most cotton pads absorb too much of my toner or nail polish remover, wasting product - or they don&#x27;t absorb enough when you&#x27;re using them to clean your face and just shmear your makeup remover around.</li>
            <li>I was having a facial and fell in love with these.  </li>
            <li>i can split one into two and it absorbs plenty of liquid (toner, make-up remover, nail polish remover) and is strong enough to do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I certainly don&#x27;t find them a sub or dup for the Shiseido Cotton.  </li>
            <li>Gentle and luxurious feeling.</li>
            <li>They are gentle when removing eye makeup, etc.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it since you can buy big packs of 3 or 6.</li>
            <li>No pieces left behind and always do a great job removing eye makeup.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works wonders with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I use it for eye makeup removal, nail polish removal and for my baby&#x27;s sensitive skin as well.  </li>
            <li>so so soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;they&#x27;re similar to the high end shisheido ones but for a fraction of the price, why go anywhere else?</li>
            <li>People think I&#x27;m crazy for loving them so much</li>
            <li>These do shed on me sometimes with certain toners and leave little rolls of cotton on my face.  </li>

            <li> minor one, but having to pay for shipping here.</li>
            <li> The HUB grabbed a few when he accidentally got cut from a very sharp knife and they were very absorbent, so now he thinks they belong in the kitchen cabinet along with band-aids.</li>

            <li> and then you have to be careful not to get cotton in your eyes when removing make-up.  </li>
            <li> but they are extremely fuzzy in the center so if you split them you lose the compressed cotton on one side</li>
            <li> other pads do.</li>
            <li> other cotton balls/pads tend to remove my eyelashes when I take make-up off.</li>
            <li> It is soft and does not leave pieces behind on your skin.  </li>
            <li> When my local one stopped carrying them, like a crazy lady</li>
            <li> Wish they were less expensive.</li>
            <li> I use it to wipe on my Prep/toner before I use expensive treatments.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed when I could no longer find them.  </li>

            <li> I bought these cotton pads at Walgreens and Ulta for several years.  Was disappointed when I could no longer find them.  I have ordered them directly from Cotton Clouds for a time and, finally, so happy to be able to order them from Amazon. I&#x27;ve tried several different brands but always come back to Cotton Clouds.  They are the absolute best.  Love that they don&#x27;t leave fuzz on my nails or around my eyes when removing eye makeup and don&#x27;t soak up too much of my eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Love these! Wish they were less expensive.</li>
            <li> great purchase! hard to find in stores, happy to get a great price and fast delivery</li>
            <li> These are definitely a dupe for the Sheseido ones and way cheaper. They are super soft and you can peel off layers and choose how thick or thin you want them. You need these in your life, they are great,</li>
            <li> If I didn&#x27;t love the product; I wouldn&#x27;t be ordering it on line.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and does not fall apart. I use it to wipe on my Prep/toner before I use expensive treatments. I also use these for the hair under my Bichon&#x27;s dogs eyes &amp; mustache to wipe stains off of her &amp; wash the tear stains away with some shampoo. The HUB grabbed a few when he accidentally got cut from a very sharp knife and they were very absorbent, so now he thinks they belong in the kitchen cabinet along with band-aids. I ordered enough bags to stick one in the band-aid box and am very happy with them for many purposes now.</li>
            <li> The best cotton pads ever! Gentle and luxurious feeling.</li>
            <li> I love these pads, they do not shed like other pads do. I heard about these pads through you tube. I use these pads to remove eye makeup.</li>
            <li> I like these okay, I was just really excited when they said they were splittable wherever you wanted them to be.  They do split wherever I want them to but they are extremely fuzzy in the center so if you split them you lose the compressed cotton on one side and then you have to be careful not to get cotton in your eyes when removing make-up.  Bummer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these beauty pads for years.  They are so soft and don&#x27;t lose their  fuzz or have any hard edges.  They&#x27;re also the perfect size to hold and to use on your  face.</li>
            <li> I was having a facial and fell in love with these.  In fact I call them &amp;#34;angle&amp;#34; clouds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works wonders with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Love these cotton clouds.  Much better than the ones you buy at the drug store.  Do not hesitate to buy these cotton clouds, you will be happy with these.  They are great!!</li>
            <li> These Cotton Clouds are ok for makeup removal, toner application and nail polish removal.  I certainly don&#x27;t find them a sub or dup for the Shiseido Cotton.  These do shed on me sometimes with certain toners and leave little rolls of cotton on my face.  It&#x27;s not that big of a deal but I was hoping they would stay together a bit better.  The cotton is soft and the package was delivered as promised and in great condition.</li>
            <li> Love them. I&#x27;ve always bought them through the mfg but tried Amazon this time and everything was great</li>
            <li> I cannot get them directly from the manufacturer any more, but have been buying them for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cotton for years but can&#x27;t find it in my area anymore.  SOOO glad Amazon.com has it so I can get it whenever I need it.  I use it for eye makeup removal, nail polish removal and for my baby&#x27;s sensitive skin as well.  It is soft and does not leave pieces behind on your skin.  I won&#x27;t be without it!</li>
            <li> I love the size and soft cottony feel .Cotton clouds are perfect for removing makeup and nail polish. These are mch better than using cotton balls.</li>
            <li> These are the best!  Always reliable!</li>
            <li> These cotton squares are the softest I have ever found.  They are gentle when removing eye makeup, etc.  I definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> I used to get these at Duane Reade in Manhattan. When my local one stopped carrying them, like a crazy lady I went to tons of Duane Reades scouring their cosmetics aisles and even my local Rite Aid back in California when I visited my family to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily came across these on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+ so so soft. other cotton balls/pads tend to remove my eyelashes when I take make-up off. these don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;+ economical. i can split one into two and it absorbs plenty of liquid (toner, make-up remover, nail polish remover) and is strong enough to do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;+ minor one, but having to pay for shipping here. it&#x27;s worth it since you can buy big packs of 3 or 6. is very cheap shipping too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they&#x27;re similar to the high end shisheido ones but for a fraction of the price, why go anywhere else?</li>
            <li> A more affordable option and comparable in quality to a cult favorite used and recommended by many YouTube beauty &amp;#34;gurus.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t fall apart and got rave reviews from my Dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Cotton Clouds for years now. I used to buy them at Duane Reade in NYC and it was the only place I could find that carried them. When they stopped carrying them, I was so happy to find them on Amazon. Cotton Clouds are the perfect size, super soft, and you can use as much or as little as you need by separating the layers. I find most cotton pads absorb too much of my toner or nail polish remover, wasting product - or they don&#x27;t absorb enough when you&#x27;re using them to clean your face and just shmear your makeup remover around. Not these. They are perfect. People think I&#x27;m crazy for loving them so much but it&#x27;s great when you find something that just works.</li>
            <li> These are the very best cotton wipes.  No pieces left behind and always do a great job removing eye makeup.</li>
