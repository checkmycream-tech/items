            <li>I love this smell...</li>
            <li>I plan of buying some more for my vacation...</li>
            <li>Love this body spray.</li>
            <li>Smelled more like alcohol.</li>
            <li>Love the smell but paid more for it than the store</li>
            <li>Gifted to someone who loves it</li>
            <li>I also love spritzing it on my pillow just before bed.</li>
            <li>Love this scent and always wear it.</li>
            <li>This is the original Tease scent!  </li>
            <li>Has no potency and doesn&#x27;t smell strong like the original at all.</li>
            <li>The item arrived fast, in good packaging, I love this mist and usually buy it in the store,but this was much more convenient and the price is good.</li>
            <li>and I love it, however this one smelt like pure alcohol.</li>
            <li>Love my new Tease body spray!</li>
            <li>I now have my new place to buy my favorite body spray.</li>
            <li>This spray is worth the price, and came quickly.</li>
            <li>definitely worth it</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just a sweet smell but sexy at the same time</li>
            <li>I run out of it so quick because I love it and use it almost everyday and everywhere its an unique scent thats not too light that as soon as you leave the house</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my daughter &amp; she absolutely Loves it !</li>
            <li>I love this scent from Victoria&#x27;s as they have finally found a formula that does not make one smell like a piece of cotton candy.</li>
            <li>but it smells amazing, just as expected!</li>
            <li>The shipment was fast too.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t have much fragrance.</li>
            <li>I like it so much this perfume...</li>
            <li>smells amazing just altogether perfect, a little more expensive than just going to victorias secret but still worth the money</li>
            <li>Light and yet sexy, this mist gives just a &amp;#34;tease&amp;#34;  of girly mixed with a hint of naughty.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great for teens or older females, as I lost my first my bottle to my 19 year old who said it smelled like Flirt in a Bottle.</li>
            <li>I was a bit skeptical about its authenticity, but am very satisfied with my purchase!</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments and way cheaper than buying it at Victoria Secret.</li>

            <li> I have purchased this body spray before directly grom Victoria Secret</li>
            <li> The only bad thing about this product is that the sprayer sucks,  it doesn&#x27;t squirt very well and when I lay it on its side it leaks a little.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually a bit stronger than the perfume, which I bought from Victoria&#x27;s Secret for like 65 bucks.</li>
            <li> Not a good buy!</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>
