            <li> I received my item yesterday I have always been a fan of Maybelline products and this foundation exceeded my expectations just be sure to get the right shade for your skin tone...</li>
            <li> Lives up to as advertized.  Glides on, covers well, &amp; does give an &amp;#34;airbrushed&amp;#34; look.  Finding the right shade took me two tries.&lt;br /&gt;I found the shades to be a little darker than I expected.  When I tried one shade lighter, it blended perfectly with my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I am 31 years old, and I have tried just about every foundation out there over the years. Between my Mother and I, we also try new products when they come out. I could estimate trying over 100 brands, at least. Maybelline Liquid Dream Mousse is the absolute best foundation I have ever used, expensive brands included. So many foundations make me break out, but this one seems to make my skin BETTER. Coverage is great - even if I am broken out (I live in the South, and this tends to happen when I&#x27;m sweating in the summertime). One quick application covers A LOT, yet does not feel or look \\&quot;caked\\&quot;. It&#x27;s just an all-around great product. I want to start stocking up on it, for fear that they would ever discontinue it, and I would be forced to use something else and go back to the roller-coaster of skin issues. I love, love, love this product and cannot say enough good things about it. You won&#x27;t regret buying it, and you&#x27;ll become a believer as well! ;)    I set the foundation with Maybelline Shine Free loose powder in \\&quot;Light\\&quot;, and carry Maybelline Shine Pressed Powder in my purse. GREAT combo for smooth, pretty, shine-free skin.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this item as a personal gift it superb quality is un matched for the price compared to MAC and other like products you will not be disappointed</li>
            <li> I had been using just powder makeup and wanted a little more cover up. I ordered this product because I wanted something that was light on my skin and this was what I expected it to be. I am happy with it and will order it again. It was cheaper on here than what it is at my local store.</li>
            <li> I usually use bare minerals. This winter I decided to use liquid foundation for the season, but I can&#x27;t indulge in the usual stuff. I have never tried Maybelline. I have always been a diehard covergirl user when I bought grocery store makup. I read the reviews for what is out there. The reviews for this were the best I found. People have been very honest and it has been helpful in finding the right product, so I thank you all, btw :-) It is in THAT spirit that I do the same. If you are like me and haven&#x27;t really ventured into liquid foundation or you haven&#x27;t tried &#x27;over the counter&#x27; cosmetics in awhile, I think you will find this is a really nice makeup! I think I lucked out finding the perfect match. It helps there are many to choose from. This goes on nice! I used the tinest amount. In areas I know to be drier, I used even less. It doesn&#x27;t shine or flake! It blends beautifully and feels natural to the touch, no rub off either.The price is awesome! I also tried it out at home first. It stayed all day without my &#x27;redness&#x27; poking out through makeup wearing off.</li>
            <li> It makes my face look smoother throughout the day!!!</li>
            <li> i bought it to my wife and she loved it</li>
            <li> This is the second time i&#x27;ve purchased this foundation. i had to purchase it in a lighter tone this time because it was too dark for me the first time (but i used the entire bottle anyway!) the coverage lasts all day if not most of the day and i really like how it feels light on my skin. I am not sure i will be buying it a third time because i&#x27;d like to branch out and try something that will hide my dark circles a little better but overall i think this is my new &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; foundation!</li>
            <li> It goes on well and makes my skin look and feel really smooth. I will definitely buy this again. I also did some research and found that is not as toxic as most makeup so its safer to use.</li>
            <li> This liquid foundation goes on smoothly and has a nice spreading consistency. It is thick enough to cover problem areas compared to thinner types of foundation. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be too heavy, oily or hot for summertime wear.</li>
            <li> THis is what i am looking for exactly for very dry skin. After this, my skin tone is totally back to normal .Before whenever i applied make up, there will be pulp on my face and i have felt extreme dryness on my skin. This save me and it has make my day. I recommend anyone who is with dry skin only.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast delivery, great seller!  I give this an A+!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product leaves your skin feeling wonderful.  You only have to use a small amount and you don&#x27;t even have to use a powder over it.  I am fair skinned, with freckles, and this product covers up my freckles and any imperfections, plus never smudges and stays on all day!</li>
            <li> Like it, feels light, like nothing is there. Good stuff</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years so I already knew I liked it.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try this brand and it does the job just fine.  I like it, it goes on nice &amp; smooth, feels light, covers really well.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation I&#x27;ve always used it but unfortunately when I received the product it was the wrong color!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of foundations and this is by far my favorite!  It has excellent coverage but also doesn&#x27;t give you a &amp;#34;caked&amp;#34; look.  Even our I ordered a shade darker than my skin it blends nicely into my neck.  It gives my face a nice summer glow!</li>
            <li> I love this foundation because let your skin very beautiful and natural. The color that I bought perfectly match with my  skin color  and the price is not that bad!</li>
            <li> Best foundation. You can mix lighter and darker shades to get that day or night look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m asian and this foundation is great, with an easy dispense nozzle. Its the perfect shade lighter to give a great coverage. Love!</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, last most of the day and color matches well! Great for combination skin.</li>
            <li> I have never had a worse foundation.  This product broke my face out in a rash, and it itches like crazy!  I definitely will not be buying anymore Maybelline products.  Also, I only used this foundation for 3 days.  I&#x27;ve included a photo with this review.</li>
            <li> Can never get my right color, but this stuff is long lasting all day.</li>
