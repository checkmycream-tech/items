            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect gift for any occasion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great Shower Wash!  </li>
            <li>In fact, I plan on buying this wash, as well as the corresponding scrub, and body butter as a birthday gift for my best friend-</li>
            <li>In the meantime, it&#x27;s very pleasant to use!</li>
            <li>The smell is wonderful and perfectly compliments the sugar scrub and body butter!</li>

            <li>This shower wash is just fantastic!</li>
            <li>and I just LOVE all of these products from Tree Hut.</li>
            <li>I love the way this body wash leaves my skin feeling.</li>
            <li>I love having some scent that isn&#x27;t flowery.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many body washes and they all tend to leave my skin feeling dry,but Tree Hut shower wash leaves my skin very moisturize and smelling good after a nice shower totally recommend giving Tree Hut products a chance they are really good.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because it was advertised as having a strong lime coconut scent</li>
            <li>It lathers well and in general works great as a body wash.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a certainly a beauty favorite of mine!</li>
            <li>Hut makes fantastic bath &amp; body products.</li>
            <li>fantastic.  </li>

            <li>i love it and will be buying more very soon as im gona run out</li>
            <li>Used it once and was expecting the wonderful coconut lime scent, what I got was something I couldn&#x27;t wash off fast enough.</li>
            <li>The body wash not only leaves you feeling clean and smelling great</li>
            <li>This body wash lathers great, and doesn&#x27;t dry the skin.</li>
            <li>It leaves a nice scent on the skin and makes the skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have used this product in the past and love it!!!  </li>
            <li>Product smells amazing AND LEAVES MY SKIN SO SOFT.  </li>
            <li>Love the Body Butter, the Shower Gel...not so much...doesn&#x27;t lather very well.</li>
            <li>Fantastic scent &amp; left my skin soft &amp; smelling great all day in the Florida heat.&lt;br /&gt;Tree</li>
            <li>I have tried other Tree Hut items and they are amazing!</li>
            <li>I love all of Tree Hut&#x27;s products that I&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
            <li>Makes me think of the beach with the sweet smell of coconut and lime mixed together in a scent that is not either overly strong or light.</li>
            <li>Then I found they even offered the Coconut Lime scent in a body wash and of course purchased this right away.</li>
            <li>I love the shower wash, but I will admit the sugar scrub in this scent is simply the best![[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I discovered their Coconut Lime line earlier this summer and fell in love with the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>The Wash is pretty think, which let&#x27;s me control how much goes on my loofah</li>
            <li>They make my skin super soft.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the scent is as strong as it used to be, but my husband thinks it is the same.</li>
            <li>It lathers really well</li>
            <li>I did use the whole bottle but wouldn&#x27;t buy it again because of the smell...</li>
            <li>However I thought it had more of a lime smell than a coconut smell once I started washing, I was hoping it would have been the other way around!</li>
            <li>Manufacturer asked for product codes to see if there was a problem with that particular run.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the body scrubs.  </li>
            <li>I would highly reccomend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>For me, the scent of coconut brings back childhood summers -  memories of returning home from a fun day at the beach.</li>
            <li>The wash is refreshing and definitely moisturizing for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>The body wash hydrates your skin, leaving it feeling soft and smooth, something I find other body washes don&#x27;t do as well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a juicy sweet smell to it like the other products for the line.</li>
            <li>the way it lathers and the way it leaves your skin feeling ever so soft.  </li>
            <li>I am pretty passionate about Tree Hut products.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t have quite as good of a scent as the sugar scrub and the body butter</li>
            <li>A lot of people complained that the scent is not the same as the other Tree Hut Coconut Lime products, but it&#x27;s still great.  </li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t review products, but I thought this item was fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, dry skin and these products</li>

            <li> Amazing shower wash! Fantastic scent &amp; left my skin soft &amp; smelling great all day in the Florida heat.&lt;br /&gt;Tree Hut makes fantastic bath &amp; body products. I get scent therapy with every shower.&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> I love all of Tree Hut&#x27;s products that I&#x27;ve tried so far and I can&#x27;t wait to try this one! I use Tree Hut Shea Brazilian Nut Body Butter, sugar scrub, and body wash.  The combination is AMAZING. Every shower is like a mini spa retreat. The body wash hydrates your skin, leaving it feeling soft and smooth, something I find other body washes don&#x27;t do as well. And then there&#x27;s the added pleasure of aroma therapy.  I just feel pampered afterwards and the scent lasts all day. It&#x27;s the perfect gift for any occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trista Baughman</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it was advertised as having a strong lime coconut scent but I found it had no smell at all to speak of. Manufacturer asked for product codes to see if there was a problem with that particular run. I supplied them and never heard back . product not as advertised and customer service poor.</li>
            <li> Love the Body Butter, the Shower Gel...not so much...doesn&#x27;t lather very well. Have to mix with another gel to feel clean, unfortunately, wont purchase this one again.  Still love the body butter, tho&#x27;...thanks for THAT, Tree Hut!</li>
            <li> Great Shower Wash!  Love the smell........the way it lathers and the way it leaves your skin feeling ever so soft.  Would definitely recommend and will purchase again!</li>
            <li> i havnt tried the body wash just yet but the body scrub in the scent is amazing i love it and will be buying more very soon as im gona run out i use it all the time..</li>
            <li> I am pretty passionate about Tree Hut products.  I love to give them as gifts as well as receive them.  The coconut lime scent is amazing.  The body wash not only leaves you feeling clean and smelling great, it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out. I highly recommend the body scrubs.  They make my skin super soft.  Also check out the Honey Almond scent....fantastic.  I have very sensitive, dry skin and these products work perfectly for me without any kind of irritation.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many body washes and they all tend to leave my skin feeling dry,but Tree Hut shower wash leaves my skin very moisturize and smelling good after a nice shower totally recommend giving Tree Hut products a chance they are really good.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It is a great price for an excellent product.  I always get compliments when I am using it.  It reminds me of summer when I smell it!</li>
            <li> I really really love Tree Hut&#x27;s Coconut Lime line- it smells lovely! It&#x27;s a certainly a beauty favorite of mine! The price is great for such a quality product, I recommend it to all my friends and blog readers. In fact, I plan on buying this wash, as well as the corresponding scrub, and body butter as a birthday gift for my best friend- I know she&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> This smells like you are on a tropical island. I love that it has organic shea butter. The wash is refreshing and definitely moisturizing for my dry skin. It is paraben-free and not tested on animals--bonus! Supposedly it has anti-aging properties too, so that would be nice if I saw results on that. In the meantime, it&#x27;s very pleasant to use!</li>
            <li> I saw this in Walmart and thought it looked very appealing, specifically the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; aspects of it. When I smelled it in the store, it smelled great. However, once I tried it, it was a different story. It didn&#x27;t lather well and it seemed like the longer I used it, the more the good smell went away. Before that, I was using Nivea cream oil body wash which has been consistently great in all dynamics. I&#x27;ll be going back to that one. I do hear the Tree Hut body butter is great, so I&#x27;d like to try that as well. As for their body wash, I won&#x27;t be buying it again, even in a different scent.</li>
            <li> This is my signature scent! Everyone knows what scent to get me when gift time rolls around :) The smell is wonderful and perfectly compliments the sugar scrub and body butter! It is less expensive than B &amp; BW&#x27;s version and I can get it in a variety of places! LOVE LOVE LOVE it!! -- Lauren Huntley, Martinez, GA</li>
            <li> This body wash lathers great, and doesn&#x27;t dry the skin. However I thought it had more of a lime smell than a coconut smell once I started washing, I was hoping it would have been the other way around! I prefer the Hawaiian Kukui scent, but Tree Hut is an all around quality brand! Kristina Vieweg</li>
            <li> This is some of the best smells ever! Makes me think of the beach with the sweet smell of coconut and lime mixed together in a scent that is not either overly strong or light. It leaves a nice scent on the skin and makes the skin feel soft and smooth. I love the shower wash, but I will admit the sugar scrub in this scent is simply the best![[ASIN:B0018DE6AI Tree Hut Shea Sugar Body Scrub, Coconut Lime, 18-Ounce Jars (Pack of 3)]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard that our sense of smell is one of the strongest memory senses. For me, the scent of coconut brings back childhood summers -  memories of returning home from a fun day at the beach. That is why I especially love Tree Hut Shower Wash Coconut Lime.  When I shower with it, I still kind of feel like I&#x27;ve been to the beach rather than to the office. It&#x27;s like a mini-vacation.</li>
            <li> I have NOT tried this yet, but it looks spectacular!  I have tried other Tree Hut items and they are amazing! I&#x27;m sure this is just as amazing!  Especially coconut yummy! Great scent for summertime!</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance.  Like having a cocktail in the shower. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and there&#x27;s no soap scum to worry about.</li>
            <li> Tree Hut has some really great products at affordable prices. I discovered their Coconut Lime line earlier this summer and fell in love with the [[ASIN:B0018DE6AI Tree Hut Shea Sugar Body Scrub in Coconut Lime]]. The scent was amazing and I wanted everything they offered from the same line. Next I purchased the [[ASIN:B000MANVMC Tree Hut Shea Body Butter in Coconut Lime]]. It smelled just as divine and has a great rich textured to it. Then I found they even offered the Coconut Lime scent in a body wash and of course purchased this right away. I assumed it would be just as wonderful. But for some reason I don&#x27;t like the smell as well. It doesn&#x27;t have a juicy sweet smell to it like the other products for the line. This reminds me more of a lime scented cleaning product smell. While some of the same notes to the scent are there, there&#x27;s just something not quite the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap texture of this body wash is thicker and has a pearly white color to it. It lathers well and in general works great as a body wash. Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t have quite as good of a scent as the sugar scrub and the body butter so from this same line.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and love it!!!  It is a refreshing product and I have not found another one like it.  You need to give it a try!</li>
            <li> Love it!  The scrub too.  Product smells amazing AND LEAVES MY SKIN SO SOFT.  Actually, I love their product line.</li>
            <li> Smells like you are in the tropics on an amazing getaway and leaves your skin silky smooth! Great for those of us that don&#x27;t really get to go to a tropical Paradise!!!!</li>
            <li> seemed to not leave any benefit on my skin once out of the shower, but the scent is very nice and it feels good while in there</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t review products, but I thought this item was fantastic.  It lathers really well and it&#x27;s SO moisturizing.  A lot of people complained that the scent is not the same as the other Tree Hut Coconut Lime products, but it&#x27;s still great.  It reminds me of the beach.  The Wash is pretty think, which let&#x27;s me control how much goes on my loofah and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. I would highly reccomend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Tree Hut&#x27;s Coconut Lime Shea Body Butter &amp; Sugar Scrub ... but the body wash was hugely disappointing and smelled chemical &amp; foul. Used it once and was expecting the wonderful coconut lime scent, what I got was something I couldn&#x27;t wash off fast enough. Hopefully it was just a bad batch, but I won&#x27;t be wasting my money to buy another that \\&quot;might\\&quot; be better.</li>
            <li> This shower wash is just fantastic! I love it! I can&#x27;t find it at any of the stores that sells Tree Hut products here in Hawaii so I just order it here online. I&#x27;ve tried the Mango shower wash but I prefer the Coconut Lime shower wash better.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the body butter, the lotion, sugar scrub and the shower wash and I just LOVE all of these products from Tree Hut.</li>
            <li> I love the way this body wash leaves my skin feeling. I don&#x27;t think the scent is as strong as it used to be, but my husband thinks it is the same. I love having some scent that isn&#x27;t flowery.</li>
            <li> However, I wasn&#x27;t too hip on the smell.  I did use the whole bottle but wouldn&#x27;t buy it again because of the smell...coconut and lime just doesn&#x27;t go well together...at least not in my opinion.</li>
