    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Product is wonderful for mornings I don&#x27;t have time to wash my hair (because I hit the snooze button!)</li>
            <li>Best advice is to shake it, hold can about 6 inches away from hair, hold hair up so spray gets to roots.</li>
            <li>and I am incredibly impressed.  </li>
            <li>with this product it allows me to skip a day in between washings and my hair still smells great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>The best part about this product is the smell.</li>
            <li>However, the smell wasn&#x27;t the best in the world.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li>I tend not to like perfumy floral scents, so the scent of coconut is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>Best of all, I don&#x27;t feel it coating my lungs with each spray.</li>
            <li>Win win!</li>
            <li>Product came in great condition, works wonderful, &amp; now I&#x27;m officially hooked.</li>

            <li>On top of that, it smells good.</li>
            <li>I love all of them, doesn&#x27;t matter which &#x27;smell&#x27;, they&#x27;re all good.</li>
            <li>Rinse vigorously with warm water (don’t want to break a sweat) as if shampooing, condition ends</li>

            <li>Glad I found this product, will buy again.</li>
            <li>This one was better than most.</li>
            <li>This stuff works like magic.  </li>
            <li>even better cause it doesnt damage your hair.</li>
            <li>Smell is OK.  </li>
            <li>It feels cool when you spray it on which is very refreshing.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you don&#x27;t spray it too close to your scalp</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love to take it with me on vacation, camping,or after the gym.</li>
            <li>It also would leave flakes sometimes and give an appearance of dandruff...not cute.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better for your hair, keeps it healthy -</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>This is OK as a backup.  </li>
            <li>most* of the residue.  </li>
            <li>well and keep shaking it while you&#x27;re using it - it seems to work better that way.</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews and this seemed like a safe bet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I took a chance on this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells.  </li>
            <li>Effectiveness-wise, it seems ok.</li>
            <li>love the smell and it works</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t cause static like baby powder and comes in colors to match your hair</li>
            <li>I gave a bottle to my hair stylist and she&#x27;s in love as well.</li>
            <li>some people said it was grandmothery, but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more tropical and beachy.  </li>
            <li>Better than talcum powder</li>
            <li>Can do anything with my hair that I need to after using it, couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product and use it every week.</li>
            <li>Glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>It makes curly or straight hair fresh and smells great!</li>
            <li>So I did some more research and decided to try this product.</li>
            <li>It seemed to work pretty good</li>
            <li>I feel it does it pretty good job and helps me to extend the time between washing my hair.  </li>
            <li>This is the best dry shampoo I have ever used!</li>
            <li>This is the best dry shampoo!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve researched them and trying to find one was becoming a bittersweet task.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo really makes your hair look like it´s clean  and healthy and smells good.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s easy to shake or brush out.</li>
            <li>this is a wonderful dry shampoo (i&#x27;ve used quite a lot of them in my time, mostly super pricey salon brands).  </li>
            <li>The best way to use it is to spray through roots while slightly lifting and parting the hair, let it sit in hair for 3-5 minutes</li>
            <li>I love this stuff for when I need a quick pick me up for my hair.</li>
            <li>It smelled like a cheap, citrus perfume.  </li>
            <li>I just spray on and use a bristle brush to smooth through my hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really light, not overwealming at all.  </li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s great for when you just dyed your hair and want to put off washing it for a couple days to make the color last longer.</li>
            <li>Just light and flowing.  </li>
            <li>After using this product my hair looked FANTASTIC from roots to ends.</li>
            <li>, I use EO tropical body wash (chemical free) and EO coconut and Hibiscus shampoo and conditioner, so</li>
            <li>and I use sulfate free everything</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a light smell though.</li>
            <li>This product works fairly well, and did clear up all oil in my hair for the day.  </li>
            <li>I can feel confident going to work with fresh, clean smelling hair.</li>
            <li>Because the product works so well, I can easily overlook the strength of the perfume, which quickly fades anyway.</li>
            <li>but it dries and brushes out quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>so it looks like my hair has been freshly washed!  </li>
            <li>It does better than not washing your hair at all until it&#x27;s the exact time you always do it.</li>
            <li>I switched back to using baby powder because the baby powder keeps the oil at bay for a good 24 hours without re-application.</li>
            <li>It is good for an instant freshening up.  </li>
            <li>I can not say enough good things about it.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s good to use as a back up on the spur of the moment.</li>
            <li>Smell is not bad, I ordered the tropical scent.</li>
            <li>I saw Batiste dry shampoo seeing it was economical in price and had great reviews, so it was a win-win for me.  </li>
            <li>Thought this was a quick hurry fix.</li>
            <li>a quick fix for my oily hair if I want to skip a wash and put my hair in a ponytail.</li>
            <li>This just might be my new favorite scent.</li>
            <li>I will be sticking to this dry shampoo for a good while.</li>
            <li>This is a good dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty fine, very straight hair that gets oily quick.  </li>
            <li>Ok, let me start off by saying WOW!  </li>
            <li>This is EXACTLY what I&#x27;ve been looking for!</li>
            <li>This dry shampoo isn&#x27;t fabulous but it does absorb the oils and has a nice tropical smell.  </li>
            <li>I would purchase again but still looking for that awesome dry shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave that white residue.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried many dry shampoos but this for me was okay.  </li>
            <li>The smell is quite nice, it is not too strong and there are several different scents, this one is my favorite though, it has a coconut essence to it.</li>
            <li>On top of that, the product just arrived on time and not even early.</li>
            <li>It soaks the oil right up leaving my hair looking just washed.  </li>
            <li>right there is the deal breaker for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this blended right in with my scent palate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong smelling at first, but the scent wears off pretty fast.  </li>
            <li>The tropical smell is great, not overwhelming or too coconutty or pineappley.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and lasts a long time in  my hair.</li>
            <li>I usually spray some on before I go to bed and in the morning my hair looks great</li>
            <li>my hair didn&#x27;t look as good as when I wash it obviously, but it looked a hell of a lot better than my normal second day hair.</li>
            <li>The Batiste Dry Shampoo not only smells good but refreshes unwashed hair all day!</li>
            <li>I always liked the texture of \\&quot;second day \\&quot; hair but could never do it because my hair gets oily so fast.</li>
            <li>While I wash my hair each day w/ regular shampoo, I love this product for right around my hair line because it has a tendency to get oily.</li>
            <li>My hair gets oily very fast.  </li>
            <li>Batiste is hands down the best dry shampoo, but this tropical smell is the bees knees!</li>
            <li>and I can go two more days without a wash if necessary.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more.  </li>
            <li>Well, I got this, and it works really well!  </li>
            <li>mch like just sprayed hair spray, but it goes away extremely fast!  </li>
            <li>I used this for the first time yesterday</li>
            <li>The coconut is my favorite, but I will be trying the cherry next.</li>
            <li>, it saves me a day or two in between shampoos--even in the hot, humid Midwest summers.</li>
            <li>just a lil sweaty and baby powder was too thick glob on, so I decide to try spritzing my batiste on my pits AND IT WORKED LOL.</li>
            <li>love this stuff, getting the big can this time.</li>
            <li>this product does exactly what I need it to do - freshen my hair up, volumize it a bit</li>
            <li>It was my first time trying the \\&quot;tropical\\&quot; scent</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I can find it on Amazon as my local beauty supply stores no longer carry it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of this dry shampoo, it works great</li>
            <li>The tropical smell isn&#x27;t anything special and really doesn&#x27;t last which is fine by me being</li>
            <li>My roots tend to get very oily fast because I have straight hair and this product makes my hair look like just washed it!!   </li>
            <li>I like the way it smells, A subtle tropical smell (more to the coconut side not the fruity side). :)</li>
            <li>/&gt; and quickly and spray this on in QUICK, SHORT SPRITZES</li>
            <li>It does leave a bit of a white residue which is great to help blend in my dark roots.</li>
            <li>This has been my life-saver not just for a post-gym freshen up (which it is AMAZING for), but also as a busy on-the-go mom with long locks</li>
            <li>Next day after styling, I used this and it looks fuller, thicker, less oily, and smells great.</li>
            <li>Finely hair powder is the only product that I have found to truly absorb the oil in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Price is also pretty decent.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>if you use too much and feel that you can still see powdery areas</li>
            <li>It really does work on those days when you just don&#x27;t have the time to shampoo or just don&#x27;t feel like it.  </li>
            <li>I have really oily hair</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling soft and looking fresh.</li>
            <li>Really recommend it.</li>
            <li>If SuperBiz care this much about their products, I will not be using them again.</li>
            <li>I really dislike the smell.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t like how the spray comes out with so much force.</li>
            <li>but I have to say I expected more from it.</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t have that problem and thanks to this product</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this one</li>
            <li>and, i now can go 2-3 days between &#x27;real&#x27;shampoos.  </li>
            <li>and my hair is much happier for it.  </li>
            <li>As for the smell, I consider myself to be very picky about scents, but once the smell dissipated after being sprayed, I never noticed it again.    </li>
            <li>It’s much improved song I stopped washing it every day</li>
            <li>(if conditioner is light enough usb thru out) rinse and style lightly&lt;</li>
            <li>I use a gentle anti-microbial hand soap in the shower on my pits, unmentionables and to scrub my feet.</li>
            <li>I noticed I wasn’t getting much odor</li>
            <li>and I also really like the smell of shampooed hair.</li>
            <li>They seem kind of harsh..</li>
            <li>I would say next to my LUSH R&amp;B hair moisturizer, this is my favorite hair find in 2 years.</li>
            <li>I have fine oily hair that I&#x27;m required to wash everyday just to get that clean feeling and avoiding an oily scalp.  </li>
            <li>The bottle does not last very long at all, but it is by far the best dry shampoo I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This stuff is hard to find in stores (besides TJ Maxx), but I&#x27;ll keep ordering it because (as a hairstylist and a person who is constantly trying new hair powders) I find that Batiste is the best so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been 1 to shower every other day and my hair remains really healthy because of it.  </li>
            <li>It works much better than all the other brands that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>i have tried several dry shampoos and this one is my second favorite (my favorite was made by Samy and has been discontinued).  </li>
            <li>Received Dry Shampoo very quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product that I used to purchase regularly before it (and other dry shampoos) became available in stores.</li>
            <li>This dry shampoo is a nice alternative to regular washing, to make your hair treatment (coloring, keratin, etc.)  </li>
            <li>Smells nice and definitely works to get the grease out of my hair when I don&#x27;t have time to wash and dry it.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and usually dry shampoos are no help.</li>
            <li>The price is not bad and I will con&#x27;t to buy this product in the future.</li>
            <li>I love the finely powder because a little goes a long way and</li>
            <li>Not only is my hair looking clean and freshly washed in an instant, but it has VOLUME.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to apply it correctly, however, which is the case with all dry shampoos.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily hair and this product wasn&#x27;t worth a red cent.  </li>
            <li>Left them soft, silky and with a light fragrance.</li>
            <li>I like that it comes in several different scents AND COLORS, and it&#x27;s not outrageously priced.</li>
            <li>went to my local TJ Maxx and found 2 more cans in different scents-</li>
            <li>My only tiny complaint is that even though the smell is pleasant, it is very strong initially.  </li>
            <li>I really like this dry shampoo, the tropical smell is delicious and the small bottle goes a long way!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the seller as well.</li>
            <li>and I was hoping for a little more, but it did the job</li>
            <li>but it usually needs it to look suitable to leave the house, so</li>
            <li>The product works great, but the powder makes you look like you have some weird hair condition (dandruff?).</li>
            <li>sometimes the next morning my bangs are greasy (because of my greasy forehead), so I spray some Batiste on it and it looks freshly washed.  </li>
            <li>I sprayed the dry shampoo when my hair begun to get oily, and it did take the oil out, but I needed to spray more probably 5 or 6 hours later.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many dry shampoos trying for the ultimate (for me)</li>
            <li>New moms...</li>
            <li>A very strong combination which I find hard to like.</li>
            <li>As for the smell, I honestly don&#x27;t think it smells as bad as many people say</li>
            <li>I literally was only able to use this product 4 times before the can was empty.</li>
            <li>p.s I bought this from SuperBiz, and it came in this cheap packaging which I could care less about, but the bottle cap ended up cracked right in the middle and on a side.</li>
            <li>TO MY PITS, LOL - The follicles in my right pit got infected and I had painful pustules popping out everywhere.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Outside of the fact that you&#x27;d have to buy 4 bottles a month to have enough, it worked pretty well.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty greasy, but short, hair and maybe I needed to use a lot</li>
            <li>This stuff sprays on light grey, but totally vanishes once you comb it out as directed.</li>
            <li>have also started rinsing my hair and only conditioning the ends more often, and it seems my hair is producing less oil than it used to.</li>
            <li>Fine and limp and, to add insult to injury, oily.</li>
            <li>I saw this product on a YouTube how to/style video made by a woman in the UK, and wanted to try it since my hair is colored with a very vibrant pigment and washing it daily fades it.</li>
            <li>With something so light, it&#x27;s hard to tell how much is in the can.  </li>
            <li>Makes my oily scalp and hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>AND it doesn&#x27;t smell like old lady perfume.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t make my hair feel soft like shampooing and conditioning would, but</li>
            <li>It made my hair look old.</li>
            <li>I tilt my head downwards, and use my fingers to run through the powder to loosen it near the roots and then comb my hair downwards.</li>
            <li>It goes on white and feels very cooling on the scalp.</li>
            <li>I tried the cornstarch/baby powder method of old, but I didn&#x27;t like the smell or care for the texture</li>
            <li>It doesn’t go as far as i’d like</li>
            <li>I have REALLY greasy hair, like washing it in the morning only for it to start showing signs of grease by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>So far I like it</li>
            <li>you wake up with clean looking and smelling hair and limited white powder!</li>
            <li>I have really dark hair, so when I spray it in it&#x27;s white, but it brushes though easily.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s great for in-between shampoos or if you are in a hurry, but the scent is not pleasant to me, and probably the only reason I would like to try another type of dry shampoo....</li>
            <li>This was my first try at dry shampoos.</li>
            <li>This is the first dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried so</li>
            <li>First &#x27;dry&#x27; shampoo I have tried,</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how clean your hair looks after a few sprays.   </li>
            <li>I have dark hair and although it sprays on white if you run your fingers through your hair it goes away quickly!</li>
            <li>This particular brand doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell, however it does smell like coconuts so if you aren&#x27;t a fan I&#x27;d suggest a different scent from this brand.</li>
            <li>It is nice not having to wash my hair everyday especially because I have thin fine hair.  </li>
            <li>but it definitely was a new odor for me</li>
            <li>i really dislike dry shampoos.</li>
            <li>If you use way too much towel dry your hair with a damp towel.</li>
            <li>I have used the can at least 6 or more times and there is still plenty left.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend actually made the comment,\\&quot;Wow!  </li>
            <li>No more lemon fresh!</li>
            <li>It cleans your hair quite well for a dry shampoo, though it&#x27;s the first and only that I have ever used at this point.     </li>
            <li>Yes there is a mild residue and its definitely not as good as a real wash, but all things considered</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been vibrant red and platinum blonde</li>
            <li>I usually use it just on my bangs because they get oily and flat easy.</li>
            <li>Aside from that, this product has pretty much been added to my &#x27;must have&#x27; in life, or at least some form of it.      </li>
            <li>I am blonde and it always blends seamlessly into my hair.</li>
            <li>I have used many different dry shampoos over the last few years because I have oily hair at the roots.  </li>
            <li>close to the root and in fine layers or rows, start at crown, work down the sides, then start at crown work down</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m careful to not use too much and only spray on the roots</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t wash my hair daily I have a major excess oil problem.  </li>
            <li>I have not tried any powder dry shampoos yet, but this dry spray works very well.</li>
            <li>i have light colored highlights on the top of my head, so any complaints of it being powdery or dusty - is actually an advantage to my thin hair and that effect masks my scalp shining through.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not expensive either compared to other dry shampoos.</li>
            <li>My intention on buying this product was because the hair near my scalp gets oily, while the rest of my hair is still dry.</li>
            <li>But it is not very helpful, it can only make your hair look a little little bit better.</li>
            <li>The spray is powerful and doesn&#x27;t dull color.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Product is wonderful for mornings I don&#x27;t have time to wash my hair (because I hit the snooze button!)</li>
            <li> Best advice is to shake it, hold can about 6 inches away from hair, hold hair up so spray gets to roots.</li>
            <li> and I am incredibly impressed.  </li>
            <li> with this product it allows me to skip a day in between washings and my hair still smells great!</li>

            <li> Win win!</li>
            <li> Product came in great condition, works wonderful, &amp; now I&#x27;m officially hooked.</li>

            <li> The smell is nice too.</li>
            <li> Bought this because it is perfect for traveling and when you really don&#x27;t have time to wash your hair.</li>
            <li> For the price, it is a good buy and a product I was glad I tried.  </li>
            <li> On top of that, it smells good.</li>
            <li> I love all of them, doesn&#x27;t matter which &#x27;smell&#x27;, they&#x27;re all good.</li>
            <li> Rinse vigorously with warm water (don’t want to break a sweat) as if shampooing, condition ends</li>
            <li> The smell is nice-</li>
            <li> The tropical smell is nice too.</li>
            <li> It works amazingly well and is much, much more affordable.</li>
            <li> Love love love!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Glad I found this product, will buy again.</li>
            <li> This one was better than most.</li>
            <li> This stuff works like magic.  </li>
            <li> even better cause it doesnt damage your hair.</li>
            <li> Smell is OK.  </li>
            <li> It feels cool when you spray it on which is very refreshing.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure you don&#x27;t spray it too close to your scalp</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love to take it with me on vacation, camping,or after the gym.</li>
            <li> It also would leave flakes sometimes and give an appearance of dandruff...not cute.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better for your hair, keeps it healthy -</li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> This is OK as a backup.  </li>
            <li> most* of the residue.  </li>
            <li> well and keep shaking it while you&#x27;re using it - it seems to work better that way.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and this seemed like a safe bet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I took a chance on this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells.  </li>
            <li> Effectiveness-wise, it seems ok.</li>
            <li> love the smell and it works</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t cause static like baby powder and comes in colors to match your hair</li>
            <li> I gave a bottle to my hair stylist and she&#x27;s in love as well.</li>
            <li> some people said it was grandmothery, but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more tropical and beachy.  </li>
            <li> Better than talcum powder</li>
            <li> Can do anything with my hair that I need to after using it, couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product and use it every week.</li>
            <li> Glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> It makes curly or straight hair fresh and smells great!</li>
            <li> So I did some more research and decided to try this product.</li>
            <li> It seemed to work pretty good</li>
            <li> I feel it does it pretty good job and helps me to extend the time between washing my hair.  </li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo I have ever used!</li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve researched them and trying to find one was becoming a bittersweet task.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo really makes your hair look like it´s clean  and healthy and smells good.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s easy to shake or brush out.</li>
            <li> this is a wonderful dry shampoo (i&#x27;ve used quite a lot of them in my time, mostly super pricey salon brands).  </li>
            <li> The best way to use it is to spray through roots while slightly lifting and parting the hair, let it sit in hair for 3-5 minutes</li>
            <li> I love this stuff for when I need a quick pick me up for my hair.</li>
            <li> It smelled like a cheap, citrus perfume.  </li>
            <li> I just spray on and use a bristle brush to smooth through my hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really light, not overwealming at all.  </li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s great for when you just dyed your hair and want to put off washing it for a couple days to make the color last longer.</li>
            <li> Just light and flowing.  </li>
            <li> After using this product my hair looked FANTASTIC from roots to ends.</li>
            <li> , I use EO tropical body wash (chemical free) and EO coconut and Hibiscus shampoo and conditioner, so</li>
            <li> and I use sulfate free everything</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a light smell though.</li>
            <li> This product works fairly well, and did clear up all oil in my hair for the day.  </li>
            <li> I can feel confident going to work with fresh, clean smelling hair.</li>
            <li> Because the product works so well, I can easily overlook the strength of the perfume, which quickly fades anyway.</li>
            <li> but it dries and brushes out quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> so it looks like my hair has been freshly washed!  </li>
            <li> It does better than not washing your hair at all until it&#x27;s the exact time you always do it.</li>
            <li> I switched back to using baby powder because the baby powder keeps the oil at bay for a good 24 hours without re-application.</li>
            <li> It is good for an instant freshening up.  </li>
            <li> I can not say enough good things about it.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s good to use as a back up on the spur of the moment.</li>
            <li> Smell is not bad, I ordered the tropical scent.</li>
            <li> I saw Batiste dry shampoo seeing it was economical in price and had great reviews, so it was a win-win for me.  </li>
            <li> Thought this was a quick hurry fix.</li>
            <li> a quick fix for my oily hair if I want to skip a wash and put my hair in a ponytail.</li>
            <li> This just might be my new favorite scent.</li>
            <li> I will be sticking to this dry shampoo for a good while.</li>
            <li> This is a good dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty fine, very straight hair that gets oily quick.  </li>
            <li> Ok, let me start off by saying WOW!  </li>
            <li> This is EXACTLY what I&#x27;ve been looking for!</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo isn&#x27;t fabulous but it does absorb the oils and has a nice tropical smell.  </li>
            <li> I would purchase again but still looking for that awesome dry shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave that white residue.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried many dry shampoos but this for me was okay.  </li>
            <li> The smell is quite nice, it is not too strong and there are several different scents, this one is my favorite though, it has a coconut essence to it.</li>
            <li> On top of that, the product just arrived on time and not even early.</li>
            <li> It soaks the oil right up leaving my hair looking just washed.  </li>
            <li> right there is the deal breaker for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this blended right in with my scent palate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong smelling at first, but the scent wears off pretty fast.  </li>
            <li> The tropical smell is great, not overwhelming or too coconutty or pineappley.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and lasts a long time in  my hair.</li>
            <li> I usually spray some on before I go to bed and in the morning my hair looks great</li>
            <li> my hair didn&#x27;t look as good as when I wash it obviously, but it looked a hell of a lot better than my normal second day hair.</li>
            <li> The Batiste Dry Shampoo not only smells good but refreshes unwashed hair all day!</li>
            <li> I always liked the texture of \\&quot;second day \\&quot; hair but could never do it because my hair gets oily so fast.</li>
            <li> While I wash my hair each day w/ regular shampoo, I love this product for right around my hair line because it has a tendency to get oily.</li>
            <li> My hair gets oily very fast.  </li>
            <li> Batiste is hands down the best dry shampoo, but this tropical smell is the bees knees!</li>
            <li> and I can go two more days without a wash if necessary.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more.  </li>
            <li> Well, I got this, and it works really well!  </li>
            <li> mch like just sprayed hair spray, but it goes away extremely fast!  </li>
            <li> I used this for the first time yesterday</li>
            <li> The coconut is my favorite, but I will be trying the cherry next.</li>
            <li> , it saves me a day or two in between shampoos--even in the hot, humid Midwest summers.</li>
            <li> just a lil sweaty and baby powder was too thick glob on, so I decide to try spritzing my batiste on my pits AND IT WORKED LOL.</li>
            <li> love this stuff, getting the big can this time.</li>
            <li> this product does exactly what I need it to do - freshen my hair up, volumize it a bit</li>
            <li> It was my first time trying the \\&quot;tropical\\&quot; scent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I can find it on Amazon as my local beauty supply stores no longer carry it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of this dry shampoo, it works great</li>
            <li> The tropical smell isn&#x27;t anything special and really doesn&#x27;t last which is fine by me being</li>
            <li> My roots tend to get very oily fast because I have straight hair and this product makes my hair look like just washed it!!   </li>
            <li> I like the way it smells, A subtle tropical smell (more to the coconut side not the fruity side). :)</li>
            <li> /&gt; and quickly and spray this on in QUICK, SHORT SPRITZES</li>
            <li> It does leave a bit of a white residue which is great to help blend in my dark roots.</li>
            <li> This has been my life-saver not just for a post-gym freshen up (which it is AMAZING for), but also as a busy on-the-go mom with long locks</li>
            <li> Next day after styling, I used this and it looks fuller, thicker, less oily, and smells great.</li>
            <li> Finely hair powder is the only product that I have found to truly absorb the oil in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Price is also pretty decent.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> if you use too much and feel that you can still see powdery areas</li>
            <li> It really does work on those days when you just don&#x27;t have the time to shampoo or just don&#x27;t feel like it.  </li>
            <li> I have really oily hair</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling soft and looking fresh.</li>
            <li> Really recommend it.</li>
            <li> If SuperBiz care this much about their products, I will not be using them again.</li>
            <li> I really dislike the smell.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t like how the spray comes out with so much force.</li>
            <li> but I have to say I expected more from it.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t have that problem and thanks to this product</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this one</li>
            <li> and, i now can go 2-3 days between &#x27;real&#x27;shampoos.  </li>
            <li> and my hair is much happier for it.  </li>
            <li> As for the smell, I consider myself to be very picky about scents, but once the smell dissipated after being sprayed, I never noticed it again.    </li>
            <li> It’s much improved song I stopped washing it every day</li>
            <li> (if conditioner is light enough usb thru out) rinse and style lightly&lt;</li>
            <li> I use a gentle anti-microbial hand soap in the shower on my pits, unmentionables and to scrub my feet.</li>
            <li> I noticed I wasn’t getting much odor</li>
            <li> and I also really like the smell of shampooed hair.</li>
            <li> They seem kind of harsh..</li>
            <li> I would say next to my LUSH R&amp;B hair moisturizer, this is my favorite hair find in 2 years.</li>
            <li> I have fine oily hair that I&#x27;m required to wash everyday just to get that clean feeling and avoiding an oily scalp.  </li>
            <li> The bottle does not last very long at all, but it is by far the best dry shampoo I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This stuff is hard to find in stores (besides TJ Maxx), but I&#x27;ll keep ordering it because (as a hairstylist and a person who is constantly trying new hair powders) I find that Batiste is the best so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been 1 to shower every other day and my hair remains really healthy because of it.  </li>
            <li> It works much better than all the other brands that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> i have tried several dry shampoos and this one is my second favorite (my favorite was made by Samy and has been discontinued).  </li>
            <li> Received Dry Shampoo very quickly.  </li>
            <li> This is a good product that I used to purchase regularly before it (and other dry shampoos) became available in stores.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo is a nice alternative to regular washing, to make your hair treatment (coloring, keratin, etc.)  </li>
            <li> Smells nice and definitely works to get the grease out of my hair when I don&#x27;t have time to wash and dry it.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and usually dry shampoos are no help.</li>
            <li> The price is not bad and I will con&#x27;t to buy this product in the future.</li>
            <li> I love the finely powder because a little goes a long way and</li>
            <li> Not only is my hair looking clean and freshly washed in an instant, but it has VOLUME.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to apply it correctly, however, which is the case with all dry shampoos.  </li>
            <li> I have very oily hair and this product wasn&#x27;t worth a red cent.  </li>
            <li> Left them soft, silky and with a light fragrance.</li>
            <li> I like that it comes in several different scents AND COLORS, and it&#x27;s not outrageously priced.</li>
            <li> went to my local TJ Maxx and found 2 more cans in different scents-</li>
            <li> My only tiny complaint is that even though the smell is pleasant, it is very strong initially.  </li>
            <li> I really like this dry shampoo, the tropical smell is delicious and the small bottle goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the seller as well.</li>
            <li> and I was hoping for a little more, but it did the job</li>
            <li> but it usually needs it to look suitable to leave the house, so</li>
            <li> The product works great, but the powder makes you look like you have some weird hair condition (dandruff?).</li>
            <li> sometimes the next morning my bangs are greasy (because of my greasy forehead), so I spray some Batiste on it and it looks freshly washed.  </li>
            <li> I sprayed the dry shampoo when my hair begun to get oily, and it did take the oil out, but I needed to spray more probably 5 or 6 hours later.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many dry shampoos trying for the ultimate (for me)</li>
            <li> New moms...</li>
            <li> A very strong combination which I find hard to like.</li>
            <li> As for the smell, I honestly don&#x27;t think it smells as bad as many people say</li>
            <li> I literally was only able to use this product 4 times before the can was empty.</li>
            <li> p.s I bought this from SuperBiz, and it came in this cheap packaging which I could care less about, but the bottle cap ended up cracked right in the middle and on a side.</li>
            <li> TO MY PITS, LOL - The follicles in my right pit got infected and I had painful pustules popping out everywhere.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Outside of the fact that you&#x27;d have to buy 4 bottles a month to have enough, it worked pretty well.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty greasy, but short, hair and maybe I needed to use a lot</li>
            <li> This stuff sprays on light grey, but totally vanishes once you comb it out as directed.</li>
            <li> have also started rinsing my hair and only conditioning the ends more often, and it seems my hair is producing less oil than it used to.</li>
            <li> Fine and limp and, to add insult to injury, oily.</li>
            <li> I saw this product on a YouTube how to/style video made by a woman in the UK, and wanted to try it since my hair is colored with a very vibrant pigment and washing it daily fades it.</li>
            <li> With something so light, it&#x27;s hard to tell how much is in the can.  </li>
            <li> Makes my oily scalp and hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> AND it doesn&#x27;t smell like old lady perfume.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t make my hair feel soft like shampooing and conditioning would, but</li>
            <li> It made my hair look old.</li>
            <li> I tilt my head downwards, and use my fingers to run through the powder to loosen it near the roots and then comb my hair downwards.</li>
            <li> It goes on white and feels very cooling on the scalp.</li>
            <li> I tried the cornstarch/baby powder method of old, but I didn&#x27;t like the smell or care for the texture</li>
            <li> It doesn’t go as far as i’d like</li>
            <li> I have REALLY greasy hair, like washing it in the morning only for it to start showing signs of grease by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> So far I like it</li>
            <li> you wake up with clean looking and smelling hair and limited white powder!</li>
            <li> I have really dark hair, so when I spray it in it&#x27;s white, but it brushes though easily.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s great for in-between shampoos or if you are in a hurry, but the scent is not pleasant to me, and probably the only reason I would like to try another type of dry shampoo....</li>
            <li> This was my first try at dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> This is the first dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried so</li>
            <li> First &#x27;dry&#x27; shampoo I have tried,</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how clean your hair looks after a few sprays.   </li>
            <li> I have dark hair and although it sprays on white if you run your fingers through your hair it goes away quickly!</li>
            <li> This particular brand doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell, however it does smell like coconuts so if you aren&#x27;t a fan I&#x27;d suggest a different scent from this brand.</li>
            <li> It is nice not having to wash my hair everyday especially because I have thin fine hair.  </li>
            <li> but it definitely was a new odor for me</li>
            <li> i really dislike dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> If you use way too much towel dry your hair with a damp towel.</li>
            <li> I have used the can at least 6 or more times and there is still plenty left.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend actually made the comment,\\&quot;Wow!  </li>
            <li> No more lemon fresh!</li>
            <li> It cleans your hair quite well for a dry shampoo, though it&#x27;s the first and only that I have ever used at this point.     </li>
            <li> Yes there is a mild residue and its definitely not as good as a real wash, but all things considered</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been vibrant red and platinum blonde</li>
            <li> I usually use it just on my bangs because they get oily and flat easy.</li>
            <li> Aside from that, this product has pretty much been added to my &#x27;must have&#x27; in life, or at least some form of it.      </li>
            <li> I am blonde and it always blends seamlessly into my hair.</li>
            <li> I have used many different dry shampoos over the last few years because I have oily hair at the roots.  </li>
            <li> close to the root and in fine layers or rows, start at crown, work down the sides, then start at crown work down</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m careful to not use too much and only spray on the roots</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t wash my hair daily I have a major excess oil problem.  </li>
            <li> I have not tried any powder dry shampoos yet, but this dry spray works very well.</li>
            <li> i have light colored highlights on the top of my head, so any complaints of it being powdery or dusty - is actually an advantage to my thin hair and that effect masks my scalp shining through.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not expensive either compared to other dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> My intention on buying this product was because the hair near my scalp gets oily, while the rest of my hair is still dry.</li>
            <li> But it is not very helpful, it can only make your hair look a little little bit better.</li>
            <li> The spray is powerful and doesn&#x27;t dull color.</li>
            <li> I put a little smoothing serum on them, hit them with the flat iron gently</li>
            <li> I just bought a single bottle the first time because I didn&#x27;t want to waste my money on something that wouldn&#x27;t work or last, but now I buy this product by the case!</li>
            <li> When I had long hair, the oilyness of my hair wasn&#x27;t such an issue, because I could just pull it back the second day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few different dry shampoos and this one is by far the best and least expensive!  </li>
            <li> My hair gets oily and looks gross about 30 hours after washing and so this product has really been a life saver when it comes to not having to wash my hair everyday!</li>
            <li> My hair is very long and straight and not very thick, It looks fantastic if I shower and dry my hair, but after the day or night is thru my hair looks limp, and gets very greasy looking very fast, I HATE IT!  </li>
            <li> It works about as well as baby powder and does not last for a long time.</li>
            <li> When all is done, my hair is no longer shiny, and the roots is no longer flat.</li>
            <li> makes them not last as long.</li>
            <li> Normally I would have to wash my hair everyday or it would appear greasy,</li>
            <li> I allowed it to dry and absorb the oil for about 3-5 minutes then brushed it through.</li>
            <li> I will never switch back to another dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product over any dry shampoos on the market!</li>
            <li> I recently went looking for a dry shampoo just to try it and an employee at a beauty store recommended Batiste Tropical Dry Shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair is not very oily, but I have very long hair, such that I want to use this between washes.</li>
            <li> Even using this dry shampoo once per week will save you money in the long run.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wash my hair daily because it dries it out severely, so I shampoo every other day.</li>
            <li> Also, I only wash my hair every OTHER day -</li>
            <li> (My hair is long and coarse, incredibly thick naturally)</li>
            <li> So after researching as to why this wasn&#x27;t necessary I decided to wash my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it on a regular basis, but it still lasts longer than all the other dry shampoos I have tried.   </li>
            <li> I bought this product as I was recommended to use dry shampoo so that I could lengthen the time between washing my hair with water.</li>
            <li> Let it dry about a minute of so and then style.</li>
            <li> Batiste Dry Shampoo 5.05 oz.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s naturally dry</li>
            <li> so have resorted to dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> Batiste Dry shampoo does the job it&#x27;s intended for.  </li>
            <li> The dry shampoo leaves a bit of a residue</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED ALL THREE FLAVORS OF BATISTE DRY SHAMPOO AND HAVE BEEN BUYING THEM REG</li>
            <li> As a college student, sometimes I just don&#x27;t have the patience or time to wash and dry my hair</li>
            <li> This is the 1st Dry Shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> Plus,  I blow dry to style</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using dry shampoo for a while now.</li>
            <li> After Sally&#x27;s stopped carrying my trusty Batiste, I gave TRESemme&#x27;s dry shampoo line a whirl.</li>
            <li> I have tried 5-10 brands of dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I also like to use it immediately after a regular shampoo and dry to give my thin straight hair some lift at the root.</li>
            <li> It also seems to give my hair some body because of the slight residue it does leave in, the curl actually stays in all day when I use it.</li>
            <li> just keep blending with your fingers or the brush and spray less next time.  </li>
            <li> The was a slight  residue left after brushing</li>
            <li> so I used a dry towel to fluff my hair.</li>
            <li> It just seems hard to control when there&#x27;s such a concentrated blast, and I can imagine it won&#x27;t last long that way.</li>
            <li> When you spray it is super cold and comes out as a white powder.</li>
            <li> My hair is wavy and always tends to look better on the second day, but those greasy roots made it impossible for me to go without washing my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ll see that my hair is not flat and dirty and that it has a lot of electricity in it that I need a brush to calm it</li>
            <li> I have to keep the vent on in the bathroom, with the door closed.  </li>
            <li> By the second day my hair is greasy looking and heavy.  </li>
            <li> , you wait a few minutes for it to soak up the oil, and then you take off the white powder.</li>
            <li> I had tried using baby powder before,  but the white residue it left behind left me wanting for another alternative.</li>
            <li> i will be buying this again; the fragrance is somewhat coconutty but not very assertive at all.  </li>
            <li> I used to wash my hair everyday until a friend mentioned to me that it&#x27;s not necessary to do that.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit frustrating to brush the white powder produced out of your hair completely</li>
            <li> I have not tried any other dry shampoo but after reading other reviews I ordered this one.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it on wet down hair, and I don&#x27;t have time to blow dry in the morning.  </li>
            <li> hair is oily at the base dry and frizzy at the ends and very fine (like abby hair)</li>
            <li> -I have dark hair and if I spray it too close it is too intense and it can be difficult to get rid of the white powder.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo costs less than $8</li>
            <li> I have tried other dry shampoos and they either hardly work or don&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> LIKE I JUST GOT OUT OF THE SHOWER AND SPENT AN HOUR DRYING AND STRAIGHTENING IT!  </li>
            <li> I wash my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare it to other brands</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every other day btw.</li>
            <li> I was a little afraid that the smell would be over-powering or cheap.</li>
            <li> With less than 5 minutes time spent on it.  </li>
            <li> I got the tropical green version of the Batiste Dry Shampoo 5.05 oz and</li>
            <li> The product says it will give you an extra day without wash, but I&#x27;ve gotten DAYS with this product, at least 3 every time.</li>
            <li> I also dye my hair, and want to limit shampooing to cut down on color fading.  </li>
            <li> Stop washing your color down the drain.</li>
            <li> decided to buckle down and order Batiste again off eBay for triple the cost of TRESemme.</li>
            <li> I usually just blow dry the rest of the powder out.  </li>
            <li> so it does make your hair less shiny.  </li>
            <li> I have dark, dark brunette hair (almost black) and this didn&#x27;t leave ANY grey/white residue!</li>
            <li> I have used every dry shampoo out there, from the most expensive to the least expensive.  </li>
            <li> I have very long, thick wavy hair that gets oily at the roots 12 hours after I wash it.</li>
            <li> My hair was pulled up in a sloppy bun and greasy as hell, and I never expected this spray could help, but wanted to see how it worked and whatnot.  </li>
            <li> and my hair needs a little pick-me-up.</li>
            <li> It does go on a little powdery</li>
            <li> I usually have to wash my hair every other day.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too tropical for my taste...</li>
            <li> It also gives me a little bit of volume too.</li>
            <li> My hair still felt a little heavy</li>
            <li> rub into scalp like shampoo and brush out with your head upside down!</li>
            <li> I have very dark hair and sometimes if I spray to closely I end up looking like I have gray hair after using this.  </li>
            <li> Made my hair feel dirtier and heavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken to putting the can and brush in my purse to use at work once my hair has dried.  </li>
            <li> (I have blonde hair) to get rid of the powdery look it leaves behind.  </li>
            <li> But it does fade within a few hours (</li>
            <li> - wait a few minutes and then brush the heck out of my hair to get the powder out.</li>
            <li> I started using the Batiste brand quite a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> for a few years.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few other brands and it left my hair with a weird texture.</li>
            <li> Makes it seem heavy, stiff.  </li>
            <li> However, ever since I purchased this item, I have had much less triumph!     </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair clumpy or stiff.  </li>
            <li> After about an hour of smelling it, it was so bad that I finally had to pull my hair back in a ponytail to get the smell away from my face.    </li>
            <li> The one little complaint I have is the talc residue feeling after I spray it</li>
            <li> therefore I try to apply very little on my hair to avoid this.</li>
            <li> For my hair that is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s difficult to rub it in well enough</li>
            <li> I could do without the weird smell, and the white powder look though.  </li>
            <li> A little expensive for dry shampoo though</li>
            <li> I was skeptical in trying a dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> The hard part of it is of course taking off the powder residue.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> Overall I was a little disappointed</li>
            <li> No more cancer inducing aluminum!</li>
            <li> I was using a different product (expensive stuff!)</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this out and was very skeptical, but it actually worked!</li>
            <li> so I was seriously concerned about frying my hair with every day wash.</li>
            <li> This product is not good if you have oily type hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is not great - to say the least.</li>
            <li> so I hate washing it everyday or even every other day..</li>
            <li> However, its scent was very hard to get used to.  </li>
            <li> I have been sick the past few days</li>
            <li> I hated paying big bucks for the name brands (Bumble&amp;Bumble, Keratase,etc.) and was convinced that i could find a cheaper alternative.  </li>
            <li> I hate washing it everyday</li>
            <li> and it was difficult to distribute evenly through my hair.</li>
            <li> No more deodorant marks on my blouses!!!!</li>
            <li> It smells awful, hardly works, and I swear I can feel it stick to my lungs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not to mention the tropical scent is not too bad either.  </li>
            <li> Not that my hair smelled bad but I just wanted to freshen it up a bit.</li>
            <li> God, did I hate the stuff.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a good product that I used to purchase regularly before it (and other dry shampoos) became available in stores.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I always liked the texture of \\&quot;second day \\&quot; hair but could never do it because my hair gets oily so fast. You just spray this at your roots... Looks like you just washed!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product as I was recommended to use dry shampoo so that I could lengthen the time between washing my hair with water. I myself am currently trying to keep the color auburn/red in my hair and let me tell you it has been a pain in the butt. However, ever since I purchased this item, I have had much less triumph!     This particular brand doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell, however it does smell like coconuts so if you aren&#x27;t a fan I&#x27;d suggest a different scent from this brand. I even spray this in my bangs sometimes for some body. It cleans your hair quite well for a dry shampoo, though it&#x27;s the first and only that I have ever used at this point.     If you have a darker shade of hair it&#x27;s a bit frustrating to brush the white powder produced out of your hair completely so it does make your hair less shiny.  Aside from that, this product has pretty much been added to my &#x27;must have&#x27; in life, or at least some form of it.      Now if only it smelled like CHI. (:</li>
            <li> It works!  Smells good and I can go two more days without a wash if necessary.  Great to have on hand in case of an emergency...</li>
            <li> Product is wonderful for mornings I don&#x27;t have time to wash my hair (because I hit the snooze button!) Best advice is to shake it, hold can about 6 inches away from hair, hold hair up so spray gets to roots. Don&#x27;t touch your hair even if it it standing up and looks gray. Let it dry about a minute of so and then style. Smell is not bad, I ordered the tropical scent. I loved it.</li>
            <li> This product works fairly well, and did clear up all oil in my hair for the day.  However, its scent was very hard to get used to.  It smelled like a cheap, citrus perfume.  After about an hour of smelling it, it was so bad that I finally had to pull my hair back in a ponytail to get the smell away from my face.    I would recommend this product for camping, or maybe for doing chores around the house.</li>
            <li> For me this product works great.  It is nice not having to wash my hair everyday especially because I have thin fine hair.  It also seems to give my hair some body because of the slight residue it does leave in, the curl actually stays in all day when I use it. For my hair that is unbelievable. Glad I found this product, will buy again.</li>
            <li> i really dislike dry shampoos. I keeo trying them in hopes that there is going to be a breakthrough. This one was better than most.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000KVH1QU Batiste Dry Shampoo 5.05 oz. Tropical]]    This was my first try at dry shampoos. I think it&#x27;s great for in-between shampoos or if you are in a hurry, but the scent is not pleasant to me, and probably the only reason I would like to try another type of dry shampoo....</li>
            <li> Ok, let me start off by saying WOW!  I just opened my package of this product tonight and I am incredibly impressed.  My hair is very long and straight and not very thick, It looks fantastic if I shower and dry my hair, but after the day or night is thru my hair looks limp, and gets very greasy looking very fast, I HATE IT!  I have been sick the past few days and I havent taken a shower in 3 days.  My hair was pulled up in a sloppy bun and greasy as hell, and I never expected this spray could help, but wanted to see how it worked and whatnot.  Let me tell you, MY HAIR LOOKS LIKE I JUST GOT OUT OF THE SHOWER AND SPENT AN HOUR DRYING AND STRAIGHTENING IT!  With less than 5 minutes time spent on it.  Yes there is a mild residue and its definitely not as good as a real wash, but all things considered, it is pretty damn impressive.  I will definitely buy more.  Smells great too.</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick wavy hair that gets oily at the roots 12 hours after I wash it. I can&#x27;t wash my hair daily because it dries it out severely, so I shampoo every other day. I sprayed the dry shampoo when my hair begun to get oily, and it did take the oil out, but I needed to spray more probably 5 or 6 hours later. It also leaves residue in your hair but it&#x27;s easy to shake or brush out. I also needed quite a bit of the product to do the job. I switched back to using baby powder because the baby powder keeps the oil at bay for a good 24 hours without re-application. I would continue to use this product, but it&#x27;s not practical for me to carry around the can in my purse and use it when I&#x27;m out and about.</li>
            <li> I really like this dry shampoo, the tropical smell is delicious and the small bottle goes a long way! Normally I would have to wash my hair everyday or it would appear greasy, with this product it allows me to skip a day in between washings and my hair still smells great!</li>
            <li> I have pretty fine, very straight hair that gets oily quick.  I also dye my hair, and want to limit shampooing to cut down on color fading.  This stuff works like magic.  Not only is my hair looking clean and freshly washed in an instant, but it has VOLUME.  My boyfriend actually made the comment,\\&quot;Wow!  It looks like you had your hair styled in a salon.\\&quot;  My only tiny complaint is that even though the smell is pleasant, it is very strong initially.  I have to keep the vent on in the bathroom, with the door closed.  Because the product works so well, I can easily overlook the strength of the perfume, which quickly fades anyway.</li>
            <li> Worked for me. ON days i don&#x27;t have to bother shamppooing i just wash my hair with water and apply this. It feels as good as shampoo , even better cause it doesnt damage your hair.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo is a nice alternative to regular washing, to make your hair treatment (coloring, keratin, etc.)  last longer.  I like the tropical scent. Spray about 12 inches from your head at the roots parting in sections; wait 3-5 minutes and then comb or brush through. I have not tried any powder dry shampoos yet, but this dry spray works very well. Good price.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every other day. On the days that I don&#x27;t wash my hair I use this product on my roots. My roots tend to get very oily fast because I have straight hair and this product makes my hair look like just washed it!!   The smell is pleasant too.</li>
            <li> If you color your hair a product like this is a must. Stop washing your color down the drain. Even using this dry shampoo once per week will save you money in the long run. I also like to use it immediately after a regular shampoo and dry to give my thin straight hair some lift at the root.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t believe it but it works!  Makes my oily scalp and hair shiny and soft. Great for those with oily scalps and need a touch up through out the day.  Smell is OK.  I&#x27;ll get a different scent next time but I will but this again.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I have thick hair and it&#x27;s naturally dry so I hate washing it everyday or even every other day.. but I also work out everynight... well that creates a problem! This product is great, I use it between washes to keep my hair fresh and bouncey and smelling nice! I wanted to give it 5 stars but I only gave it 4... the reason? The ingredients. They seem kind of harsh.. but hey it works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of this dry shampoo, it works great AND it doesn&#x27;t smell like old lady perfume. Win win!</li>
            <li> Thought this was a quick hurry fix. Made my hair feel dirtier and heavy. Probably would never buy again.</li>
            <li> I recently went looking for a dry shampoo just to try it and an employee at a beauty store recommended Batiste Tropical Dry Shampoo. While I wash my hair each day w/ regular shampoo, I love this product for right around my hair line because it has a tendency to get oily. This product is great. The price is not bad and I will con&#x27;t to buy this product in the future.</li>
            <li> I have used many different dry shampoos over the last few years because I have oily hair at the roots.  I hate washing it everyday so have resorted to dry shampoos. This dry shampoo isn&#x27;t fabulous but it does absorb the oils and has a nice tropical smell.  I would purchase again but still looking for that awesome dry shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave that white residue.</li>
            <li> Had never heard of this before. Thought it might be good for my daughter, who has to was her hair every day. She loves it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff! The tropical smell is great, not overwhelming or too coconutty or pineappley. It is so helpful for when I&#x27;m in a rush or on the go and my hair needs a little pick-me-up. It does go on a little powdery but it dries and brushes out quickly and easily. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Received Dry Shampoo very quickly.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting it so soon.  Product came in great condition, works wonderful, &amp; now I&#x27;m officially hooked.</li>
            <li> Batiste Dry shampoo does the job it&#x27;s intended for.  It feels cool when you spray it on which is very refreshing.  The smell is nice too.</li>
            <li> Bought this because it is perfect for traveling and when you really don&#x27;t have time to wash your hair. It is good for an instant freshening up.  The smell is quite nice, it is not too strong and there are several different scents, this one is my favorite though, it has a coconut essence to it. I was surprised at how clean your hair looks after a few sprays.   Just make sure you don&#x27;t spray it too close to your scalp-I have dark hair and if I spray it too close it is too intense and it can be difficult to get rid of the white powder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been 1 to shower every other day and my hair remains really healthy because of it.  When I had long hair, the oilyness of my hair wasn&#x27;t such an issue, because I could just pull it back the second day.  But with my short hairdo, it looks so oily by day 2.  I was resorting to washing my hair every day.  Well, I got this, and it works really well!  I just spray on and use a bristle brush to smooth through my hair.  It soaks the oil right up leaving my hair looking just washed.  My only problem is that my hair sticks up in all directions in the morning.  I haven&#x27;t tried it on wet down hair, and I don&#x27;t have time to blow dry in the morning.  I&#x27;ve taken to putting the can and brush in my purse to use at work once my hair has dried.  I use the tropical smell.  It&#x27;s really light, not overwealming at all.  There is a split second when you spray it that it has a smell mch like just sprayed hair spray, but it goes away extremely fast!  I will definately buy more!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical in trying a dry shampoo.  I&#x27;ve researched them and trying to find one was becoming a bittersweet task.  I saw Batiste dry shampoo seeing it was economical in price and had great reviews, so it was a win-win for me.  I have fine oily hair that I&#x27;m required to wash everyday just to get that clean feeling and avoiding an oily scalp.  I used the Batiste and not only did it soak up the oiliness, but there was a lot of volume as well!  Not to mention the tropical scent is not too bad either.  I will be sticking to this dry shampoo for a good while.</li>
            <li> This is a good dry shampoo.  I like it and I keep ordering it.  I recommended this to a friend.</li>
            <li> i have tried several dry shampoos and this one is my second favorite (my favorite was made by Samy and has been discontinued).  I hated paying big bucks for the name brands (Bumble&amp;Bumble, Keratase,etc.) and was convinced that i could find a cheaper alternative.  This dry shampoo costs less than $8 (look around, some places sell it for $5, some for $11...you just have to be savvy about it) and works just as well as the pricey brands.      The best way to use it is to spray through roots while slightly lifting and parting the hair, let it sit in hair for 3-5 minutes (don&#x27;t worry that it will look gray or powdery in some areas) and then rake fingers thru hair blending it in from roots to tips, lastly, take a bristle brush and comb thru to continue blending any that is left.  if you use too much and feel that you can still see powdery areas just keep blending with your fingers or the brush and spray less next time.  If you use way too much towel dry your hair with a damp towel.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product!  It leaves your hair with a white coating.  Makes you look gray.  I end up having to shampoo it out anyways.</li>
            <li> I love this product. When I was a teenager I used a product similar to this.  It really does work on those days when you just don&#x27;t have the time to shampoo or just don&#x27;t feel like it.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY love this product!! I can not say enough good things about it.    I have tried other dry shampoos and they either hardly work or don&#x27;t last. (My last one clogged after only one use!)     My hair gets oily and looks gross about 30 hours after washing and so this product has really been a life saver when it comes to not having to wash my hair everyday! I know I can just spray this on, wait a couple of minutes, and then rub it in and then go!     I just bought a single bottle the first time because I didn&#x27;t want to waste my money on something that wouldn&#x27;t work or last, but now I buy this product by the case!</li>
            <li> The best part about this product is the smell. It works about as well as baby powder and does not last for a long time. I have really oily hair and I try to avoid washing it every day but it usually needs it to look suitable to leave the house, so i figured i&#x27;d give this a try. The dry shampoo leaves a bit of a residue so make sure you&#x27;re boyfriend doesn&#x27;t run his hands through your hair! Overall I was a little disappointed but I suppose I was expecting miracles.</li>
            <li> I loved the smell of the product.  It seemed to work pretty good but it alters the texture of your hair somewhat.  Makes it seem heavy, stiff.  I will still continue to use it as it does work.  Nothing is perfect, right?</li>
            <li> I have not tried any other dry shampoo but after reading other reviews I ordered this one. I have used the can at least 6 or more times and there is still plenty left. I usually use it just on my bangs because they get oily and flat easy. I like the way it smells, A subtle tropical smell (more to the coconut side not the fruity side). :)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff for when I need a quick pick me up for my hair. I have tried a few other brands and it left my hair with a weird texture. This stuff sprays on light grey, but totally vanishes once you comb it out as directed. I love to take it with me on vacation, camping,or after the gym. It leaves my hair feeling soft and looking fresh. The tropical smell isn&#x27;t anything special and really doesn&#x27;t last which is fine by me being that I don&#x27;t want my hair smelling all fruity anyways. I would definitly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> this makes your hair white while spraying and the fumes from the bottle is intoxicating.  This product is not good if you have oily type hair.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I HAVE USED ALL THREE FLAVORS OF BATISTE DRY SHAMPOO AND HAVE BEEN BUYING THEM REG AT THE SALLY&#x27;S BEAUTY SUPPLY HERE IN VESTAL,NY BUT THEY DON&#x27;T CARRY THE TROPICAL AND THATS MY FAV!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried many dry shampoos but this for me was okay.  It does the job of removing the oil from your hair.  But it&#x27;s difficult to rub it in well enough (I have blonde hair) to get rid of the powdery look it leaves behind.  It also would leave flakes sometimes and give an appearance of dandruff...not cute.</li>
            <li> This is the first dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried so I can&#x27;t compare it to other brands but I love it! As a college student, sometimes I just don&#x27;t have the patience or time to wash and dry my hair so using Batiste in the mornings is great for me. It makes hair not look oily anymore. As for the smell, I honestly don&#x27;t think it smells as bad as many people say but it definitely was a new odor for me but nobody ever noticed it. Also, it&#x27;s great for when you just dyed your hair and want to put off washing it for a couple days to make the color last longer. Really recommend it.</li>
            <li> My hair gets oily very fast.  I wash it at night and sometimes the next morning my bangs are greasy (because of my greasy forehead), so I spray some Batiste on it and it looks freshly washed.  Also, I only wash my hair every OTHER day - it&#x27;s better for your hair, keeps it healthy - so because my hair is oily, I use Batiste on it and the girls at work so it looks like my hair has been freshly washed!  PLUS, it smells like coconut - I love it!</li>
            <li> The transaction was great.  I received the product within a weeks time.  The shampoo does absorb oil however I don&#x27;t like the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I usually have to wash my hair every other day.  By the second day my hair is greasy looking and heavy.  I don&#x27;t use a lot of products or anything in my hair regularly.  I used this for the first time yesterday and I was hoping for a little more, but it did the job okay.  My hair still felt a little heavy and it didn&#x27;t make my hair feel soft like shampooing and conditioning would, but it took that greasy look away.  That&#x27;s all I can ask for, I suppose.  Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I literally was only able to use this product 4 times before the can was empty. Are you kidding?  That right there is the deal breaker for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outside of the fact that you&#x27;d have to buy 4 bottles a month to have enough, it worked pretty well.  My hair no longer looked oily , which was great.  However, the smell wasn&#x27;t the best in the world.  It&#x27;s a little too tropical for my taste... whenever I&#x27;d get a whiff, I wasn&#x27;t happy about it.</li>
            <li> This is OK as a backup.  My hair is oily.  When I touch, I know it will be needing washing eventually but using this products brings out the \\&quot;electricity\\&quot; as we call it in my hair.  Others won&#x27;t feel the oily part of my hair.  They&#x27;ll see that my hair is not flat and dirty and that it has a lot of electricity in it that I need a brush to calm it down.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good to use as a back up on the spur of the moment. It still does not get rid of the oily feeling in my hair.  It does better than not washing your hair at all until it&#x27;s the exact time you always do it.</li>
            <li> 3.5 Stars rounded to 4.  My intention on buying this product was because the hair near my scalp gets oily, while the rest of my hair is still dry. I wash my hair every other day btw. Anyways, the product is something I have never used before. When you spray it is super cold and comes out as a white powder. The powder sticks onto your hair, you wait a few minutes for it to soak up the oil, and then you take off the white powder. The hard part of it is of course taking off the powder residue. It made my hair look old. The product works great, but the powder makes you look like you have some weird hair condition (dandruff?). I tilt my head downwards, and use my fingers to run through the powder to loosen it near the roots and then comb my hair downwards. This takes about 5 minutes for me to get ride *most* of the residue.  I got the tropical green version of the Batiste Dry Shampoo 5.05 oz and the smell isn&#x27;t that..tropical. It smells like chemicals and air freshener. A very strong combination which I find hard to like. But it does fade within a few hours (either that or I stopped noticing)  When all is done, my hair is no longer shiny, and the roots is no longer flat. It has VOLUME, and I LOVE that! I could do without the weird smell, and the white powder look though.  For the price, it is a good buy and a product I was glad I tried.  p.s I bought this from SuperBiz, and it came in this cheap packaging which I could care less about, but the bottle cap ended up cracked right in the middle and on a side. So, I taped it together... On top of that, the product just arrived on time and not even early. If SuperBiz care this much about their products, I will not be using them again. Just saying.</li>
            <li> My hair is not great - to say the least. Fine and limp and, to add insult to injury, oily. It&#x27;s also blondish and getting darker every year. I&#x27;ve tried many dry shampoos trying for the ultimate (for me) every-other-day-wash. Some of them worked but made my hair look weird - sort of grayish and with way too much static - if I didn&#x27;t put it in a pony I looked like a dandelion.  Batiste actually makes my hair look blonder - adds volume and my hair is shiny and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shake the can well and keep shaking it while you&#x27;re using it - it seems to work better that way. I&#x27;m careful to not use too much and only spray on the roots - wait a few minutes and then brush the heck out of my hair to get the powder out. It does have a scent but isn&#x27;t objectionable - on the flowery side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say if it will do the same for anybody else but I let one of my girlfriends try it and she \\&quot;borrowed\\&quot; it in her suitcase somehow...</li>
            <li> This is the 1st Dry Shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried. I read all the reviews and this seemed like a safe bet. I was a little afraid that the smell would be over-powering or cheap. In fact, it is quite pleasant. I sprayed it on in a sweeping motion along my part line. I used it sparingly. It goes on white and feels very cooling on the scalp. I allowed it to dry and absorb the oil for about 3-5 minutes then brushed it through. It was not flaky or powdery. The was a slight  residue left after brushing so I used a dry towel to fluff my hair. Guess what? It came out great! My hair looked freshly washed,shiny, smelled great, and had incredible body. I&#x27;m so glad I took a chance on this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells.  It works much better than all the other brands that I have tried.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair clumpy or stiff.  Just light and flowing.  It does leave a bit of a white residue which is great to help blend in my dark roots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product a while ago and I am just starting to run out of it. I don&#x27;t use it on a regular basis, but it still lasts longer than all the other dry shampoos I have tried.   On top of that, it smells good. It&#x27;s not expensive either compared to other dry shampoos. I will stick with it for now.</li>
            <li> Batiste is hands down the best dry shampoo, but this tropical smell is the bees knees! Smaller than the cans you&#x27;d get from Ulta, but larger than the purse size.. This just might be my new favorite scent.</li>
            <li> I really dislike the smell. I also don&#x27;t like how the spray comes out with so much force. It just seems hard to control when there&#x27;s such a concentrated blast, and I can imagine it won&#x27;t last long that way. Then when I brush it out, my brush ends up with all this residue on it. Effectiveness-wise, it seems ok. It soaked up some of the grease in my hair but I have to say I expected more from it.</li>
            <li> love the smell and it works</li>
            <li> I started using the Batiste brand quite a few years ago.  I have used every dry shampoo out there, from the most expensive to the least expensive.  This is hands-down the best!  I love all of them, doesn&#x27;t matter which &#x27;smell&#x27;, they&#x27;re all good. (did not like the one with color).  I hope they never discontinue this.</li>
            <li> First &#x27;dry&#x27; shampoo I have tried, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work. Just adds a chalky residue to hair and it doesn&#x27;t feel any cleaner at all.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do the job at all.  I have very oily hair and this product wasn&#x27;t worth a red cent.  Finely hair powder is the only product that I have found to truly absorb the oil in my hair.  If I don&#x27;t wash my hair daily I have a major excess oil problem.  I love the finely powder because a little goes a long way and it doesn&#x27;t cause static like baby powder and comes in colors to match your hair</li>
            <li> I bought this product recently and was amazed at how well it works. I was one of those women who HAD to wash her hair EVERY DAY!!! My roots would get SOOO oily, but the rest of my hair looked great. I had tried using baby powder before,  but the white residue it left behind left me wanting for another alternative. After using this product my hair looked FANTASTIC from roots to ends. My hair is wavy and always tends to look better on the second day, but those greasy roots made it impossible for me to go without washing my hair everyday. Plus,  I blow dry to style so I was seriously concerned about frying my hair with every day wash. Now I don&#x27;t have that problem and thanks to this product I can feel confident going to work with fresh, clean smelling hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo I have ever used! The smell is phenomenal! No more lemon fresh! The spray is powerful and doesn&#x27;t dull color. I&#x27;ve been vibrant red and platinum blonde and it&#x27;s worked with both shades and everything in between. The product says it will give you an extra day without wash, but I&#x27;ve gotten DAYS with this product, at least 3 every time. I will never switch back to another dry shampoo. I&#x27;ve used everything and I swear by this product. I even buy this for my friends to convince them to switch. I gave a bottle to my hair stylist and she&#x27;s in love as well. The coconut is my favorite, but I will be trying the cherry next. (My hair is long and coarse, incredibly thick naturally)</li>
            <li> New moms... This is the beauty product that will save you time and allow you to feel refresh those days where you don&#x27;t get to have a shower! It would also be awesome for camping too. I really like the smell of this one and it does an incredible job soaking up the oil. It also gives me a little bit of volume too. I definitely recommend this product over any dry shampoos on the market!</li>
            <li> I have very dark hair and sometimes if I spray to closely I end up looking like I have gray hair after using this.  It is what it is......a quick fix for my oily hair if I want to skip a wash and put my hair in a ponytail. The smell needs some work but the product does what it&#x27;s designed to do.</li>
            <li> Great priced product! Smells nice and definitely works to get the grease out of my hair when I don&#x27;t have time to wash and dry it. I&#x27;m a big fan!</li>
            <li> The item was just as described and it has a great smell.  My hair had bounce in it just like I had washed it that day.</li>
            <li> this is a wonderful dry shampoo (i&#x27;ve used quite a lot of them in my time, mostly super pricey salon brands).  i will be buying this again; the fragrance is somewhat coconutty but not very assertive at all.  and, i now can go 2-3 days between &#x27;real&#x27;shampoos.  and my hair is much happier for it.  i can not reccomend this enough!</li>
            <li> This is EXACTLY what I&#x27;ve been looking for! I tried the cornstarch/baby powder method of old, but I didn&#x27;t like the smell or care for the texture and it was difficult to distribute evenly through my hair. The aerosol spray solves that problem. As for the smell, I consider myself to be very picky about scents, but once the smell dissipated after being sprayed, I never noticed it again.    This has been my life-saver not just for a post-gym freshen up (which it is AMAZING for), but also as a busy on-the-go mom with long locks, it saves me a day or two in between shampoos--even in the hot, humid Midwest summers. I&#x27;m a huge fan! And you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I personally like the scent, I use EO tropical body wash (chemical free) and EO coconut and Hibiscus shampoo and conditioner, so this blended right in with my scent palate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is oily at the base dry and frizzy at the ends and very fine (like abby hair) It’s much improved song I stopped washing it every day and I use sulfate free everything now!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If my ends are frizzy I put a little smoothing serum on them, hit them with the flat iron gently&lt;br /&gt; and quickly and spray this on in QUICK, SHORT SPRITZES AT A TIME!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry to CAPS, but that is the key to not have white spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shake, Shake, shake your can prior to spritzing and in between each and every spritz!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hit close to the root and in fine layers or rows, start at crown, work down the sides, then start at crown work down the back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then rub into scalp like shampoo and brush out with your head upside down! VOILA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also started rinsing my hair and only conditioning the ends more often, and it seems my hair is producing less oil than it used to. Rinse vigorously with warm water (don’t want to break a sweat) as if shampooing, condition ends (if conditioner is light enough usb thru out) rinse and style lightly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BACK TO MY PITS, LOL - The follicles in my right pit got infected and I had painful pustules popping out everywhere. I took a break from deodorant to let them heal. I use a gentle anti-microbial hand soap in the shower on my pits, unmentionables and to scrub my feet. I noticed I wasn’t getting much odor just a lil sweaty and baby powder was too thick glob on, so I decide to try spritzing my batiste on my pits AND IT WORKED LOL. Left them soft, silky and with a light fragrance. No more cancer inducing aluminum! No more deodorant marks on my blouses!!!! Try the blush fragrance if you don’t like this one!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff, getting the big can this time. It doesn’t go as far as i’d like (but mydaughter may have gotten into it too)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  The smell is nice- some people said it was grandmothery, but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more tropical and beachy.  It&#x27;s strong smelling at first, but the scent wears off pretty fast.  The shampoo works great.  I have really dark hair, so when I spray it in it&#x27;s white, but it brushes though easily.  If there&#x27;s any left I usually just blow dry the rest of the powder out.  It also works great if you spray it into your hair the night before- you wake up with clean looking and smelling hair and limited white powder!</li>
            <li> On those days when I didn&#x27;t wash my hair, no one has to know.  Better than talcum powder this product does exactly what I need it to do - freshen my hair up, volumize it a bit and it&#x27;s great smelling too.  Can do anything with my hair that I need to after using it, couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more.  Comes in a convenient travel size too!!</li>
            <li> The Batiste Dry Shampoo not only smells good but refreshes unwashed hair all day! I love it and would buy it again! I highly recommend the seller as well.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I must reorder soon. It&#x27;s great for in between washes and smells DIVINE. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product and use it every week. It smells amazing and lasts a long time in  my hair. I am blonde and it always blends seamlessly into my hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is hard to find in stores (besides TJ Maxx), but I&#x27;ll keep ordering it because (as a hairstylist and a person who is constantly trying new hair powders) I find that Batiste is the best so far. I like that it comes in several different scents AND COLORS, and it&#x27;s not outrageously priced.</li>
            <li> It works great. You don&#x27;t get that product feeling. However you have to rub in bc it sprays white. They should consider adding color for hair color to these products.</li>
            <li> With something so light, it&#x27;s hard to tell how much is in the can.  I have pretty greasy, but short, hair and maybe I needed to use a lot but I ran out in just 3 weeks.  For that price, I&#x27;ve decided to use baby powder.  It works amazingly well and is much, much more affordable.</li>
            <li> I saw this product on a YouTube how to/style video made by a woman in the UK, and wanted to try it since my hair is colored with a very vibrant pigment and washing it daily fades it. I think I am hooked now. Next day after styling, I used this and it looks fuller, thicker, less oily, and smells great. i have light colored highlights on the top of my head, so any complaints of it being powdery or dusty - is actually an advantage to my thin hair and that effect masks my scalp shining through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to my local TJ Maxx and found 2 more cans in different scents- and one of the blonde tinted editions which I have been using on my crown. I would say next to my LUSH R&amp;B hair moisturizer, this is my favorite hair find in 2 years.</li>
            <li> I have dark, dark brunette hair (almost black) and this didn&#x27;t leave ANY grey/white residue! It&#x27;s not a miracle worker- my hair didn&#x27;t look as good as when I wash it obviously, but it looked a hell of a lot better than my normal second day hair. It smells great too! Totally recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using dry shampoo for a while now. I go to the gym but don&#x27;t want to shampoo my hair ever day. I was using a different product (expensive stuff!) for a few years. I saw this on Amazon and it was on sale so I thought &#x27;why not&#x27;. It&#x27;s awesome! I have dark hair and although it sprays on white if you run your fingers through your hair it goes away quickly! It actually makes your hair look like you just got done spending hours styling it. Glad I tried it. I&#x27;m switching to this brand now.</li>
            <li> Fantastic dry shampoo. This brand is amazing! I have a can in my car, at work, and in my gym bag. Love love love!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this, especially the scent.  She would give it a 5.  I don&#x27;t like the tropical smell- not into coconut/banana scents.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this out and was very skeptical, but it actually worked! I ordered the tropical scent and it smells like coconuts, smells good. It isn&#x27;t a light smell though. It&#x27;s basically like you&#x27;re wearing perfume</li>
            <li> The shampoo really makes your hair look like it´s clean  and healthy and smells good.  I´d surelly buy it again!</li>
            <li> Loved the smell. A little expensive for dry shampoo though</li>
            <li> The bottle does not last very long at all, but it is by far the best dry shampoo I have ever used. I have fine hair and usually dry shampoos are no help. I can use this and get away with 3 days of no washing my hair, and thats amazing because i have extensions and washing my hair all the time makes them not last as long.</li>
            <li> I feel it does it pretty good job and helps me to extend the time between washing my hair.  Doesn&#x27;t leave it too powdery and smells good.</li>
            <li> After Sally&#x27;s stopped carrying my trusty Batiste, I gave TRESemme&#x27;s dry shampoo line a whirl. God, did I hate the stuff. It smells awful, hardly works, and I swear I can feel it stick to my lungs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to buckle down and order Batiste again off eBay for triple the cost of TRESemme. I&#x27;m so glad I did. It was my first time trying the \\&quot;tropical\\&quot; scent and I LOVE it. I tend not to like perfumy floral scents, so the scent of coconut is perfect for me. Best of all, I don&#x27;t feel it coating my lungs with each spray.</li>
            <li> Good smell. My hair is not very oily, but I have very long hair, such that I want to use this between washes. But it is not very helpful, it can only make your hair look a little little bit better.</li>
            <li> I have REALLY greasy hair, like washing it in the morning only for it to start showing signs of grease by the end of the day.  I&#x27;ve tried quite a few different dry shampoos and this one is by far the best and least expensive!  I usually spray some on before I go to bed and in the morning my hair looks great so no need to wash my hair every day!  The tropical smell is nice too.</li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo! The can lasts a while so you get enough for your money. It makes curly or straight hair fresh and smells great!</li>
            <li> I used to wash my hair everyday until a friend mentioned to me that it&#x27;s not necessary to do that. So after researching as to why this wasn&#x27;t necessary I decided to wash my hair every other day. Problem is my hair gets a bit oily after one day of not washing it and I also really like the smell of shampooed hair. Not that my hair smelled bad but I just wanted to freshen it up a bit. So I did some more research and decided to try this product. So far I like it, I noticed the oiliness issue has improved and I especially like the tropical coconut fragrance. The one little complaint I have is the talc residue feeling after I spray it therefore I try to apply very little on my hair to avoid this. Price is also pretty decent.</li>
            <li> I have tried 5-10 brands of dry shampoo.  This one works the best, has a delicious smell, and doesn&#x27;t leave a gross residue in your hair!  It&#x27;s important to apply it correctly, however, which is the case with all dry shampoos.  I&#x27;m glad I can find it on Amazon as my local beauty supply stores no longer carry it.</li>
