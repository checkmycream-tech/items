            <li>Good coverage.</li>

            <li>/&gt;Coverage is  quite good.</li>
            <li>Loved this foundation.</li>
            <li>The quality of this foundation is not as good as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>It also provides good coverage (and I do always have blemishes that need coverage), but it&#x27;s not a mask-like product.  </li>
            <li>The coverage is good, but it doesn&#x27;t make my face look cakey</li>
            <li>way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend setting this product with powder or using a good primer to get all day coverage.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I loved this product.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s true!!!</li>
            <li>Great stuff, love it ðŸ˜Š</li>

            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love this foundation!</li>
            <li>Easy to use, great finish...</li>
            <li>Good product but very light cover</li>
            <li>Nothing really compares to this - it lasts all day, doesn&#x27;t get cakey, it isn&#x27;t greasy and the shade is perfect for my skin.</li>
            <li>and this foundation covers all nicely.</li>
            <li>Not oily at all and gives a nice semi-matte finish.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied and will be buying a lot more E.L.F products.</li>
            <li>It has good coverage and it&#x27;s easy to blend.</li>
            <li>Very nice product as it goes on smooth with light to medium coverage.  </li>
            <li>Pretty great match, too, and</li>
            <li>Ingredients could be better.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this foundation.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind just screwing the top off.</li>
            <li>It went on smoothly and covered nicely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I love the consistency and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have an odor.</li>
            <li>Love the hygenic dispenser.</li>
            <li>Love this foundation.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It covers most imperfections and whatever it leaves out</li>
            <li>Okay, so i used to use lancome.</li>
            <li>Their liquid eyeliner was even better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it</li>
            <li>This color porcelain is more like a nude color.</li>
            <li>and I find it to be a better formula for me.</li>
            <li>but they need more colors</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 69 now, but ever since I turned 50 most makeup sits inside my pores - visibly.</li>
            <li>I love all ELF products.</li>
            <li>To be fair about my review, I will say that this is why I stopped using liquid foundation in the first place.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used liquid foundation in probably 10 years, but I needed something very light to help with makeup for a special costume.</li>
            <li>It is light feeling and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>A little too drying for my skin but perfect for nose area.</li>
            <li>the combination is fabulous.</li>
            <li>As for smoothness and feel, however, this foundation goes on smooth and not cakey.</li>
            <li>I have fairly light skin and this shade is supposed to be a light shade.</li>
            <li>and I figured the porcelain color would be the right choice, but it&#x27;s still a bit more orange than matches.</li>
            <li>It matched my skin like it should and was super easy to apply.</li>
            <li>So if you have significant coverage needs, you will have to use concealer with this foundation.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So in general in good just make shure</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and it looks good even later in the day.</li>
            <li>Full coverage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 32, it hides wrinkles, buffs out red splotches and looks good on.</li>
            <li>I love this foundation because it works really well.  </li>
            <li>Much too strong.</li>
            <li>but it is not expensive and it might just be the one!</li>
            <li>product is good, just one of them was the incorrect one, I live far away</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great everyday foundation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and really works.</li>
            <li>My skin always looks dewy and fresh.</li>
            <li>Worth trying....</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and this works just right in all the right places.</li>
            <li>you get the right things.</li>
            <li>It also is some of the best coverage I&#x27;ve ever used, it is almost as good as Clinique&#x27;s liquid foundations, I buy E.L.F. though because it is less expensive.</li>
            <li>so many different drugstore foundations - Almay, physican&#x27;s formula, maybeline, the list goes on and on.</li>
            <li>Looking for a middle-line product, I first found this at Target.  </li>
            <li>It seemed while most of their items are hits, there is an occasional miss.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>I just ordered two more of the same foundations.</li>
            <li>Goes on lightweight, very even!</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty oily, and this product does not do much to help hide the oils</li>
            <li>but I took a chance and it covers very well.</li>
            <li>It is much darker than it looks in photos.</li>
            <li>So if you can find a skin color match in your shade, I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t break out as much as i did with the mineral makeup.</li>
            <li>It evens out my skin tone and leaves my face looking fresh and clear.</li>
            <li>but when I received this, it was much darker.</li>
            <li>it makes me look several shades darker, it is a light color, but its like the color of someone having a tan, its not for me.</li>
            <li>It kind of leaves a messy look that mineral foundation doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this seems to work pretty well for me.</li>
            <li>It gives a decent but smoother coverage that</li>
            <li>I have light skin (not quite pale) and the color is a little off for my skin tone, so I do mix a little of my BB cream with it to get my perfect match!</li>
            <li>If you can find a skin match for this product, I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After that got a wee bit expensive, i moved on to mineral makeup, but i stopped getting compliments on how great my makeup</li>
            <li>If you are thinking of purchasing this from Amazon, I&#x27;d recommend at least visiting a store first to make sure the shade is what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li>Okay, so porcelain usually is very very extremely pale, and the pictures of this product shows it being just that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently switched all of my cosmetics to cruelty free products only</li>
            <li>It is also very sensitive.</li>
            <li>I do use their mineral primer first and that makes it last all day!</li>
            <li>I find you can either set it with a powder for a completely matte look, but leaving it as is works well too!</li>
            <li>I like full coverage, so if you&#x27;re looking for a thin, light foundation this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li>We have all spent so much money trying different brands and different colors but don&#x27;t let the price fool you, this foundation is just as good as the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>For as thick as it is, it goes on easily and really stays on.</li>
            <li>The cruel free aspect is very important and I love the price.</li>
            <li>Had to use Benadryl to clear it up...  </li>
            <li>, I prefer a complete cover</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend - you really can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
            <li>And hey, if you don&#x27;t like it, at least it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always surprised with the quality of e.l.f. products because their so inexpensive..</li>
            <li>ELF made a mature skin formula.</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t beat the quality for the price, especially when buying from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical that this could be a good foundation</li>
            <li>i have a hard time finding good matches for my pale skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used BB creams the last few years because I couldn&#x27;t find a foundation that had good coverage without feeling heavy.</li>
            <li>I was worried that a bottle of foundation that only cost $6 wasn&#x27;t going to give her the coverage she wanted and that it wouldn&#x27;t mesh well with her sensitive skin or match her skin tone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried the Ulta and Ulta professional foudnations which seperated and left my skin oily.</li>
            <li>It has kind of a weird smell</li>
    </ol>

            <li> but when I received this, it was much darker.</li>
            <li> it makes me look several shades darker, it is a light color, but its like the color of someone having a tan, its not for me.</li>
            <li> It kind of leaves a messy look that mineral foundation doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this seems to work pretty well for me.</li>
            <li> It gives a decent but smoother coverage that</li>
            <li> I have light skin (not quite pale) and the color is a little off for my skin tone, so I do mix a little of my BB cream with it to get my perfect match!</li>
            <li> If you can find a skin match for this product, I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After that got a wee bit expensive, i moved on to mineral makeup, but i stopped getting compliments on how great my makeup</li>
            <li> If you are thinking of purchasing this from Amazon, I&#x27;d recommend at least visiting a store first to make sure the shade is what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> Okay, so porcelain usually is very very extremely pale, and the pictures of this product shows it being just that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently switched all of my cosmetics to cruelty free products only</li>
            <li> It is also very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I do use their mineral primer first and that makes it last all day!</li>
            <li> I find you can either set it with a powder for a completely matte look, but leaving it as is works well too!</li>
            <li> I like full coverage, so if you&#x27;re looking for a thin, light foundation this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> We have all spent so much money trying different brands and different colors but don&#x27;t let the price fool you, this foundation is just as good as the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> For as thick as it is, it goes on easily and really stays on.</li>
            <li> The cruel free aspect is very important and I love the price.</li>
            <li> Had to use Benadryl to clear it up...  </li>
            <li> , I prefer a complete cover</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend - you really can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
            <li> And hey, if you don&#x27;t like it, at least it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always surprised with the quality of e.l.f. products because their so inexpensive..</li>
            <li> ELF made a mature skin formula.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t beat the quality for the price, especially when buying from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical that this could be a good foundation</li>
            <li> i have a hard time finding good matches for my pale skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used BB creams the last few years because I couldn&#x27;t find a foundation that had good coverage without feeling heavy.</li>
            <li> I was worried that a bottle of foundation that only cost $6 wasn&#x27;t going to give her the coverage she wanted and that it wouldn&#x27;t mesh well with her sensitive skin or match her skin tone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried the Ulta and Ulta professional foudnations which seperated and left my skin oily.</li>
            <li> It has kind of a weird smell</li>
            <li> It was a medium coverage as far as coving dark spots and/or</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s hard to recommend foundation, because foundation is really based on whether you can find your skin match.  </li>
            <li> I have spent $40 on foundation only to end up mixing it with another color or just giving up and throwing it in the trash....</li>
            <li> I have an oily t zone but dry otherwise</li>
            <li> It does not make my skin greasy at all (like, ever), nor does it dry it out.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy nude or creamy natural (depending on the brand).</li>
            <li> I typically have dark circles under my eyes and my skin is a little on the red side because it&#x27;s sensitive</li>
            <li> I purchased 4 more bottles and 1/2 way through the first one, had a terrible allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just this or liquid in general.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this one when I ran out of my other.</li>
            <li> cause the one i have is not right and non of the other ones are ether.</li>
            <li> I am very very pale, like almost white, and I don&#x27;t mean just pale, I mean super pale.</li>
            <li> The other missing star is for the color.</li>
            <li> Previously she was using a foundation from the Chanel makeup line.</li>
            <li> I bought porcelain since I read a review that this color is darker than typical porcelain foundations.</li>
            <li> I use e.l.f everyday and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> It was noticeable on so again, heavy.</li>
            <li> but I guess I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I do get a few small blemishes from time to time when I used it.</li>
            <li> I got the usual oily breakthrough in my T zone, but I use rice paper oil blotters to take of that.</li>
            <li> I have very pale skin.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Color (hard to find one that fits my skin</li>
            <li> it is so hard to find a foundation that is the correct color.  </li>
            <li> Scent is my biggest complaint.</li>
            <li> It is rather thick.</li>
            <li> A bit on thick side</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too thick.</li>
            <li> Received on time ,&amp; it&#x27;s a thick foundation.</li>
            <li> year, I slowly started trying elf products, adding one to my cart every once in a while.</li>
            <li> or like I&#x27;m wearing thick makeup.</li>
            <li> I have started adding the tiniest bit of face lotion to the foundation to thin it out</li>
            <li> I was wrong on all accounts.</li>
            <li> so it was difficult to return it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was awful, itching, red, swollen face...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not too bad</li>
            <li> you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is almost perfect. It has excellent  coverage and lasts all day on my combination skin. It makes my skin look like porcelain. It is rather thick. I have started adding the tiniest bit of face lotion to the foundation to thin it out so it glides on smoother and easier.</li>
            <li> Good coverage. Ingredients could be better.</li>
            <li> Good product but very light cover, I prefer a complete cover</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this foundation. I have tried so many different drugstore foundations - Almay, physican&#x27;s formula, maybeline, the list goes on and on. Nothing really compares to this - it lasts all day, doesn&#x27;t get cakey, it isn&#x27;t greasy and the shade is perfect for my skin. I use this with the Elf lavender primer and a different brand mineral powder, Elf bronzer, and the combination is fabulous. My skin always looks dewy and fresh. I have combination skin and this works just right in all the right places. I typically have dark circles under my eyes and my skin is a little on the red side because it&#x27;s sensitive but this covers everything flawlessly. It has kind of a weird smell but it&#x27;s not too bad and I can&#x27;t get the pump to work, but I don&#x27;t mind just screwing the top off. Definitely recommend - you really can&#x27;t beat it for the price. And hey, if you don&#x27;t like it, at least it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li> I just got this today and I have to admit I was skeptic of using the porcaline since I have medium skin and lots of freckles but I took a chance and it covers very well. I do also use a primer and a powder as well. I am very satisfied and will be buying a lot more E.L.F products.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, love it ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> I got this in Porcelain. It went on smoothly and covered nicely. I have combination skin and it looks good even later in the day. I got the usual oily breakthrough in my T zone, but I use rice paper oil blotters to take of that. I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase. I&#x27;m always surprised with the quality of e.l.f. products because their so inexpensive..</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that this could be a good foundation but it has excellent coverage, lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t feel goopy. For as thick as it is, it goes on easily and really stays on. I have an oily t zone but dry otherwise and this foundation covers all nicely. I love the consistency and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have an odor. The cruel free aspect is very important and I love the price.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot and i will defiantly buy this again. I think that this a good foundation it helps me cover my scar an my face by a dog and it is light and airy!!!</li>
            <li> Very good foundation. A bit on thick side so I use with damp sponge. Affordable great quality from a company that has no animal testing</li>
            <li> This is awful. Very disappointed. When you wear this with a moisturizer...it seems to separate and will not blend well.I feel as if I am wearing spackle and it won&#x27;t even pump through the pump! It&#x27;s too thick. Even after cleaning the pump out it still won&#x27;t pump through so I end up taking the pump part off. I definitely won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Scent is my biggest complaint. Much too strong. Makes me wonder if it&#x27;s masking something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coverage is  quite good. Love the hygenic dispenser. A little too drying for my skin but perfect for nose area. Tightens pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish ELF made a mature skin formula.</li>
            <li> This is so perfect. Received on time ,&amp; it&#x27;s a thick foundation. It&#x27;s only orange like if you don&#x27;t blend well. Hides flaws well. Defiantly will be re purchasing .</li>
            <li> Loved this foundation. It matched my skin like it should and was super easy to apply. would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a bit darker than I was expecting. I&#x27;m very fair skinned and I figured the porcelain color would be the right choice, but it&#x27;s still a bit more orange than matches. As for smoothness and feel, however, this foundation goes on smooth and not cakey.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very fair skin. It is also very sensitive. I was worried that a bottle of foundation that only cost $6 wasn&#x27;t going to give her the coverage she wanted and that it wouldn&#x27;t mesh well with her sensitive skin or match her skin tone. I was wrong on all accounts. It provided her with the perfect amount of coverage, matched her skin tone, and didn&#x27;t cause her to break out. Previously she was using a foundation from the Chanel makeup line. This product has saved me quite a bit of money.</li>
            <li> As an esthetician I have tried various  make up. What I like about e.l.f is there affordability. ThE quality  of there cosmetics are so impressive. I use e.l.f everyday and will continue to do so. If you try e.l.f you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend any E.L.F products! A+</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this seems to work pretty well for me. It also is some of the best coverage I&#x27;ve ever used, it is almost as good as Clinique&#x27;s liquid foundations, I buy E.L.F. though because it is less expensive.</li>
            <li> For the money, this is a great product - however - the pump does not work!  I tried priming it several times - nothing.  Finally unscrewed the cap and swept the wand part of the pump over my sponge.  Time-consuming.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used BB creams the last few years because I couldn&#x27;t find a foundation that had good coverage without feeling heavy. I also didn&#x27;t want to shell out lots of cash for just foundation! This elf foundation gives me everything I&#x27;m looking for! I have combo skin, and this evens out my skin giving it a luminous, dewy (not oily) glow. I do use their mineral primer first and that makes it last all day! I have light skin (not quite pale) and the color is a little off for my skin tone, so I do mix a little of my BB cream with it to get my perfect match! I will continue to use this,  very happy!</li>
            <li> Love this foundation. It doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily which i like a lot.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used liquid foundation in probably 10 years, but I needed something very light to help with makeup for a special costume. The quality of this foundation is not as good as I thought it would be. It kind of leaves a messy look that mineral foundation doesn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just this or liquid in general. To be fair about my review, I will say that this is why I stopped using liquid foundation in the first place. So I took one star off for the coverage and the texture it left on my face. The other missing star is for the color. I have fairly light skin and this shade is supposed to be a light shade. It is much darker than it looks in photos. It&#x27;s actually the same shade as my current foundation. If you are thinking of purchasing this from Amazon, I&#x27;d recommend at least visiting a store first to make sure the shade is what you&#x27;re looking for. I do like the bottle and the pump instead of just an open pour container. It makes it easier to only use what you need.</li>
            <li> I have used Urban Decay, Too Faced and all drug store foundations. I decided to try this one when I ran out of my other. I love it. Full coverage. I&#x27;m 32, it hides wrinkles, buffs out red splotches and looks good on. Quite impressed.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s hard to recommend foundation, because foundation is really based on whether you can find your skin match.  If you can find a skin match for this product, I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the cheaper, well-known products for years (Maybelline, Cover Girl) as well as some more expensive products (Estee Lauder, Loreal).  Looking for a middle-line product, I first found this at Target.  I love this foundation because it works really well.  It does not make my skin greasy at all (like, ever), nor does it dry it out.  It&#x27;s the perfect balance of moisture.  It also provides good coverage (and I do always have blemishes that need coverage), but it&#x27;s not a mask-like product.  So if you have significant coverage needs, you will have to use concealer with this foundation.  But the flip side of this is that the coverage looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about this product, however, is the price.  You really can&#x27;t beat the quality for the price, especially when buying from Amazon.  So if you can find a skin color match in your shade, I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great everyday foundation. It covers most imperfections and whatever it leaves out i cover it with the concealer. My skin is pretty oily, and this product does not do much to help hide the oils but I guess it&#x27;s just my complexion. However, my mom uses this product and looks flawless, but her skin is not as oily as mine.</li>
            <li> Okay, so i used to use lancome. After that got a wee bit expensive, i moved on to mineral makeup, but i stopped getting compliments on how great my makeup looked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last year, I slowly started trying elf products, adding one to my cart every once in a while. Their tweezers were great. Their liquid eyeliner was even better. Their eye  pencils, i don&#x27;t recommend though. The wood expands and they become unsharpenable. It seemed while most of their items are hits, there is an occasional miss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this foundation is one of their hits. I have very pale skin. This works great! I used the lancome porcelain too. Of course it&#x27;s a lil thicker than the lancome stuff, but it&#x27;s still a go for me. I&#x27;ve also tried the Ulta and Ulta professional foudnations which seperated and left my skin oily. I will continue to buy this! I don&#x27;t break out as much as i did with the mineral makeup. I&#x27;d get a pimple every once in a while with the mineral stuff and just assumed it was my skin. Since switching, i have had 0 things to pop (I know ...eww!), so i think it was hte mineral makeup causing the breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Price&lt;br /&gt;Application/ease of use&lt;br /&gt;Coverage&lt;br /&gt;Color (hard to find one that fits my skin just right)&lt;br /&gt;No scent&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t separate</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s cheap and really works. The coverage is good, but it doesn&#x27;t make my face look cakey or like I&#x27;m wearing thick makeup. It evens out my skin tone and leaves my face looking fresh and clear. I&#x27;m glad I bought it and I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> I just ordered two more of the same foundations. I like full coverage, so if you&#x27;re looking for a thin, light foundation this isn&#x27;t for you. Pretty great match, too, and i have a hard time finding good matches for my pale skin.</li>
            <li> Very nice product as it goes on smooth with light to medium coverage.  Called porcelain but is actually 1 step darker.  I have very fair porcelain skin and this looks beige on me.</li>
            <li> Love this foundation! I have a medium beige skin color. I usually buy nude or creamy natural (depending on the brand). I bought porcelain since I read a review that this color is darker than typical porcelain foundations. And it&#x27;s true!!! This color porcelain is more like a nude color. Goes on lightweight, very even! I bought the mineral infused elf primer and a foundation brush with this. The combo is unbeatable!!! And the price is nice!</li>
            <li> I tried this product alone for awhile and found that it was heavy and doesn&#x27;t stay on very well all day. I do get a few small blemishes from time to time when I used it. It was noticeable on so again, heavy. It was a medium coverage as far as coving dark spots and/or blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now mix it with Aveeno Tinted Moisturizer or Aveeno BB Cream depending on what I have on hand and I find it to be a better formula for me. It gives a decent but smoother coverage that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend setting this product with powder or using a good primer to get all day coverage.</li>
            <li> I asked this for my wife.  4 different e.l.f. Studio flawless finish foundation, I recibed 3 e.l.f. Studio flawless finish foundation and 1 e.l.f. Studio Mineral Infused Face Primer, so one of the was incorrect.&lt;br /&gt;The product is good, just one of them was the incorrect one, I live far away so it was difficult to return it.&lt;br /&gt;So in general in good just make shure you get the right things.</li>
            <li> Worth trying....it is so hard to find a foundation that is the correct color.  We have all spent so much money trying different brands and different colors but don&#x27;t let the price fool you, this foundation is just as good as the more expensive brands. I have spent $40 on foundation only to end up mixing it with another color or just giving up and throwing it in the trash....so I was really happy when I discovered e.l.f. and it actually was a close match to my skin tone.  Maybe it won&#x27;t work for you but it is not expensive and it might just be the one!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorites.  It is light feeling and easy to apply.  It will wear off at the end of the day so if going from work to another event, may possibly need to reapply.</li>
            <li> It works well but they need more colors cause the one i have is not right and non of the other ones are ether. over all good product but need more colors:)!!!...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 69 now, but ever since I turned 50 most makeup sits inside my pores - visibly. Not this one. The only problem is that the makeup doesn&#x27;t glide over my skin, unless I use their primer. Then it&#x27;s wonderful! My sister is using it now, too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item a few years ago and used the whole bottle without incident..  I purchased 4 more bottles and 1/2 way through the first one, had a terrible allergic reaction.  Had to use Benadryl to clear it up...  It was awful, itching, red, swollen face...&lt;br /&gt;I loved this product.  Easy to use, great finish... but after that allergic reaction, No way will I try it again....</li>
            <li> I love all ELF products. This is a great foundation for an even better price. I&#x27;ve recently switched all of my cosmetics to cruelty free products only and ELF has been a big help with their affordability. I recommend this to anyone in need of a great foundation!</li>
            <li> It has good coverage and it&#x27;s easy to blend. Not oily at all and gives a nice semi-matte finish. I find you can either set it with a powder for a completely matte look, but leaving it as is works well too! And for the price, it&#x27;s a great quality product.</li>
            <li> Okay, so porcelain usually is very very extremely pale, and the pictures of this product shows it being just that. but when I received this, it was much darker. I am very very pale, like almost white, and I don&#x27;t mean just pale, I mean super pale. I thought this was the product for me but I guess I wasted my money. it makes me look several shades darker, it is a light color, but its like the color of someone having a tan, its not for me. I wish I could get my money back.... ughh...</li>
