            <li>Great product at great price</li>
            <li>smells great.</li>
            <li>My sister-in-law loved getting this for her birthday</li>
            <li>Gift for my sister and she loved it</li>
            <li>My wife loved this, she uses it each night.</li>
            <li>This item makes for a good gift for any occasion.</li>
            <li>But made a good Christmas gift.</li>
            <li>Bought this as a gift for my Mom, She loved it and the smell is exceptional.</li>
            <li>I sent it as a gift, and they really liked it!&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just nice.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how she liked it.  </li>
            <li>I WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF AT BATH AND BODY WORKS FOR THE PRICE.  </li>
            <li>The picture makes it look like a fairly nice Christmas gift, but when it arrived it just looks cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to purchase seomthing more as not to be embarrassed when I give this as a gift.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the purchase when I examined it before wrapping it.</li>
            <li>A great last minute Christmas gift and my sis was well pleased.</li>
            <li>The bar soap looks fine, but I would be embarrassed to give this as a gift.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaply made, and it&#x27;s quite a hassle to take out of the box.</li>
            <li>let me know that the body wash s really smooth and does not stick like liquid soaps.</li>
            <li>The box is flimsy, there are &#x27;Made in China&#x27; stickers everywhere, and the labels on the bottles look cheap, as does the lotion/gel inside.</li>
            <li>Luckily it&#x27;s just a filler gift because it would not serve as anything else without looking cheap.</li>
            <li>It is a very beautiful gift and the price is low, some like these wil be important for the next december.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s got a good scent and is very soothing in the bathtub.</li>
            <li>HAD TO ADD MORE TO MY CHRISTMAS PRESENT.</li>
            <li>Would rather see it in person first.</li>
            <li>The little box it came in is nice, but the actual bottles look really cheap.</li>
            <li>Am sending it back today, and I found a much better quality gift for the same price!</li>
            <li>I got the for my very busy aunt.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look very sophisticated and the lotion is very thin.</li>

            <li> Wasn&#x27;t want I was expecting for what I spent.</li>
            <li> Ended up using the entire bottle of bath bubble gel because it created hardly any bubbles.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> She needs a little relaxation.</li>
            <li> This is ridiculously small.</li>
            <li> THIS WAS VERY VERY VERY SMALL.  </li>
            <li> It smells worse than what you would get in a motel bathroom.</li>
            <li> You can smell the product without opening it, and the smell is artificial and unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Would be embarrassed to just give this as a Christmas gift , which is what I bought it for, had to buy something else to go with it , :(</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this purchase.</li>
