            <li>eyeliner is really good</li>

            <li>easy and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Wonderful thank you very much</li>
            <li>Now, I use 2-3 coats to get my preferred look and am enjoying the compliments!  </li>

            <li>It does what it promises, and amazingly so.</li>
            <li>just was amazing</li>
            <li>One of the best pencils &amp; the Mascara makes my lashes look so much fuller.</li>
            <li>It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and it was nice having the additional products included in the price.  </li>
            <li>and it really is the best out there.</li>
            <li>Beautiful full lashes are proposed with this mascara.</li>
            <li>Sure glad I did!</li>
            <li>Great mascara n eyeliner, fast ship!</li>
            <li>I love loreal voluminous mascara</li>
            <li>, only wish it was waterproof, but it&#x27;s still great!</li>
            <li>I love all of it.</li>
            <li>The color pay off is outstanding.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS MASCARA.</li>
            <li>I use another maybelline mascara that does a much better job than this.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but I love the eyeliner</li>
            <li>I love the eyeliner pencil that comes with it and sharpener.  </li>
            <li>I love this brand of mascara.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and great price</li>
            <li>, the eyeliner is just ok,  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li>LOVE this mascara, will likely never change :D</li>
            <li>The eyeliner is awesome especially if using it on your waterline.</li>
            <li>my husband says  my eyes just stand out so much more</li>
            <li>however, if you simply do more than 3 layers it looks too clumpy and overdone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it two starts since the eyeliner is actually pretty good.</li>
            <li>Best way I can describe it is if anyone remembers letting elders glue dry on their skin when they were a kid.</li>
            <li>I had my makeup done for a very special picture and</li>
            <li>I loved it so much I purchased some for my Mom.</li>
            <li>Willy buy again each easy to put on</li>
            <li>It temporarily removed fine lines, wrinkles &amp; crowd feet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many mascaras and bold pencils and this accomplishes what I want when creating a smokey look.</li>
            <li>However, if you&#x27;re experienced with pencil eyeliners and are looking to try one of the new &amp;#34;false fiber&amp;#34; mascaras, it may be worth giving this a try.  </li>
            <li>However, if you&#x27;re experienced with pencil eyeliners and are looking to try one of the new &amp;#34;false fiber&amp;#34; mascaras, it may be worth giving this a try.  </li>
            <li>The mascara doesn&#x27;t apply smoothly and just clumps on the brush.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smoothly, helps me with my cat eye as well.</li>
            <li>Eyeliner in perfect condition, mascara on the other hand came clumpy as I opened for the very first use.</li>
            <li>Clear might even be a good option.</li>
            <li>Not too excited about that, but the eyeliner makes up for it as it goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>The eyeliner is fine, but nothing special.  </li>
            <li>Make up was brand new in packaging, works great and not dried out!</li>
            <li>I mostly bought this for the eyeliner, but I really like the mascara, too.</li>
            <li>It lengthens but not like true fiber lashes.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, I am a mascara freak, very very picky , works great as expected,  definitely a great buy, comes off easy when ready to wash face, don&#x27;t spend money on expensive ones</li>
            <li>This mascara was super died out and clumpy immediately out of the package.</li>
            <li>Chunky but great because it goes on thick and makes my eyes pop more dramatically.</li>
            <li>It went on smoothly, separating my lashes without clumping, and noticeably lengthened them with the first coat.</li>
            <li>I normally only use liquid liner since I like to do a really smooth cat eye most of the time, but I would consider using this to do a cat eye since it is THAT smooth.</li>
            <li>This really clumps on the lashes instead of smoothly creating longer lashes.  </li>
            <li>Love it fast shipping thanks</li>
            <li>Love the eyeliner - goes on easily - is soft, and stays well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth twice the money.</li>
            <li>I rarely use.</li>
            <li>so make sure you take it off at night and start clean the next day.</li>
            <li>The eyeliner looks all right when on.</li>
            <li>and everybody said that the mascara came right out</li>
            <li>The pencil is nice, smooth and dark.  </li>
            <li>the eyeliner lasts a long time and is amazing.</li>
            <li>the end, this product has a fairly even mix of advantages and disadvantages, maybe slightly tilted towards advantages.</li>
            <li>I like it, its very cheap on amazon, in my country (Republic of Georgia) it costs nearly 17$ only mascara, and the quality is the same.&lt;br /&gt;perfect</li>
            <li>its more like regular mascara!!</li>
            <li>Higher quality than many similar products in higher price ranges.  </li>
            <li>Really like this mascara!</li>
            <li>You use it just like regular mascara on top and bottom lashes and BOOM...</li>
            <li>I put mascara on first and then apply on one eye at a time.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what it claims.</li>
            <li>Love this, it&#x27;s different than I am use too.  </li>
            <li>It is ultimately your decision, I understand finances are always an important factor, I just believe women need to know there are options out there for them!</li>
            <li>I am smiling with my eyes thanks to #Younique 3d mascara!  </li>
            <li>when I first saw this product I looked at all the reviews</li>
            <li>it was perfect there is nothing wrong</li>
            <li>I tried the island for the first time</li>
            <li>However, after having tried some competing products, my opinion of this is a little more favorable than when I originally posted this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I love long eyelashes.</li>
            <li>not really a make up person , but love a good eyeliner, stays on forever, very long lasting, worth every penny</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I was very satisfied :)</li>
            <li>and it made my lashes very full and long.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It really works well, no clumps</li>
            <li>This product dries fast and does not flake.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not looking for a blendable/smudgeable eyeliner, and prefer straight lines, this might work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really like the eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li>Finally found a lengthening mascara that looks great with little effort!  </li>
            <li>I live in a hot area and my eyes are older</li>
            <li>It also flakes very easily leaving bits of dried mascara under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I do worry that a fair amount of the actual eyeliner is wasted because it&#x27;s a thicker pencil and a lot of the product gets removed when the pencil is sharpened.</li>
            <li>I actually purchased this for the eyeliner, but decide to try this because it was only a dollar more and let me say i was impressedd when I tried on the mascara.  </li>
            <li>A couple coats of this, and I have thick, long beautiful lashes</li>
            <li>The sharpener was a nice bonus, and it seems easy enough to keep the longer shape of the liner, which is an advantage - the long, narrow tip helps make a smooth long line.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Love the makes you eyelashes look long and last and does not smear.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t like the False Fiber Mascara, but LOVED the Eye Liner</li>
            <li>Bought it because I needed a new mascara,  mine was drying out.</li>
            <li>Really good it just lasted less than my other ones.</li>
            <li>I have very short, straight lashes that really don&#x27;t hold a curl.</li>
            <li>Wow, wow, wow!!!  </li>
            <li>As a professional makeup artist I have tried everything!</li>
            <li>Disappointed and will stick with the more popular fiber lash brand</li>
            <li>Very few clumps, despite having fibres of some kind mixed in.  </li>
            <li>The mascara - almost seemed old and gloppy - not for me.  </li>
            <li>but I am now completely sold on this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Color/appearance: The color of both products is a nice, dark black.</li>
            <li>the order I received was dry and clumped when it was first opened.</li>
            <li>This product is no better than cheap mascara from wal-mart.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had one time where the mascara has bled under my eyes, and that was after a very humid day here in Florida, and after a brief rain storm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about is the sharpener, which I really had to use on the pencil since it is a very thick size (about 3 times thicker than a normal pencil).</li>
            <li>I generally apply 2 coats.</li>
            <li>When I try to apply it it seems like it barely goes on.  </li>
            <li>I actually received it a day early.</li>
            <li>The mascara was a new kinda of mascara for me, I already have long lashes</li>
            <li>Not as dramatic as other more expensive brands of fiber lash mascara but a wonderful everyday one</li>
            <li>even bigger, barely flakes and</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Chunky but great because it goes on thick and makes my eyes pop more dramatically.</li>
            <li> It went on smoothly, separating my lashes without clumping, and noticeably lengthened them with the first coat.</li>
            <li> I normally only use liquid liner since I like to do a really smooth cat eye most of the time, but I would consider using this to do a cat eye since it is THAT smooth.</li>
            <li> This really clumps on the lashes instead of smoothly creating longer lashes.  </li>
            <li> Love it fast shipping thanks</li>
            <li> Love the eyeliner - goes on easily - is soft, and stays well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth twice the money.</li>
            <li> I rarely use.</li>
            <li> so make sure you take it off at night and start clean the next day.</li>
            <li> The eyeliner looks all right when on.</li>
            <li> and everybody said that the mascara came right out</li>
            <li> The pencil is nice, smooth and dark.  </li>
            <li> the eyeliner lasts a long time and is amazing.</li>
            <li> the end, this product has a fairly even mix of advantages and disadvantages, maybe slightly tilted towards advantages.</li>
            <li> I like it, its very cheap on amazon, in my country (Republic of Georgia) it costs nearly 17$ only mascara, and the quality is the same.&lt;br /&gt;perfect</li>
            <li> its more like regular mascara!!</li>
            <li> Higher quality than many similar products in higher price ranges.  </li>
            <li> Really like this mascara!</li>
            <li> You use it just like regular mascara on top and bottom lashes and BOOM...</li>
            <li> I put mascara on first and then apply on one eye at a time.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what it claims.</li>
            <li> Love this, it&#x27;s different than I am use too.  </li>
            <li> It is ultimately your decision, I understand finances are always an important factor, I just believe women need to know there are options out there for them!</li>
            <li> I am smiling with my eyes thanks to #Younique 3d mascara!  </li>
            <li> when I first saw this product I looked at all the reviews</li>
            <li> it was perfect there is nothing wrong</li>
            <li> I tried the island for the first time</li>
            <li> However, after having tried some competing products, my opinion of this is a little more favorable than when I originally posted this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I love long eyelashes.</li>
            <li> not really a make up person , but love a good eyeliner, stays on forever, very long lasting, worth every penny</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was very satisfied :)</li>
            <li> and it made my lashes very full and long.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It really works well, no clumps</li>
            <li> This product dries fast and does not flake.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not looking for a blendable/smudgeable eyeliner, and prefer straight lines, this might work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really like the eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li> Finally found a lengthening mascara that looks great with little effort!  </li>
            <li> I live in a hot area and my eyes are older</li>
            <li> It also flakes very easily leaving bits of dried mascara under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I do worry that a fair amount of the actual eyeliner is wasted because it&#x27;s a thicker pencil and a lot of the product gets removed when the pencil is sharpened.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this for the eyeliner, but decide to try this because it was only a dollar more and let me say i was impressedd when I tried on the mascara.  </li>
            <li> A couple coats of this, and I have thick, long beautiful lashes</li>
            <li> The sharpener was a nice bonus, and it seems easy enough to keep the longer shape of the liner, which is an advantage - the long, narrow tip helps make a smooth long line.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love the makes you eyelashes look long and last and does not smear.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the False Fiber Mascara, but LOVED the Eye Liner</li>
            <li> Bought it because I needed a new mascara,  mine was drying out.</li>
            <li> Really good it just lasted less than my other ones.</li>
            <li> I have very short, straight lashes that really don&#x27;t hold a curl.</li>
            <li> Wow, wow, wow!!!  </li>
            <li> As a professional makeup artist I have tried everything!</li>
            <li> Disappointed and will stick with the more popular fiber lash brand</li>
            <li> Very few clumps, despite having fibres of some kind mixed in.  </li>
            <li> The mascara - almost seemed old and gloppy - not for me.  </li>
            <li> but I am now completely sold on this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Color/appearance: The color of both products is a nice, dark black.</li>
            <li> the order I received was dry and clumped when it was first opened.</li>
            <li> This product is no better than cheap mascara from wal-mart.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had one time where the mascara has bled under my eyes, and that was after a very humid day here in Florida, and after a brief rain storm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about is the sharpener, which I really had to use on the pencil since it is a very thick size (about 3 times thicker than a normal pencil).</li>
            <li> I generally apply 2 coats.</li>
            <li> When I try to apply it it seems like it barely goes on.  </li>
            <li> I actually received it a day early.</li>
            <li> The mascara was a new kinda of mascara for me, I already have long lashes</li>
            <li> Not as dramatic as other more expensive brands of fiber lash mascara but a wonderful everyday one</li>
            <li> even bigger, barely flakes and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Application: The mascara is easy to apply but did clump a little bit on the second day; well into my second week of using it, very few days go by when I don&#x27;t experience clumps.</li>
            <li> eyeliner was good mascara was dry, like its a few months old already :(</li>
            <li> The mascara is old and almost completely dried up.</li>
            <li> the fiber lash comparison is overstated by a long shot.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t dry it out</li>
            <li> Not sure if item is old or is suppose to be like this.</li>
            <li> any rate, my feelings about this product are a little bit mixed.  </li>
            <li> Before I spent a lot of money on other &amp;#34;fiber&amp;#34; lash products, I decided to try this one.  </li>
            <li> I havee very short lashes and this mascara makes them look so long someone actually asked me if I was wearing false lashes.</li>
            <li> It gives your skin a slight glossy look when product is dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely clumpy.</li>
            <li> It works well with other mascara....</li>
            <li> I did not write this review to just put this brand down and get you to like something else.</li>
            <li> I was extremely skeptical about this product (from some prior reviews); therefore,I had low expectations.  </li>
            <li> I bought this kit because it contained both a mascara and an eyeliner; I chose black because I have (dyed) black hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m less enthused about the eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m less enthused about the eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I previously bought this eyeliner at Walmart and ended up losing it.</li>
            <li> The skin gets kinda tight.</li>
            <li> - Thank you SO much for thinking of me!!&amp;#34; When using this product, I generally use a very thin base coat of waterproof or a decent quality mascara.</li>
            <li> A little concealer hides the shine.</li>
            <li> and I got a little bit worried I&#x27;m not going to lie</li>
            <li> I have fine, short and boring lashes.</li>
            <li> but this one dried out faster than the one I had.</li>
            <li> The mascara seems dried out.  </li>
            <li> Flaked off onto face in just a few hours.</li>
            <li> Can me shipped to me all dried out and looked used.</li>
            <li> Was completely dried out-</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I usually use two-three coats.  </li>
            <li> I would not say that rivals the two step process of other false lash mascaras.  </li>
            <li> While I think the eyeliner pencil is easier to handle because it&#x27;s thick, it&#x27;s difficult to smudge the eyeliner to create different looks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m doing something wrong, but these don&#x27;t get my lashes long at all.</li>
            <li> Not thrilled.  </li>
            <li> Made my lashes really thick and longer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be looking for another fiber mascara, though. :(</li>
            <li> but YOUR item came in DRY  :(</li>
            <li> The mascara does extend the length of my eyelashes in a noticeable and dramatic manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then once the base coat is dry, I use the fiber mascara by &amp;#34;vibrating&amp;#34; the brush back-and-forth as I pull the wand through my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I have skimpy lashes and this product is a game changer!</li>
            <li> Looks like I&#x27;m wearing false lashes!</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> The brush is horrible.</li>

            <li> Made my lashes really thick and longer</li>
            <li> Love it makes my eyelashs look great and arrived a day early which makes it even better!!!!</li>
            <li> Bought it because I needed a new mascara,  mine was drying out. I love loreal voluminous mascara but this one dried out faster than the one I had. Selling out of date products online is perfect for con artists.  Never again.</li>
            <li> I like it, its very cheap on amazon, in my country (Republic of Georgia) it costs nearly 17$ only mascara, and the quality is the same.&lt;br /&gt;perfect price an quality</li>
            <li> I like the eyeliner..... but not noticing any difference in the length or fullness with the fiber lashes... its more like regular mascara!!</li>
            <li> Love it fast shipping thanks</li>
            <li> This mascara was super died out and clumpy immediately out of the package. I looked like I had tarantula eyes. Yuck!!!</li>
            <li> I was surprisingly impressed with this product. When I opened up the mascara I was worried as it looked clumpy on the brush. Don&#x27;t judge a book.... This stuff is great! I didn&#x27;t want to spend the $30+ on the younique fiberlash so I figured I&#x27;d try this out as an alternative. Sure glad I did!</li>
            <li> not really a make up person , but love a good eyeliner, stays on forever, very long lasting, worth every penny</li>
            <li> The eye liner was great! The mascara, however, I did not see any difference from this mascara and a regular mascara, there was no volume added.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara, great price, since trying it I will only use this brand. I didn&#x27;t need the eyeliner pencil but it&#x27;s a plus with the mascara.</li>
            <li> Love the eyeliner - goes on easily - is soft, and stays well.  The mascara - almost seemed old and gloppy - not for me.  Will stick with the eyeliner!</li>
            <li> Great product, excellent price.  Higher quality than many similar products in higher price ranges.  I&#x27;ve tried many mascaras and bold pencils and this accomplishes what I want when creating a smokey look.</li>
            <li> Really like this mascara! Lashes look great, only wish it was waterproof, but it&#x27;s still great! Great price for this product!</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!!! One of the best pencils &amp; the Mascara makes my lashes look so much fuller. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I love all of it. The mascara, the eyeliner and the sharpener. It makes my eyes look even bigger, barely flakes and the eyeliner lasts a long time and is amazing. The color pay off is outstanding. Shipping was great also.</li>
            <li> I have skimpy lashes and this product is a game changer! You use it just like regular mascara on top and bottom lashes and BOOM...easy and beautiful.</li>
            <li> makes your lashes thicker but not longer. It also makes your lashes clump together-</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS MASCARA. It really works well, no clumps and it made my lashes very full and long. Not as dramatic as other more expensive brands of fiber lash mascara but a wonderful everyday one and if I do more coats its perfect for a night out.</li>
            <li> I was extremely skeptical about this product (from some prior reviews); therefore,I had low expectations.  However; upon using this product, I realized it is remarkable.  I put mascara on first and then apply on one eye at a time.  I usually use two-three coats.  This product dries fast and does not flake.  I live in a hot area and my eyes are older (50) so I have oily area by my eyes and yet this product does not run either.  I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit because it contained both a mascara and an eyeliner; I chose black because I have (dyed) black hair (I&#x27;ve read that blondes should choose browns instead of blacks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, my feelings about this product are a little bit mixed.  However, after having tried some competing products, my opinion of this is a little more favorable than when I originally posted this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color/appearance: The color of both products is a nice, dark black. The eyeliner looks all right when on. The mascara does extend the length of my eyelashes in a noticeable and dramatic manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Staying power/removal: Both the eyeliner and the mascara stay on all day without smudging or coming off. However, when it IS time to remove them, several different eye makeup removers have worked (as did washing my face with Cetaphil when I forgot to remove the eye makeup first).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Size: The mascara appears to be a full-size product. The eyeliner, however, appears to come in a shorter pencil than if it was bought alone (I checked some of them out in a local Walgreens). I do worry that a fair amount of the actual eyeliner is wasted because it&#x27;s a thicker pencil and a lot of the product gets removed when the pencil is sharpened. (Note: this package does include a sharpener.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application: The mascara is easy to apply but did clump a little bit on the second day; well into my second week of using it, very few days go by when I don&#x27;t experience clumps. Wiping the wand on the edge of the container to remove extra material does seem to help. While I think the eyeliner pencil is easier to handle because it&#x27;s thick, it&#x27;s difficult to smudge the eyeliner to create different looks.  If you&#x27;re not looking for a blendable/smudgeable eyeliner, and prefer straight lines, this might work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, this product has a fairly even mix of advantages and disadvantages, maybe slightly tilted towards advantages. I&#x27;d be open to considering the mascara again, alone, after trying some of the competing products. I&#x27;m less enthused about the eyeliner. However, if you&#x27;re experienced with pencil eyeliners and are looking to try one of the new &amp;#34;false fiber&amp;#34; mascaras, it may be worth giving this a try.  3.5 stars.the mascara again, alone, after trying some of the competing products.

            <li> Received today. The mascara is old and almost completely dried up.</li>
            <li> Finally found a lengthening mascara that looks great with little effort!  The eyeliner is fine, but nothing special.  However, the mascara is exceptional.  It went on smoothly, separating my lashes without clumping, and noticeably lengthened them with the first coat. Now, I use 2-3 coats to get my preferred look and am enjoying the compliments!  Before I spent a lot of money on other &amp;#34;fiber&amp;#34; lash products, I decided to try this one.  So happy that I did!!</li>
            <li> Really good it just lasted less than my other ones. Still good while it lasted.  I would buy again eyeliner is really good</li>
            <li> I have very short, straight lashes that really don&#x27;t hold a curl. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m doing something wrong, but these don&#x27;t get my lashes long at all. I use another maybelline mascara that does a much better job than this. I&#x27;m giving it two starts since the eyeliner is actually pretty good. I normally only use liquid liner since I like to do a really smooth cat eye most of the time, but I would consider using this to do a cat eye since it is THAT smooth. I&#x27;ll definitely be looking for another fiber mascara, though. :(</li>
            <li> Wow, wow, wow!!!  I was a skeptic but I am now completely sold on this product. It does exactly what it claims. It temporarily removed fine lines, wrinkles &amp; crowd feet. It gives your skin a slight glossy look when product is dry. Best way I can describe it is if anyone remembers letting elders glue dry on their skin when they were a kid. The skin gets kinda tight. I love it. A little concealer hides the shine. Will continue to buy!!</li>
            <li> Great product for the price!</li>
            <li> It may have been good....but YOUR item came in DRY  :(</li>
            <li> Great price for the combo of mascara and eyeliner.  Make up was brand new in packaging, works great and not dried out!</li>
            <li> Gorgeous, i love it , nice color, its so beautiful  and cute, so great. and good quality (Hermoso ,el color es exacto al de la foto lo recomiendo)</li>
            <li> Awesome - It extended my lashes longer than they ever have been!</li>
            <li> I mostly bought this for the eyeliner, but I really like the mascara, too. The sharpener was a nice bonus, and it seems easy enough to keep the longer shape of the liner, which is an advantage - the long, narrow tip helps make a smooth long line. I will buy this again before they sell out. It&#x27;s worth twice the money.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the False Fiber Mascara, but LOVED the Eye Liner</li>
            <li> Flaked off onto face in just a few hours. Disappointed and will stick with the more popular fiber lash brand</li>
            <li> I did not like the mascara at all but I love the eyeliner</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and it was nice having the additional products included in the price.  I wasn&#x27;t wowed, but my lashes looked good.</li>
            <li> Love this, it&#x27;s different than I am use too.  It works!  I love the eyeliner pencil that comes with it and sharpener.  Great value!</li>
            <li> I had my makeup done for a very special picture and&lt;br /&gt;the makeup artist chose this kit to put on me.</li>
            <li> It lengthens but not like true fiber lashes.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this for the eyeliner, but decide to try this because it was only a dollar more and let me say i was impressedd when I tried on the mascara.  I havee very short lashes and this mascara makes them look so long someone actually asked me if I was wearing false lashes.</li>
            <li> Not thrilled.  This really clumps on the lashes instead of smoothly creating longer lashes.  It also flakes very easily leaving bits of dried mascara under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Best mascara I&#x27;ve used. I put on about 3 coats. Looks like I&#x27;m wearing false lashes! Lasts all day and night.</li>
            <li> Terrible. Can me shipped to me all dried out and looked used.</li>
            <li> Great mascara.  Very few clumps, despite having fibres of some kind mixed in.  The pencil is nice, smooth and dark.  The only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about is the sharpener, which I really had to use on the pencil since it is a very thick size (about 3 times thicker than a normal pencil).</li>
            <li> Really like the eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li> On time and what I wanted, very happy.</li>
            <li> Does give the illusion of longer eyelashes. It can build up over time so make sure you take it off at night and start clean the next day. he pencil I rarely use. I don&#x27;t wear makeup but I love long eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I love this brand of mascara. It adds a fullness to my eyelashes. It&#x27;s like adding lash extensions without all the money and time involved.</li>
            <li> Was completely dried out-</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need fakes with these -</li>
            <li> As a professional makeup artist I have tried everything! But all of these brands claiming to be &amp;#34;Fiber Mascara&amp;#34; are all knock offs to Younique Cosmetics which is the company who founded this idea. I have been using it for quite a while and it really is the best out there. Yes, it is more expensive than this brand but I believe you do get what you pay for. Its just a thought. Here is the link to my rep webpage https://www.youniqueproducts.com/fastlash/party/904163/view. I have worked with her for some time and I know she would be happy to answer any questions you may have. I did not write this review to just put this brand down and get you to like something else. It is ultimately your decision, I understand finances are always an important factor, I just believe women need to know there are options out there for them!</li>
            <li> eyeliner was good mascara was dry, like its a few months old already :(</li>
            <li> Good product, but I would not say that rivals the two step process of other false lash mascaras.  I do however like the oversized pencil liner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great mascara and it does the job of a great mascara now the fiber lash comparison is overstated by a long shot. It&#x27;s not a fiber 3D mascara by any means and it does not achieve the same look at all. So for the value of an eyeliner and mascara it&#x27;s great but don&#x27;t be fooled. BTW the eyeliner is wonderful and worth buying alone if sold that way.</li>
            <li> This product is no better than cheap mascara from wal-mart. The mascara doesn&#x27;t apply smoothly and just clumps on the brush.</li>
            <li> Beautiful full lashes are proposed with this mascara. No smudging or clumping.</li>
            <li> Wonderful thank you very much</li>
            <li> Great mascara n eyeliner, fast ship!</li>
            <li> Eyeliner in perfect condition, mascara on the other hand came clumpy as I opened for the very first use. Not too excited about that, but the eyeliner makes up for it as it goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> I am smiling with my eyes thanks to #Younique 3d mascara!  Look at my pout: #Luxe #Lucrative gloss&lt;br /&gt;Order yours today&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great price</li>
            <li> I am a makeup junkie. I loved this mascara. A couple coats of this, and I have thick, long beautiful lashes, the eyeliner is just ok,  but I bought the product for the mascara anyway.</li>
            <li> What an awesome product. It does what it promises, and amazingly so. I have fine, short and boring lashes. I loved it so much I purchased some for my Mom. Her comments: &amp;#34;Wow, this is great! It has given me lashes I haven&#x27;t seen in twenty years - Thank you SO much for thinking of me!!&amp;#34; When using this product, I generally use a very thin base coat of waterproof or a decent quality mascara. Clear might even be a good option. The goal for me is to not have &amp;#34;spider eyes&amp;#34;. Then once the base coat is dry, I use the fiber mascara by &amp;#34;vibrating&amp;#34; the brush back-and-forth as I pull the wand through my eyelashes. This helps separate them for me. I generally apply 2 coats. I&#x27;ve only had one time where the mascara has bled under my eyes, and that was after a very humid day here in Florida, and after a brief rain storm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, I am a mascara freak, very very picky , works great as expected,  definitely a great buy, comes off easy when ready to wash face, don&#x27;t spend money on expensive ones this does the job</li>
            <li> I like both the liner and mascara but when I put the line in my water line it ends up under my eyes within a hour</li>
            <li> I actually received it a day early. I previously bought this eyeliner at Walmart and ended up losing it. It&#x27;s my favorite eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever purchased. It goes on so smoothly, helps me with my cat eye as well. The mascara was a new kinda of mascara for me, I already have long lashes so this made them look gorgeous. Needless to say, I was very satisfied :)</li>
            <li> the order I received was dry and clumped when it was first opened. I think it must have been an old/expired one.</li>
            <li> Love the makes you eyelashes look long and last and does not smear. Willy buy again each easy to put on</li>
            <li> LOVE this mascara, will likely never change :D</li>
            <li> The eyeliner is awesome especially if using it on your waterline. The mascara is great. Chunky but great because it goes on thick and makes my eyes pop more dramatically. Great for a smokey look.</li>
            <li> This stuff is about the same quality as a dollar store brand. It&#x27;s extremely clumpy. The brush is horrible. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> when I first saw this product I looked at all the reviews and everybody said that the mascara came right out and I got a little bit worried I&#x27;m not going to lie but when I got mine today I looked at it and it was perfect there is nothing wrong it wasn&#x27;t dry it out the eyeliner was perfect everything just was amazing I tried the island for the first time today my eyelashes look longer they look beautiful my husband says  my eyes just stand out so much more I&#x27;m happy as can be you this product will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> Loved this product!! Works great for a great price.</li>
            <li> It works well with other mascara....however, if you simply do more than 3 layers it looks too clumpy and overdone.</li>
            <li> This product does not work. It&#x27;s just like regular mascara NO noticeable fibers to extend lashes.</li>
