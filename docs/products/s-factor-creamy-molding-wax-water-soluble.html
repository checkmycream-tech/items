            <li>I love love love this product.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s fast to style, stays looking great all day and smells of watermelon.</li>
            <li>Love Love Love me some Creamy Molding Wax..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for handstyling short hair (around 1&amp;#34; to 3&amp;#34;), but be sure to check that the product is good as soon as it arrives.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to style with.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the way it helps my&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used it on my hair damp and dry and it worked great both ways.</li>
            <li>Even on straight hair, when I flat iron mine, it works great to get those tiny fly aways.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s pliable, I can re work it all day, has a great scent , and is overall a great product, just not my everyday go to.</li>
            <li>My hair is even still in good shape when I wake up the next day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy and appreciate a product I can put on quickly in the morning and lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li>When this arrived the lid was not on good and it was very very  DRY.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for a bed head or a matte  neat messy look</li>
            <li>I use a fingertip&#x27;s worth, rub it around in my palms, and then run through.  </li>
            <li>I want it to go) to give it a little more weight, then I put some more in my hair to put hold and style it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many a product in an attempt to keep my hair styled in such a way that I don&#x27;t have wisps of hair waving about if it gets too humid.  </li>
            <li>So the first thing I did was tear the ball of it&#x27;s plastic platform and throw it into the trash.  </li>
            <li>pretty greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My friend first introduced me to it while she was in school to be a hairstylist</li>
            <li>, it has a good shine, it does not weigh my hair down ( which was the most important feature) and it isn&#x27;t sticky or stiff.</li>
            <li>I look ok going out the door but within an hour, my hair is flat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure it does have actual glue in it though because I&#x27;ll wash my hands after I&#x27;m done applying it to my hair, and my hands are still really sticky afterwards.&lt;br</li>
            <li>BTW, if anyone else is having this problem via Prime, please report it to Amazon as we&#x27;ve been told they are trying to determine if this is an issue with stock coming from a certain fulfillment warehouse.</li>
            <li>I usually get a chemical relaxer on that part of my hair because no product helped to smooth it good enough.</li>
            <li>It adds that extra control and frizz free curl.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of creams to manage my hair, but most leave it greasy or wet looking.</li>
            <li>was something I could use to style my hair the way I want it and hold it that way for most of the day without looking wet or greasy</li>
            <li>Most waxes weigh my hair down within an hour or so.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it instead of this stuff.</li>
            <li>Seriously, only product I&#x27;m trusting right now.  </li>
            <li>For the price I paid, this is no better than most of the molding wax I have tried.</li>
            <li>I have thick hair that tends to lay very fine.</li>
            <li>Just make sure your hair is almost completely dry before you put it in... since it&#x27;s wax, wet hair will repel it and it won&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li>Great little product that gives medium to firm hold for my short hair.</li>
            <li>My hair feels natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a pixie haircut for over ten years, and due to my baby fine hair, have been trying products to give me volume ever since then.  </li>
            <li>It will last a long time if you use it right.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t put too much on, but if you do you can rub a dry towel over your hair a bit to take some out.</li>
            <li>Also, try not to get too much product near the roots of your hair because it&#x27;ll weigh it down.</li>
            <li>If your hair is not dry enough and the wax is not the correct consistency</li>
            <li>Enables ready restyling with just your hand, a brush, a little water or a combination of all three.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricy, but you don&#x27;t need much.</li>

            <li> Not quite as bad though.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed .</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have thick hair that tends to lay very fine. In other words, it can look like a helmet. This product holds well, it has a good shine, it does not weigh my hair down ( which was the most important feature) and it isn&#x27;t sticky or stiff. It gives my layers good separation. Most waxes weigh my hair down within an hour or so. I look ok going out the door but within an hour, my hair is flat. This is very different. It is expensive but you only have to use a little bit. I wish I had known about this product earlier. I would recommend it. Don&#x27;t let the price fool you. It will last a long time if you use it right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a pixie haircut for over ten years, and due to my baby fine hair, have been trying products to give me volume ever since then.  This wax beats out all the rest in regard to giving you maximum hold and plyability without giving you any grease or heavy strands.  I use a fingertip&#x27;s worth, rub it around in my palms, and then run through.  The wax gives me lift and the pieces stay in place all day, or I can move them around without reapplying.  I love love love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many a product in an attempt to keep my hair styled in such a way that I don&#x27;t have wisps of hair waving about if it gets too humid.  This product gave me that control without turning my hair into a helmet or plastering it onto my skull.  Less greasy than pomade or forming cream.  Enables ready restyling with just your hand, a brush, a little water or a combination of all three.  Seriously, only product I&#x27;m trusting right now.  I&#x27;m sticking with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but worth every penny. I put some in my hair when it&#x27;s wet and blow it dry (pushing my hair in the direction I want it to go) to give it a little more weight, then I put some more in my hair to put hold and style it. Works like nothing else.</li>
            <li> Great product. Delivered on time</li>
            <li> I have thinner hair and this product makes it look thicker.  I also like that it doesn&#x27;t give the wet gelled look.  It&#x27;s easy to style with.  Doesn&#x27;t leave residue in your hair and you can still move your hair around afterwards, it&#x27;s not in a firm position but it will keep the shape you put your hair in.  I&#x27;d suggest it for short to mid length hair (mens).</li>
            <li> Disappointed . When this arrived the lid was not on good and it was very very  DRY.</li>
            <li> I love this wax! Not much is needed to get effect you want. I use this for the front of my hair, where I have the most frizz. I usually get a chemical relaxer on that part of my hair because no product helped to smooth it good enough. But this one worked great! I used it on my hair damp and dry and it worked great both ways. Now I can save myself the harsh chemicals to straighten my frizz!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: another way to use this besides sleek styles and pieced hair styles is if you are wearing a curly ponytail, you can use a quarter size and rub in between palms and run over ponytail! It adds that extra control and frizz free curl. Even on straight hair, when I flat iron mine, it works great to get those tiny fly aways.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold well. If your hair is not dry enough and the wax is not the correct consistency it&#x27;s very easy to end up with wax bits in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally don&#x27;t have the patience for this product.</li>
            <li> We landed on this in a search for something similar to American Crew, but with less harmful additives. It&#x27;s perfect for handstyling short hair (around 1&amp;#34; to 3&amp;#34;), but be sure to check that the product is good as soon as it arrives. It is intended to be a thick, dense creamy consistency. Unfortunately, we&#x27;ve had to exchange at least 5 of these over the past year due to bad product -- some just too thick to rub through hair, but most had solidified and shrunk up inside the container.

            <li> Great little product that gives medium to firm hold for my short hair. I&#x27;m a guy and appreciate a product I can put on quickly in the morning and lasts throughout the day. Will need to lather a bit longer in the shower to shampoo this out fully. If I sleep in it accidentally, it breaks my face out. So just make sure to shampoo it out before you fall asleep. About a nickel-size portion is enough for my thick short hair to give it a very textured or sculpted look. Use your fingers to mold it, not a comb. Also, try not to get too much product near the roots of your hair because it&#x27;ll weigh it down. Instead, apply more to the tips by feathering your hands across your scalp. Yea...&amp;#34;feathering.&amp;#34; Not sure how else to describe it. Just don&#x27;t put too much on, but if you do you can rub a dry towel over your hair a bit to take some out.</li>
            <li> For the price I paid, this is no better than most of the molding wax I have tried. I will not purchase this again. Waste of money</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t use a lot of hair product. Love this molding wax. A little goes a long way. Only negative is, it tends to dry about 3/4 of the way.</li>
            <li> After all the reviews I read, I thought for sure this stuff would be great.  I went ahead and bought 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the packaging is obnoxious.  I have no idea what&#x27;s going on with this silver ball sitting on a plastic pyramid, but I couldn&#x27;t possibly take myself seriously with this sitting in my bathroom.  So the first thing I did was tear the ball of it&#x27;s plastic platform and throw it into the trash.  Now I have just a shiny metal ball, slightly less ridiculous looking for a male to have in his bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is incredibly sticky.  It&#x27;s similar to Got2BeGlue, the stuff they sell at Target for like $3 that we&#x27;ve all tried and immediately thrown away.  Not quite as bad though.  I&#x27;m pretty sure it does have actual glue in it though because I&#x27;ll wash my hands after I&#x27;m done applying it to my hair, and my hands are still really sticky afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does hold your hair in place, but it&#x27;s quite difficult to style your hair once you put it in.  It also leaves my hair looking pretty greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I did like was that it smells amazing.  Like some sort of fruity candy that I used to love as a kid, but I can&#x27;t quite place it.  Jolly Rancher maybe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I was looking for was something I could use to style my hair the way I want it and hold it that way for most of the day without looking wet or greasy like I just put LA Looks in it.  I already have another product that does this, but the smell is not very appealing.  Neuma &#x27;Styling Clay&#x27; is what it&#x27;s called.  Highly recommend it instead of this stuff. http://www.amazon.com/Neuma-Styling-Clay-1-8-oz/dp/B006NRBT7M/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1370361757&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;neuma+styling+clay</li>
            <li> I have a pixie cut and it gives me volume and texture without being too heavy. I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> This is THE best mens hair wax in the world. It&#x27;s fast to style, stays looking great all day and smells of watermelon. I can&#x27;t recommend S-Factor enough and I&#x27;m just scared of what happens when they change the formula or discontinue it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus at this price I ordered 5 of them and saved a fortune on retail. It&#x27;s less than my hairdresser pays at wholesale.</li>
            <li> I have really thick wavy hair, this product is soft,  and doesn&#x27;t have the hold I need. But that&#x27;s not to say it&#x27;s not good, it&#x27;s pliable, I can re work it all day, has a great scent , and is overall a great product, just not my everyday go to. It&#x27;s great for a bed head or a matte  neat messy look</li>
            <li> Love Love Love me some Creamy Molding Wax.. Good  Product..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used about 4 yrs, and will continue.. I enjoy the way it helps my&lt;br /&gt;hair look like, what i want..&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,</li>
            <li> I thought this would seperate the ends of my long hair during humid weather but it just felt heavy and dirty.  I do like it for my childrens short hair - they like a little spike but they don&#x27;t like their hair to be sticky and stiff.  This product gives the spike without the sticky.</li>
            <li> I have been using this wax for several years. I had always used gel and hair spray before, but those left my hair feeling crunchy. When I use this wax, it helps keep my hair in place without the crunch. My hair feels natural. Good product.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best hair product i&#x27;ve ever owned. My friend first introduced me to it while she was in school to be a hairstylist and it&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve used since. It smells great and holds forever... My hair is even still in good shape when I wake up the next day. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair look greasy at all. Just make sure your hair is almost completely dry before you put it in... since it&#x27;s wax, wet hair will repel it and it won&#x27;t work as well.</li>
