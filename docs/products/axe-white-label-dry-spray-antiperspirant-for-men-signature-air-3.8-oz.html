            <li>smells good,  works great</li>
            <li>Scent is strong and the best part, it&#x27;s not fruity.</li>
            <li>Does a good job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does smell good though.</li>

            <li>The bottle design is absolutely the best of the three.</li>
            <li>A nice pop-up button, with a twist can.</li>
            <li>The scents are &#x27;good&#x27; but they&#x27;re overwhelming in the quantities desired to get effectiveness out of this product.</li>
            <li>The Forest scent is nice but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Beware,  very strong scent.</li>
            <li>Very good product and really lasts.</li>
            <li>I liked the smell but its overwhelming</li>
            <li>I think it has a great smile and it keeps my arm pits smelling great for the whole day.</li>
            <li>While ur putting this on there is so many chemicals coming out</li>
            <li>They worked for the most part.</li>
            <li>My favorite stick based antiperspirant was Arm &amp; Hammer Men&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It seems to be more refined and comes out in a lighter, more controllable stream.</li>
            <li>Plus, a spray product is so much more convenient to use than those push-up tubes.  </li>
            <li>(And you get more thorough coverage.)  </li>
            <li>Although this one isn&#x27;t my favorite</li>
            <li>TO BUY MANY BECAUSE MY GRAND DAUGHTER ALSO LOVES  IT AND SHES 18 WHEN SHE VISITS</li>
            <li>Product quality is fine but it is very light weight so my son move it a lot</li>
            <li>This is my first time using a spray antiperspirant or deodorant and I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I wish they&#x27;d make the bottle a little more design-oriented, but it gets the job done the best of the three</li>
            <li>I wish they&#x27;d make the bottle a little more design-oriented, but it gets the job done the best of the three</li>
            <li>I prefer the Forest to the Night, but it&#x27;s like spraying an strong body spray on your armpits.</li>
            <li>My favorite scent from this brand is the &#x27;Cool Metal&#x27;</li>
            <li>The bottle design is nice, but I feel it could be improved to make it more clear whether the nozzle is locked or unlocked.&lt;br</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, all three products are worth buying but the Dove is clearly my favorite.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, all three products are worth buying but the Dove is clearly my favorite.</li>
            <li>Smells great, doesn&#x27;t last close to 48 hrs.</li>
            <li>I got this free from walmart.</li>
            <li>I will do better holding my breath next time I use it because the powdery nature seems to make it very easy to breath in and this can&#x27;t be healthy.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m pretty sure it works just fine.</li>
            <li>My husband was excited to try it</li>
            <li>The fragrance of AXE White is very pleasant, and doesn&#x27;t seem to be for any particular gender.  </li>
            <li>Thankfully, though, the removable plastic top does make it nice and obvious whether you&#x27;re about to spray or not.</li>
            <li>but Forest has a really clean scent to it</li>
            <li>This product is still worth buying because it smells great and works decently (especially when applied heavily), but I much prefer the Dove or Degree in preference, even though their canisters aren&#x27;t quite as beautiful!</li>
            <li>This product is still worth buying because it smells great and works decently (especially when applied heavily), but I much prefer the Dove or Degree in preference, even though their canisters aren&#x27;t quite as beautiful!</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a good product and will likely stick around</li>
            <li>The canister also has a cool design to expose and hide the spray nozzle.</li>
            <li>It comes out of the bottle nice and easily and does not spray tons of extra product into the air to be inhaled.</li>
            <li>A good body wash plus AXE White Label leaves you smelling and feeling clean, and that&#x27;s definitely worth the price tag.</li>
            <li>Like Axe fumigation which can work for other smells you need to cover up lol.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t as great as the other axe sprays</li>
            <li>As for the scent, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be much of one though what little there is can best be described as blah .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>Did a good job its first week but noticed my armpits were wet an hour in after spraying,  i still smelled fine and everything</li>
            <li>i still give it 5 stars because it does what it&#x27;s suppose to do with no disappointment.</li>
            <li>First, the good: the spray does go on dry as promised.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s not too overpowering if you use it right.</li>
            <li>Last,  its a cool bottle with a twist up top thingy.</li>
            <li>I was using the arrid ultra fresh for a few months, it smells good and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t have much luck with this acting as an effective antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>This is a nice innovation in antiperspirants -- it goes on DRY.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear and easy.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite for several reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>although I&#x27;ve tried most of the scents from the entire product line and they&#x27;re all good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the most innovative of the three bottle designs, but unfortunately, that&#x27;s where most of this product&#x27;s shine wears off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m starting to like the product more.</li>
            <li>I have found that applying more of the deodarant helps the product last all day, consequently it means that I will use it quicker than anticipated.</li>
            <li>When I spray on the &amp;#34;smoke&amp;#34; it bounces off of my body and goes everywhere, makes my whole room cloudy, makes me choke up!</li>
            <li>I use this every day and i feel confident to go out on those hot days wearing axe white.</li>
            <li>I only wear axe deoderant and love all of their products.</li>
            <li>Adventure reminded me of a Hollister/Abercrombie boy&#x27;s scent; It was very powerful and had that young men&#x27;s smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also worth mentioning that the Degree Dry spray is most often the cheapest product of this type in any given</li>
            <li>The product was quite effective and would last me throughout the day - Keeping me dry and feeling clean.</li>
            <li>The fragrance isn&#x27;t too strong and it keeps me dry and smelling fresh all day.</li>
            <li>I find the push-button release on this product to be softer, more controllable, and overall better than the other two products.&lt;br /&gt;4.8 STARS</li>
            <li>The Dove Men+ Dry Spray had a much better dispersion method.</li>
            <li>The degree had a decently powerful scent but the adventure was a little overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Also you dont need to use much and it lasts forever.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried &#x27;Forrest&#x27; and &#x27;Island&#x27; and I like them both, but I tend to sweat easier when wearing this product, so I really have to cake it on when I</li>
            <li>, so I really have to cake it on when I</li>
            <li>Too much</li>
            <li>My favorite scent was actually Extreme, even though I didn&#x27;t care for it as much in the store.</li>
            <li>- The bottle does state these are used for underarm purposes only, but I have used them in several other areas to smell good and reduce perspiration significantly.</li>

            <li>and I believe it lasts longer due to better application.</li>
            <li>When actually on my body, Extreme is a little less overwhelming and more pleasant.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last very long though, and I have had to reapply many times.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know who thought it needed to be dry, but I guess the idea is cool</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth noting firstly, that Dove Mens+ Is often the most expensive of the three brands I have tried in any given market.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have actually tried three brands of dry sprays (and multiple scents) and these have become my go-to&#x27;s, but I&#x27;d like to let you know what I liked and didn&#x27;t like about each brand.</li>
            <li>The bottle is nice, but you have very little control over the flow, and I can only describe the output as &#x27;like a fire extinguisher&#x27;.</li>

            <li>Even in my lightest of days with minimal activity the spray wears off quite quick.  </li>
            <li>Generally, I buy whichever is on sale, but I always reach for the Dove if it&#x27;s not ridiculously</li>
            <li>Generally, I buy whichever is on sale, but I always reach for the Dove if it&#x27;s not ridiculously</li>
            <li>and I am spraying it far away from my armpit.</li>
            <li>I believe these scents are meant to be unisex, as there is no men&#x27;s/women&#x27;s branded products on the market as far as I&#x27;m aware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells like old man cologne</li>
            <li>Larger bottle would be much appreciated as I use a lot at a time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Degree Men&#x27;s dry spray was the first spray I had tried.</li>
            <li>Its cheaper on amazon than where I live so its just another regular order item now.</li>
            <li>Keeps me dry and fresh smelling all day long.</li>
            <li>Just remember that the places you apply them do get a slight slippery texture at first.</li>

            <li>I did want to try something new though and bought the axe dry spray.</li>
            <li>But boy was that stuff hard to scrub off in the shower and it made you feel kind of &#x27;dirty&#x27; after first putting it on until it really set</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s worth noting firstly, that Dove Mens+ Is often the most expensive of the three brands I have tried in any given market.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have actually tried three brands of dry sprays (and multiple scents) and these have become my go-to&#x27;s, but I&#x27;d like to let you know what I liked and didn&#x27;t like about each brand.</li>
            <li> The bottle is nice, but you have very little control over the flow, and I can only describe the output as &#x27;like a fire extinguisher&#x27;.</li>

            <li> Even in my lightest of days with minimal activity the spray wears off quite quick.  </li>
            <li> Generally, I buy whichever is on sale, but I always reach for the Dove if it&#x27;s not ridiculously</li>

            <li> and I am spraying it far away from my armpit.</li>
            <li> I believe these scents are meant to be unisex, as there is no men&#x27;s/women&#x27;s branded products on the market as far as I&#x27;m aware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells like old man cologne</li>
            <li> Larger bottle would be much appreciated as I use a lot at a time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Degree Men&#x27;s dry spray was the first spray I had tried.</li>
            <li> Its cheaper on amazon than where I live so its just another regular order item now.</li>
            <li> Keeps me dry and fresh smelling all day long.</li>
            <li> Just remember that the places you apply them do get a slight slippery texture at first.</li>

            <li> I did want to try something new though and bought the axe dry spray.</li>
            <li> But boy was that stuff hard to scrub off in the shower and it made you feel kind of &#x27;dirty&#x27; after first putting it on until it really set</li>
            <li> So far I have tried &#x27;Extreme&#x27; and &#x27;Adventure&#x27; scents.</li>
            <li> last product I have tried is Axe White Label Dry Spray.</li>
            <li> There is no really reason to use this over regular antiperspirant, since it&#x27;s not dry.</li>
            <li> I discovered Dry Spray antiperspirants just about 3 months ago, and I only decided to try them at the recommendation of my wife.</li>
            <li> next product I tried was Dove Men+ Dry Spray.</li>
            <li> I have tried three different dry sprays, and out of the three I prefer this one.</li>
            <li> I also somewhat appreciated the bottle design, although, it&#x27;s hard to know whether the bottle is open or closed without giving it a second look.</li>
            <li> Leaving some product in the air which will likely be accidentally inhaled if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
            <li> Also, because of this, it seems the Dove bottles (of the same size) tend to last me a little longer.</li>
            <li> Also, the bottle design is very basic and unimaginative compared to the other two brands I am reviewing.</li>
            <li> Use your imagination on other areas; But again, the bottle does only recommend the underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> I BUY THE DRY SPRAY</li>
            <li> The instant dry feature is pretty miraculous and as a side bonus it does not feel nearly as cold as a regular spray on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even used these on my feet when paired with black leather dress shoes and thick black socks to help keep them fresh throughout the day, and it works.</li>

            <li> but it would mess up my undershirt.  </li>

            <li> (that was a mortifying revelation in the office) but not so much that you smell like a desperately hopeless teenager.</li>
            <li> Infact it smells very odd.</li>
            <li> Get enough on there so that it won&#x27;t fail you</li>
            <li> No more drips or sticky liquids.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed to say that in my few days of using it, i&#x27;ve learned it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re in a bad spot, not enough</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leave marks that badly and seemed to keep me relatively dry throughout the day.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Did a good job its first week but noticed my armpits were wet an hour in after spraying,  i still smelled fine and everything but it would mess up my undershirt.  Though it was suppose to be dry and I am spraying it far away from my armpit.</li>
            <li> I used to hate this brand but while walking through a dept store a bottle was sitting there so I sprayed a little. I liked the smell but its overwhelming so you need not wear colognes while using this product. Women like it,  and so does my wife. Ive been asked what it was and I just say Axe deoderant lol.  Also you dont need to use much and it lasts forever. Last,  its a cool bottle with a twist up top thingy. Its cheaper on amazon than where I live so its just another regular order item now. Beware,  very strong scent. Have to leave the bathroom after using it. Like Axe fumigation which can work for other smells you need to cover up lol.</li>
            <li> The instant dry feature is pretty miraculous and as a side bonus it does not feel nearly as cold as a regular spray on. I have not tested it under stress but the active ingredient is proven so I&#x27;m pretty sure it works just fine. As for the scent, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be much of one though what little there is can best be described as blah . You will still need body spray or cologne if you want that. One thing I will caution you about it inhaling the powder/vapor. I will do better holding my breath next time I use it because the powdery nature seems to make it very easy to breath in and this can&#x27;t be healthy. I think it&#x27;s a good product and will likely stick around but I was always a &amp;#34;solid&amp;#34; guy and I probably will continue to be. I like to use the Axe Kilo stick and matching body spray.</li>
            <li> While ur putting this on there is so many chemicals coming out you cant even breathe</li>
            <li> smells good,  works great</li>
            <li> Great product, it lasts all day. The only complaint i do have is that I&#x27;ve had the bottle for about 2 weeks, and it seems like its already going to run out. I dont even use it often. Pshhhhh.</li>
            <li> I discovered Dry Spray antiperspirants just about 3 months ago, and I only decided to try them at the recommendation of my wife. I had always used Stick-based antiperspirants, and, while they were never ideal due to leaving marks, feeling cruddy, etc... They worked for the most part. My favorite stick based antiperspirant was Arm &amp; Hammer Men&#x27;s. It didn&#x27;t leave marks that badly and seemed to keep me relatively dry throughout the day. But boy was that stuff hard to scrub off in the shower and it made you feel kind of &#x27;dirty&#x27; after first putting it on until it really set in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have actually tried three brands of dry sprays (and multiple scents) and these have become my go-to&#x27;s, but I&#x27;d like to let you know what I liked and didn&#x27;t like about each brand. I will likely post reviews to the pages of all three products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Degree Men&#x27;s dry spray was the first spray I had tried. So far I have tried &#x27;Extreme&#x27; and &#x27;Adventure&#x27; scents. My favorite scent was actually Extreme, even though I didn&#x27;t care for it as much in the store. When actually on my body, Extreme is a little less overwhelming and more pleasant. Adventure reminded me of a Hollister/Abercrombie boy&#x27;s scent; It was very powerful and had that young men&#x27;s smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT I LIKED: The degree had a decently powerful scent but the adventure was a little overwhelming. The product was quite effective and would last me throughout the day - Keeping me dry and feeling clean. I also somewhat appreciated the bottle design, although, it&#x27;s hard to know whether the bottle is open or closed without giving it a second look. This can cause some unintended sprays! It&#x27;s also worth mentioning that the Degree Dry spray is most often the cheapest product of this type in any given market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT COULD BE IMPROVED: Compared to some of the other sprays I have tried, this one disperses quite a bit - Leaving some product in the air which will likely be accidentally inhaled if you aren&#x27;t careful. The bottle design is nice, but I feel it could be improved to make it more clear whether the nozzle is locked or unlocked.&lt;br /&gt;4.5 STARS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next product I tried was Dove Men+ Dry Spray. This is my favorite for several reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT I LIKED: The Dove Men+ Dry Spray had a much better dispersion method. It comes out of the bottle nice and easily and does not spray tons of extra product into the air to be inhaled. It seems to be more refined and comes out in a lighter, more controllable stream. Also, because of this, it seems the Dove bottles (of the same size) tend to last me a little longer. I also preferred the lighter, cleaner scent of the Dove. My favorite scent from this brand is the &#x27;Cool Metal&#x27; although I&#x27;ve tried most of the scents from the entire product line and they&#x27;re all good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT COULD BE IMPROVED: It&#x27;s worth noting firstly, that Dove Mens+ Is often the most expensive of the three brands I have tried in any given market. Also, the bottle design is very basic and unimaginative compared to the other two brands I am reviewing. Thankfully, though, the removable plastic top does make it nice and obvious whether you&#x27;re about to spray or not. I find the push-button release on this product to be softer, more controllable, and overall better than the other two products.&lt;br /&gt;4.8 STARS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last product I have tried is Axe White Label Dry Spray. I believe these scents are meant to be unisex, as there is no men&#x27;s/women&#x27;s branded products on the market as far as I&#x27;m aware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT I LIKED: The bottle design is absolutely the best of the three. A nice pop-up button, with a twist can. This is the most innovative of the three bottle designs, but unfortunately, that&#x27;s where most of this product&#x27;s shine wears off. The scents are &#x27;good&#x27; but they&#x27;re overwhelming in the quantities desired to get effectiveness out of this product. I&#x27;ve tried &#x27;Forrest&#x27; and &#x27;Island&#x27; and I like them both, but I tend to sweat easier when wearing this product, so I really have to cake it on when I apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT COULD BE IMPROVED: The Axe product is the absolute worst application method. The bottle is nice, but you have very little control over the flow, and I can only describe the output as &#x27;like a fire extinguisher&#x27;. If I&#x27;m using this product in a closed bathroom, I have to hold my breath when applying to underarms as to not inhale. When I leave the bathroom, it&#x27;s like I sprayed this product intentionally as an air freshener. This product is still worth buying because it smells great and works decently (especially when applied heavily), but I much prefer the Dove or Degree in preference, even though their canisters aren&#x27;t quite as beautiful! Strangely enough, I think Unilever makes both Dove and Axe products.&lt;br /&gt;4 STARS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, all three products are worth buying but the Dove is clearly my favorite. I wish they&#x27;d make the bottle a little more design-oriented, but it gets the job done the best of the three and I believe it lasts longer due to better application. Generally, I buy whichever is on sale, but I always reach for the Dove if it&#x27;s not ridiculously priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also - The bottle does state these are used for underarm purposes only, but I have used them in several other areas to smell good and reduce perspiration significantly. Just remember that the places you apply them do get a slight slippery texture at first. I&#x27;ve even used these on my feet when paired with black leather dress shoes and thick black socks to help keep them fresh throughout the day, and it works. Use your imagination on other areas; But again, the bottle does only recommend the underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps you in shopping!!!ct, so I really have to cake it on when I apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT COULD BE IMPROVED: The Axe product is the absolute worst application method.

            <li> Very good product and really lasts.</li>
            <li> Scent is strong and the best part, it&#x27;s not fruity. Two sprays is enough for about 4 hours. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Smells great, doesn&#x27;t last close to 48 hrs. I was using the arrid ultra fresh for a few months, it smells good and gets the job done. I did want to try something new though and bought the axe dry spray. I&#x27;m disappointed to say that in my few days of using it, i&#x27;ve learned it doesn&#x27;t last. Even in my lightest of days with minimal activity the spray wears off quite quick.  Update: 1/18/2015   I&#x27;m starting to like the product more. I have found that applying more of the deodarant helps the product last all day, consequently it means that I will use it quicker than anticipated. Smells great though, and the girlfriend approves so I&#x27;ll raise my rating from 2 to 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Product quality is fine but it is very light weight so my son move it a lot</li>
            <li> This product works great and smells awesome</li>
            <li> The fragrance isn&#x27;t too strong and it keeps me dry and smelling fresh all day. This is my first time using a spray antiperspirant or deodorant and I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I have tried three different dry sprays, and out of the three I prefer this one. The Forest scent is nice but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Does a good job. However, it itches and has an overpowering scent. Try to spray with eyes and nose covered or facing away.&lt;br /&gt;It does smell good though.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind the wetness of body sprays or perfumes. I think that&#x27;s how you know it&#x27;s working. I don&#x27;t know who thought it needed to be dry, but I guess the idea is cool so I tried it. In order to accomplish the &amp;#34;dryness&amp;#34; they had to turn it into a smoke-like substance. When I spray on the &amp;#34;smoke&amp;#34; it bounces off of my body and goes everywhere, makes my whole room cloudy, makes me choke up! And because it&#x27;s so &amp;#34;smokey&amp;#34; only 25% of it goes on your body and wears off in short period of time. The smell is not great either. Infact it smells very odd.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried both the Forest and Night scents. First, the good: the spray does go on dry as promised. The canister also has a cool design to expose and hide the spray nozzle. The bad: Both scents are extremely overpowering. I prefer the Forest to the Night, but it&#x27;s like spraying an strong body spray on your armpits. The spray also fills the room and your nostrils, as a result. I also didn&#x27;t have much luck with this acting as an effective antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> My best tip to buyers is to hold the can a bit closer than the recommended 6 inches and spray in intervals. Get enough on there so that it won&#x27;t fail you (that was a mortifying revelation in the office) but not so much that you smell like a desperately hopeless teenager. A good body wash plus AXE White Label leaves you smelling and feeling clean, and that&#x27;s definitely worth the price tag. Haven&#x27;t gotten around to trying Night or Island yet (I read some bad things about Air) but Forest has a really clean scent to it that&#x27;s not too overpowering if you use it right. Totally would recommend, but again, apply some caution. Too much and you&#x27;re in a bad spot, not enough and you may as well have just not worn any.</li>
            <li> Leaves white everywhere. I forgot about this side-effect and why I switched to gel based armpit relief. If you are used to that stuff thought, this is great!</li>
            <li> Smells like old man cologne</li>
            <li> This is a nice innovation in antiperspirants -- it goes on DRY.  You spray it, and all you feel is a slightly powdery mist.  No more drips or sticky liquids.  Plus, a spray product is so much more convenient to use than those push-up tubes.  (And you get more thorough coverage.)  The fragrance of AXE White is very pleasant, and doesn&#x27;t seem to be for any particular gender.  It&#x27;s just clean and fresh.  And of course, it does the job you expect of an antiperspirant/deoderant.  Definitely deserves five stars.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t care for this.</li>
            <li> I got this free from walmart. I think it has a great smile and it keeps my arm pits smelling great for the whole day. The smell isn&#x27;t as great as the other axe sprays but i got use to this one. I use this every day and i feel confident to go out on those hot days wearing axe white. I&#x27;m an axe guy. I only wear axe deoderant and love all of their products. Although this one isn&#x27;t my favorite i still give it 5 stars because it does what it&#x27;s suppose to do with no disappointment.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t go on instantly dry, as it claims.  My husband was excited to try it and he put it on and then put a shirt on and there were wet spots coming through the shirt in the arm pits.  There is no really reason to use this over regular antiperspirant, since it&#x27;s not dry.</li>
            <li> Great product. Keeps me dry and fresh smelling all day long. Larger bottle would be much appreciated as I use a lot at a time.</li>
            <li> I USE ALL THEIR PRODUCTS  I BUY THE DRY SPRAY IT DOES THE JOB I HAVE TO BUY MANY BECAUSE MY GRAND DAUGHTER ALSO LOVES  IT AND SHES 18 WHEN SHE VISITS SHE HIT MY RESERVES FROM SHAMPOOS TO BODY WASHS SHE A COLLEGE GIRL AND SHE SAY SHE BROKE LOL SEEMS WHAT I LIKE SHE ENJOYS ALL SO</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear and easy.  It doesn&#x27;t last very long though, and I have had to reapply many times.</li>
