    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Excellent trimmer.</li>
            <li>Perfect style every time.</li>
            <li>good quality, durable, fancy, waterproof and flexible for your needs !!!</li>
            <li>Best trimmer I have ever got.  </li>
            <li>best trimmer phillips has ever made.</li>
            <li>This thing looks awesome, and who doesn&#x27;t want to flash a laser about while shaving?</li>
            <li>Ergo is excellent, the variable depth heads work</li>
            <li>I have not quite figured out how to best use this laser guide.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This trimmer functions perfectly.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the best trimmers I&#x27;ve ever used on my beard.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through about six of them, with the best one being the cheapest one (believe it or not).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>best feature of this trimmer, however, is the battery life.</li>
            <li>The laser line feature is particularly awesome.  </li>
            <li>I had my barber teach me how to best use it on my first-time beard.</li>
            <li>if it werent for that it would be perfect.</li>
            <li>This product is great!</li>
            <li>However, I found that if you don&#x27;t keep the trimmer perfectly perpendicular to your face at all times the cutters rock forward and give you too close of a shave.  </li>
            <li>I do not recommend this, would not buy again, and hope this helps someone.more curvy at my cheeks, rather than at perfect angles.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gimmick at best.</li>
            <li>Perfect for a stubbly shave.</li>
            <li>The laser feature is awesome.  </li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s me dreaming, it works perfectly as a trimmer.</li>
            <li>Best trimmer I have ever had.  </li>
            <li>Great trimmer!</li>
            <li>Excellent purchase, excellent seller</li>

            <li>Very good product with aceptable price.</li>
            <li>very good power and trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a very good timer for your bread.</li>
            <li>This trimmer cuts hair very good and close.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is a great beard trimmer, and it suits my needs perfectly.</li>
            <li>Good battery life!</li>
            <li>This one sounded impressive and I figured the brand means good</li>
            <li>Once I got the hang of it, it works beautifully.</li>
            <li>and it works great for that.</li>
            <li>and it works great for that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Performance-wise I have been quite happy with this trimmer.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this beard trimmer to anyone, its a great product.</li>
            <li>I trimmed my beard and also used it for a haircut with great satisfaction.  </li>
            <li>This is great and the battery holds a charge for quite awhile.  </li>
            <li>Great trimer.</li>
            <li>Works great if you don&#x27;t mind clippers against the skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for stubble</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Great feeling during the shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>, laser looks great</li>
            <li>Great beard-shaper.</li>
            <li>The laser guide is a great addition.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for about 1 month and have experienced no issues.  </li>
            <li>I just used this trimmer a couple of times but it works great on my beard.</li>
            <li>Holds charge and cuts great</li>
            <li>It fits great in the hand.</li>
            <li>Great seller 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Great product at a Great Price.</li>
            <li>Everything works great.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s a very nice looking trimmer too.</li>
            <li>The blades need no oil which is very nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe you can use the laser if you go for one of those perfectly trimmed chin strapped looks, but I doubt you&#x27;ll even be able to use that because it doesn&#x27;t trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>great product and a good shave</li>
            <li>And, I keep my beard more curvy at my cheeks, rather than at perfect angles.  </li>
            <li>It works wonderfully for a fellow like me, who has a scraggly beard with curly hair of many dimensions.</li>
            <li>Take my word for it, he WILL love you even more !!!</li>
            <li>That probably isn&#x27;t good for you, even though it&#x27;s a low-powered laser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a good value.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The laser doesn&#x27;t work as good as advertised.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall good product</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good beard trimmer, I would recommend this for that reason, not for &amp;#34;precision laser technology&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It has been a really good experience buying this product.</li>
            <li>Yes good product for the money</li>
            <li>Once you do it just doesn&#x27;t do anything good.</li>
            <li>and I loved it.</li>
            <li>I thought it was a good looking trimmer</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s good for a one or two day after look, but</li>
            <li>Everything about it is good.  </li>
            <li>Its good.</li>
            <li>An adjustment wheel on the trimmer provides good control over how closely it will clip hair.  </li>
            <li>There are a lot of good setting for this</li>
            <li>The trimmer is good, comes with two attachments.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery lasts a good amount of time.  </li>
            <li>but the trimmer it&#x27;s good, really good.</li>
            <li>Basically its a good shaver.  </li>
            <li>The full hour charge is awesome...</li>
            <li>Very good and smooth shaving</li>
            <li>More than happy with this product.</li>
            <li>The two attachments are ok, the great part about these is that there is a depth adjustment on the trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Great trimmer, just would appreciate a more ample set of guards for a longer beard than those provided.</li>
            <li>impressive, love the light</li>
            <li>Very happy with it on my first use.</li>
            <li>Great product and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Powerful trimming tool, very accurate and attractive!</li>
            <li>Using no blade covers, you can achieve the five o&#x27;clock shadow look and the precision is amazing.</li>
            <li>Great beard trimmer with precise length control.</li>
            <li>Great quality, laser light helps those who may struggle with close up vision to achieve a sharper / straighter line.</li>
            <li>Nicely designed and durable.  </li>
            <li>The lazer guide is not that handy.</li>
            <li>It just cuts nice and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>everything is handy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall he loved it, we both think the lasers are just magic</li>
            <li>The laser guide function is extremely handy for getting a well defined beard shape.  </li>
            <li>I have been getting lots of complements on my beard since using this (more just that my beard/ or style looks good).  </li>
            <li>The laser guide seemed handy, but didnt speed up the process and attempted to solve an accuracy problem I did not have</li>
            <li>For the money you would also expect this unit to come with some kind of travel case.</li>
            <li>Glad he was so good at it.</li>
            <li>The product is nice except for the:&lt;br /&gt;1.Sometimes</li>
            <li>I really liked this product......</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather have a trimmer that effectively guided the hair up into the guides</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather have a trimmer that effectively guided the hair up into the guides</li>
            <li>laser is a nice novelty and works well</li>
            <li>I really liked it&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good, need more time to learn to use it.</li>
            <li>Works well, recharges nicely</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I can definitely live with the cons and am very happy with the quality of the trimmer.</li>
            <li>I found the battery life is good, and this pouch makes it an easy on the go</li>
            <li>My son in law got the best deal since I gave him my old trimmer...</li>
            <li>/&gt;The light is too bright.</li>
            <li>so out of date, it&#x27;s important to a man not to choose to look like (even if we all loved him)</li>
            <li>good product the laser light will help in precision....</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is, by far, the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Had been looking for a nice beard trimmer for some time and opted for this Philips Norelco model mostly based on the reviews I read and watched online.</li>
            <li>This is a good unique trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Trimmer works great but the laser is more a fancy add on then truly useful.</li>
            <li>that are all perfect and squarish and for hipster mustaches like no other.</li>
            <li>The trimmer itself is very light.</li>
            <li>so it is very comfortable to carry.</li>
            <li>Very smooth with no pulling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Trims the beard very smoothly...</li>
            <li>Product is super good.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see that it just didn&#x27;t do a very good job.</li>
            <li>this one is a huge improvement!  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>This one goes to the top though.</li>
            <li>satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>i have a Remington and cut much better than this.  </li>
            <li>This does an excellent job of trimming &amp; keeping beard all at same length.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are some people who do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m quite happy with this trimmer, and I really don&#x27;t have any complaints about it.</li>
            <li>This is on the better end of those, and in the price range for this series-</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>sure that moving the trimmer also moves the laser...</li>
            <li>Before I knew it I had lost any hope of achieving coveted Top Gun status.</li>
            <li>nothing outstanding.</li>
            <li>My beard looks more even on both sides of my face then it ever has before.  </li>
            <li>The whole razor is waterproof which is great for cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Overall, an excellent beard trimmer!</li>
            <li>I called after the 10th day and they told me \\&quot;its being processed and will take 3 more days.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I told the customer service rep that whatever they were getting paid, Philips lost more money paying them to avoid paying a return to me.</li>
            <li>Th laser is a neat innovation which in time I am sure I will adapt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I am satisfied with my puchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But when I went to order it, I noticed that the price more than tripled.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I do notice that the setting it works best on is simple stubble.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to make the guard give an even cut on all parts of the beard, or maybe my face might just be weird.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>think you will be pleased if you pick up this razor.</li>
            <li>It has no lubrication requirements, time will tell if that is ok.  </li>
            <li>At this price point I was expecting a bit more.</li>
            <li>I now do it myself and have more than paid for this trimmer.</li>
            <li>There are better ones out there</li>
            <li>Device can use more power.</li>
            <li>THE MAN IN YOUR LIFE WILL LOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;garunteed</li>
            <li>i use this trimmer the most</li>
            <li>Maybe it would work better for a thicker beard?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really more of a stubble styler, for stubble length savants.</li>
            <li>but I  wasn&#x27;t sure about the laser.</li>
            <li>Some better than others.</li>
            <li>but the laser is too bright to be useful for me.</li>
            <li>I find it easier to use without the laser and there is a model that doesn&#x27;t have it so that would have been a better buy.</li>
            <li>We really do love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Obviously I don&#x27;t use it, but I love the effects and looks it gives my husband!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am extremely satisfied with the quality and function of the BT9285.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better beard trimmer for my needs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sold on the laser-guided trimmer as being more than a gimmick.</li>
            <li>All in all there are better trimmers out there</li>
            <li>that offer more for the money.</li>
            <li>awesome only for beard/mustache not for haircutting....</li>
            <li>I actually enjoyed the trimmer.</li>
            <li>I am sure I will get better at using it to make a level cut with time.</li>
            <li>The Trimmer has a nice weight to it and feels comfortable in my hand when using it.</li>
            <li>If I want to limit my beard length to about an inch or so, that is okay.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a good, powerful and purposeful trimmer.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and looks good.</li>
            <li>it is good and easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>My husband is enjoying it....</li>
            <li>Love how it has the two options between cordless n using it with the cord in...</li>
            <li>he was HOT!!!, \\&quot;Mac\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sturdy without being clunky, with a very straightforward design.</li>
            <li>a beard trimmer could be cool, this is the ONE for sure!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It can be rinsed clean, which is nice.</li>
            <li>slim trimmer, works great, washable, and high tech....</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and very useful.  </li>
            <li>But the laser is just a cool (and possibly hazardous to your eyes) gimmick, and this thing is out-performed by a $25 Wahl Lithium beard trimmer when it comes to close-cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But the laser is just a cool (and possibly hazardous to your eyes) gimmick, and this thing is out-performed by a $25 Wahl Lithium beard trimmer when it comes to close-cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The include detail-er trimmer comb is awesome for getting the mustache trimmed though it does require more care than the other beard comb.  </li>
            <li>But if you like a variety of short lengths, the ability of a fine trim blade that you don&#x27;t have to interchange, and a good battery life (mine lasted 2 weeks before I decided to recharge) then this could still be a good option for you.</li>
            <li>i read that it cuts as short as .2mm, but i didnt notice any difference from my old trimmer, but anyway its a very good trimmer, battery is great</li>
            <li>It does not feel like I trimmed afterwords which is great if you have sensitive skin or are prone to ingrown hairs (which I am).  </li>
            <li>The laser is neat, but since I don&#x27;t like to trim close to the skin with an electric it is a feature U admire more than I enjoy.</li>
            <li>It seems very well made, and it feels good and fits well in my hand.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair for me to adjust for the laser feature, but I can&#x27;t see much of a use for it unless you are a guy</li>
            <li>They all work OK, but nothing to get too excited about.  </li>
            <li>And, with the chargeable feature, it makes it easy to use wherever and whenever throughout the house, car, office, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>Also cleaning the blade is easy.</li>
            <li>The light does not extend very far beyond either edge of the side of the clipper when it&#x27;s touching your face, so it&#x27;s not like it does you very much good anyway.  </li>
            <li>If it wasn&#x27;t for the high price, it would make a good gag gift.</li>
            <li>I liked the Laser marker very much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m pretty sure MOST people make shave movements that are perpendicular to the razor blade, otherwise disaster ensues...</li>
            <li>The guard is secure and easily adjustable.  </li>
            <li>it is awesome and take less time for chraging</li>
            <li>you decide to use this without using the laser guide, the trimmer is fine.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use guards for trimming his beard because part of the issue with his face is a large scar on his chin that he prefers covered, but I do like to keep the guards handy for touch ups on the sides if he feels like doing them.</li>
            <li>In my case the device trimmer below the light bar and was perhaps faulty.</li>
            <li>They lock securely in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but overall a great product.</li>
            <li>No add on comb available</li>
            <li>The colors are nice, and it has a really sleek, high-tech look to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>There is a smooth gliding that occurs with use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Philips has a 45-day risk free guarantee.</li>
            <li>but it does cone in handy when you need a straight line shave.</li>
            <li>The laser guide gives you a extremely precise line to ensure accuracy.</li>
            <li>The trimmer tools are great and do offer different lengths</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Just as important to a woman not to get stuck in a \\&quot;style decade\\&quot; which is oh</li>
            <li>would be a great graduation present looking forward to this spring!&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>overall great in every aspect.  </li>
            <li>It is comfortable to hold during use,  </li>
            <li>light that lights up when you are charing it and when it needs a charge.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The laser, a nice touch, really assists when you are trimming your neckline in the mirror.</li>
            <li>Its great over all just wish the guards were designed different.</li>
            <li>0.4 mm blade not so smooth.</li>
            <li>Not feeling comfortable if we use it at Level 1</li>
            <li>Works great and is a solid made trimmer!</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are no snags or pulls on his sensitive skin, and it gets fairly close.</li>
            <li>far as mechanics are concerned this is a good razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this is the beard trimmer you give your husband if you are confident that when he looks really good, he will still stick around because he loves YOU and only you!</li>
            <li>The auto adjustment is very useful and convenient.</li>
            <li>Best birthday present, by far!!</li>
            <li>ok thats normal. :)</li>
            <li>Hopefully, down the road, I&#x27;ll be able to be as happy with reliability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the additional cost!</li>
            <li>This trimmer is definitely the best one I&#x27;ve owned so far.</li>
            <li>Cuts clean and works like you would hope it would.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t like opening the guard every stroke to clean it out</li>
            <li>It gives me a clean and uniform shave.</li>
            <li>This handy feature is basically a pop out laser that emits a horizontal beam that allows you to set your edges with beautiful precision and accuracy, a true blessing for those who take this level of grooming seriously.  </li>
            <li>This machine does exactly as it says, and the option of having the trimmer side available simply by turning it 180 degrees is great.</li>
            <li>Its very ergonomic, which means its very comfortable to handle and use.</li>
            <li>they really need is a trimmer that simultaneously shaves the other side of your face to make it perfectly symmetrical...</li>
            <li>I still couldn&#x27;t figure out the perfect way to use laser and it&#x27;s really hard to avoid them getting into eye as the reflection from mirror can fall on eye.</li>
            <li>The laser is only good for marketing.</li>
            <li>The laser function is a cool toy, but not something I would depend on.</li>
            <li>But on the cool factor its all five stars alone.</li>
            <li>The closest setting did not trim my full beard in the sightest.  </li>
            <li>Fortunaly, the BT9285/9100 came along and I am very well satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I packaged it up and sent it back after a good cleaning.</li>
            <li>I do use the laser just to feel cool though.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with how nice it is.</li>
            <li>The led display is cool.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>to adjust (nearly as easy as the Remington, although that one was amazingly easy)&lt;br /&gt;Feels very solid</li>
            <li>Despite what some of the other reviews say this is a great beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>Adequate for shaping your neckline, or trimming your beard.</li>
            <li>It is pretty accurate.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m sawing a piece of wood I can barely stay on a line that&#x27;s drawn with pencil... and a moving laser target that&#x27;s being stabilized by my own hand....</li>
            <li>Good trimmer for long stabble</li>
            <li>Love my new razor.  </li>
            <li>The laser guide allows for more precision and the digital display makes viewing the comb length setting quick and easy.</li>
            <li>Great if you like tons of mess when you trim your bird...</li>
            <li>precise, the power level indicator works well, and the feel in the hand is very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This lightweight trimmer give a very close cut, smooth.  </li>
            <li>This razor charges really fast and cuts evenly and smooth without snagging or pulling out hairs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bright enough to be really distracting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one does a far better job and requires fewer attachments than the cheaper ones.</li>
            <li>I bought this because my old variable length beard trimmer battery was no longer charging, and the reviews suggested it would be better than the Wahl beard</li>
            <li>It cuts far more efficiently than any trimmer I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>all this said, the laser was useful but its not needed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was surprised that the trimmer did not come with a case, and perhaps some more attachments.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I miss about the Norelco G370 is the nice charging dock.</li>
            <li>The fact that something we shave with merits the addition of a laser is a pretty cool concept.</li>
            <li>This is super-helpful for trimming up the back/bottom of my head after a fresh haircut and my sideburns are always dialed in.    </li>
            <li>A razor blade works far better than using this &amp;#34;laser guided&amp;#34; trimmer for the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Philips Norelco Beard Trimmer 9100 is the creme de la creme of great beard trimmers, with its laser control and the 17 settings it offers, as well as the fact that it can simply be rinsed off under the faucet to be cleaned.&lt;br</li>
            <li>design overall is nice.</li>
            <li>It should cut better than my 10 year old one.</li>
            <li>Laser isn&#x27;t really useful, miss having a shaver attachment</li>
            <li>The laser is useful and pops up with a spring at the touch of your finger like a pen.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for over 15 years now, and this is easily the best trimmer for one major reason, no snags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The trimmer itself works well, but the laser guide is two bright and wide for a clean line, and really only works well when trimming on the top sides of the beard-cheek line.</li>
            <li>but i mostly use it for touching up and keeping the lines... laser sharp.</li>
            <li>the battery seem to drain pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Other than that this is a good unit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another annoyance is the power button seems quite finicky, and you have to press it in just the right spot to turn the trimmer on or off.</li>
            <li>This razor has a laser right?</li>
            <li>I always struggle with that, and the precise straight lines help you to cut exactly what you want.</li>
            <li>It is much easier to adjust and clean.</li>
            <li>And, unlike my last trimmer, this trimmer&#x27;s settings are very easy to read.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a pretty version of my old trimmer that has a better battery and cuts only slightly better.</li>
            <li>Very good, item I just wish have more cutting levels</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li>It cuts very straight lines and cuts close.  </li>
            <li>i like it very much...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It cuts hair very fast too no wast of time.</li>
            <li>For a moderately priced beard trimmer, this Philips Norelco gets the job done and is super easy to use.</li>
            <li>Great trimming blades, hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin, though the plastic guards are a bit hard on my skin.</li>
            <li>but i dont use, the trimmer isnt small as i noticed in some reviews, but looks nice and its smooth and make jobe very fast.</li>
            <li>once he tries this amazing trimmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Husband really likes it!</li>
            <li>BUT, with that said, this model is only $20.00 more than the 5100, so you might want to give this model a try anyway.</li>
            <li>However, if you do happen to decide to purchase this beard trimmer, I am pretty confident that you won&#x27;t be sending it back.</li>

            <li>well, and holds a charge for more than enough time to trim up his beard.</li>
            <li>You can definitely get more quality for your money out there.</li>
            <li>I only used it twice, and it trims and cuts much better.  </li>
            <li>Being able to plug it in for use is a definite plus.  </li>
            <li>It arrived in a timely fashion and is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a pretty neat feature.</li>
            <li>At higher settings, it does not cut at all.  </li>
            <li>I still need to go over my beard several times to get most of it and even then I find I still miss spots or have hairs that I just can&#x27;t seem to to trim.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Battery life is ok and the power enough to keep a short beard trimmed without any problems, but it has problems with thicker and more hair, requiring you to rinse the trimmer to keep going with the thicker beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The was exactly as described</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed using this and with summer here i have removed my entire beard and now use it as a body trimmer, sideburns and neck trimmer where it excels.</li>
            <li>This my first trimmer.</li>
            <li>Over the years I&#x27;ve bought numerous cheaper trimmers (spending far more tnan if I&#x27;d bought a quality one to begin with!).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;55 days after I originally purchased the trimmer (10 days after the guarantee ended), I got an automated email from Philips asking me to complete a survey and product review.</li>
            <li>/&gt;55 days after I originally purchased the trimmer (10 days after the guarantee ended), I got an automated email from Philips asking me to complete a survey and product review.</li>
            <li>Sure there&#x27;s a laser guide, but missiles simply went astray as fast as I could fire them.</li>
            <li>First of all its a pure gimmick.</li>
            <li>The major issue I am seeing with this is that it does not glide across my face smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I have nothing positive to say about this trimmer.</li>
            <li>I liked my 30 year old Norelco better, this one seems to be designed so a person cannot cut themselves, so it is hard to get a close shave when trimming your mustache or beard.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why the hell I thought it would be a good idea to purchase a beard trimmer with a laser,</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m showing my age, but I&#x27;ve been begging for Philips/Norelco to go back to their T-series, where the guard was high quality, the length clicks were meaningful, and there weren&#x27;t gimmicks to add bulk to the size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>with the numerous length adjustments and design of the two combs, a neatly trimmed beard and mustache are easily achieved.</li>
            <li>but the accessory plastic comb is fragile and easy to breake.</li>
            <li>A charge seems last a good long time too.  </li>
            <li>Of course, the laser feature adds a certain &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; appeal, but</li>
            <li>But this works great for trimming up or at least knocking it down so that you can get a close shave. :)</li>
            <li>This is a product for those who like to keep their lines nice and tight.  </li>
            <li>Yeah, it&#x27;s a good all around beard trimmer with solid power, 17 locked in length settings, dual sided trimmer with self-sharpening blades that requires no oil or maintenance (love this) but what it comes down to is that you are paying a premium for 1 key feature - a built in laser (class 1) guide.  </li>
            <li>I think this would work fine for a short beard.</li>
            <li>The trimmer works fine, and the two different sides for trimming and detailing work well.</li>
            <li>the trimmer allows extremely close cuts, so you may take off more than intended the first time it is used.</li>
            <li>For my trimming needs, I found the laser guide to be of little use to be honest.</li>
            <li>So I pulled out the Wahl beard trimmer (without head-attachments) and went over the same areas, and I could see a huge difference in how much hair was removed.</li>
            <li>The blades fit in to trim his mustaches above his lip very well too which has been a design issue in some trimmers.</li>
            <li>Very cool.&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s essentially mostly trimming pretty short hair, 2 or 3-day growth, without any of the head-attachments, just using the bare metal shears.</li>
            <li>This is really, really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You very well might find the laser guide to be useful/helpful.</li>
            <li>It helps you eye things straight, or you can use it with a eyeliner pencil for a straight line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d use the laser guide on this thing as much as I use the laser guide on my table</li>
            <li>Its really lightweight which as a woman who blow dries and curls her hair, I can understand how a man would want a lighter beard tool.</li>
            <li>real feature on this item is the straight line laser that helps give you a line for the blade.</li>
            <li>My thoughts are that really this is not needed.</li>
            <li>For $90 I expected better.  </li>
            <li>I put the device to lowest possible setting to get a light trim but have to keep going over my beard time and again</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t trim much, beard remained darker than I wanted.</li>
            <li>I really like this trimmer.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t buy into the laser..</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You could get a much cheaper beard clipper without all the gimmicks that aren&#x27;t practical.</li>
            <li>You could get a much cheaper beard clipper without all the gimmicks that aren&#x27;t practical.</li>
            <li>guard is the same cheap plastic that Philips/Norelco has been using for years, so you can count on it losing a tooth or two before your warranty is</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have a use for the laser guide</li>
            <li>The pivoting head works really well</li>
            <li>but it really does help me guide the trimmer and keep the cuts straight.  </li>
            <li>Had a goatee or beard for over 20 years straight.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>so I really needed to replace mine.</li>
            <li>REALLY into grooming.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to accidentally trim too much of my beard.</li>
            <li>no need for the laser really</li>
            <li>Straight lines everytime</li>
            <li>Much needed, my VanDyke was getting way out of control.</li>
            <li>Barbers want too much to trim it.</li>
            <li>The only difference appears to be the laser guide, which looks and sounds pretty cool...</li>
            <li>I have used this a few times and was surprised at how good of a trimmer it was.</li>
            <li>In fact, a straight edge shave by a barber is almost a welcome chance to the unnecessary technology that is coming out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t spread out far enough in either direction to be able to see it.&lt;br /&gt;The indicator that shows what adjustment the guide is on is backlit and the backlight goes off when not in use.</li>
            <li>As an aside, my old Lithium powered Wahl beard trimmer that cost about $25, powers right through without any slowdown.</li>
            <li>Apparently another feature that will quickly be ignored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This beard trimmer has a good grip that allows the hairs to be brushed off (unlike some other trimmers - Wahl lithium</li>
            <li>if you want it longer than that, it&#x27;s better to look at one of their other products.</li>
            <li>and I could use that just the same to create a clean edge.</li>
            <li>Not only that, but the motors run more smoothly, providing less shake and vibration in my hand.</li>
            <li>I have an old Remington that works much better on a beard that is 1/2 inch to 1 inch long</li>
            <li>trimmer overall with some nice extra features, you decide if its worth the extra $$.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no need to fool around with a brush to clean the blades on this trimmer, as I can just run it under the faucet, and in a few seconds it&#x27;s perfectly clean.</li>
            <li>If you have a hard time trimming straight lines or keeping things symetrical, it might be worth $20 more.  </li>
            <li>Now, though it&#x27;s a cool feature, I&#x27;m not convinced the laser guide is actually all that useful/helpful.</li>
            <li>Having a laser on this contraption is pretty weaksauce but it is an epic trimmer.</li>
            <li>My previous trimmer (the Norelco with the vacuum) could never do a good job trimming the moustache as my nose got in the way-</li>
            <li>And, if for some reason you don&#x27;t like it, or you find it doesn&#x27;t suit your particular needs</li>
            <li>And, if for some reason you don&#x27;t like it, or you find it doesn&#x27;t suit your particular needs</li>
            <li>Sir or Madam:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose this particular item (BT9285/41 9100) in hope of finding a beard trimmer that functions to my satisfaction.  </li>
            <li>but I do like how quickly and quietly I can groom my beard.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The larger side to the trimmer blade cuts aggresively and quickly.  </li>
            <li>It is nothing more than a light behind a rotating wheel.</li>
            <li>main blade keeps falling off with the slightest movement.</li>
            <li>Granted this Philips Norelco model costs several times more, but it feels very solid</li>
            <li>If this particular feature appeals to you</li>
            <li>I have bought so many different trimmers then after a short time, get another.  </li>
            <li>(my larger hair clippers are much better at this function), and a vacuum to control the hair clippings.  </li>
            <li>(my larger hair clippers are much better at this function), and a vacuum to control the hair clippings.  </li>
            <li>The other needs more care to use as you can easily cut down to the skin depending on the angle</li>
            <li>, to get to the point, those sorts of looks on those men are very hard to maintain without a really good beard trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Consequently, I highly recommend giving this trimmer a try.</li>
            <li>Consequently, I highly recommend giving this trimmer a try.</li>
            <li>This is a high tech beard trimmer, with plenty of adjustable settings.  </li>
            <li>i highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>had high hopes for this Philips Norelco trimmer though.</li>
            <li>Figure the odds on doing precisely that with a beard trimmer that has a 6&amp;#34; wide laser that you&#x27;re pointing at your face.</li>
            <li>However, is it worth the extra $15+ for the 9100 over the 5100?</li>
            <li>Its good but not great, I thought it wil have more type of trimmers and my old trimmer seems to do the same work except for all the different lenght.</li>
            <li>I do like the smaller size of the head on the beard trimmer than on my hair clippers, and the trim head is definitely useful.  </li>
            <li>I do like the smaller size of the head on the beard trimmer than on my hair clippers, and the trim head is definitely useful.  </li>
            <li>ok for beard purpose as long as it remain short</li>
            <li>It just glides along the top of the beard and you hear a few hairs getting cut here and there.</li>
            <li>short, I think the laser is a novelty and not truly useful.  </li>
            <li>Quiet and powerful.</li>
            <li>then it&#x27;s definitely worth the extra 20 or so</li>
            <li>According to the instructions, you must run down the full charge during the first use before recharging.  </li>
            <li>cleanly with a single pass, motor doesn&#x27;t feel like it is straining&lt;br</li>
            <li>Because it moves along with the trimmer, and only makes a single straight line, you&#x27;re probably better off using it to set your lines, draw them in with your significant other&#x27;s eyeliner (or dry-erase marker, as the case may be) and then use those lines as your guide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The battery life is good as from one charge it will last me several weeks using every other day or so.</li>
            <li>used the 9100 five times on a single charge, and it seems to have more uses left.</li>
            <li>I really like the way the head flips around to present either the wide or narrow shears, great for shaping the mustache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m genuinely puzzled by what purpose it&#x27;s supposed to serve, other than verifying that you&#x27;ve made jagged edges.</li>
            <li>and I buy a new trimmer every couple of years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep it because I did need a new variable length trimmer for the goatee</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep it because I did need a new variable length trimmer for the goatee</li>
            <li>But I thought I&#x27;d keep it since I needed a new one.</li>
            <li>This is a new trimmer.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t start with its power button no matter how much you press it: you have to open the laser and close it for the whole device to power up.</li>
            <li>trimmer is also comparatively quiet, and is powerful and sharp, and makes quick work of trimming my beard.</li>
            <li>However, after the 45 days past, I gave up and reported Philips to the Better Business Bureau.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like to keep a short hair beard and most other brands</li>
            <li>The pictures displayed on Amazon show perfect looking beards with well crafted lines; however, every time I used the laser guide I walked away feeling disappointed concerning</li>
            <li>You have to make sure to spend less than a second on any particular area or risk getting a bald spot.</li>
            <li>First off there are no beards in my household, but we have always had a beard trimmer on hand to trim up side burns and the back of the neck between hair cuts.</li>
            <li>I have to make down and up manually by hand to be accurate with blade trimmer.</li>
            <li>The Beard comb/detail comb is fantastic, but its plastic so over time will this get damaged or worn down?</li>
            <li>It has 17 length settings, which are in very small increments, so I can easily set it to cut my beard to the exact length I like.</li>
            <li>My wife bought me this new laser trimmer as a gift since my trimmer is old.</li>
            <li>If you use the guard without the full enclosure you will likely gouge a big hunk of your hair out...</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cutter, used without a guard, can be rotated to either expose the wide blades that are good for neck or jaw lines, or the smaller cutting blade, good for areas such as sideburns or a mustache.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not bad but like any other trimmer with sheep price also no need at all for the laser</li>
            <li>That said, it is slightly less bulky than the 9100 and has better grips on the back side.</li>
            <li>easy flip it around depending on if you need it to be small or normal.</li>
            <li>It also only goes to level 7 on it which happens to be the shortest I have been keeping mine lately, which is fairly short still; so if you like a more full beard, this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li>I does have a light, presumably to guide your trimming, but you&#x27;ll soon ignore it, as it does little to improve the task.</li>
            <li>then draw a line that is obviously not going to be easy to reproduce on the other side of your face and shave to that line...?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had to report them to the BBB and write a negative review on their site to get them to honor their guarantee, then they censor the reviews of their products - completely unethical.ast, I gave up and reported Philips to the Better Business Bureau.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Upgraded from a 3 year old Norelco and their is no difference.</li>
            <li>The laser is very cumbersome to use longest comb is only 3/8 inch.</li>
            <li>trimmer cuts through hair like a knife through soft butter.</li>
            <li>I even went so far as to replace it with another when it wore out.</li>
            <li>far these have met my expectations.</li>
            <li>much experience with trimmers while getting haircuts tells me this is possible.  </li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t imagine actually trimming a real beard with this.</li>
            <li>The numbers allegedly represent length in millimeters, but that seems to translate to \\&quot;short beard\\&quot;, \\&quot;very short beard\\&quot;, \\&quot;are you growing a beard?\\&quot;, and 14 more settings of stubble.</li>
            <li>I needed something to replace my Remington Titanium trimmer which was about 2 years old and no longer held a charge.</li>
            <li>and I expect it to last much</li>
            <li>The laser has no side to side projection once you get near your face.</li>
            <li>Completely gapped up my beard as soon as I started upwards along my jawbone contour.</li>
            <li>I did one side and got out my old trimmer and finished the job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this product for 3 months so far</li>
            <li>settings allow you to get close to the sensitive areas around the nose and also let you regulate the length of your side burns.</li>
            <li>My old trimmer&#x27;s battery was dying</li>
            <li>good trimmer laser is useless</li>
            <li>I was already regretting that she spent that much money on something that seemed like a decent idea.</li>
            <li>It comes with a laser, which provides a straight line for cutting a clean neck line---a nice feature that I&#x27;ve not seen in other trimmers.</li>
            <li>Seems to be of a very high quality and functionally, far better than any other systems I had purchased in the past.</li>
            <li>Tested it and found it to be underpowered for my moderately thick beard and the attachments are very flimsy - I&#x27;ve had other trimmers from Philips and they broke very easily, but are not covered in the warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does a decent job on the mustache, but the hair surrounding the face is left wanting.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is essentially the exact same trimmer as the 5100 model, except this model has the pop-up laser guide, and there are color differences.</li>
            <li>Why take turbo mode out, that&#x27;s a big mistake since all the older trimmers had it</li>
            <li>It seems a reason to take a beard trimmer to a new level of technological advance when really there is not much room for growth.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;laser&#x27; is kind of useless and it seems to be limited to helping to trim sideburns at the right level.</li>
            <li>The laser does allow you to see where a straight line would be (theoretically), but, being attached to the clippers, your frame of reference (the laser line) constantly moves as you move the clippers to trim/ detail.  </li>
            <li>so I can access a narrow blade that gets into harder to reach places (or more stubborn hairs</li>
            <li>much cheaper 2 yr old trimmer didn&#x27;t leave occasional long hairs on my beard as this one did: I discovered this AFTER being at work all day.</li>
            <li>it is getting very hot in few minutes..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fine with that, there isn&#x27;t much use for cutting straight lines.</li>
            <li>Very little hair was removed from my full beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Anyway, apart from that the guides keep everything trim and the length settings are solid and clear.</li>
            <li>It requires you use the trimmer for 3-weeks, then you have to call to have them process the guarantee and the package that you send the trimmer back in must be post marked by the 45th day after the date of your purchase</li>
            <li>I currently use an old Norelco.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;beard comb&amp;#34; barely cuts my stubble at the lowest setting.  </li>
            <li>Barely.</li>
            <li>which I feel like many plug in razors have poor</li>
            <li>Have used it, adequate but not more.</li>
            <li>My other Andis trimmer cuts much closer than this trimmer however than this Norelco causes NO irritation of my skin.  </li>
            <li>Admittedly, I&#x27;m too lazy to actually &amp;#34;shave.&amp;#34; As in baby smooth no facial hair at all shave.</li>
            <li>The laser on the trimmer has some value other than just being a freaking laser, yes it does move with the trimmer, but you can use it verify that you have straight</li>
            <li>and it remains there versus other trimmers i have used that if you apply to much pressure they might change settings.</li>
            <li>Before with a full beard it would last me about a week before i needed to charge but only used for a few minutes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first I was really excited about this, but upon first use my disappointment nearly drowned me like a yodeler in a horse trough.</li>
            <li>but as long as you have a clear mirror, steady hand and put attention to what you are doing you really do not need the laser.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it that&#x27;s really worth anything.</li>
            <li>I used the &amp;#34;trimming&amp;#34; guide (or whatever it&#x27;s called) the first time, just to cut back the length of my beard a little.  </li>
            <li>They usually offer above average products that last longer that most.</li>
            <li>and the blade is pretty smooth cutting too.</li>
            <li>Just let them dry completely before putting them away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charges</li>
            <li>The small trimmer on the opposite side of the trimmer is extremely useful for details and for trimming my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>: NO TURBO MODE, no vacuum so hair drops all over the place, Laser is pointless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> good quality, durable, fancy, waterproof and flexible for your needs !!!</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I have ever got.  </li>
            <li> best trimmer phillips has ever made.</li>
            <li> This thing looks awesome, and who doesn&#x27;t want to flash a laser about while shaving?</li>
            <li> Ergo is excellent, the variable depth heads work</li>
            <li> I have not quite figured out how to best use this laser guide.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This trimmer functions perfectly.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the best trimmers I&#x27;ve ever used on my beard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through about six of them, with the best one being the cheapest one (believe it or not).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> best feature of this trimmer, however, is the battery life.</li>
            <li> The laser line feature is particularly awesome.  </li>
            <li> I had my barber teach me how to best use it on my first-time beard.</li>
            <li> if it werent for that it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> This product is great!</li>
            <li> However, I found that if you don&#x27;t keep the trimmer perfectly perpendicular to your face at all times the cutters rock forward and give you too close of a shave.  </li>
            <li> I do not recommend this, would not buy again, and hope this helps someone.more curvy at my cheeks, rather than at perfect angles.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gimmick at best.</li>
            <li> Perfect for a stubbly shave.</li>
            <li> The laser feature is awesome.  </li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s me dreaming, it works perfectly as a trimmer.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I have ever had.  </li>

            <li> This one sounded impressive and I figured the brand means good</li>
            <li> Once I got the hang of it, it works beautifully.</li>
            <li> and it works great for that.</li>
            <li> and it works great for that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Performance-wise I have been quite happy with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this beard trimmer to anyone, its a great product.</li>
            <li> I trimmed my beard and also used it for a haircut with great satisfaction.  </li>
            <li> This is great and the battery holds a charge for quite awhile.  </li>
            <li> Great trimer.</li>
            <li> Works great if you don&#x27;t mind clippers against the skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for stubble</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Great feeling during the shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> , laser looks great</li>
            <li> Great beard-shaper.</li>
            <li> The laser guide is a great addition.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for about 1 month and have experienced no issues.  </li>
            <li> I just used this trimmer a couple of times but it works great on my beard.</li>
            <li> Holds charge and cuts great</li>
            <li> It fits great in the hand.</li>
            <li> Great seller 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Great product at a Great Price.</li>
            <li> Everything works great.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s a very nice looking trimmer too.</li>
            <li> The blades need no oil which is very nice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe you can use the laser if you go for one of those perfectly trimmed chin strapped looks, but I doubt you&#x27;ll even be able to use that because it doesn&#x27;t trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> great product and a good shave</li>
            <li> And, I keep my beard more curvy at my cheeks, rather than at perfect angles.  </li>
            <li> It works wonderfully for a fellow like me, who has a scraggly beard with curly hair of many dimensions.</li>
            <li> Take my word for it, he WILL love you even more !!!</li>
            <li> That probably isn&#x27;t good for you, even though it&#x27;s a low-powered laser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a good value.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The laser doesn&#x27;t work as good as advertised.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall good product</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a good beard trimmer, I would recommend this for that reason, not for &amp;#34;precision laser technology&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It has been a really good experience buying this product.</li>
            <li> Yes good product for the money</li>
            <li> Once you do it just doesn&#x27;t do anything good.</li>
            <li> and I loved it.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a good looking trimmer</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s good for a one or two day after look, but</li>
            <li> Everything about it is good.  </li>
            <li> Its good.</li>
            <li> An adjustment wheel on the trimmer provides good control over how closely it will clip hair.  </li>
            <li> There are a lot of good setting for this</li>
            <li> The trimmer is good, comes with two attachments.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery lasts a good amount of time.  </li>
            <li> but the trimmer it&#x27;s good, really good.</li>
            <li> Basically its a good shaver.  </li>
            <li> The full hour charge is awesome...</li>
            <li> Very good and smooth shaving</li>
            <li> More than happy with this product.</li>
            <li> The two attachments are ok, the great part about these is that there is a depth adjustment on the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Great trimmer, just would appreciate a more ample set of guards for a longer beard than those provided.</li>
            <li> impressive, love the light</li>
            <li> Very happy with it on my first use.</li>
            <li> Great product and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Powerful trimming tool, very accurate and attractive!</li>
            <li> Using no blade covers, you can achieve the five o&#x27;clock shadow look and the precision is amazing.</li>
            <li> Great beard trimmer with precise length control.</li>
            <li> Great quality, laser light helps those who may struggle with close up vision to achieve a sharper / straighter line.</li>
            <li> Nicely designed and durable.  </li>
            <li> The lazer guide is not that handy.</li>
            <li> It just cuts nice and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> everything is handy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall he loved it, we both think the lasers are just magic</li>
            <li> The laser guide function is extremely handy for getting a well defined beard shape.  </li>
            <li> I have been getting lots of complements on my beard since using this (more just that my beard/ or style looks good).  </li>
            <li> The laser guide seemed handy, but didnt speed up the process and attempted to solve an accuracy problem I did not have</li>
            <li> For the money you would also expect this unit to come with some kind of travel case.</li>
            <li> Glad he was so good at it.</li>
            <li> The product is nice except for the:&lt;br /&gt;1.Sometimes</li>
            <li> I really liked this product......</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather have a trimmer that effectively guided the hair up into the guides</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather have a trimmer that effectively guided the hair up into the guides</li>
            <li> laser is a nice novelty and works well</li>
            <li> I really liked it&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good, need more time to learn to use it.</li>
            <li> Works well, recharges nicely</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I can definitely live with the cons and am very happy with the quality of the trimmer.</li>
            <li> I found the battery life is good, and this pouch makes it an easy on the go</li>
            <li> My son in law got the best deal since I gave him my old trimmer...</li>
            <li> /&gt;The light is too bright.</li>
            <li> so out of date, it&#x27;s important to a man not to choose to look like (even if we all loved him)</li>
            <li> good product the laser light will help in precision....</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is, by far, the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Had been looking for a nice beard trimmer for some time and opted for this Philips Norelco model mostly based on the reviews I read and watched online.</li>
            <li> This is a good unique trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Trimmer works great but the laser is more a fancy add on then truly useful.</li>
            <li> that are all perfect and squarish and for hipster mustaches like no other.</li>
            <li> The trimmer itself is very light.</li>
            <li> so it is very comfortable to carry.</li>
            <li> Very smooth with no pulling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Trims the beard very smoothly...</li>
            <li> Product is super good.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see that it just didn&#x27;t do a very good job.</li>
            <li> this one is a huge improvement!  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> This one goes to the top though.</li>
            <li> satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> i have a Remington and cut much better than this.  </li>
            <li> This does an excellent job of trimming &amp; keeping beard all at same length.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are some people who do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m quite happy with this trimmer, and I really don&#x27;t have any complaints about it.</li>
            <li> This is on the better end of those, and in the price range for this series-</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> sure that moving the trimmer also moves the laser...</li>
            <li> Before I knew it I had lost any hope of achieving coveted Top Gun status.</li>
            <li> nothing outstanding.</li>
            <li> My beard looks more even on both sides of my face then it ever has before.  </li>
            <li> The whole razor is waterproof which is great for cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Overall, an excellent beard trimmer!</li>
            <li> I called after the 10th day and they told me \\&quot;its being processed and will take 3 more days.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I told the customer service rep that whatever they were getting paid, Philips lost more money paying them to avoid paying a return to me.</li>
            <li> Th laser is a neat innovation which in time I am sure I will adapt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I am satisfied with my puchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But when I went to order it, I noticed that the price more than tripled.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I do notice that the setting it works best on is simple stubble.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to make the guard give an even cut on all parts of the beard, or maybe my face might just be weird.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> think you will be pleased if you pick up this razor.</li>
            <li> It has no lubrication requirements, time will tell if that is ok.  </li>
            <li> At this price point I was expecting a bit more.</li>
            <li> I now do it myself and have more than paid for this trimmer.</li>
            <li> There are better ones out there</li>
            <li> Device can use more power.</li>
            <li> THE MAN IN YOUR LIFE WILL LOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;garunteed</li>
            <li> i use this trimmer the most</li>
            <li> Maybe it would work better for a thicker beard?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really more of a stubble styler, for stubble length savants.</li>
            <li> but I  wasn&#x27;t sure about the laser.</li>
            <li> Some better than others.</li>
            <li> but the laser is too bright to be useful for me.</li>
            <li> I find it easier to use without the laser and there is a model that doesn&#x27;t have it so that would have been a better buy.</li>
            <li> We really do love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously I don&#x27;t use it, but I love the effects and looks it gives my husband!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied with the quality and function of the BT9285.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better beard trimmer for my needs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sold on the laser-guided trimmer as being more than a gimmick.</li>
            <li> All in all there are better trimmers out there</li>
            <li> that offer more for the money.</li>
            <li> awesome only for beard/mustache not for haircutting....</li>
            <li> I actually enjoyed the trimmer.</li>
            <li> I am sure I will get better at using it to make a level cut with time.</li>
            <li> The Trimmer has a nice weight to it and feels comfortable in my hand when using it.</li>
            <li> If I want to limit my beard length to about an inch or so, that is okay.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, a good, powerful and purposeful trimmer.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and looks good.</li>
            <li> it is good and easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> My husband is enjoying it....</li>
            <li> Love how it has the two options between cordless n using it with the cord in...</li>
            <li> he was HOT!!!, \\&quot;Mac\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy without being clunky, with a very straightforward design.</li>
            <li> a beard trimmer could be cool, this is the ONE for sure!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It can be rinsed clean, which is nice.</li>
            <li> slim trimmer, works great, washable, and high tech....</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and very useful.  </li>
            <li> But the laser is just a cool (and possibly hazardous to your eyes) gimmick, and this thing is out-performed by a $25 Wahl Lithium beard trimmer when it comes to close-cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But the laser is just a cool (and possibly hazardous to your eyes) gimmick, and this thing is out-performed by a $25 Wahl Lithium beard trimmer when it comes to close-cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The include detail-er trimmer comb is awesome for getting the mustache trimmed though it does require more care than the other beard comb.  </li>
            <li> But if you like a variety of short lengths, the ability of a fine trim blade that you don&#x27;t have to interchange, and a good battery life (mine lasted 2 weeks before I decided to recharge) then this could still be a good option for you.</li>
            <li> i read that it cuts as short as .2mm, but i didnt notice any difference from my old trimmer, but anyway its a very good trimmer, battery is great</li>
            <li> It does not feel like I trimmed afterwords which is great if you have sensitive skin or are prone to ingrown hairs (which I am).  </li>
            <li> The laser is neat, but since I don&#x27;t like to trim close to the skin with an electric it is a feature U admire more than I enjoy.</li>
            <li> It seems very well made, and it feels good and fits well in my hand.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair for me to adjust for the laser feature, but I can&#x27;t see much of a use for it unless you are a guy</li>
            <li> They all work OK, but nothing to get too excited about.  </li>
            <li> And, with the chargeable feature, it makes it easy to use wherever and whenever throughout the house, car, office, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> Also cleaning the blade is easy.</li>
            <li> The light does not extend very far beyond either edge of the side of the clipper when it&#x27;s touching your face, so it&#x27;s not like it does you very much good anyway.  </li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t for the high price, it would make a good gag gift.</li>
            <li> I liked the Laser marker very much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty sure MOST people make shave movements that are perpendicular to the razor blade, otherwise disaster ensues...</li>
            <li> The guard is secure and easily adjustable.  </li>
            <li> it is awesome and take less time for chraging</li>
            <li> you decide to use this without using the laser guide, the trimmer is fine.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use guards for trimming his beard because part of the issue with his face is a large scar on his chin that he prefers covered, but I do like to keep the guards handy for touch ups on the sides if he feels like doing them.</li>
            <li> In my case the device trimmer below the light bar and was perhaps faulty.</li>
            <li> They lock securely in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but overall a great product.</li>
            <li> No add on comb available</li>
            <li> The colors are nice, and it has a really sleek, high-tech look to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> There is a smooth gliding that occurs with use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Philips has a 45-day risk free guarantee.</li>
            <li> but it does cone in handy when you need a straight line shave.</li>
            <li> The laser guide gives you a extremely precise line to ensure accuracy.</li>
            <li> The trimmer tools are great and do offer different lengths</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Just as important to a woman not to get stuck in a \\&quot;style decade\\&quot; which is oh</li>
            <li> would be a great graduation present looking forward to this spring!&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> overall great in every aspect.  </li>
            <li> It is comfortable to hold during use,  </li>
            <li> light that lights up when you are charing it and when it needs a charge.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The laser, a nice touch, really assists when you are trimming your neckline in the mirror.</li>
            <li> Its great over all just wish the guards were designed different.</li>
            <li> 0.4 mm blade not so smooth.</li>
            <li> Not feeling comfortable if we use it at Level 1</li>
            <li> Works great and is a solid made trimmer!</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are no snags or pulls on his sensitive skin, and it gets fairly close.</li>
            <li> far as mechanics are concerned this is a good razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is the beard trimmer you give your husband if you are confident that when he looks really good, he will still stick around because he loves YOU and only you!</li>
            <li> The auto adjustment is very useful and convenient.</li>
            <li> Best birthday present, by far!!</li>
            <li> ok thats normal. :)</li>
            <li> Hopefully, down the road, I&#x27;ll be able to be as happy with reliability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the additional cost!</li>
            <li> This trimmer is definitely the best one I&#x27;ve owned so far.</li>
            <li> Cuts clean and works like you would hope it would.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like opening the guard every stroke to clean it out</li>
            <li> It gives me a clean and uniform shave.</li>
            <li> This handy feature is basically a pop out laser that emits a horizontal beam that allows you to set your edges with beautiful precision and accuracy, a true blessing for those who take this level of grooming seriously.  </li>
            <li> This machine does exactly as it says, and the option of having the trimmer side available simply by turning it 180 degrees is great.</li>
            <li> Its very ergonomic, which means its very comfortable to handle and use.</li>
            <li> they really need is a trimmer that simultaneously shaves the other side of your face to make it perfectly symmetrical...</li>
            <li> I still couldn&#x27;t figure out the perfect way to use laser and it&#x27;s really hard to avoid them getting into eye as the reflection from mirror can fall on eye.</li>
            <li> The laser is only good for marketing.</li>
            <li> The laser function is a cool toy, but not something I would depend on.</li>
            <li> But on the cool factor its all five stars alone.</li>
            <li> The closest setting did not trim my full beard in the sightest.  </li>
            <li> Fortunaly, the BT9285/9100 came along and I am very well satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I packaged it up and sent it back after a good cleaning.</li>
            <li> I do use the laser just to feel cool though.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with how nice it is.</li>
            <li> The led display is cool.</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> to adjust (nearly as easy as the Remington, although that one was amazingly easy)&lt;br /&gt;Feels very solid</li>
            <li> Despite what some of the other reviews say this is a great beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> Adequate for shaping your neckline, or trimming your beard.</li>
            <li> It is pretty accurate.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m sawing a piece of wood I can barely stay on a line that&#x27;s drawn with pencil... and a moving laser target that&#x27;s being stabilized by my own hand....</li>
            <li> Good trimmer for long stabble</li>
            <li> Love my new razor.  </li>
            <li> The laser guide allows for more precision and the digital display makes viewing the comb length setting quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Great if you like tons of mess when you trim your bird...</li>
            <li> precise, the power level indicator works well, and the feel in the hand is very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This lightweight trimmer give a very close cut, smooth.  </li>
            <li> This razor charges really fast and cuts evenly and smooth without snagging or pulling out hairs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bright enough to be really distracting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one does a far better job and requires fewer attachments than the cheaper ones.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my old variable length beard trimmer battery was no longer charging, and the reviews suggested it would be better than the Wahl beard</li>
            <li> It cuts far more efficiently than any trimmer I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> all this said, the laser was useful but its not needed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was surprised that the trimmer did not come with a case, and perhaps some more attachments.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I miss about the Norelco G370 is the nice charging dock.</li>
            <li> The fact that something we shave with merits the addition of a laser is a pretty cool concept.</li>
            <li> This is super-helpful for trimming up the back/bottom of my head after a fresh haircut and my sideburns are always dialed in.    </li>
            <li> A razor blade works far better than using this &amp;#34;laser guided&amp;#34; trimmer for the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco Beard Trimmer 9100 is the creme de la creme of great beard trimmers, with its laser control and the 17 settings it offers, as well as the fact that it can simply be rinsed off under the faucet to be cleaned.&lt;br</li>
            <li> design overall is nice.</li>
            <li> It should cut better than my 10 year old one.</li>
            <li> Laser isn&#x27;t really useful, miss having a shaver attachment</li>
            <li> The laser is useful and pops up with a spring at the touch of your finger like a pen.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for over 15 years now, and this is easily the best trimmer for one major reason, no snags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The trimmer itself works well, but the laser guide is two bright and wide for a clean line, and really only works well when trimming on the top sides of the beard-cheek line.</li>
            <li> but i mostly use it for touching up and keeping the lines... laser sharp.</li>
            <li> the battery seem to drain pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Other than that this is a good unit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another annoyance is the power button seems quite finicky, and you have to press it in just the right spot to turn the trimmer on or off.</li>
            <li> This razor has a laser right?</li>
            <li> I always struggle with that, and the precise straight lines help you to cut exactly what you want.</li>
            <li> It is much easier to adjust and clean.</li>
            <li> And, unlike my last trimmer, this trimmer&#x27;s settings are very easy to read.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a pretty version of my old trimmer that has a better battery and cuts only slightly better.</li>
            <li> Very good, item I just wish have more cutting levels</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> It cuts very straight lines and cuts close.  </li>
            <li> i like it very much...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It cuts hair very fast too no wast of time.</li>
            <li> For a moderately priced beard trimmer, this Philips Norelco gets the job done and is super easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great trimming blades, hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin, though the plastic guards are a bit hard on my skin.</li>
            <li> but i dont use, the trimmer isnt small as i noticed in some reviews, but looks nice and its smooth and make jobe very fast.</li>
            <li> once he tries this amazing trimmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Husband really likes it!</li>
            <li> BUT, with that said, this model is only $20.00 more than the 5100, so you might want to give this model a try anyway.</li>
            <li> However, if you do happen to decide to purchase this beard trimmer, I am pretty confident that you won&#x27;t be sending it back.</li>
            <li> However, if you do happen to decide to purchase this beard trimmer, I am pretty confident that you won&#x27;t be sending it back.</li>
            <li> well, and holds a charge for more than enough time to trim up his beard.</li>
            <li> You can definitely get more quality for your money out there.</li>
            <li> I only used it twice, and it trims and cuts much better.  </li>
            <li> Being able to plug it in for use is a definite plus.  </li>
            <li> It arrived in a timely fashion and is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a pretty neat feature.</li>
            <li> At higher settings, it does not cut at all.  </li>
            <li> I still need to go over my beard several times to get most of it and even then I find I still miss spots or have hairs that I just can&#x27;t seem to to trim.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery life is ok and the power enough to keep a short beard trimmed without any problems, but it has problems with thicker and more hair, requiring you to rinse the trimmer to keep going with the thicker beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The was exactly as described</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using this and with summer here i have removed my entire beard and now use it as a body trimmer, sideburns and neck trimmer where it excels.</li>
            <li> This my first trimmer.</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve bought numerous cheaper trimmers (spending far more tnan if I&#x27;d bought a quality one to begin with!).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;55 days after I originally purchased the trimmer (10 days after the guarantee ended), I got an automated email from Philips asking me to complete a survey and product review.</li>
            <li> /&gt;55 days after I originally purchased the trimmer (10 days after the guarantee ended), I got an automated email from Philips asking me to complete a survey and product review.</li>
            <li> Sure there&#x27;s a laser guide, but missiles simply went astray as fast as I could fire them.</li>
            <li> First of all its a pure gimmick.</li>
            <li> The major issue I am seeing with this is that it does not glide across my face smoothly.  </li>
            <li> I have nothing positive to say about this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I liked my 30 year old Norelco better, this one seems to be designed so a person cannot cut themselves, so it is hard to get a close shave when trimming your mustache or beard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why the hell I thought it would be a good idea to purchase a beard trimmer with a laser,</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m showing my age, but I&#x27;ve been begging for Philips/Norelco to go back to their T-series, where the guard was high quality, the length clicks were meaningful, and there weren&#x27;t gimmicks to add bulk to the size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> with the numerous length adjustments and design of the two combs, a neatly trimmed beard and mustache are easily achieved.</li>
            <li> but the accessory plastic comb is fragile and easy to breake.</li>
            <li> A charge seems last a good long time too.  </li>
            <li> Of course, the laser feature adds a certain &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; appeal, but</li>
            <li> But this works great for trimming up or at least knocking it down so that you can get a close shave. :)</li>
            <li> This is a product for those who like to keep their lines nice and tight.  </li>
            <li> Yeah, it&#x27;s a good all around beard trimmer with solid power, 17 locked in length settings, dual sided trimmer with self-sharpening blades that requires no oil or maintenance (love this) but what it comes down to is that you are paying a premium for 1 key feature - a built in laser (class 1) guide.  </li>
            <li> I think this would work fine for a short beard.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works fine, and the two different sides for trimming and detailing work well.</li>
            <li> the trimmer allows extremely close cuts, so you may take off more than intended the first time it is used.</li>
            <li> For my trimming needs, I found the laser guide to be of little use to be honest.</li>
            <li> So I pulled out the Wahl beard trimmer (without head-attachments) and went over the same areas, and I could see a huge difference in how much hair was removed.</li>
            <li> The blades fit in to trim his mustaches above his lip very well too which has been a design issue in some trimmers.</li>
            <li> Very cool.&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s essentially mostly trimming pretty short hair, 2 or 3-day growth, without any of the head-attachments, just using the bare metal shears.</li>
            <li> This is really, really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You very well might find the laser guide to be useful/helpful.</li>
            <li> It helps you eye things straight, or you can use it with a eyeliner pencil for a straight line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d use the laser guide on this thing as much as I use the laser guide on my table</li>
            <li> Its really lightweight which as a woman who blow dries and curls her hair, I can understand how a man would want a lighter beard tool.</li>
            <li> real feature on this item is the straight line laser that helps give you a line for the blade.</li>
            <li> My thoughts are that really this is not needed.</li>
            <li> For $90 I expected better.  </li>
            <li> I put the device to lowest possible setting to get a light trim but have to keep going over my beard time and again</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t trim much, beard remained darker than I wanted.</li>
            <li> I really like this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t buy into the laser..</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You could get a much cheaper beard clipper without all the gimmicks that aren&#x27;t practical.</li>
            <li> You could get a much cheaper beard clipper without all the gimmicks that aren&#x27;t practical.</li>
            <li> guard is the same cheap plastic that Philips/Norelco has been using for years, so you can count on it losing a tooth or two before your warranty is</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have a use for the laser guide</li>
            <li> The pivoting head works really well</li>
            <li> but it really does help me guide the trimmer and keep the cuts straight.  </li>
            <li> Had a goatee or beard for over 20 years straight.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> so I really needed to replace mine.</li>
            <li> REALLY into grooming.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to accidentally trim too much of my beard.</li>
            <li> no need for the laser really</li>
            <li> Straight lines everytime</li>
            <li> Much needed, my VanDyke was getting way out of control.</li>
            <li> Barbers want too much to trim it.</li>
            <li> The only difference appears to be the laser guide, which looks and sounds pretty cool...</li>
            <li> I have used this a few times and was surprised at how good of a trimmer it was.</li>
            <li> In fact, a straight edge shave by a barber is almost a welcome chance to the unnecessary technology that is coming out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t spread out far enough in either direction to be able to see it.&lt;br /&gt;The indicator that shows what adjustment the guide is on is backlit and the backlight goes off when not in use.</li>
            <li> As an aside, my old Lithium powered Wahl beard trimmer that cost about $25, powers right through without any slowdown.</li>
            <li> Apparently another feature that will quickly be ignored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This beard trimmer has a good grip that allows the hairs to be brushed off (unlike some other trimmers - Wahl lithium</li>
            <li> if you want it longer than that, it&#x27;s better to look at one of their other products.</li>
            <li> and I could use that just the same to create a clean edge.</li>
            <li> Not only that, but the motors run more smoothly, providing less shake and vibration in my hand.</li>
            <li> I have an old Remington that works much better on a beard that is 1/2 inch to 1 inch long</li>
            <li> trimmer overall with some nice extra features, you decide if its worth the extra $$.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no need to fool around with a brush to clean the blades on this trimmer, as I can just run it under the faucet, and in a few seconds it&#x27;s perfectly clean.</li>
            <li> If you have a hard time trimming straight lines or keeping things symetrical, it might be worth $20 more.  </li>
            <li> Now, though it&#x27;s a cool feature, I&#x27;m not convinced the laser guide is actually all that useful/helpful.</li>
            <li> Having a laser on this contraption is pretty weaksauce but it is an epic trimmer.</li>
            <li> My previous trimmer (the Norelco with the vacuum) could never do a good job trimming the moustache as my nose got in the way-</li>
            <li> And, if for some reason you don&#x27;t like it, or you find it doesn&#x27;t suit your particular needs</li>
            <li> And, if for some reason you don&#x27;t like it, or you find it doesn&#x27;t suit your particular needs</li>
            <li> Sir or Madam:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose this particular item (BT9285/41 9100) in hope of finding a beard trimmer that functions to my satisfaction.  </li>
            <li> but I do like how quickly and quietly I can groom my beard.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The larger side to the trimmer blade cuts aggresively and quickly.  </li>
            <li> It is nothing more than a light behind a rotating wheel.</li>
            <li> main blade keeps falling off with the slightest movement.</li>
            <li> Granted this Philips Norelco model costs several times more, but it feels very solid</li>
            <li> If this particular feature appeals to you</li>
            <li> I have bought so many different trimmers then after a short time, get another.  </li>
            <li> (my larger hair clippers are much better at this function), and a vacuum to control the hair clippings.  </li>
            <li> (my larger hair clippers are much better at this function), and a vacuum to control the hair clippings.  </li>
            <li> The other needs more care to use as you can easily cut down to the skin depending on the angle</li>
            <li> , to get to the point, those sorts of looks on those men are very hard to maintain without a really good beard trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Consequently, I highly recommend giving this trimmer a try.</li>
            <li> Consequently, I highly recommend giving this trimmer a try.</li>
            <li> This is a high tech beard trimmer, with plenty of adjustable settings.  </li>
            <li> i highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> had high hopes for this Philips Norelco trimmer though.</li>
            <li> Figure the odds on doing precisely that with a beard trimmer that has a 6&amp;#34; wide laser that you&#x27;re pointing at your face.</li>
            <li> However, is it worth the extra $15+ for the 9100 over the 5100?</li>
            <li> Its good but not great, I thought it wil have more type of trimmers and my old trimmer seems to do the same work except for all the different lenght.</li>
            <li> I do like the smaller size of the head on the beard trimmer than on my hair clippers, and the trim head is definitely useful.  </li>
            <li> I do like the smaller size of the head on the beard trimmer than on my hair clippers, and the trim head is definitely useful.  </li>
            <li> ok for beard purpose as long as it remain short</li>
            <li> It just glides along the top of the beard and you hear a few hairs getting cut here and there.</li>
            <li> short, I think the laser is a novelty and not truly useful.  </li>
            <li> Quiet and powerful.</li>
            <li> then it&#x27;s definitely worth the extra 20 or so</li>
            <li> According to the instructions, you must run down the full charge during the first use before recharging.  </li>
            <li> cleanly with a single pass, motor doesn&#x27;t feel like it is straining&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because it moves along with the trimmer, and only makes a single straight line, you&#x27;re probably better off using it to set your lines, draw them in with your significant other&#x27;s eyeliner (or dry-erase marker, as the case may be) and then use those lines as your guide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The battery life is good as from one charge it will last me several weeks using every other day or so.</li>
            <li> used the 9100 five times on a single charge, and it seems to have more uses left.</li>
            <li> I really like the way the head flips around to present either the wide or narrow shears, great for shaping the mustache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m genuinely puzzled by what purpose it&#x27;s supposed to serve, other than verifying that you&#x27;ve made jagged edges.</li>
            <li> and I buy a new trimmer every couple of years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep it because I did need a new variable length trimmer for the goatee</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep it because I did need a new variable length trimmer for the goatee</li>
            <li> But I thought I&#x27;d keep it since I needed a new one.</li>
            <li> This is a new trimmer.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t start with its power button no matter how much you press it: you have to open the laser and close it for the whole device to power up.</li>
            <li> trimmer is also comparatively quiet, and is powerful and sharp, and makes quick work of trimming my beard.</li>
            <li> However, after the 45 days past, I gave up and reported Philips to the Better Business Bureau.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like to keep a short hair beard and most other brands</li>
            <li> The pictures displayed on Amazon show perfect looking beards with well crafted lines; however, every time I used the laser guide I walked away feeling disappointed concerning</li>
            <li> You have to make sure to spend less than a second on any particular area or risk getting a bald spot.</li>
            <li> First off there are no beards in my household, but we have always had a beard trimmer on hand to trim up side burns and the back of the neck between hair cuts.</li>
            <li> I have to make down and up manually by hand to be accurate with blade trimmer.</li>
            <li> The Beard comb/detail comb is fantastic, but its plastic so over time will this get damaged or worn down?</li>
            <li> It has 17 length settings, which are in very small increments, so I can easily set it to cut my beard to the exact length I like.</li>
            <li> My wife bought me this new laser trimmer as a gift since my trimmer is old.</li>
            <li> If you use the guard without the full enclosure you will likely gouge a big hunk of your hair out...</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cutter, used without a guard, can be rotated to either expose the wide blades that are good for neck or jaw lines, or the smaller cutting blade, good for areas such as sideburns or a mustache.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not bad but like any other trimmer with sheep price also no need at all for the laser</li>
            <li> That said, it is slightly less bulky than the 9100 and has better grips on the back side.</li>
            <li> easy flip it around depending on if you need it to be small or normal.</li>
            <li> It also only goes to level 7 on it which happens to be the shortest I have been keeping mine lately, which is fairly short still; so if you like a more full beard, this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> I does have a light, presumably to guide your trimming, but you&#x27;ll soon ignore it, as it does little to improve the task.</li>
            <li> then draw a line that is obviously not going to be easy to reproduce on the other side of your face and shave to that line...?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to report them to the BBB and write a negative review on their site to get them to honor their guarantee, then they censor the reviews of their products - completely unethical.ast, I gave up and reported Philips to the Better Business Bureau.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Upgraded from a 3 year old Norelco and their is no difference.</li>
            <li> The laser is very cumbersome to use longest comb is only 3/8 inch.</li>
            <li> trimmer cuts through hair like a knife through soft butter.</li>
            <li> I even went so far as to replace it with another when it wore out.</li>
            <li> far these have met my expectations.</li>
            <li> much experience with trimmers while getting haircuts tells me this is possible.  </li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t imagine actually trimming a real beard with this.</li>
            <li> The numbers allegedly represent length in millimeters, but that seems to translate to \\&quot;short beard\\&quot;, \\&quot;very short beard\\&quot;, \\&quot;are you growing a beard?\\&quot;, and 14 more settings of stubble.</li>
            <li> I needed something to replace my Remington Titanium trimmer which was about 2 years old and no longer held a charge.</li>
            <li> and I expect it to last much</li>
            <li> The laser has no side to side projection once you get near your face.</li>
            <li> Completely gapped up my beard as soon as I started upwards along my jawbone contour.</li>
            <li> I did one side and got out my old trimmer and finished the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for 3 months so far</li>
            <li> settings allow you to get close to the sensitive areas around the nose and also let you regulate the length of your side burns.</li>
            <li> My old trimmer&#x27;s battery was dying</li>
            <li> good trimmer laser is useless</li>
            <li> I was already regretting that she spent that much money on something that seemed like a decent idea.</li>
            <li> It comes with a laser, which provides a straight line for cutting a clean neck line---a nice feature that I&#x27;ve not seen in other trimmers.</li>
            <li> Seems to be of a very high quality and functionally, far better than any other systems I had purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> Tested it and found it to be underpowered for my moderately thick beard and the attachments are very flimsy - I&#x27;ve had other trimmers from Philips and they broke very easily, but are not covered in the warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does a decent job on the mustache, but the hair surrounding the face is left wanting.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is essentially the exact same trimmer as the 5100 model, except this model has the pop-up laser guide, and there are color differences.</li>
            <li> Why take turbo mode out, that&#x27;s a big mistake since all the older trimmers had it</li>
            <li> It seems a reason to take a beard trimmer to a new level of technological advance when really there is not much room for growth.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;laser&#x27; is kind of useless and it seems to be limited to helping to trim sideburns at the right level.</li>
            <li> The laser does allow you to see where a straight line would be (theoretically), but, being attached to the clippers, your frame of reference (the laser line) constantly moves as you move the clippers to trim/ detail.  </li>
            <li> so I can access a narrow blade that gets into harder to reach places (or more stubborn hairs</li>
            <li> much cheaper 2 yr old trimmer didn&#x27;t leave occasional long hairs on my beard as this one did: I discovered this AFTER being at work all day.</li>
            <li> it is getting very hot in few minutes..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fine with that, there isn&#x27;t much use for cutting straight lines.</li>
            <li> Very little hair was removed from my full beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Anyway, apart from that the guides keep everything trim and the length settings are solid and clear.</li>
            <li> It requires you use the trimmer for 3-weeks, then you have to call to have them process the guarantee and the package that you send the trimmer back in must be post marked by the 45th day after the date of your purchase</li>
            <li> I currently use an old Norelco.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;beard comb&amp;#34; barely cuts my stubble at the lowest setting.  </li>
            <li> Barely.</li>
            <li> which I feel like many plug in razors have poor</li>
            <li> Have used it, adequate but not more.</li>
            <li> My other Andis trimmer cuts much closer than this trimmer however than this Norelco causes NO irritation of my skin.  </li>
            <li> Admittedly, I&#x27;m too lazy to actually &amp;#34;shave.&amp;#34; As in baby smooth no facial hair at all shave.</li>
            <li> The laser on the trimmer has some value other than just being a freaking laser, yes it does move with the trimmer, but you can use it verify that you have straight</li>
            <li> and it remains there versus other trimmers i have used that if you apply to much pressure they might change settings.</li>
            <li> Before with a full beard it would last me about a week before i needed to charge but only used for a few minutes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first I was really excited about this, but upon first use my disappointment nearly drowned me like a yodeler in a horse trough.</li>
            <li> but as long as you have a clear mirror, steady hand and put attention to what you are doing you really do not need the laser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it that&#x27;s really worth anything.</li>
            <li> I used the &amp;#34;trimming&amp;#34; guide (or whatever it&#x27;s called) the first time, just to cut back the length of my beard a little.  </li>
            <li> They usually offer above average products that last longer that most.</li>
            <li> and the blade is pretty smooth cutting too.</li>
            <li> Just let them dry completely before putting them away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charges</li>
            <li> The small trimmer on the opposite side of the trimmer is extremely useful for details and for trimming my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> : NO TURBO MODE, no vacuum so hair drops all over the place, Laser is pointless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just be aware that the laser guide is gimmicky and what you are acquiring with this product is a quality razor that is quiet, provides a long battery life, and is resilient to be dropped onto the bathroom floor.</li>
            <li> The attachments are fine too (though putting them on and taking them off is a bit clumsy compared to other trimmers I&#x27;ve tested).  </li>
            <li> Wish it had all the features that the lower models support, such as the vacuum.</li>
            <li> only drawback is, as I have a fairly long beard, the guards are not long enough.</li>
            <li> After putting several nearly bald lines in my face either due to rocking it forward, or bunching up my face skin in front of the blade, I had to shave all the hair off my face to make it &amp;#34;even&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The different length options are in such small increments that it&#x27;s really unnoticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Aside from the pop-up laser -- which I find insanely gimmicky and worthless -- this trimmer has given me the best trim I&#x27;ve had in a long time.</li>
            <li> I especially appreciate the lights that tell me how long I need till the next charge.</li>
            <li> Plus you can keep the short parts short and the longer parts exactly as long as you like.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Self sharpening, washable, turn around 2 size blades, long lasting battery charge, and even the every now an then used laser are all big pluses !!!</li>
            <li> I find that very little precision is really gained with the laser.</li>
            <li> you cannot be perfectly flat against at all moments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Study and should last a long time.</li>
            <li> After the investment in the rest of the unit why not top it off with a decent guard that can make the actual trimmer work well for its intended purpose.</li>
            <li> Battery last very long, but no boost mode</li>
            <li> The tiny travel one I have that runs on AA batteries has more cutting power than this one.</li>
            <li> This unit is consistently powerful and provides very even cutting.</li>
            <li> More disappointing though, is that the finished length is nothing approaching</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally, it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re leveling picture frames on a long wall; the distances on my face aren&#x27;t long enough that I need a laser guide.  </li>
            <li> You have a tiny 1&amp;#34; wide blinding red line on your skin</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, if you want a clean shave you still need to go back behind with some other razor.  </li>
            <li> So if you don&#x27;t need the laser guide (and don&#x27;t care about the digital display), the 5100 is the better, and less expensive, choice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As most other reviewers here have already stated, the laser feature is useless .</li>
            <li> Obviously, as you move the trimmer, the laser moves too, making it tough to get an accurate line and rendering the feature pretty useless.</li>
            <li> like the fact that the plastic guard is set in a fixed position depending on what setting you choose on the led display, as opposed to my old beard trimmer which had only a few settings, and was not fixed, which usually led to a disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> beard isn&#x27;t long.  </li>
            <li> I use this to shave my face and noggin after a long weekend without shaving, and to shape the goatee.</li>
            <li> asked why they always put me on hold so long.</li>
            <li> battery stays charged for a LONG time, and charges within a couple hours when it does require recharging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It take me a long time to line up my beard now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using trimmers for a long time.</li>
            <li> Runs for a long time between charges, but can also be used plugged</li>
            <li> maybe thats why the battery has lasted me so long without recharging.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> Definitely not what I expected, considering the advertising brags!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the downside, cuttings tend to accumulate around the blades, and the combs can be difficult to remove to clean the trimmings.</li>
            <li> Expected better cutting</li>
            <li> I have owned much worse made products overall but really?  </li>
            <li> (my other Norelco with the vacuum goes to 18mm).&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Charge takes just a few minutes and last for several days</li>
            <li> Other trimmers have done a much better job at cutting my stubble at all length settings.  </li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s possible when putting on the attachment to accidentally push down on the laser and make it pop up.  </li>
            <li> I thought this trimmer would be pretty standard, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> The smaller side also cuts well, with less aggressive nature so it doesnt leave scapes and cuts when it is used to trim the edges clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Weak power and can&#x27;t cut through a real mans beard</li>
            <li> My next trimmer will be the cheaper versions, this is a little overpriced.</li>
            <li> Not a big deal, but a little annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But with a little care, the result is just what I&#x27;ve been looking for, and have been unable to easily achieve with any of my other trimmers.</li>
            <li> I had to report them to the BBB and write a negative review on their site to get them to honor their guarantee, then they censor the reviews of their products - completely unethical.</li>
            <li> I have several trimmers, some gathering dust, a few I still use.</li>
            <li> If this continues, within a few months, the thing will probably start falling off during regular use.</li>
            <li> If this continues, within a few months, the thing will probably start falling off during regular use.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a lot of different beard trimmers, but I&#x27;ve had few.</li>
            <li> It trims close enough that it does not look messy.  </li>
            <li> Does not trim beard as expected.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re careful about angle, no problem.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Laser is a gimmick, not really helpful.</li>
            <li> I do not like way it feels after a trim, rough and jagged.  </li>
            <li> Just as expected.</li>
            <li> the manual also warns you not to shine the laser IN your eye, but then you are expected to shine it roughly 2 inches away from your eye.  </li>
            <li> 110-220v power supply is usefull for travel but red laser marker isn&#x27;t as narrow as need.</li>
            <li> Use this trimmer every few days and after two months, still haven&#x27;t charged it a second time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is fancy and the battery does seem to last nicely so far ... but the beard guard was made poorly and fills with hair almost immediately.  </li>
            <li> And, once charged, this beard trimmer&#x27;s battery lasts about twice as long as the battery on my previous trimmer.</li>
            <li> (Just a cool looking gadget to get guys to pony up a little extra money, but are they in for a disappointment.)</li>
            <li> expected much better :(</li>
            <li> It cuts thick and thin hard, more than just a beard.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several inexpensive trimmers in the past.</li>
            <li> They said they were assisting other customers!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I confronted them that calling themselves &#x27;customer service&#x27; was a flimsy pretense to avoid taking care of customers and giving them the return they were promised.</li>
            <li> I am not really sure what I was expecting, but was left wanting.</li>
            <li> The laser is cool, but it could be positioned closer to the cutting line on the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> So on the other side I tried the other guard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sharp looking device, but it doesn&#x27;t even come with a case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;bare blade&amp;#34; setting gets extremely close, and the attachments can be dialed to the millimeter for precision trimming.</li>
            <li> couple other issues:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> only complaint is it doesnt have an adjustable length comb attatchment like alot of my other &amp;#34;beard trimmers&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> wide on one edge, narrow on the other, depending on the precision you need.  </li>
            <li> so it was not worth the additional price to me.  </li>
            <li> And, because my facial hair grows so slowly, I can get away with doing it once per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I hit a dense patch of hair growth, I can hear the motor slowing down.</li>
            <li> That rotating shears head is probably going to be a problem down the road.</li>
            <li> This replaces my wahl trimmer that I kicked down to my son.</li>
            <li> It does not say if you may recharge before running down the battery.  </li>
            <li> but it slows down my trimming..</li>
            <li> In this case, you need to take the attachment off, push the laser down again, and then replace the attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> instead I am reminded of how much of a failure I am at personal beard care, and I should probably shave it all off anyway</li>
            <li> This one lasted less than two months.</li>
            <li> I asked the rep if they were, and if so, how they could be, satisfied holding such a terrible job where they just lie to and frustrate customers.</li>
            <li> Get that \\&quot;I haven&#x27;t shaved for a day and half look\\&quot; that all the coolest actors and rock stars have.</li>
            <li> Less than my expectation.</li>
            <li> so I used the open one and it is not good for beards, or anything else</li>
            <li> Also, after several tries at using it, I really think the laser function is gimmicky and worthless.</li>
            <li> Wish it had an option for length longer than 7mm since I like to keep my beard a little longer than that</li>
            <li> It seems as if the trimmer did not cut as well as other clippers I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> The instruction manual says that this laser-guided trimmer &amp;#34;may take a little getting used to.&amp;#34;  I find that to be an understatement.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for the next development of high quality technological advances in razors the Philips Norelco Beard Trimmer will leave you sadly disappointed.</li>
            <li> The reason appears to be the thickness of the metal shears; the Wahl is finer and thinner, so it gets MUCH closer to the skin (without cutting the skin).</li>
            <li> Battery life is much longer than cutting three styles in one session.  </li>
            <li> It does have a front blocker that prevents cutting too close when you rock the handle forward or bunch skin up in front of the cutters, but I feel like it doesn&#x27;t really guide the hair into the cutters</li>
            <li> real gripe comes in with the cutting.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few trimmers on the market that works either plugged in or off the battery.</li>
            <li> Yes, this thing is built to withstand everyday use.</li>
            <li> Worse yet, it wouldn&#x27;t even shave off of the power cord unless (what was left of) the battery was fully charged.</li>
            <li> So far I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> I used it a few times</li>
            <li> Doesnt seem to mind thin, thick, soft, or stiff, it just cuts them all.  </li>
            <li> i like it but its not easy to use the laser guide.</li>
            <li> Attachments are not easy to put on or take off.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I thought was a bit gimmicky was the fake LED readout.</li>
            <li> As you put the clippers to your face, you can still see the laser, but it doesn&#x27;t really affect where your line is going to be because 1) the clippers are already cutting hair (too late for a frame of reference) and 2)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, the build quality of everything below the blade is unimpressive, the \\&quot;features\\&quot; are just plain silly, and the price is totally unjustified.</li>
            <li> It has everything I need, and very little I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s almost completely pointless since it does move with the trimmer.</li>
            <li> It is not adjustable past .4 mm which is rediculous, have it adjust to zero dummy</li>
            <li> usually i shave  my beard with gellet fusion in vacations, but when i am in work i use trimmers</li>
            <li> not sure why</li>
            <li> The laser is pointless, theres no need for it.  </li>
            <li> A fancy trimmer overall with an expensive price tag.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the tallest trimmer guide position is 7mm which is fairly small if you want a long beard</li>
            <li> It was pretty much worthless.</li>
            <li> Now the blades are dull again</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to worry about them going dull anytime soon.</li>
            <li> I imagine that when the battery is low, that slow-down is going to yank some hair instead of cutting it.</li>
            <li> And I can simply spin the cutting head around to the small/narrow blade to perform detail trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I told them that would be too late, it would be the 46th day</li>
            <li> cause it is a patchy beard and not a nice beard like the guys in the photo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And, honestly, I do not find myself using the laser when I am trying to straighten things up.  </li>
            <li> The unit works well for cutting facial hair, the laser is overrated</li>
            <li> The combs are too round and spaced poorly.</li>
            <li> Not amazing though.</li>
            <li> i mean it worked</li>
            <li> If/when it goes out from a battery failure I will attempt to replace it myself.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;detail comb&amp;#34; actually cuts at multiple lengths, but the finish is terrible.  </li>
            <li> battery is not good</li>
            <li> It is not good.</li>
            <li> the past I puchased a Norlco beard trimmer (model# T7900) which was unfortunately discontinued.  </li>
            <li> LED adjustment lights are very hard to read.  </li>
            <li> I digress, the laser on this beard trimmer is a little disappointing.</li>
            <li> over 6-weeks: approximately 18-20 trims.</li>
            <li> He felt the trimer was cutting unevenly</li>
            <li> The Wahl picked up and trimmed a lot, even going behind this Norelco.</li>
            <li> how horrible I was at shaving in a straight line.</li>
            <li> but it seemed unnecessary.  </li>
            <li> box touts the \\&quot;LED display\\&quot; which is literally an LED behind a plastic wheel with numbers that have an LCD font.</li>
            <li> Not great.</li>
            <li> how can i buy this accessory if is is broken.</li>
            <li> But this is by far the worst trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed with the Philips Norelco BT9285/41 9100 Beard Trimmer.</li>
            <li> I returned it and didn&#x27;t ask for an exchange as the laser was useless anyway.</li>
            <li> Flimsy and the laser is a useless gimmick.</li>
            <li> The laser is useless and the trimmer doesn&#x27;t cut that well ...  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a concern, but maybe I&#x27;m wrong about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a concern, but maybe I&#x27;m wrong about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> The rep replied that they were sorry that can&#x27;t be helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately with the attachments I find myself using an angle with the trimmer that subverts the cut length, that is I cut some spots shorter than it is supposed to allow.  </li>
            <li> This time around, the product is so cheesy, they should be ashamed of themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought it was just another useless bell and whistle</li>
            <li> The laser is useless and the trimmer doesn&#x27;t cut that well ...</li>
            <li> total crap !!</li>
            <li> The bad part is that the beard guard is also clunky, making it difficult to trim the mustache area specifically.</li>

            <li> so I looking to upgrade, Phillips employees must be on here leavings reviews because this is the worst beard trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible!</li>
            <li> This product has a lithium ion battery instead of the terrible NiCad batteries in the Remington</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just an awful design for beard trimming guards.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works well but laser takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li> Nicely designed and durable.  I fully charged the trimmer after opening the box and haven&#x27;t had to recharge yet.......over 6-weeks: approximately 18-20 trims.</li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer. Perfect style every time.</li>
            <li> good quality, durable, fancy, waterproof and flexible for your needs !!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why the hell I thought it would be a good idea to purchase a beard trimmer with a laser, but I did and have to say that it was a bad move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beard isn&#x27;t long.  I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s about 7mm, but this machine does not trim.  I didn&#x27;t even get to the point of using the laser, because it doesn&#x27;t do what it says it does on the box.  It simply doesn&#x27;t trim the beard.  It does a decent job on the mustache, but the hair surrounding the face is left wanting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe you can use the laser if you go for one of those perfectly trimmed chin strapped looks, but I doubt you&#x27;ll even be able to use that because it doesn&#x27;t trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money.</li>
            <li> it is getting very hot in few minutes..</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I have ever got.  Using no blade covers, you can achieve the five o&#x27;clock shadow look and the precision is amazing.</li>
            <li> The laser is only good for marketing. In my case the device trimmer below the light bar and was perhaps faulty. I returned it and didn&#x27;t ask for an exchange as the laser was useless anyway.</li>
            <li> Wish it had all the features that the lower models support, such as the vacuum. Upgraded from a 3 year old Norelco and their is no difference. My next trimmer will be the cheaper versions, this is a little overpriced.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I was very wary about buying this trimmer. But I&#x27;m glad I did. I have several trimmers, some gathering dust, a few I still use. This one goes to the top though. Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than have a bagful of combs, this one comes with only two. One fully encloses the blades. The other needs more care to use as you can easily cut down to the skin depending on the angle you hold the trimmer. The length is adjustable with a dial, from .4 to 7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes some time to do a proper job. This is by no means a one-pass trimmer. But with a little care, the result is just what I&#x27;ve been looking for, and have been unable to easily achieve with any of my other trimmers. I does have a light, presumably to guide your trimming, but you&#x27;ll soon ignore it, as it does little to improve the task. The trimmer can be recharged, but also used while it is plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the downside, cuttings tend to accumulate around the blades, and the combs can be difficult to remove to clean the trimmings. Maybe in time it will become easier, or I&#x27;ll find some trick to talking them off. On the plus side, you don&#x27;t have to worry about them falling off. They lock securely in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another annoyance is the power button seems quite finicky, and you have to press it in just the right spot to turn the trimmer on or off. Again, something I just may need to get used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the base of the blades is a minute set of cutters. Apparently another feature that will quickly be ignored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But with the numerous length adjustments and design of the two combs, a neatly trimmed beard and mustache are easily achieved. Hopefully, down the road, I&#x27;ll be able to be as happy with reliability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> best trimmer phillips has ever made.</li>
            <li> Best birthday present, by far!!</li>
            <li> Husband really likes it!</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my husband. He likes it a lot.</li>
            <li> shaving and trimming have never been easier.  HOWEVER, if you want a clean shave you still need to go back behind with some other razor.  But this works great for trimming up or at least knocking it down so that you can get a close shave. :)</li>
            <li> Terrible. Underpowered. Flimsy and the laser is a useless gimmick. I&#x27;ve had a short beard for over a decade and I buy a new trimmer every couple of years. This one lasted less than two months. The tiny travel one I have that runs on AA batteries has more cutting power than this one. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Powerful trimming tool, very accurate and attractive!</li>
            <li> Expected better cutting</li>
            <li> My husband did not like.  He felt the trimer was cutting unevenly</li>
            <li> Very good product with aceptable price.</li>
            <li> Have used it, adequate but not more. The laser function is a cool toy, but not something I would depend on. My son in law got the best deal since I gave him my old trimmer...</li>
            <li> The laser is useless and the trimmer doesn&#x27;t cut that well ...  i have a Remington and cut much better than this.  don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> Great product and easy to use. More than happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Wish it had an option for length longer than 7mm since I like to keep my beard a little longer than that but overall a great product.</li>
            <li> Didnt come with the blade</li>
            <li> This does an excellent job of trimming &amp; keeping beard all at same length.  The lazer guide is not that handy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several inexpensive trimmers in the past. This one does a far better job and requires fewer attachments than the cheaper ones. It is much easier to adjust and clean. It&#x27;s well worth the additional cost!</li>
            <li> impressive, love the light</li>
            <li> The laser is very cumbersome to use longest comb is only 3/8 inch. No add on comb available</li>
            <li> great product and a good shave</li>
            <li> I bought this because my old variable length beard trimmer battery was no longer charging, and the reviews suggested it would be better than the Wahl beard trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros :&lt;br /&gt;1) This thing looks awesome, and who doesn&#x27;t want to flash a laser about while shaving? Very cool.&lt;br /&gt;2) Ergo is excellent, the variable depth heads work fine.&lt;br /&gt;3) I really like the way the head flips around to present either the wide or narrow shears, great for shaping the mustache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) Remember all those laser-pointers with the warnings not to flash the laser in your eyes? Figure the odds on doing precisely that with a beard trimmer that has a 6&amp;#34; wide laser that you&#x27;re pointing at your face. That probably isn&#x27;t good for you, even though it&#x27;s a low-powered laser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) It lacks power. When I hit a dense patch of hair growth, I can hear the motor slowing down. I imagine that when the battery is low, that slow-down is going to yank some hair instead of cutting it. As an aside, my old Lithium powered Wahl beard trimmer that cost about $25, powers right through without any slowdown. -1 Star&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) I use this to shave my face and noggin after a long weekend without shaving, and to shape the goatee. So it&#x27;s essentially mostly trimming pretty short hair, 2 or 3-day growth, without any of the head-attachments, just using the bare metal shears. I was surprised to see that it just didn&#x27;t do a very good job. So I pulled out the Wahl beard trimmer (without head-attachments) and went over the same areas, and I could see a huge difference in how much hair was removed. The Wahl picked up and trimmed a lot, even going behind this Norelco. The reason appears to be the thickness of the metal shears; the Wahl is finer and thinner, so it gets MUCH closer to the skin (without cutting the skin). -1 Star&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) That rotating shears head is probably going to be a problem down the road. After removing it 3 times for cleaning, it&#x27;s noticeably easier to pop off. If this continues, within a few months, the thing will probably start falling off during regular use. It&#x27;s a concern, but maybe I&#x27;m wrong about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So. I&#x27;ll keep it because I did need a new variable length trimmer for the goatee and it works great for that. But the laser is just a cool (and possibly hazardous to your eyes) gimmick, and this thing is out-performed by a $25 Wahl Lithium beard trimmer when it comes to close-cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m afraid I cannot recommend this product to anyone.op off.

            <li> This is really, really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very precise, the power level indicator works well, and the feel in the hand is very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At last, I&#x27;ve found a trimmer that&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li> I liked my 30 year old Norelco better, this one seems to be designed so a person cannot cut themselves, so it is hard to get a close shave when trimming your mustache or beard.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a lot of different beard trimmers, but I&#x27;ve had few. This trimmer is definitely the best one I&#x27;ve owned so far. It seems very well made, and it feels good and fits well in my hand. And it&#x27;s a very nice looking trimmer too. The colors are nice, and it has a really sleek, high-tech look to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is essentially the exact same trimmer as the 5100 model, except this model has the pop-up laser guide, and there are color differences. Now, though it&#x27;s a cool feature, I&#x27;m not convinced the laser guide is actually all that useful/helpful. For my trimming needs, I found the laser guide to be of little use to be honest. BUT, with that said, this model is only $20.00 more than the 5100, so you might want to give this model a try anyway. You very well might find the laser guide to be useful/helpful. I&#x27;m sure there are some people who do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance-wise I have been quite happy with this trimmer. I can charge it for an hour or so, and can use it about 10 times before I need to recharge it. It has 17 length settings, which are in very small increments, so I can easily set it to cut my beard to the exact length I like. And, unlike my last trimmer, this trimmer&#x27;s settings are very easy to read. And I can simply spin the cutting head around to the small/narrow blade to perform detail trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer is also comparatively quiet, and is powerful and sharp, and makes quick work of trimming my beard. Cleaning this trimmer is a breeze too. There&#x27;s no need to fool around with a brush to clean the blades on this trimmer, as I can just run it under the faucet, and in a few seconds it&#x27;s perfectly clean. This is a big plus in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a great beard trimmer, and it suits my needs perfectly. It has everything I need, and very little I don&#x27;t. And, once charged, this beard trimmer&#x27;s battery lasts about twice as long as the battery on my previous trimmer. So, I&#x27;m quite happy with this trimmer, and I really don&#x27;t have any complaints about it. Consequently, I highly recommend giving this trimmer a try. And, if for some reason you don&#x27;t like it, or you find it doesn&#x27;t suit your particular needs, you can just send it back. However, if you do happen to decide to purchase this beard trimmer, I am pretty confident that you won&#x27;t be sending it back. I hope this review was helpful to you.e any complaints about it.

            <li> I thought this trimmer would be pretty standard, but I was wrong. It cuts far more efficiently than any trimmer I&#x27;ve used before. I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for over 15 years now, and this is easily the best trimmer for one major reason, no snags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer cuts through hair like a knife through soft butter. No resistance, and it actually cuts every bit of what it comes in contact with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this trimmer to anyone, it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> The laser guide? That&#x27;s almost completely pointless since it does move with the trimmer. It helps you eye things straight, or you can use it with a eyeliner pencil for a straight line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been trimming my dad&#x27;s beard for over 20 years now. He has vision issues and can&#x27;t do it himself. In the time, I&#x27;ve used a lot of trimmers and clippers on it. This is on the better end of those, and in the price range for this series- a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no snags or pulls on his sensitive skin, and it gets fairly close. The blades fit in to trim his mustaches above his lip very well too which has been a design issue in some trimmers. It just cuts nice and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use guards for trimming his beard because part of the issue with his face is a large scar on his chin that he prefers covered, but I do like to keep the guards handy for touch ups on the sides if he feels like doing them. The fact that it&#x27;s only 2 guards makes it easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be rinsed clean, which is nice. Not having to poke and prod with a tiny brush to get out everything is handy. I also like the fact that the blades don&#x27;t need oiling. Just let them dry completely before putting them away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charges well, and holds a charge for more than enough time to trim up his beard.</li>
            <li> For a moderately priced beard trimmer, this Philips Norelco gets the job done and is super easy to use. It doesn&#x27;t take an instruction manual to figure out how to use it and doesn&#x27;t seem to always need a charge. However, is it worth the extra $15+ for the 9100 over the 5100? The only difference appears to be the laser guide, which looks and sounds pretty cool... But will probably be way underutilized. Obviously, as you move the trimmer, the laser moves too, making it tough to get an accurate line and rendering the feature pretty useless. Of course, the laser feature adds a certain &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; appeal, but I&#x27;m not sure if it that&#x27;s really worth anything. After all, you&#x27;re (hopefully) using this trimmer alone in your bathroom.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery. Product is super good.</li>
            <li> Get one and try not to shine it in your eye, or do.  Either way get one</li>
            <li> the laser was a wast of money I&#x27;ll never use it</li>
            <li> The laser guid, well we will see, maybe of use. But on the cool factor its all five stars alone. The trimmer itself is very light. Cuts clean and works like you would hope it would. This replaces my wahl trimmer that I kicked down to my son. The blades need no oil which is very nice. I just hope the battery holds up. The manual explains how to remove it for disposal. If/when it goes out from a battery failure I will attempt to replace it myself. Very happy with it on my first use.</li>
            <li> The only thing this has to offer is that instead of shaving with an electric razor... you now get to shave with an electric razor while simultaneously being blinded by red laser beams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will now look like you&#x27;re shaving with a UPC Barcode Scanner.  Boop... Boop.... Boop...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty sure MOST people make shave movements that are perpendicular to the razor blade, otherwise disaster ensues...&lt;br /&gt;This razor is the biggest gimmick that&#x27;s happened in quite some time to shave tech.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do you do... draw a line on one side of your face... then shave to the line? then draw a line that is obviously not going to be easy to reproduce on the other side of your face and shave to that line...?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What they really need is a trimmer that simultaneously shaves the other side of your face to make it perfectly symmetrical... okay now we&#x27;re just talkin&#x27; loco~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But lasers... totally sane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow...  I&#x27;d use the laser guide on this thing as much as I use the laser guide on my table saw... (never)&lt;br /&gt;Pretty sure that moving the trimmer also moves the laser... therefor rendering it utterly useless...&lt;br /&gt;When i&#x27;m sawing a piece of wood I can barely stay on a line that&#x27;s drawn with pencil... and a moving laser target that&#x27;s being stabilized by my own hand.... that&#x27;s a moving target!  Never going to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Completely inapplicable to ANYONE&#x27;s lives... congratulations Philips.</li>
            <li> At first I was really excited about this, but upon first use my disappointment nearly drowned me like a yodeler in a horse trough. Sure there&#x27;s a laser guide, but missiles simply went astray as fast as I could fire them. Before I knew it I had lost any hope of achieving coveted Top Gun status. And bomb targeting was just as non-existent. Hell, a laser system like this probably wouldn&#x27;t even help you cut hair.</li>
            <li> A laser guide?  I have not quite figured out how to best use this laser guide.  And, you can use this without the laser guide.  This is a high tech beard trimmer, with plenty of adjustable settings.  There is a smooth gliding that occurs with use.  This lightweight trimmer give a very close cut, smooth.  I found the battery life is good, and this pouch makes it an easy on the go trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I also like is the simple, wash it in the sink feature, and supposedly, the blades don’t need oiling.  And, with the chargeable feature, it makes it easy to use wherever and whenever throughout the house, car, office, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice slim trimmer, works great, washable, and high tech....Rizzo</li>
            <li> I especially appreciate the lights that tell me how long I need till the next charge. and the blade is pretty smooth cutting too. I haven&#x27;t had it pull at all.</li>
            <li> The laser doesn&#x27;t work as good as advertised. Its trimming functions work well, but nothing outstanding. You can definitely get more quality for your money out there.</li>
            <li> The engineer must not have a beard...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is fancy and the battery does seem to last nicely so far ... but the beard guard was made poorly and fills with hair almost immediately.  If you use the guard without the full enclosure you will likely gouge a big hunk of your hair out... I have done this twice.  I know I shouldn&#x27;t use the thing but I don&#x27;t like opening the guard every stroke to clean it out so I used the open one and it is not good for beards, or anything else you cannot be perfectly flat against at all moments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been trimming beards since I was a lad, about 30 years now, and I haven&#x27;t found a lousier guard on any product.  I have owned much worse made products overall but really?  After the investment in the rest of the unit why not top it off with a decent guard that can make the actual trimmer work well for its intended purpose.</li>
            <li> I of course do not have a beard, so I observed my Husband and took notes. What a life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips Norelco Beard Trimmer is all fancy. Its got laser guidance for those beards that guys have that are all perfect and squarish and for hipster mustaches like no other. Dual sided trimmer, self sharpening blades, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what we got out of it. Its really lightweight which as a woman who blow dries and curls her hair, I can understand how a man would want a lighter beard tool. Its very ergonomic, which means its very comfortable to handle and use. The full hour charge is awesome...no cords to get in the way. The Beard comb/detail comb is fantastic, but its plastic so over time will this get damaged or worn down? The laser itself is not needed for my guy, and he found it totally distracting and if he wanted to use it? it blinded the area in laserness and he couldn&#x27;t see what he was doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall he loved it, we both think the lasers are just magic but unnecessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say afterwards I could not stop looking at him, ....ok thats normal. :)</li>
            <li> This is a good unique trimmer.  The laser guide function is extremely handy for getting a well defined beard shape.  I use it to establish symmetry in my beard on both sides of my face.  My beard looks more even on both sides of my face then it ever has before.  I have been getting lots of complements on my beard since using this (more just that my beard/ or style looks good).  The small trimmer on the opposite side of the trimmer is extremely useful for details and for trimming my eyebrows.  The include detail-er trimmer comb is awesome for getting the mustache trimmed though it does require more care than the other beard comb.  My previous trimmer (the Norelco with the vacuum) could never do a good job trimming the moustache as my nose got in the way- this one is a huge improvement!  Unfortunately, the tallest trimmer guide position is 7mm which is fairly small if you want a long beard (my other Norelco with the vacuum goes to 18mm).&lt;br /&gt;  The trimmer without any guide does not cut as close as I would like.  My other Andis trimmer cuts much closer than this trimmer however than this Norelco causes NO irritation of my skin.  It does not feel like I trimmed afterwords which is great if you have sensitive skin or are prone to ingrown hairs (which I am).  It trims close enough that it does not look messy.  The whole razor is waterproof which is great for cleaning.  Overall, an excellent beard trimmer!</li>
            <li> This machine does exactly as it says, and the option of having the trimmer side available simply by turning it 180 degrees is great.</li>
            <li> Tested it and found it to be underpowered for my moderately thick beard and the attachments are very flimsy - I&#x27;ve had other trimmers from Philips and they broke very easily, but are not covered in the warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips has a 45-day risk free guarantee. It requires you use the trimmer for 3-weeks, then you have to call to have them process the guarantee and the package that you send the trimmer back in must be post marked by the 45th day after the date of your purchase receipt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called Philips immediately after 3 weeks. They said they would process the return/guarantee in 3-5 days and I would get an email. I watched my email, including junk/spam, and never heard back. I called after the 10th day and they told me \\&quot;its being processed and will take 3 more days.\\&quot; This went on and on until the 43rd day of my 45-day guarantee and they promised \\&quot;it will be processed in 3-days.\\&quot; I told them that would be too late, it would be the 46th day and I could no longer return the trimmer then. Finally, the customer service representative promised to have the return processed and that I would get an email within 10 minutes. I never got that email.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked to speak to a manager. They evaded my request.&lt;br /&gt;I asked why they always put me on hold so long. They said they were assisting other customers!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I confronted them that calling themselves &#x27;customer service&#x27; was a flimsy pretense to avoid taking care of customers and giving them the return they were promised. I asked the rep if they were, and if so, how they could be, satisfied holding such a terrible job where they just lie to and frustrate customers. The rep replied that they were sorry that can&#x27;t be helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My time is valuable, but I also have values about how I should be treated, which is why I persisted. I told the customer service rep that whatever they were getting paid, Philips lost more money paying them to avoid paying a return to me. However, after the 45 days past, I gave up and reported Philips to the Better Business Bureau.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:&lt;br /&gt;55 days after I originally purchased the trimmer (10 days after the guarantee ended), I got an automated email from Philips asking me to complete a survey and product review. I cut &amp; pasted the above review. An hour later, Philips finally emailed me a return slip for the 45-Day Guarantee. The next day, they emailed me saying they were removing my product review!!! I had to report them to the BBB and write a negative review on their site to get them to honor their guarantee, then they censor the reviews of their products - completely unethical.ast, I gave up and reported Philips to the Better Business Bureau.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:&lt;br /&gt;55 days after I originally purchased the trimmer (10 days after the guarantee ended), I got an automated email from Philips asking me to complete a survey and product review.

            <li> Trimmer strength is good&lt;br /&gt;Durable and sturdy&lt;br /&gt;Lazer is not needed as i thought i would&lt;br /&gt;Overall good product</li>
            <li> Very good and smooth shaving</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd Norelco Brand beard trimmer I have owned. Despite what some of the other reviews say this is a great beard trimmer. The laser line is not a feature that I will use a lot but it does cone in handy when you need a straight line shave. This razor charges really fast and cuts evenly and smooth without snagging or pulling out hairs. I like to keep a short hair beard and most other brands I ha e tried are either not short enough or too short, but this one does the job and I still have 3 length settings to go even shorter. This trimmer is also quite, it is actually the quietest trimmer I have ever used. This is one of the few trimmers on the market that works either plugged in or off the battery. I would recommend this beard trimmer to anyone, its a great product.</li>
            <li> I have used this a few times and was surprised at how good of a trimmer it was. It gives me a clean and uniform shave. The charge seems to hold well too which I feel like many plug in razors have poor charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real feature on this item is the straight line laser that helps give you a line for the blade. My thoughts are that really this is not needed. It seems a reason to take a beard trimmer to a new level of technological advance when really there is not much room for growth. In fact, a straight edge shave by a barber is almost a welcome chance to the unnecessary technology that is coming out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all this said, the laser was useful but its not needed. My neckline is present and I could use that just the same to create a clean edge. If you are looking for a good beard trimmer, I would recommend this for that reason, not for &amp;#34;precision laser technology&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> May 10, 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dear Sir or Madam:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose this particular item (BT9285/41 9100) in hope of finding a beard trimmer that functions to my satisfaction.  The last trimmer I bought was a Norelco, model number QG3270.  It did not perform how I had hoped.  The closest setting did not trim my full beard in the sightest.  Very little hair was removed from my full beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past I puchased a Norlco beard trimmer (model# T7900) which was unfortunately discontinued.  That trimmer lasted me for about 15 years.  I trimmed my beard and also used it for a haircut with great satisfaction.  As you can tell, I am a fan of Philips Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until now, I have been displeased.  Fortunaly, the BT9285/9100 came along and I am very well satisfied.  I only used it twice, and it trims and cuts much better.  I will use it again tomorrow with pleasure.  Th laser is a neat innovation which in time I am sure I will adapt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised that the trimmer did not come with a case, and perhaps some more attachments.  Otherwise, I am satisfied with my puchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would appreciate it if you can give me some moer information on recharging.  According to the instructions, you must run down the full charge during the first use before recharging.  It does not say if you may recharge before running down the battery.  Neverless, this is a big improvement from the last model aforementioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerly,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert M. Ellenbogen</li>
            <li> For years, I&#x27;ve used the Philips Norelco G370. I even went so far as to replace it with another when it wore out. Now the blades are dull again and so I was looking at replacing it a third time. But when I went to order it, I noticed that the price more than tripled. So I figured it was time to try something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeping with the Norelco brand, I gave the 9100 and 5100 a try. And I&#x27;m glad I did. Not only do they provide a closer shave, but they are self-sharpening so I don&#x27;t have to worry about them going dull anytime soon. Not only that, but the motors run more smoothly, providing less shake and vibration in my hand. The trimmer head can flip around (even while running) so I can access a narrow blade that gets into harder to reach places (or more stubborn hairs the larger blade can&#x27;t cut).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the 9100 five times on a single charge, and it seems to have more uses left. The laser guide allows for more precision and the digital display makes viewing the comb length setting quick and easy. With the 5100, you don&#x27;t get either of those options, but it matches quality and features with everything else. That said, it is slightly less bulky than the 9100 and has better grips on the back side. So if you don&#x27;t need the laser guide (and don&#x27;t care about the digital display), the 5100 is the better, and less expensive, choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far these have met my expectations. The only thing I miss about the Norelco G370 is the nice charging dock.</li>
            <li> I think this would work fine for a short beard. But it did not work well at all for a longer beard. I have an old Remington that works much better on a beard that is 1/2 inch to 1 inch long</li>
            <li> This is great and the battery holds a charge for quite awhile.  I dont have a need for the laser but I do like how quickly and quietly I can groom my beard.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is almost indistinguishable from the BT5275/41 5100 model, with the exception of the additional of the laser guide and $20 increase in purchase price.  The laser guide seemed handy, but didnt speed up the process and attempted to solve an accuracy problem I did not have so it was not worth the additional price to me.  If you have a hard time trimming straight lines or keeping things symetrical, it might be worth $20 more.  The laser adds quite a bit of buik to the trimmer compared to the BT5275/41 5100 model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer functions perfectly.  It cuts thick and thin hard, more than just a beard.  The guard is secure and easily adjustable.  There is a visual indicator which shows you the length the guard is set to, so you dont have to guess if it is set at the same spot as last time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The larger side to the trimmer blade cuts aggresively and quickly.  Doesnt seem to mind thin, thick, soft, or stiff, it just cuts them all.  The smaller side also cuts well, with less aggressive nature so it doesnt leave scapes and cuts when it is used to trim the edges clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery stays charged for a LONG time, and charges within a couple hours when it does require recharging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this or the BT5275/41 5100 to anyone wanting a hair trimmer, as it is not just for beards but will also cut body and head hair if desired.  The only question is if you require the laser guide feature on this model or not.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for the next development of high quality technological advances in razors the Philips Norelco Beard Trimmer will leave you sadly disappointed. This razor has a laser right? The fact that something we shave with merits the addition of a laser is a pretty cool concept. I would really like it if companies would follow this trend of adding lasers to everyday products. Like a laser line on my ice machine so I never spill ice on the floor. I digress, the laser on this beard trimmer is a little disappointing. I am not really sure what I was expecting, but was left wanting. The pictures displayed on Amazon show perfect looking beards with well crafted lines; however, every time I used the laser guide I walked away feeling disappointed concerning how horrible I was at shaving in a straight line. I was expecting my shaving and beard upkeep to improve, but instead I am reminded of how much of a failure I am at personal beard care, and I should probably shave it all off anyway cause it is a patchy beard and not a nice beard like the guys in the photo.&lt;br /&gt;As far as mechanics are concerned this is a good razor. There isn&#x27;t any pulling or ripping when I use it on my beard. I do notice that the setting it works best on is simple stubble. I haven&#x27;t been able to make the guard give an even cut on all parts of the beard, or maybe my face might just be weird.&lt;br /&gt;I think you will be pleased if you pick up this razor. Just be aware that the laser guide is gimmicky and what you are acquiring with this product is a quality razor that is quiet, provides a long battery life, and is resilient to be dropped onto the bathroom floor. This isn&#x27;t a next generation razor but it is a razor that will treat your face well.</li>
            <li> Great trimer. Very easy to use and very useful.  i highly recommend it.  Study and should last a long time.</li>
            <li> Does not trim beard as expected. it needs a lot of work.</li>
            <li> Great beard trimmer with precise length control. The laser is neat, but since I don&#x27;t like to trim close to the skin with an electric it is a feature U admire more than I enjoy. Works great if you don&#x27;t mind clippers against the skin.</li>
            <li> My miter saw has a laser. My circular saw has a laser. Now my beard trimmer has a laser!    This is one of the best trimmers I&#x27;ve ever used on my beard. The reason is simple. 1) This unit is consistently powerful and provides very even cutting. 2) The laser guide gives you a extremely precise line to ensure accuracy. This is super-helpful for trimming up the back/bottom of my head after a fresh haircut and my sideburns are always dialed in.    The only thing I thought was a bit gimmicky was the fake LED readout. It is nothing more than a light behind a rotating wheel. Not the digital readout you might expect.    For the money you would also expect this unit to come with some kind of travel case. Nope. Nothing.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works well.  It has no lubrication requirements, time will tell if that is ok.  I do wish it would cut closer to the skin, much experience with trimmers while getting haircuts tells me this is possible.  The laser is cool, but it could be positioned closer to the cutting line on the trimmer.  And, honestly, I do not find myself using the laser when I am trying to straighten things up.  The two attachments are ok, the great part about these is that there is a depth adjustment on the trimmer.  Unfortunately with the attachments I find myself using an angle with the trimmer that subverts the cut length, that is I cut some spots shorter than it is supposed to allow.  If you&#x27;re careful about angle, no problem.  Being able to plug it in for use is a definite plus.  Battery life is much longer than cutting three styles in one session.  Biggest downer, I wish it cut closer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed with the Philips Norelco BT9285/41 9100 Beard Trimmer. At this price point I was expecting a bit more. The &#x27;laser&#x27; is kind of useless and it seems to be limited to helping to trim sideburns at the right level. The guard pulls on and off instead of being integrated and I find that there aren&#x27;t nearly enough length settings to make it versatile enough. It&#x27;s great for stubble looks but I can&#x27;t imagine actually trimming a real beard with this.</li>
            <li> Its good but not great, I thought it wil have more type of trimmers and my old trimmer seems to do the same work except for all the different lenght.</li>
            <li> . the short size trimming is not working because the comb  is not covering the trimmer. should be corrected&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;regards,</li>
            <li> I bought this Trimmer because of laser-guided, but the laser is much upper than the blade trimmer. I have to make down and up manually by hand to be accurate with blade trimmer. Do not spend any penny of this device.</li>
            <li> It has been a really good experience buying this product. Charge takes just a few minutes and last for several days so it is very comfortable to carry.</li>
            <li> Love my new razor.  I was spending a lot of money to have the barber trim my beard regularly.  I now do it myself and have more than paid for this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Weak power and can&#x27;t cut through a real mans beard</li>
            <li> Great product. Great feeling during the shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m well versed in beard trimmers at this point. I&#x27;ve been through about six of them, with the best one being the cheapest one (believe it or not).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had high hopes for this Philips Norelco trimmer though. They usually offer above average products that last longer that most. Yes, this thing is built to withstand everyday use. It&#x27;s sturdy without being clunky, with a very straightforward design. I like that. The bad part is that the beard guard is also clunky, making it difficult to trim the mustache area specifically. It doesn&#x27;t pull or tug though, so that&#x27;s nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best feature of this trimmer, however, is the battery life. I got this, fully charged it (took about 8-10 hours) and haven&#x27;t charged it since. That was four months ago. That being said, I only trim about one a week or so. But still, impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a quality beard trimmer, save for the mustache trimming difficulties. There are better ones out there that are cheaper though, hence the 3-star rating...</li>
            <li> What a POS, I&#x27;ve had a whale for years so I looking to upgrade, Phillips employees must be on here leavings reviews because this is the worst beard trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had. It is not adjustable past .4 mm which is rediculous, have it adjust to zero dummy</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and just as described.  Over the years I&#x27;ve bought numerous cheaper trimmers (spending far more tnan if I&#x27;d bought a quality one to begin with!).  The laser line feature is particularly awesome.  If you have a beard or have any trimming needs, buy these clippers!</li>
            <li> Laser doesnt line up with razor and it doesnt actually function well because it needs to go over the same area multiple times to ensure it actually cut the hair. I would not recommend</li>
            <li> Great quality, laser light helps those who may struggle with close up vision to achieve a sharper / straighter line.</li>
            <li> usually i shave  my beard with gellet fusion in vacations, but when i am in work i use trimmers but i dont like electric shavers, i bought this trimmer when i after my philishave t788, and a hitachi. i read that it cuts as short as .2mm, but i didnt notice any difference from my old trimmer, but anyway its a very good trimmer, battery is great, laser looks great but i dont use, the trimmer isnt small as i noticed in some reviews, but looks nice and its smooth and make jobe very fast.</li>
            <li> For $90 I expected better.  I put the device to lowest possible setting to get a light trim but have to keep going over my beard time and again and it doesn&#x27;t trim much, beard remained darker than I wanted. You have to make sure to spend less than a second on any particular area or risk getting a bald spot. Device can use more power. main blade keeps falling off with the slightest movement.</li>
            <li> Great beard-shaper. I had my barber teach me how to best use it on my first-time beard. Glad he was so good at it.</li>
            <li> I really like this trimmer. It cuts very straight lines and cuts close.  I really didn&#x27;t buy into the laser.. i mean it worked but it seemed unnecessary.  There is one problem with it that drives me crazy.  It seems to lose power for a bit and then picks up a bit later... not sure why but it slows down my trimming.. if it werent for that it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> This product is great! It has met all my expectations. Good battery life!</li>
            <li> The product is nice except for the:&lt;br /&gt;1.Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t start with its power button no matter how much you press it: you have to open the laser and close it for the whole device to power up. This happens 5 out of ten times you turn ON.</li>
            <li> Good trimmer for long stabble</li>
            <li> Yes good product for the money</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband..... As a gift..... The laser guide which prompted my choice seems to be of no use to help&lt;br /&gt;Shape your beard as you move your hand to shave the laser line moves also... So if buying for the laser feature only I would pass. The trimmer tools are great and do offer different lengths</li>
            <li> IT HAS A LAZER ON IT. THE MAN IN YOUR LIFE WILL LOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;garunteed to make him stand in the bathroom and quote bond lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great trimmer only complaint is it doesnt have an adjustable length comb attatchment like alot of my other &amp;#34;beard trimmers&amp;#34;. i use this trimmer the most but i mostly use it for touching up and keeping the lines... laser sharp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible! I feel cheated, it says you can control the length without combs... Just what I was looking for, but hey in reality you must have a comb on. Once you do it just doesn&#x27;t do anything good. I feel ripped off and I&#x27;m probably going to send it back to Philips.</li>
            <li> A razor blade works far better than using this &amp;#34;laser guided&amp;#34; trimmer for the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My much cheaper 2 yr old trimmer didn&#x27;t leave occasional long hairs on my beard as this one did: I discovered this AFTER being at work all day.</li>
            <li> good trimmer laser is useless</li>
            <li> I really liked this product......very good power and trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the product stopped working after only two weeks of regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> The trimmer works fine, and the two different sides for trimming and detailing work well. I used the &amp;#34;trimming&amp;#34; guide (or whatever it&#x27;s called) the first time, just to cut back the length of my beard a little.  However, I found that if you don&#x27;t keep the trimmer perfectly perpendicular to your face at all times the cutters rock forward and give you too close of a shave.  After putting several nearly bald lines in my face either due to rocking it forward, or bunching up my face skin in front of the blade, I had to shave all the hair off my face to make it &amp;#34;even&amp;#34;. The next time I used it, I used the actual &amp;#34;Beard trimmer&amp;#34;.  It does have a front blocker that prevents cutting too close when you rock the handle forward or bunch skin up in front of the cutters, but I feel like it doesn&#x27;t really guide the hair into the cutters very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to keep my beard at about a 5 day length.  Maybe it would work better for a thicker beard? Mine spits hair all over the sink/ counter/ hands/ clothes.  Also, after several tries at using it, I really think the laser function is gimmicky and worthless. The laser does allow you to see where a straight line would be (theoretically), but, being attached to the clippers, your frame of reference (the laser line) constantly moves as you move the clippers to trim/ detail.  The light does not extend very far beyond either edge of the side of the clipper when it&#x27;s touching your face, so it&#x27;s not like it does you very much good anyway.  As you put the clippers to your face, you can still see the laser, but it doesn&#x27;t really affect where your line is going to be because 1) the clippers are already cutting hair (too late for a frame of reference) and 2) the laser isn&#x27;t showing you any larger of a line than the clipper head already is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re leveling picture frames on a long wall; the distances on my face aren&#x27;t long enough that I need a laser guide.  And, I keep my beard more curvy at my cheeks, rather than at perfect angles.  I&#x27;d rather have a trimmer that effectively guided the hair up into the guides (my larger hair clippers are much better at this function), and a vacuum to control the hair clippings.  I do like the smaller size of the head on the beard trimmer than on my hair clippers, and the trim head is definitely useful.  You could get a much cheaper beard clipper without all the gimmicks that aren&#x27;t practical. I do not recommend this, would not buy again, and hope this helps someone.more curvy at my cheeks, rather than at perfect angles.

            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m showing my age, but I&#x27;ve been begging for Philips/Norelco to go back to their T-series, where the guard was high quality, the length clicks were meaningful, and there weren&#x27;t gimmicks to add bulk to the size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, Philips/Norelco continues to disappoint. This time around, the product is so cheesy, they should be ashamed of themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box touts the \\&quot;LED display\\&quot; which is literally an LED behind a plastic wheel with numbers that have an LCD font. The numbers allegedly represent length in millimeters, but that seems to translate to \\&quot;short beard\\&quot;, \\&quot;very short beard\\&quot;, \\&quot;are you growing a beard?\\&quot;, and 14 more settings of stubble. It&#x27;s really more of a stubble styler, for stubble length savants. More disappointing though, is that the finished length is nothing approaching consistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guard is the same cheap plastic that Philips/Norelco has been using for years, so you can count on it losing a tooth or two before your warranty is up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then there&#x27;s the laser. I&#x27;m genuinely puzzled by what purpose it&#x27;s supposed to serve, other than verifying that you&#x27;ve made jagged edges. Because it moves along with the trimmer, and only makes a single straight line, you&#x27;re probably better off using it to set your lines, draw them in with your significant other&#x27;s eyeliner (or dry-erase marker, as the case may be) and then use those lines as your guide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the build quality of everything below the blade is unimpressive, the \\&quot;features\\&quot; are just plain silly, and the price is totally unjustified.</li>
            <li> I needed something to replace my Remington Titanium trimmer which was about 2 years old and no longer held a charge. Worse yet, it wouldn&#x27;t even shave off of the power cord unless (what was left of) the battery was fully charged. It was pretty much worthless. This product has a lithium ion battery instead of the terrible NiCad batteries in the Remington and it is washable (just run it under water). Granted this Philips Norelco model costs several times more, but it feels very solid and I expect it to last much longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Battery life seems great&lt;br /&gt;Charges fast&lt;br /&gt;Washable&lt;br /&gt;Easy to adjust (nearly as easy as the Remington, although that one was amazingly easy)&lt;br /&gt;Feels very solid&lt;br /&gt;Cuts cleanly with a single pass, motor doesn&#x27;t feel like it is straining&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Laser is a gimmick, not really helpful. I&#x27;m fine with that, there isn&#x27;t much use for cutting straight lines. But if there were uses for it, it just doesn&#x27;t work. The laser is too closer to the face so it doesn&#x27;t spread out far enough in either direction to be able to see it.&lt;br /&gt;The indicator that shows what adjustment the guide is on is backlit and the backlight goes off when not in use. So if you pick it up and want to see what it is adjusted to, you have to turn on the razor to get the backlight to turn on. Not a big deal, but a little annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I can definitely live with the cons and am very happy with the quality of the trimmer.</li>
            <li> ok for beard purpose as long as it remain short</li>
            <li> Not bad but like any other trimmer with sheep price also no need at all for the laser the only advantage is the battery it is awesome and take less time for chraging</li>
            <li> I think it works for some people. African Americans tend to have heavier hair. It seems as if the trimmer did not cut as well as other clippers I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> It arrived in a timely fashion and is exactly what I wanted.  Seems to be of a very high quality and functionally, far better than any other systems I had purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have a use for the laser guide but it&#x27;s a pretty neat feature. The pivoting head works really well and it&#x27;s easy to clean. I do feel that it should remain plugged in when not in use otherwise the battery seem to drain pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> This beard trimmer has a good grip that allows the hairs to be brushed off (unlike some other trimmers - Wahl lithium i&#x27;m referring to you).  The laser guide is a great addition.  I thought it was just another useless bell and whistle but it really does help me guide the trimmer and keep the cuts straight.  A charge seems last a good long time too.  I&#x27;ve had it for about 1 month and have experienced no issues.  I replaced it after my 2nd Wahl lithium ion all in one trimmer broke -- that was 2 Wahl&#x27;s in 6 months.  Granted, this Norelco 9100 is about twice the price but I guess you get what you pay for...</li>
            <li> Pros: Washable, Twisting head&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: NO TURBO MODE, no vacuum so hair drops all over the place, Laser is pointless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips takes one step forward and two steps back. Why take turbo mode out, that&#x27;s a big mistake since all the older trimmers had it and I loved it. It take me a long time to line up my beard now</li>
            <li> Had a goatee or beard for over 20 years straight. I&#x27;ve been using trimmers for a long time. I currently use an old Norelco. My wife bought me this new laser trimmer as a gift since my trimmer is old. I thought it was a good looking trimmer but I  wasn&#x27;t sure about the laser. First of all its a pure gimmick. The laser has no side to side projection once you get near your face. You have a tiny 1&amp;#34; wide blinding red line on your skin and you can&#x27;t see what you&#x27;re doing with your beard. I was already regretting that she spent that much money on something that seemed like a decent idea. But I thought I&#x27;d keep it since I needed a new one. So I tried the trimmer. Totally worthless. The height guide with angled edges has no bottom that presses along your face. Completely gapped up my beard as soon as I started upwards along my jawbone contour. It just bites into the hair and looks like someone hit it with no guard at all. Just chopped it up bad. So on the other side I tried the other guard. The combs are too round and spaced poorly. It doesn&#x27;t allow any hair to reach the blade. It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;comb and lift&amp;#34; the hair I guess I would say. It just glides along the top of the beard and you hear a few hairs getting cut here and there. It&#x27;s just an awful design for beard trimming guards. So after butchering my beard, I had to go back to a goatee. I gave the thing a final test and shaved my face without the guard leaving stubble like I have done forever when removing a beard. The head itself bites into the skin and leaves scratches. I did one side and got out my old trimmer and finished the job. I have nothing positive to say about this trimmer. I&#x27;ve used every brand out there over 2 decades. Some better than others. But this is by far the worst trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s a gimmick at best. I packaged it up and sent it back after a good cleaning. If it wasn&#x27;t for the high price, it would make a good gag gift.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is not for stubble.  The &amp;#34;beard comb&amp;#34; barely cuts my stubble at the lowest setting.  At higher settings, it does not cut at all.  Other trimmers have done a much better job at cutting my stubble at all length settings.  I imagine this &amp;#34;beard comb&amp;#34; is for longer beards.  The &amp;#34;detail comb&amp;#34; actually cuts at multiple lengths, but the finish is terrible.  I do not like way it feels after a trim, rough and jagged.  I will be switching back to the Philips Norelco BT5275/41 5100, which I returned prematurely in favor of this unit.</li>
            <li> Perfect for a stubbly shave. Very smooth with no pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The different length options are in such small increments that it&#x27;s really unnoticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good for a one or two day after look, but if you want it longer than that, it&#x27;s better to look at one of their other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for 3 months so far and I really like it. The auto adjustment is very useful and convenient. Also cleaning the blade is easy.</li>
            <li> The unit works well for cutting facial hair, the laser is overrated and I do not use this feature on this unit.&lt;br /&gt;The light is too bright. Other than that this is a good unit.</li>
            <li> So far I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> The cutting heads work well but the laser is too bright to be useful for me. I find it easier to use without the laser and there is a model that doesn&#x27;t have it so that would have been a better buy.</li>
            <li> Just as important to a woman not to get stuck in a \\&quot;style decade\\&quot; which is oh so out of date, it&#x27;s important to a man not to choose to look like (even if we all loved him) Tom Selleck from his \\&quot;Magnum PI\\&quot; days, or, bless him ... he was HOT!!!, \\&quot;Mac\\&quot; MacGuyver.&lt;br /&gt;No, today our style icons for males look very different if they want to be in fashion.&lt;br /&gt;For example, let&#x27;s look at Jared Leto, or Justin Timberlake.&lt;br /&gt;For a while. OK?&lt;br /&gt;Now, to get to the point, those sorts of looks on those men are very hard to maintain without a really good beard trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;This Philips Norelco Beard Trimmer 9100 is the creme de la creme of great beard trimmers, with its laser control and the 17 settings it offers, as well as the fact that it can simply be rinsed off under the faucet to be cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;In short,&lt;br /&gt;this is the beard trimmer you give your husband if you are confident that when he looks really good, he will still stick around because he loves YOU and only you! Take my word for it, he WILL love you even more !!! once he tries this amazing trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;The settings allow you to get close to the sensitive areas around the nose and also let you regulate the length of your side burns. It is dual ended.  Get that \\&quot;I haven&#x27;t shaved for a day and half look\\&quot; that all the coolest actors and rock stars have. Plus you can keep the short parts short and the longer parts exactly as long as you like.&lt;br /&gt;This would be a great graduation present looking forward to this spring!&lt;br /&gt;If a beard trimmer could be cool, this is the ONE for sure!  We really do love it.&lt;br /&gt;Obviously I don&#x27;t use it, but I love the effects and looks it gives my husband!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;jean</li>
            <li> My old trimmer&#x27;s battery was dying so I really needed to replace mine. This one sounded impressive and I figured the brand means good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair for me to adjust for the laser feature, but I can&#x27;t see much of a use for it unless you are a guy REALLY into grooming. Even then, I tried it and I couldn&#x27;t get the hand of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design overall is nice. It&#x27;s a sharp looking device, but it doesn&#x27;t even come with a case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My real gripe comes in with the cutting. This is a new trimmer. It should cut better than my 10 year old one. And it does. Sort of. Barely. I still need to go over my beard several times to get most of it and even then I find I still miss spots or have hairs that I just can&#x27;t seem to to trim. This is where the three star rating comes in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For it&#x27;s price it&#x27;s a pretty version of my old trimmer that has a better battery and cuts only slightly better.</li>
            <li> Great if you like tons of mess when you trim your bird...</li>
            <li> I just used this trimmer a couple of times but it works great on my beard.</li>
            <li> My husband has a line beard and I purchased this shaver thinking the red guide would also help him keep the line beard even. The red line doesn&#x27;t even line up with his jaw. So it did not serve a purpose</li>
            <li> Having a laser on this contraption is pretty weaksauce but it is an epic trimmer. I do use the laser just to feel cool though.</li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied with the quality and function of the BT9285. I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better beard trimmer for my needs. A solid give stars from me!</li>
            <li> I thought I was buying one battery driven, but you have to charge it with electricity for a day and then it works for awhile. Too cumbersome.</li>
            <li> Holds charge and cuts great</li>
            <li> Great trimming blades, hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin, though the plastic guards are a bit hard on my skin. Laser isn&#x27;t really useful, miss having a shaver attachment and it&#x27;s overpriced.</li>
            <li> expected much better :(</li>
            <li> Everything about it is good.  Battery last very long, but no boost mode</li>
            <li> Just as expected. Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> As a beard trimmer it works well. I&#x27;m not sold on the laser-guided trimmer as being more than a gimmick. It&#x27;s not like it stays in one place to show where to trim but it moves as I move the trimmer. Anyway, apart from that the guides keep everything trim and the length settings are solid and clear. I&#x27;m not going to accidentally trim too much of my beard.</li>
            <li> Not bad. Not great. As most other reviewers here have already stated, the laser feature is useless . (Just a cool looking gadget to get guys to pony up a little extra money, but are they in for a disappointment.) Battery life isn&#x27;t bad. meh....All in all there are better trimmers out there that offer more for the money. Shop around.</li>
            <li> awesome only for beard/mustache not for haircutting....</li>
            <li> i like it but its not easy to use the laser guide.</li>
            <li> overall great in every aspect.  The laser is pointless, theres no need for it.  You might as well buy the version underneath this one.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband and he loves it!</li>
            <li> Takes gettting used to</li>
            <li> no need for the laser really</li>
            <li> i like it very much...good product the laser light will help in precision....</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I&#x27;m too lazy to actually &amp;#34;shave.&amp;#34; As in baby smooth no facial hair at all shave. For years, I&#x27;ve just used a trimmer and gone for that five o&#x27;clock shadow look. Every day. And, because my facial hair grows so slowly, I can get away with doing it once per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is, by far, the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used. Aside from the pop-up laser -- which I find insanely gimmicky and worthless -- this trimmer has given me the best trim I&#x27;ve had in a long time. The &amp;#34;bare blade&amp;#34; setting gets extremely close, and the attachments can be dialed to the millimeter for precision trimming.</li>
            <li> I actually enjoyed the trimmer. But it is not a very different product as it is advertised. The laser is almost &amp;#34;not usable&amp;#34;. I could not find a way to get use of it.</li>
            <li> Its good. Not amazing though.</li>
            <li> First off there are no beards in my household, but we have always had a beard trimmer on hand to trim up side burns and the back of the neck between hair cuts. Over the years we have gone through several battery powered versions and when this was given to us I was pleasantly surprised with how nice it is. The laser is useful and pops up with a spring at the touch of your finger like a pen.  I am sure I will get better at using it to make a level cut with time. The Trimmer has a nice weight to it and feels comfortable in my hand when using it. There are two trimming sides and it is easy flip it around depending on if you need it to be small or normal. I leave it plugged in and charging in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Had been looking for a nice beard trimmer for some time and opted for this Philips Norelco model mostly based on the reviews I read and watched online. The laser on the trimmer has some value other than just being a freaking laser, yes it does move with the trimmer, but you can use it verify that you have straight lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that the plastic guard is set in a fixed position depending on what setting you choose on the led display, as opposed to my old beard trimmer which had only a few settings, and was not fixed, which usually led to a disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is ok and the power enough to keep a short beard trimmed without any problems, but it has problems with thicker and more hair, requiring you to rinse the trimmer to keep going with the thicker beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like it. It is comfortable to hold during use,  is 110-220v compatible, so you can take this with you when travelling without any worries.</li>
            <li> I have tried dozens of beard and mustache trimmers over the years.  They all work OK, but nothing to get too excited about.  They all work like a set of barber clippers, but built to a smaller scale.  This unit, instead of having numbered blades to indicate beard length, has 2 adjustable, snap on attachments that are used like a comb.  An adjustment wheel on the trimmer provides good control over how closely it will clip hair.  It comes with a laser, which provides a straight line for cutting a clean neck line---a nice feature that I&#x27;ve not seen in other trimmers. A word of caution---Don&#x27;t get carried away.....the trimmer allows extremely close cuts, so you may take off more than intended the first time it is used. I did.  Once I got the hang of it, it works beautifully.</li>
            <li> The was exactly as described</li>
            <li> The instruction manual says that this laser-guided trimmer &amp;#34;may take a little getting used to.&amp;#34;  I find that to be an understatement.  It&#x27;s bright enough to be really distracting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple other issues:&lt;br /&gt;1) the manual also warns you not to shine the laser IN your eye, but then you are expected to shine it roughly 2 inches away from your eye.  That seems a bit risky to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) the retractable laser beam can be &amp;#34;popped up&amp;#34; when needed, but when it&#x27;s up you can&#x27;t rotate the head of the trimmer.  And the trimmer attachments that are included can&#x27;t be used with the laser.  However, it&#x27;s possible when putting on the attachment to accidentally push down on the laser and make it pop up.  In this case, you need to take the attachment off, push the laser down again, and then replace the attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you decide to use this without using the laser guide, the trimmer is fine.  I like the rotating head: wide on one edge, narrow on the other, depending on the precision you need.  The attachments are fine too (though putting them on and taking them off is a bit clumsy compared to other trimmers I&#x27;ve tested).  However, if you aren&#x27;t going to use the laser guide, then why bother spending the extra money for the feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I think the laser is a novelty and not truly useful.  I find that very little precision is really gained with the laser.</li>
            <li> This is a very good timer for your bread. This trimmer cuts hair very good and close. There are a lot of good setting for this trimer.&lt;br /&gt;It cuts hair very fast too no wast of time. The laser helps you to cut hair on line. There are 2 different combs you get with this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;Nice light that lights up when you are charing it and when it needs a charge. It fits great in the hand.</li>
            <li> Quiet and powerful. Adequate for shaping your neckline, or trimming your beard. Runs for a long time between charges, but can also be used plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The laser, a nice touch, really assists when you are trimming your neckline in the mirror. I always struggle with that, and the precise straight lines help you to cut exactly what you want. Though if someone cuts your beard or neckline for you, it&#x27;s not needed as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cutter, used without a guard, can be rotated to either expose the wide blades that are good for neck or jaw lines, or the smaller cutting blade, good for areas such as sideburns or a mustache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guards allow you to control the depth of your trim, and are controlled by a rotating illuminated display on the handle, telling you what setting you are on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is, as I have a fairly long beard, the guards are not long enough. If I want to limit my beard length to about an inch or so, that is okay. Any longer and you can&#x27;t use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good, powerful and purposeful trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is a product for those who like to keep their lines nice and tight.  Yeah, it&#x27;s a good all around beard trimmer with solid power, 17 locked in length settings, dual sided trimmer with self-sharpening blades that requires no oil or maintenance (love this) but what it comes down to is that you are paying a premium for 1 key feature - a built in laser (class 1) guide.  This handy feature is basically a pop out laser that emits a horizontal beam that allows you to set your edges with beautiful precision and accuracy, a true blessing for those who take this level of grooming seriously.  If this particular feature appeals to you then it&#x27;s definitely worth the extra 20 or so that this trimmer is priced at versus comparable products.</li>
            <li> It has exellent quality of reversable blades/ 110-220v power supply is usefull for travel but red laser marker isn&#x27;t as narrow as need.</li>
            <li> Its great over all just wish the guards were designed different.</li>
            <li> The trimmer itself works well, but the laser guide is two bright and wide for a clean line, and really only works well when trimming on the top sides of the beard-cheek line. It also only goes to level 7 on it which happens to be the shortest I have been keeping mine lately, which is fairly short still; so if you like a more full beard, this isn&#x27;t for you. But if you like a variety of short lengths, the ability of a fine trim blade that you don&#x27;t have to interchange, and a good battery life (mine lasted 2 weeks before I decided to recharge) then this could still be a good option for you.</li>
            <li> The laser is useless and the trimmer doesn&#x27;t cut that well ...total crap !! Please don&#x27;t but</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using this and with summer here i have removed my entire beard and now use it as a body trimmer, sideburns and neck trimmer where it excels. Definitely like the click wheel for selection of length and it remains there versus other trimmers i have used that if you apply to much pressure they might change settings. Easy to clean and looks good. The battery life is good as from one charge it will last me several weeks using every other day or so. Before with a full beard it would last me about a week before i needed to charge but only used for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;The laser is a nice novelty and works well but as long as you have a clear mirror, steady hand and put attention to what you are doing you really do not need the laser. I used it a few times but then i didn&#x27;t even open it up...maybe thats why the battery has lasted me so long without recharging.&lt;br /&gt;Great trimmer overall with some nice extra features, you decide if its worth the extra $$.</li>
            <li> Less than my expectation. 0.4 mm blade not so smooth. And the laser not so useable in my sense. So....</li>
            <li> What is the power of electricity upon which the device?&lt;br /&gt;Is it a 110-v or 220-v ?&lt;br /&gt;Is The device works in the State of Kuwait, where the strength of 220 volts of electricity ؟</li>
            <li> it is good and easy to use and clean. but the accessory plastic comb is fragile and easy to breake. how can i buy this accessory if is is broken.</li>
            <li> In the video shows that it comes with a bag and mine didn&#x27;t come with.</li>
            <li> Trimmer works great but the laser is more a fancy add on then truly useful.</li>
            <li> The laser feature is awesome.  Straight lines everytime</li>
            <li> I only wish it could be also a shaver. But that&#x27;s me dreaming, it works perfectly as a trimmer.</li>
            <li> Works as well as any trimmer he has used. Self sharpening, washable, turn around 2 size blades, long lasting battery charge, and even the every now an then used laser are all big pluses !!!</li>
            <li> battery is not good I wait my refund</li>
            <li> The trimmer is good, comes with two attachments. The led display is cool. I still couldn&#x27;t figure out the perfect way to use laser and it&#x27;s really hard to avoid them getting into eye as the reflection from mirror can fall on eye. A fancy trimmer overall with an expensive price tag.</li>
            <li> My husband is enjoying it....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery lasts a good amount of time.  The major issue I am seeing with this is that it does not glide across my face smoothly.  I have the lowest setting guard on it, but it just doesn&#x27;t want to glide along my face like my Conair did.</li>
            <li> I really liked it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the laser is not that usefull, actually I never use it... but the trimmer it&#x27;s good, really good.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I have ever had.  I have bought so many different trimmers then after a short time, get another.  This one is definitely a keeper.</li>
            <li> It is not good. Not feeling comfortable if we use it at Level 1</li>
            <li> Great trimmer, just would appreciate a more ample set of guards for a longer beard than those provided. It works wonderfully for a fellow like me, who has a scraggly beard with curly hair of many dimensions. Keeps everything neat and even!</li>
            <li> Works great and is a solid made trimmer!</li>
            <li> This my first trimmer. I liked the Laser marker very much. It is pretty accurate. Battery lasts forever once you charge it</li>
            <li> Trims the beard very smoothly... Love how it has the two options between cordless n using it with the cord in... that helps alot if ur in a rush n if the machine is not fully charged u can put the cord in and trim away... hope the next version has the trim option from 0.1mm...</li>
            <li> Great trimmer! I don&#x27;t use the laser guide but can see how it might be helpful for some people. Use this trimmer every few days and after two months, still haven&#x27;t charged it a second time.</li>
            <li> Excellent purchase, excellent seller</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good, need more time to learn to use it.</li>
            <li> Attachments are not easy to put on or take off.  LED adjustment lights are very hard to read.  Considering returning it. Definitely not what I expected, considering the advertising brags!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I like is the battery recharging feature.</li>
            <li> Great features and efficient!!</li>
            <li> Great seller 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The laser feature is worthless.  Basically its a good shaver.  Could have bought same  brand cheaper without laser feature.</li>
            <li> Great product at a Great Price.</li>
            <li> Works well, recharges nicely</li>
            <li> worst trimmer I have ever had!!!!!!!!! I would rate 0 stars if I could</li>
            <li> Very good, item I just wish have more cutting levels</li>
            <li> Much needed, my VanDyke was getting way out of control. Barbers want too much to trim it.</li>
            <li> Everything works great. I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
