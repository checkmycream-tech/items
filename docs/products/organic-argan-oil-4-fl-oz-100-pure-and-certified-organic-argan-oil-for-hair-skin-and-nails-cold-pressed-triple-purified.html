            <li>However, getting a bottle of 100% pure Argan Oil is always better, because you know there are not additional chemicals, parabens and silicones.</li>
            <li>It also works great at moisturizing my super dry hands in the process.</li>
            <li>I use it like baby oil for everything and the smell of the oil is wonderful, very subtle and refreshing.</li>
            <li>The dropper does not pull up too much oil, so have to keep getting more out of jar if using a lot.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 100% natural which I liked, and is offered at a competitive price.</li>
            <li>My hair looks nourished, shiny and healthy - real</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very shiny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>I am a blogger that states my true opinion.</li>
            <li>I am an african-american woman and argan oil absorbs quickly and softens my hair without making it oily.</li>
            <li>soaks it quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have gotten several compliment on how shiny and healthy my hair looks now : )</li>
            <li>If you put some into your shampoo, you&#x27;ll have super shiny hair</li>
            <li>It has so many uses and is a high quality oil.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since goPURE Naturals is in its purest form, it doesn&#x27;t have any fragrances, but you can smell a strong odor that I didn&#x27;t really like.</li>
            <li>I use more than the suggested amount because I have long hair with a lot of frizz, and always need more.</li>
            <li>If you have not tried Argan Oil yet, I strongly suggest to do so as soon as possible, because you are going to love all the benefits that will provide for your hair, face,body and nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;goPure makes awesome products in general, i&#x27;ve used a number of their other products and they&#x27;ve all blown my socks off</li>
            <li>Worth the investment.</li>
            <li>The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!</li>
            <li>So far I am pleased.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, after using it my hair become so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Otherwise you could use more product at night to deep condition and wash it out in the morning for fabulous results.</li>
            <li>I purchased a promotional sample of this product and this is my objective and honest opinion after using it.</li>
            <li>and so far I love it,</li>
            <li>I seem to have inherited the eczema that my mother fought most of her adult life.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product provided complimentary for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>loved this argan oil it definitely passed all the test to see if it was really 100% aragan oil</li>
            <li>I put it in all my beauty products and I use it right bout of the bottle as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>Mix with other oils to make your own unique blend.</li>
            <li>Love the argan oil for my hair, does not weigh it down, and ads a healthy shine.</li>
            <li>RECIEVED THIS ITEM PRETTY FAST!!</li>
            <li>Honestly, my skin is oily skin , so most of oily skin care products, I basically do not touch them, but I see a lot of benefits from this product, so I decided to try it, in order to avoid my skin feels oily, I only use 4 drops on my palm before going to bed, It doesn&#x27;t have special smell, I put it on my face and neck, and gently massage the face (especially focus on lines), and until I do not feel there is any oily feeling on my face , and then apply my lotion</li>
            <li>I put a little more in my hand and then put my hair product on top of it in my hand (mousse)</li>
            <li>IT WAS LARGE BOTTLE!</li>
            <li>Argan Oil is a natural product and is safe for pregnant women and kids, though you should do a spot test before start using anything new on your skin, in case of an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li>I have dry hair and this works amazingly for that.</li>
            <li>The argan oil absorbs super fast too.</li>
            <li>It melts easily into the skin, leaving it hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li>stops the dry splitting areas from catching and pulling&lt;br</li>
            <li>And it fades quickly so that isn’t really a problem</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that goPURE Naturals Argan Oil is light-weight, absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is important for those like me that can be sensitive to certain smells and have a full on nasal shutdown, which I didn&#x27;t, YAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On the one hand, it seems to be pretty effective against dry skin on my face. ...</li>
            <li>well packed and very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>but it dose soak in very fast</li>
            <li>I love using argain oil because it is simply one ingredient.</li>
            <li>, i mixed this with my favorite salts</li>
            <li>their are so many different uses for this product</li>
            <li>First  of all it has been used in my hair.</li>
            <li>have found the first oil that I can say will always be in my supply rack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to help with maintaining healthy hair and skin.</li>
            <li>The 4 oz size is a great value and it should last a long time.</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase more from goPURE when I run out.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the product!</li>
            <li>I will  definitely be buying more when it runs out.</li>
            <li>satisfy with the consistent quality of their products.</li>

            <li>I am an avid user of argan oil.</li>

            <li>The next night I used seven drops much better .</li>
            <li>Speaking of, mixing some into your dye before dying your hair makes the color grab on and last longer while looking more vibrant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You get an enormous bottle for the price of most that are 1/4 the size</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other argon oils,  but this seems the best to use on my African American/Asian hair so far.  </li>
            <li>This argan oil is light and makes my hair really shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>Just apply a few drops on your skin and rub in for smooth refreshing skin.</li>
            <li>I was not required to give a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all).</li>
            <li>The directions say to use one or two drops on skin and rub in , I did this the first night and my skin soaked it up so fast</li>
            <li>Super super LOVE this stiff!</li>
            <li>The oil absorbs pretty quickly and it works rather well at keeping those rough areas of the skin like knees and elbows smooth.</li>
            <li>i can see that my dry skin is much better after applying this oil</li>
            <li>100% pure argon oil by goPure.</li>

            <li>~Thanks</li>
            <li>The stylist absolutely FRIED my hair.</li>
            <li>really don&#x27;t have much of a smell to it.</li>
            <li>I have very damaged ends from an ombre that I had done and this argan oil really protects it for when I add heat to it.</li>
            <li>You really want to give Argan Oil</li>
            <li>Really like this product.  </li>
            <li>It softens up cuticles on fingers and toes and makes my nails look really hydrated.</li>
            <li>I really like that this product is organic</li>
            <li>The seller was very responsive when I contacted them about how to use the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She  now wants to  start using it for herself.</li>
            <li>and really helps my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still in the healing process but it is much improved and wish I had taken a before and after to show the difference.  </li>
            <li>makes it so much easier to brush</li>
            <li>I have really frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>WE USE IT FOR WHOLE BODY.  </li>
            <li>THANKS  </li>
            <li>but this oil made things much easier</li>
            <li>There was no odor from the oil, and I was really worried that my hair would be oily after using it.</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>I have purchased Argan oil in the past from different manufacturers, and they have all had a distinctly nutty (and pleasant) smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other more expensive argon oils but this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>This Argan Oil is light and easy to apply after towel-drying my hair after shampooing; it can also be used as an intensive treatment prior to shampooing for really dry hair.</li>
            <li>which is good for me because I&#x27;m sensitive to smells and don&#x27;t usually wear anything that is scented.  </li>
            <li>I use it as cuticle oil because my cuticles are on the dry side and Argan oils leaves them soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>I just began experimenting with different oils for a cleansing and moisturizing method and this argan oil is spectacular for my dry skin--</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and many oil / skin products leave my skin pink and blotchy.  </li>
            <li>but this is my first time purchasing so it may just be how it naturally smells.  </li>
            <li>and there isn&#x27;t near as much shedding either!  </li>
            <li>If it helps this much straight in tiny amounts it can only get better spread out in a lotion</li>
            <li>I have quite sensitive skin that can be quite dry due to where I live and this argan oil was great at not causing any additional breakouts while healing it and keeping it hydrated.  </li>
            <li>I have been doing so for less than a week, and already my hands are in much better condition.</li>
            <li>only thing that I didn’t love about the product was the initial scent.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend trying this and plan to repurchase if and when I run out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smell and texture is high quality</li>
            <li>Absolutely fabulous for my dry hair after giving birth!</li>
            <li>when I use this argan oil not only does it make my skin soft and hydrated, but it&#x27;s rich in anti oxidants.</li>
            <li>it is bigger than I thought, totally worth it.</li>
            <li>, Surprise happen when I get up the next day, my skin looks softer, the fine lines look a little bit not so deep, Love</li>
            <li>Only 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t been using it very long, but will update my review once I get a chance to use it more.</li>
            <li>I tend to use a little bit more than normal for my eyes, but this stuff can really go to greasy if your not careful.</li>
            <li>AND MADE MY ENDS VERY SOFT AND SILKY.</li>
            <li>and her hair was very soft and silky, too!&lt;br /&gt;#ARGANOIL</li>
            <li>Also received a personal email from the company, thanking me for supporting them.</li>
            <li>Oil was completely rancid!</li>
            <li>my hair is so soft!</li>
            <li>, you only need a few drops so this bottle will last you a good while.  </li>
            <li>Since Argan Oil is considered a dry oil, absorbs quickly, leaving hair and body soft and moisturized without greasy or oily residues.</li>
            <li>This is the only stuff I can put on my hair that keeps those little fly away hairs down without it looking greasy.</li>
            <li>may start using it right out of the bottle soon as my skin is that dry.  </li>
            <li>No improvement only more mess</li>
            <li>I did add a few drops of lavender oil to it, however, and it now smells super luxurious!</li>
            <li>I have clear skin anyways because I use an oil cleansing method with another type of oil.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I figure out my hair look smooth and shining everyday, what a surprise~~LOVE IT</li>
            <li>and my hands felt soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Felt silky soft too and not greasy.</li>
            <li>Use it on my face and so far no problems with breakouts.  </li>
            <li>it makes it look soft and supple without looking greasy.</li>
            <li>One time I put in on my eyes after a shower and then brushed through my whole head</li>
            <li>and it made my entire head very greasy.</li>
            <li>WOW.  </li>
            <li>My aesthetician remarked how soft my skin is.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed some improvement in my adult acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when this arrived so well packaged and with the bottle dropper.</li>
            <li>Makes my nails and cuticles perfectly soft.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li>Once a week I put this in my colored hair wear a soft bonnet and go to bed.</li>
            <li>skin feels supple, and soft after each use.</li>
            <li>I have been dying my hair since I was about 30 years old.</li>
            <li>KEEP OUR SKIN MOISTURE, SOFT.  </li>
            <li>Omg it fells so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I used the oil at night on all the listed places and the next morning they were very morsturized.</li>
            <li>Usually more of a subtle nutty hint to it.</li>
            <li>I tried the hair, first time too much, next time not enough.  </li>
            <li>I love how this oil went on my hair, but a little bit went a very long way.</li>
            <li>and it goes on so smoothly and absorbs into skin so quickly and wont leave any uncomfortable or sticky feeling after.</li>
            <li>It also  works fantastic in my hair after a shower mixed with a little leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>It made my hair feel really greasy and limp, maybe I used too much but won&#x27;t use it on my hair again.</li>
            <li>it was only about half full but for what was there helped my hair.</li>
            <li>This works better and has none of the other harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>I mainly use it on the bottom half of my hair because that is where I have my main issue.</li>
            <li>No expiration date was printed on this bottle, so I have no way of knowing how old this oil actually is.</li>
            <li>In two weeks i have notices a complete difference and once again can get a brush thru the back of my hair...</li>
            <li>To use, simply massage the organ oil directly into the skin wherever you wish to take advantage of its healing, nourishing and rejuvenating properties.</li>
            <li>My sensitive skin was irritated and turned red.</li>
            <li>It soothed his skin, made him beard soft and shiny and made the skin feel moisturized, Now he would like to take it for over from me on a regular basis :</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s extra soft and protected against the sun if you have colored or processed hair.</li>
            <li>She mixes it with an essential oil that she enjoys smelling, then applies it lightly to her face, she is fair-skinned and has a hard time finding something that does not make her break out.</li>
            <li>, it leaves her skin moisturized and does not dry her out.</li>
            <li>I live in the desert and have pretty dry skin and just a few drops rubbed into my skin for a week is already showing benefits.</li>
            <li>I put a small amount in my hands and worked it through my freshly washed hair.</li>
            <li>I use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair when it wont stay down or before I use the straight iron.</li>
            <li>so seriously you&#x27;re getting your moneys worth plus!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll get some other, highly rated argan oil and see how that smells.</li>
            <li>I use 2-3 drops on my damp hair before I blow dry and it makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>This 100% pure Argan Oil is light and no added artificial fragrance.</li>

            <li> Great and reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> very light scent</li>
            <li> The smell goes away after a while, but when you don&#x27;t mix it with anything else, and use it on its own, it takes a while for the strong odor to fade</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t like the scent, I think it&#x27;s still a great product because its pure, and makes my skin, hair, and nails look healthy.&lt;br</li>

            <li> This product is high quality and a HUGE bottle for the price!!</li>
            <li> but it also does not have a pretty scent which is a good thing because that means it doesn&#x27;t have any added scented ingredients which would not make it pure argan oil.</li>
            <li> I love that the goPURE Naturals Argan Oil is 100% pure!</li>
            <li> I was impressed once my hair was dry because it made my hair extremely soft and smooth!</li>

            <li> I was excited to receive this and begin using it.</li>

            <li> I just have to make sure the oil I buy is 100% pure with no additives AND no fragrances.</li>
            <li> However, getting a bottle of 100% pure Argan Oil is always better, because you know there are not additional chemicals, parabens and silicones.</li>

            <li> It has so many uses and is a high quality oil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since goPURE Naturals is in its purest form, it doesn&#x27;t have any fragrances, but you can smell a strong odor that I didn&#x27;t really like.</li>
            <li> I use more than the suggested amount because I have long hair with a lot of frizz, and always need more.</li>
            <li> If you have not tried Argan Oil yet, I strongly suggest to do so as soon as possible, because you are going to love all the benefits that will provide for your hair, face,body and nails.&lt;br</li>

            <li> and so far I love it,</li>
            <li> I seem to have inherited the eczema that my mother fought most of her adult life.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product provided complimentary for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> loved this argan oil it definitely passed all the test to see if it was really 100% aragan oil</li>
            <li> I put it in all my beauty products and I use it right bout of the bottle as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> Mix with other oils to make your own unique blend.</li>
            <li> Love the argan oil for my hair, does not weigh it down, and ads a healthy shine.</li>
            <li> RECIEVED THIS ITEM PRETTY FAST!!</li>
            <li> Honestly, my skin is oily skin , so most of oily skin care products, I basically do not touch them, but I see a lot of benefits from this product, so I decided to try it, in order to avoid my skin feels oily, I only use 4 drops on my palm before going to bed, It doesn&#x27;t have special smell, I put it on my face and neck, and gently massage the face (especially focus on lines), and until I do not feel there is any oily feeling on my face , and then apply my lotion</li>
            <li> I put a little more in my hand and then put my hair product on top of it in my hand (mousse)</li>
            <li> IT WAS LARGE BOTTLE!</li>
            <li> Argan Oil is a natural product and is safe for pregnant women and kids, though you should do a spot test before start using anything new on your skin, in case of an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair and this works amazingly for that.</li>
            <li> The argan oil absorbs super fast too.</li>
            <li> It melts easily into the skin, leaving it hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li> stops the dry splitting areas from catching and pulling&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it fades quickly so that isn’t really a problem</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that goPURE Naturals Argan Oil is light-weight, absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is important for those like me that can be sensitive to certain smells and have a full on nasal shutdown, which I didn&#x27;t, YAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On the one hand, it seems to be pretty effective against dry skin on my face. ...</li>
            <li> well packed and very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> but it dose soak in very fast</li>

            <li> The seller was very responsive when I contacted them about how to use the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She  now wants to  start using it for herself.</li>
            <li> and really helps my skin.</li>

            <li> I have really frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> WE USE IT FOR WHOLE BODY.  </li>
            <li> THANKS  </li>
            <li> but this oil made things much easier</li>
            <li> There was no odor from the oil, and I was really worried that my hair would be oily after using it.</li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> I have purchased Argan oil in the past from different manufacturers, and they have all had a distinctly nutty (and pleasant) smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other more expensive argon oils but this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> This Argan Oil is light and easy to apply after towel-drying my hair after shampooing; it can also be used as an intensive treatment prior to shampooing for really dry hair.</li>
            <li> which is good for me because I&#x27;m sensitive to smells and don&#x27;t usually wear anything that is scented.  </li>
            <li> I use it as cuticle oil because my cuticles are on the dry side and Argan oils leaves them soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> I just began experimenting with different oils for a cleansing and moisturizing method and this argan oil is spectacular for my dry skin--</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and many oil / skin products leave my skin pink and blotchy.  </li>
            <li> but this is my first time purchasing so it may just be how it naturally smells.  </li>
            <li> and there isn&#x27;t near as much shedding either!  </li>
            <li> If it helps this much straight in tiny amounts it can only get better spread out in a lotion</li>
            <li> I have quite sensitive skin that can be quite dry due to where I live and this argan oil was great at not causing any additional breakouts while healing it and keeping it hydrated.  </li>
            <li> I have been doing so for less than a week, and already my hands are in much better condition.</li>
            <li> only thing that I didn’t love about the product was the initial scent.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend trying this and plan to repurchase if and when I run out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smell and texture is high quality</li>
            <li> Absolutely fabulous for my dry hair after giving birth!</li>
            <li> when I use this argan oil not only does it make my skin soft and hydrated, but it&#x27;s rich in anti oxidants.</li>
            <li> it is bigger than I thought, totally worth it.</li>
            <li> , Surprise happen when I get up the next day, my skin looks softer, the fine lines look a little bit not so deep, Love</li>
            <li> Only 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t been using it very long, but will update my review once I get a chance to use it more.</li>
            <li> I tend to use a little bit more than normal for my eyes, but this stuff can really go to greasy if your not careful.</li>
            <li> AND MADE MY ENDS VERY SOFT AND SILKY.</li>
            <li> and her hair was very soft and silky, too!&lt;br /&gt;#ARGANOIL</li>
            <li> Also received a personal email from the company, thanking me for supporting them.</li>
            <li> Oil was completely rancid!</li>
            <li> my hair is so soft!</li>
            <li> , you only need a few drops so this bottle will last you a good while.  </li>
            <li> Since Argan Oil is considered a dry oil, absorbs quickly, leaving hair and body soft and moisturized without greasy or oily residues.</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff I can put on my hair that keeps those little fly away hairs down without it looking greasy.</li>
            <li> may start using it right out of the bottle soon as my skin is that dry.  </li>
            <li> No improvement only more mess</li>
            <li> I did add a few drops of lavender oil to it, however, and it now smells super luxurious!</li>
            <li> I have clear skin anyways because I use an oil cleansing method with another type of oil.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I figure out my hair look smooth and shining everyday, what a surprise~~LOVE IT</li>
            <li> and my hands felt soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Felt silky soft too and not greasy.</li>
            <li> Use it on my face and so far no problems with breakouts.  </li>
            <li> it makes it look soft and supple without looking greasy.</li>
            <li> One time I put in on my eyes after a shower and then brushed through my whole head</li>
            <li> and it made my entire head very greasy.</li>
            <li> WOW.  </li>
            <li> My aesthetician remarked how soft my skin is.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed some improvement in my adult acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when this arrived so well packaged and with the bottle dropper.</li>
            <li> Makes my nails and cuticles perfectly soft.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> Once a week I put this in my colored hair wear a soft bonnet and go to bed.</li>
            <li> skin feels supple, and soft after each use.</li>
            <li> I have been dying my hair since I was about 30 years old.</li>
            <li> KEEP OUR SKIN MOISTURE, SOFT.  </li>
            <li> Omg it fells so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I used the oil at night on all the listed places and the next morning they were very morsturized.</li>
            <li> Usually more of a subtle nutty hint to it.</li>
            <li> I tried the hair, first time too much, next time not enough.  </li>
            <li> I love how this oil went on my hair, but a little bit went a very long way.</li>
            <li> and it goes on so smoothly and absorbs into skin so quickly and wont leave any uncomfortable or sticky feeling after.</li>
            <li> It also  works fantastic in my hair after a shower mixed with a little leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel really greasy and limp, maybe I used too much but won&#x27;t use it on my hair again.</li>
            <li> it was only about half full but for what was there helped my hair.</li>
            <li> This works better and has none of the other harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I mainly use it on the bottom half of my hair because that is where I have my main issue.</li>
            <li> No expiration date was printed on this bottle, so I have no way of knowing how old this oil actually is.</li>
            <li> In two weeks i have notices a complete difference and once again can get a brush thru the back of my hair...</li>
            <li> To use, simply massage the organ oil directly into the skin wherever you wish to take advantage of its healing, nourishing and rejuvenating properties.</li>
            <li> My sensitive skin was irritated and turned red.</li>
            <li> It soothed his skin, made him beard soft and shiny and made the skin feel moisturized, Now he would like to take it for over from me on a regular basis :</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s extra soft and protected against the sun if you have colored or processed hair.</li>
            <li> She mixes it with an essential oil that she enjoys smelling, then applies it lightly to her face, she is fair-skinned and has a hard time finding something that does not make her break out.</li>
            <li> , it leaves her skin moisturized and does not dry her out.</li>
            <li> I live in the desert and have pretty dry skin and just a few drops rubbed into my skin for a week is already showing benefits.</li>
            <li> I put a small amount in my hands and worked it through my freshly washed hair.</li>
            <li> I use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair when it wont stay down or before I use the straight iron.</li>
            <li> so seriously you&#x27;re getting your moneys worth plus!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll get some other, highly rated argan oil and see how that smells.</li>
            <li> I use 2-3 drops on my damp hair before I blow dry and it makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> This 100% pure Argan Oil is light and no added artificial fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have used other Argan Oil treatments and none have left my hair this soft.</li>
            <li> I like this, a little goes a long way and having a stopper is very helpful.  </li>
            <li> Really only requires 2-3 drops per use so this bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I use it mainly on my face everyday.  </li>
            <li> This bottle will last a long time...</li>
            <li> Flat ironing it doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> i will not renew it due to pricing on the license and renewal classes, major was skincare, haircare and makeup).</li>
            <li> Adding a couple of drops to bath water helping with overall dry skin flaking&lt;br</li>
            <li> Oh and a bottle of less than a complete ounce of this stuff sells in the hair care section at Mall Mart for over $5</li>
            <li> I guess my skin is extra dry .</li>
            <li> This oil was obviously spoiled as it had a pungent and sour aroma that is NOT characteristic of Argan oil.</li>
            <li> Lately I have been using my 100% Pure Argan Oil by GoPURE  </li>
            <li> Bought it for my daughter with long hair.</li>
            <li> It does not have a smell and not nearly as greasy as others.  </li>
            <li> (I have long hair),  and leave it on for the night, then wash in the morning.</li>
            <li> I also use the remaining oil that&#x27;s left on my hands to rub through the ends of my hair when its wet.  </li>
            <li> I switched due to price instead of Josie Marans but may go back.</li>
            <li> I have other brands of argan oil and none have ever had such a pungent, off scent.</li>
            <li> It also helps to prevent my hands from getting dry and also my nails.  </li>
            <li> My skin is dry to combination.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin</li>
            <li> If you suffer from dry skin or scalp, listen up.</li>
            <li> I do have a health condition that causes my hair to be dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I use it for hair after shampoo before and after blow  dry.  </li>
            <li> I had just reserved myself to dry, brittle, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> BECAUSE OUR FAMILY&#x27;S SKIN ALWAYS FEEL SO DRY.  </li>
            <li> Skin, hair, nails, cuticles, dry patches-</li>
            <li> Whether you use it alone or add a few drops to a store-bought lotion, argan oil will provide deep, lasting moisture.</li>
            <li> single bottle will last you a long time since a few drops go a long way.</li>
            <li> The smell is interesting but not overpowering or unpleasant</li>
            <li> The product seems natural but not sure if it has improved my skin or hair.</li>
            <li> and she manages to fry my normally dark hair to a day flow yellow.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t leave it weighed down especially at the crown.</li>
            <li> By the next day, I could tell my hair was softer and less brittle.</li>
            <li> I’ve even used it on my children when they have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have very dry scalp and skin - and this non comedogenic works well to retain moisture, without clogging my pores.</li>
            <li> hair is no where near the tangled mess in the mornings, as it used to be, after using a few drops on my hair after the shower (</li>
            <li> Lately, I have started to use the oil on my hands (and especially the cuticle area), and putting on gloves prior to bed at night.</li>
            <li> Not much of a smell to it</li>
            <li> My hands feel softer, smoother and nourished, and the effect lasts longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> I heard the quality of Argan oil sold could vary widely.</li>
            <li> Only have used it for a few days.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no scent</li>
            <li> Rough elbows?</li>
            <li> as you would a defrizzing agent).&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil is a keeper in my health and beauty regime and this organic, cold pressed, Moroccan Argan Oil is just right for all of the abovementioned requirements (and possibly beyond).</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way too when you are rubbing this on your skin after the shower.  </li>
            <li> So my hair has been dry and frizzy and not healthy looking for a long time now.</li>
            <li> Other uses for argan oil is aid in reducing stretch marks, acne blemishs and</li>
            <li> little bit goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other types of argan oil</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about pairing it with other beauty products.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair shiny and it seems oily and sticky compared to other Moroccan oil I have used.  </li>
            <li> underwent a medical treatment in the last 6 months, which left my hair, skin, and nails in very poor condition.</li>
            <li> A few drops go a long way!</li>
            <li> I have also  noticed a  little (a few drops) goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A Tiny little bit on my hands added to my behind length hair (starting at the ends)</li>
            <li> The smell reminds me of sour milk, and it made me feel nauseous.</li>
            <li> I put this on my hair (which is coarse, thick and curly) and it was transformed.</li>
            <li> but this one smells sour</li>
            <li> AND THEN APPLYED 2 DROPS INTO THE BOTTOM HALF OF MY HAIR FOR FRIZZ</li>
            <li> But it has a (growing) slightly rancid odor.</li>
            <li> I mix this half and half with my lotion.  </li>
            <li> Had a bad smell and the bottle isn&#x27;t full</li>
            <li> At 62, my face needs it and my long thick wavy hair can&#x27;t do without it</li>
            <li> I  told my  mom I would share a little with her</li>
            <li> A little drop will do you.</li>
            <li> This product has a slight smell to it, which isn&#x27;t terrible, but I kind of wish it was either stronger or not there at all.</li>
            <li> Sooooo I was somewhat hesitant to try pure Argan oil because I was afraid it would have a heavy perfumed smell.</li>
            <li> That being said, if your careful it REALLY softens your hair and your ends if they&#x27;re in a bad shape.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair everyday, so my hair still have damage even I use organic shampoo, but after I start to use this organ oil, and keep use this everyday</li>
            <li> I added couple drops onto my hands and buffed it with buffing crystals and it helped remove the dead skin off my hands.  </li>
            <li> After getting out the shower, I towel dried my hair and brush it</li>
            <li> For me, I just use a few drops at a time so not a problem.  </li>
            <li> I like it, I used over night for my face and neck, need a few drops</li>
            <li> Try rubbing a few drops onto your palms and then distribute it throughout the hair.</li>
            <li> I USED ON MY DRIED END</li>
            <li> I have a lot of trouble with eczema and allergies.</li>
            <li> so it is grease for a few</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few days and have seen a difference with the way my hands, feet, face, elbows and knees.</li>
            <li> My husband uses it all the time to tame is mane.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s my imagination, but my skin feels softer and luxurious after just a few days.</li>
            <li> I usually put a dab on the ends of my hair after styling and it keeps them from splitting.</li>
            <li> The oil flows out nicely, not sticky or heavy feeling at all.  </li>
            <li> I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO RECIEVED A SMALL SAMPLE BOTTLE,</li>
            <li> No more.</li>
            <li> poor hands get so dry in the cold months and they start to get red and irritated.  </li>
            <li> This oil is unusable and I doubt its safety for use on hair and skin if it has such a terrible smell straight out of the box.</li>
            <li> I rub a couple drops between my hands, and I literally mean 2, and run it through my damp hair after a shower.  </li>
            <li> Not that it is bad, just different.</li>
            <li> It takes anywhere from one day to several - it depends on how bad the flare up is.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my thick curly hair and it seems to make it worse.</li>
            <li> I received this product right after a horrible trip to the hair dresser</li>
            <li> I thought they were the same thing, and I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> It is a harsh product and smells bad</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointing purchase.</li>
            <li> 2 times aday to attempt to repair the damage instead of cutting it all off.</li>
            <li> it was crazy .</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s triple cold processed ensuring purity without sacrificing efficacy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to use it now:/</li>
            <li> usually on my face when you use oil for oil i get nasty break outs that scar my face</li>
            <li> /&gt;You know that this bottle came in 4oz bottle amber bottle (to protect it from going bad) with a dropper.  </li>
            <li> i have been using this for a day now on my hands and face, i am shocked to say no break outs!</li>

            <li> This works great in my family&#x27;s dry hair. It brings the life back. My husband uses it all the time to tame is mane. I use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair when it wont stay down or before I use the straight iron. I use it in my own hair before I straight iron because the lady at sally&#x27;s says it&#x27;s the best to keep the heat from damaging my hair.</li>
            <li> excellent product, recently had sutures on my face and the oil has helped with lessening the scar.</li>
            <li> This is a nice big jar and love the dropper! I use 2-3 drops on my damp hair before I blow dry and it makes my hair soft and shiny. I also add couple drops into my body lotion and it apply nicely.</li>
            <li> This product is high quality and a HUGE bottle for the price!!</li>
            <li> I received this Argan Oil for review from GoPure Naturals. Quite lovely. I love using argain oil because it is simply one ingredient. My skin and hair are happy. I usually put a dab on the ends of my hair after styling and it keeps them from splitting. This is a good quality argan oil. Worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s my imagination, but my skin feels softer and luxurious after just a few days. I&#x27;m a convert. Also received a personal email from the company, thanking me for supporting them. Wow. Real people. A real product. Why wouldn&#x27;t I be thrilled. Thank you goPure Naturals.</li>
            <li> great product.  My hair looks so much better since I&#x27;ve been using the product.</li>
            <li> Awesome wish I had gotten a bigger bottle in the first place. Definitely reordering soon.</li>
            <li> This was a gift to a friend; she really loves the product and uses it for both skin and hair.</li>
            <li> I love this oil for everything hair,  skin,  and  nails. I put it in all my beauty products and I use it right bout of the bottle as a moisturizer.  It also  works fantastic in my hair after a shower mixed with a little leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> i have been using this for a day now on my hands and face, i am shocked to say no break outs! usually on my face when you use oil for oil i get nasty break outs that scar my face, this doesn&#x27;t make me break out at all it&#x27;s been 24 hours now and no break outs, i mixed this with my favorite salts so i could do a face scrub and i am completely impressed with it. i&#x27;m almost speechless! i can not wait to mix this with shea butter and coconut oil to see if it will work better than others on my psoriasis on my ankle and leg!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FTC Disclosure: &amp;#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation, Licensed Cosmetologist as of 1996 (expired 2013 i will not renew it due to pricing on the license and renewal classes, major was skincare, haircare and makeup).

            <li> I wash my hair everyday, so my hair still have damage even I use organic shampoo, but after I start to use this organ oil, and keep use this everyday I figure out my hair look smooth and shining everyday, what a surprise~~LOVE IT~Thanks</li>
            <li> There are a lot of options out there if you are looking for carrier oils. Argan oil is one of my Favorites! I was really excited that this bottle came with a glass dropper. Argan oil is great for all types of skin, especially maturing, without leaving a greasy feel. It absorbs nicely.  Love that this is 100% pure and I can trust it.</li>
            <li> I heard read great things about this oil. And gave it as a gift.</li>
            <li> I have received this product for testing and review. 100% pure argon oil by goPure. I love this oil for it&#x27;s many uses. It&#x27;s great to use on hair, hydrating the skin, nails. I love the way it feels on my skin. There is no scent,&lt;br /&gt;With this bottle of argan oil you get a dropper. Just apply a few drops on your skin and rub in for smooth refreshing skin. My skin feels amazing when I use this argan oil not only does it make my skin soft and hydrated, but it&#x27;s rich in anti oxidants. Other uses for argan oil is aid in reducing stretch marks, acne blemishs and scars.&lt;br /&gt;My argan oil arrived quickly and packed appropriately. I&#x27;m sure that you will enjoy your 100% Pure Argan Oil by goPURE Naturals, that you will want to continue to purchase more. This Argan Oil made in the USA in an FDA registered facility.</li>
            <li> Good quality and good for my hair and skin!</li>
            <li> My birthday was two weeks ago, and I went to get my hair done. The stylist absolutely FRIED my hair. It was terrible and a terrible experience. I litterally had scabs all over my head for days. When I got home, I broke out my Argon Oil by goPure and used it in my hair. Within a week of using it daily, my hair was almost back to it&#x27;s former glory. It&#x27;s been about two weeks now and my hair is actually in better condition than it was before</li>
            <li> Works amazing. Love this product. Use it on my hair mostly and it does wonders.</li>
            <li> I use this Argan Oil to keep my hair moisturized after washing it. I have dry hair and this works amazingly for that. It also helps to prevent my hands from getting dry and also my nails.  The smell is not overpowering, very pleasant.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  It makes my hair shiny for my coarse hair.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love the way this feels on my face and doesn&#x27;t make it too oily. I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> My hair is absolutely beautiful again because of this oil. I spent months trying to find a product that would restore my hair&#x27;s natural oils and not just mask it. goPURE&#x27;s Argan Oil will become a permanent part of my hair routine.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to try goPure&#x27;s Argan Oil!  When I had the chance to be able to try this I was looking at the many uses for this &amp;#34;liquid gold&amp;#34; There are so many ways to use Argan oil from skin to hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know that this bottle came in 4oz bottle amber bottle (to protect it from going bad) with a dropper.  The oil flows out nicely, not sticky or heavy feeling at all.  I love how it just dissapears into your skin without leaving a greasy film to where ever it is applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My poor hands get so dry in the cold months and they start to get red and irritated.  I added couple drops onto my hands and buffed it with buffing crystals and it helped remove the dead skin off my hands.  Then I mixed some argan oil with shea butter and my hands felt soft and moisturized. Now i do this 1 time every week to prevent my hands from cracking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love using it right out of the shower!  I mix it with my moisturizer and my skin just drinks it up.  Love it, it absorbs right into my skin.  No greasy after feel.  Did you know it is also great for brittle nails?  I use it as cuticle oil because my cuticles are on the dry side and Argan oils leaves them soft and healthy looking. I did use it on my hair, I made a hair mask with this. It was my avocado n Argan oil hair food.  I left it on for 30 mins while I did some housework.  After getting out the shower, I towel dried my hair and brush it and it looked so shiny! Felt silky soft too and not greasy. I sometimes like to use coconut oil but that does leave hair greasy.  Not this Argan oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like to straighten your hair you can use one tiny dot of this and run it through your hair before straightening. Then a bit after to seal in the shininess to your hair.  You&#x27;ll love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I did receive sample for review.  All opinions expressed here are my own.* I did post up a review a while ago but it never go posted.</li>
            <li> very good quality and good price.</li>
            <li> Big bottle with both a dropper and a cap.  The dropper does not pull up too much oil, so have to keep getting more out of jar if using a lot.  For me, I just use a few drops at a time so not a problem.  Use it on my face and so far no problems with breakouts.  I use as a carrier oil for  essential oils.  Not much of a smell to it so that is a good thing.  Plan on trying on my hair.  So far I am pleased.  Great product, great price and shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting because I had tried argon oil hair products and the consistency and texture are totally different. I still use the hair products, but I use this as a nightly treatment for my face and I LOVE it!!!!</li>
            <li> Had a bad smell and the bottle isn&#x27;t full it was only about half full but for what was there helped my hair.</li>
            <li> I like it, I used over night for my face and neck, need a few drops and I saw different. My skin is dry to combination. Oil has a light scent.</li>
            <li> I love this product, after using it my hair become so soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and I regularly use it on my hair and hands. I am an african-american woman and argan oil absorbs quickly and softens my hair without making it oily. My hands feel softer, smoother and nourished, and the effect lasts longer than I expected. I&#x27;m going to try it on my face to see how well it works.</li>
            <li> Great oil. Use it on skin and hair</li>
            <li> Absolutely fabulous for my dry hair after giving birth! Love it!</li>
            <li> This Argan Oil works great for skin &amp; hair. It&#x27;s 100% natural which I liked, and is offered at a competitive price.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily. I add this to shampoo, lotions, and etc.it really don&#x27;t have much of a smell to it. It does take awhile to absorb into skin so its best to use at night. the ingredients are;100% pure grade A, certified organic (USDA &amp;ECOCERT) cold-pressed argan oil(argania spinosa kernel argan oil). its light weight. their are so many different uses for this product and this is how I use it; I HAVE FRIZZY HAIR AND I WATCHED MY HAIR WITH IT AND THEN APPLYED 2 DROPS INTO THE BOTTOM HALF OF MY HAIR FOR FRIZZ AND IT WORKS WONDERFUL IN MY HAIR. I ASLO ADD IT TO MY LOTIONS TO HELP MY SKIN AND BOOST UP MU FAVORIGHT LOTIONS.... I DID GET THIS PRODUCT FOR FREE TO GIVE MY HONEST OPINION ON IT.. THIS IS MY OWN THOUGHT ABOUT THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this product. I use this Argan oil as a fix all, it works great as a facial moisturizer and seems to even out my skin tone. I also like to use it in my hair it makes it look soft and supple without looking greasy. When i use it as a moisturizer my skin feels great and not at all greasy. The argan oil absorbs super fast too.</li>
            <li> I ordered Argan oil because a blog group I belong to was discussing the benefits of using Arganoil for facial cleansing (mixed with a carrier oil) and moisturizing. I heard the quality of Argan oil sold could vary widely. I was very pleased with the quality of this Argan oil. It definitely improves the cleansing formula I created and makes a noticeable difference in my moisturizer. It melts easily into the skin, leaving it hydrated and soft. It does not clog my pores. It feels luxurious! A few drops go a long way! This bottle will last a long time...good value!</li>
            <li> The product seems natural but not sure if it has improved my skin or hair.</li>
            <li> I was sent this product for free to review for an unbiased opinion. This product has a slight smell to it, which isn&#x27;t terrible, but I kind of wish it was either stronger or not there at all. I absolutely loved the packaging it came in because it was a huge glass bottle with an eye dropper. I always love using the eye dropper and the glass makes the packaging very attractive. I love how this oil went on my hair, but a little bit went a very long way. I tend to use a little bit more than normal for my eyes, but this stuff can really go to greasy if your not careful. One time I put in on my eyes after a shower and then brushed through my whole head and it made my entire head very greasy. That being said, if your careful it REALLY softens your hair and your ends if they&#x27;re in a bad shape. I have very damaged ends from an ombre that I had done and this argan oil really protects it for when I add heat to it. If your looking for something that is cheap and organic, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> So far it is great and makes my face smoother and brighter.  Only have used it for a few days.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re an Argan oil fan, than this is a great deal!</li>
            <li> Argan oil is the most wonderful product!  Great for nails, hair and skin.  I use this daily with great results!  Good price.  Nice quality product.</li>
            <li> I have been  using  this  product  in two  different  ways. First  of all it has been used in my hair. It makes my hair  nice and shiny  but not at all greasy. I traditionally  use keratin. I also  used  this on my skin  and  again  I didn&#x27;t  find it greasy  it absorbed  quickly and  left  my skin  well moisturized. I wish  it had a stronger  scent to it and  also a pump  as opposed  to a dropper. I received  this  product  for  a  discount  in  exchange  for  an  honest  review.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my daughter with long hair. She said its good.</li>
            <li> WOW.  THIS STUFF IS AMAZING. BEST MOISTURIZER THAT DOES NOT CLOG FACE AND DOES WHAT IS SAYS. ALL I CAN SAY IS I AM ORDERING MORE FOR FAMILY AND FRIENDS.  DO NOT PASS UP THIS PRODUCT. DOES WHAT IT SAYS AND MORE</li>
            <li> Great price! Will buy again!!</li>
            <li> The first two bottles I bought made me very happy. I used it on my hair and it made it really smooth. But the third bottle smelled rancid. Does argan oil expire? Why is there no expiration date? If it&#x27;s caused by the summer heat, why doesn&#x27;t the label have storage instructions?</li>
            <li> If you suffer from dry skin or scalp, listen up. You really want to give Argan Oil a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found the first oil that I can say will always be in my supply rack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the ways we are using it:&lt;br /&gt;~ Rubbing just a drop on the ends of our hair stops the frizzy look and feel&lt;br /&gt;~ Massaging a couple of drops on any itchy spot – stops the itch immediately&lt;br /&gt;~ Rubbing a drop on our cuticles stops the dry splitting areas from catching and pulling&lt;br /&gt;~ Adding a couple of drops to bath water helping with overall dry skin flaking&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I didn’t love about the product was the initial scent. Not that it is bad, just different. And it fades quickly so that isn’t really a problem either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
            <li> Really like this product.  It is great for the skin and hair.  I use it mainly on my face everyday.  it keeps it moist and smooth.</li>
            <li> Received this oil and opened the bottle today. . . Oil was completely rancid! I have purchased Argan oil in the past from different manufacturers, and they have all had a distinctly nutty (and pleasant) smell. This oil was obviously spoiled as it had a pungent and sour aroma that is NOT characteristic of Argan oil. The smell reminds me of sour milk, and it made me feel nauseous. This oil is unusable and I doubt its safety for use on hair and skin if it has such a terrible smell straight out of the box. No expiration date was printed on this bottle, so I have no way of knowing how old this oil actually is. I will be returning this product and I will not purchase from goPURE ever again. Extremely disappointing purchase.</li>
            <li> Good product and works well!</li>
            <li> good quality argan oil</li>
            <li> When I received my Argan Oil it came packaged very nicely and was so glad that the dropper was included. I have been using this about a week and love the way it makes my skin feel, but used it on my hair and wish I had not. It made my hair feel really greasy and limp, maybe I used too much but won&#x27;t use it on my hair again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it on my face and hair.  My aesthetician remarked how soft my skin is.  The smell is interesting but not overpowering or unpleasant which is good for me because I&#x27;m sensitive to smells and don&#x27;t usually wear anything that is scented.  Arrived quickly and with no problems!  Really only requires 2-3 drops per use so this bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my thick curly hair and it seems to make it worse. Flat ironing it doesn&#x27;t do anything. No improvement only more mess</li>
            <li> This argan oil is light and makes my hair really shiny and soft. I like to use it on my skin and nails. It softens up cuticles on fingers and toes and makes my nails look really hydrated. The oil absorbs pretty quickly and it works rather well at keeping those rough areas of the skin like knees and elbows smooth. I really like that this product is organic, this helps me to feel more confident in using it on my face. It works great under makeup to help foundation go on smoothly. I would definitely recommend this to help with maintaining healthy hair and skin. The 4 oz size is a great value and it should last a long time. I recommend using it sparingly on the hair if you are going for shine. Try rubbing a few drops onto your palms and then distribute it throughout the hair. Otherwise you could use more product at night to deep condition and wash it out in the morning for fabulous results. I received this for free so I could give my own honest opinion of this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this oil and the quality is good. The company is good and they stand by their product. This product promoted growth in my nails and makes my skin soft but it wasn&#x27;t the best product for my hair. I do have a health condition that causes my hair to be dry and brittle.  Over all this product rocks.  I was offered this product at a reduced price however,  this is a unbiased  review and it is solely based upon my usage of the Argan oil. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I have been using argan oil for some time now on my hair. I have always loved it but this organic argan oil has no funky smell or color and has a much &#x27;cleaner&#x27; feeling! I&#x27;m gonna be a lifer!  https://www.amazon.com/review/R2EZXPYBBUJ78W/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rdp_perm</li>
            <li> Excellent product and excellent service.  Wrapped nicely with a extra dropper top so you do not waste a drop of the wonderful oil.  A nice touch was receiving a personal email from the company to make sure I was satisfied.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I really love goPURE products.  They are consistently high quality and do exactly what I need them to do.  The Argan oil is no exception.  Wonderful product.  I will definitely purchase more from goPURE when I run out.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! This Argan oil adds a great shine to my hair &amp; makes it feel so soft. I haven&#x27;t tried it on my face or skin yet, but if I do, I will update this review and let y&#x27;all know how that goes. :)</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and many oil / skin products leave my skin pink and blotchy.  This 100% pure Argan Oil is light and no added artificial fragrance. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil to help restore luster to my hair. I chose it over coconut oil because my hair is fairly straight, and coconut oil is just too heavy to use on my type of hair. I did a lot of research prior to choosing the GoPure Naturals brand. This Argan Oil is light and easy to apply after towel-drying my hair after shampooing; it can also be used as an intensive treatment prior to shampooing for really dry hair. The seller was very responsive when I contacted them about how to use the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I underwent a medical treatment in the last 6 months, which left my hair, skin, and nails in very poor condition. Lately, I have started to use the oil on my hands (and especially the cuticle area), and putting on gloves prior to bed at night. I have been doing so for less than a week, and already my hands are in much better condition. I may start using it on my hands during the day as well. I definitely recommend the product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other more expensive argon oils but this is by far the best. I use it on my hair. cuticles and skin. One of the driest oils ever which is great for a non-greasy result!</li>
            <li> What a great value for this product!  I just began experimenting with different oils for a cleansing and moisturizing method and this argan oil is spectacular for my dry skin-- about 3 drops and my face feels ultra moisturized and the scars from my acne are fading as well :)  The one thing I didn&#x27;t like was the smell of the oil-- but this is my first time purchasing so it may just be how it naturally smells.  I did add a few drops of lavender oil to it, however, and it now smells super luxurious! Thanks for the product!</li>
            <li> Read reviews before buying this product and I would have to agree there is no smell with this product...Been using it for only a week and not only can I already see a difference in my skin but even my mom noticed a difference too. My skin  is much  softer and already my fine lines are  even starting to soften too. My mom asked me  what I was using and I told her Argan oil. She  now wants to  start using it for herself. This is a  4 oz. bottle  with a dropper included. I have also  noticed a  little (a few drops) goes a long way. I  told my  mom I would share a little with her but  she would have to buy her own bottle LOL  I will  definitely be buying more when it runs out.</li>
            <li> Good product,will buy it again</li>
            <li> i can see that my dry skin is much better after applying this oil</li>
            <li> Thicker than a lot of oils and really helps my skin. Looking forward to using this in some balm and lotion blends with some essential oils.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t my &amp;#34;fav&amp;#34; of the argan oils I have used, but it is good and I&#x27;m not disappointed.  It does not have a smell and not nearly as greasy as others.  I use mine for my hands.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product for my toddler&#x27;s hair. It leaves her hair so shiny and healthy looking and has even made it more manageable. I will be buying more!</li>
            <li> On the one hand, it seems to be pretty effective against dry skin on my face. ...But it has a (growing) slightly rancid odor. I doubt it&#x27;s supposed to smell like this. Guessing the warehouse has a backlog of this stuff that they don&#x27;t want to throw away. ...Thinking they should. I&#x27;ll get some other, highly rated argan oil and see how that smells.</li>
            <li> In my experience, using Argan oil is a win - win situation; It&#x27;s amazing to use to moisturize and strengthen brittle nails, hydrate dried out dish washer hands and put luster, shine, conditioning and detangling benefits into your worn out, fried hair.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is no where near the tangled mess in the mornings, as it used to be, after using a few drops on my hair after the shower (as you would a defrizzing agent).&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil is a keeper in my health and beauty regime and this organic, cold pressed, Moroccan Argan Oil is just right for all of the abovementioned requirements (and possibly beyond). I would recommend this product to a friend. I purchased a promotional sample of this product and this is my objective and honest opinion after using it.</li>
            <li> RECIEVED THIS ITEM PRETTY FAST!! I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO RECIEVED A SMALL SAMPLE BOTTLE, NOPE IT WAS LARGE BOTTLE! THIS ITEM WORKS WONDERS I USED ON MY DRIED END AND MADE MY ENDS VERY SOFT AND SILKY. I RECIEVED THIS PRODUCT FREE IN EXCHANGED FOR MY HONEST REVIEW. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO OTHERS.</li>
            <li> wonderful! i add it to my face and body cream and apply it morning and evening. it makes my skin hydrated and actually gives it a glow..i have had several people comment on how well i am looking since i began using this product..very pleased ..</li>
            <li> I just go this is and so far I love it,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been hesitant of the hype and reluctant to try this for quite a while, so when I was given the chance to try it for free for my unbiased opinion I jumped at the chance.  I was surprised that it really is as good as they say!  The scent is very light and pleasant, not purfumey, and doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation.  This is important for those like me that can be sensitive to certain smells and have a full on nasal shutdown, which I didn&#x27;t, YAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little bit goes a long way!  I repeat, you only need a few drops so this bottle will last you a good while.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week on both my face and hair.  I rub a couple drops between my hands, and I literally mean 2, and run it through my damp hair after a shower.  It&#x27;s great at reducing the frizz and giving me smooth and shiny hair.  I&#x27;ve also noticed some improvement in my adult acne prone skin.  I&#x27;m still in the healing process but it is much improved and wish I had taken a before and after to show the difference.  I have quite sensitive skin that can be quite dry due to where I live and this argan oil was great at not causing any additional breakouts while healing it and keeping it hydrated.  I would highly recommend trying this and plan to repurchase if and when I run out.</li>
            <li> Love it! Great and reasonably priced! You can use it from head to toe. It&#x27;s not greasy and it&#x27;s basically odorless. You will NOT be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Sooooo I was somewhat hesitant to try pure Argan oil because I was afraid it would have a heavy perfumed smell. I was pleasantly surprised when this arrived so well packaged and with the bottle dropper. I put this on my hair (which is coarse, thick and curly) and it was transformed. By the next day, I could tell my hair was softer and less brittle. I used it on my skin at night and it absorbs well. I have clear skin anyways because I use an oil cleansing method with another type of oil. No more. Argan oil is now my go to oil of choice for my cleansing. Mix with other oils to make your own unique blend. I forever grateful and will using this product from now on. Makes my nails and cuticles perfectly soft. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I like this, a little goes a long way and having a stopper is very helpful.  I&#x27;ve tried other argon oils,  but this seems the best to use on my African American/Asian hair so far.  Only 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t been using it very long, but will update my review once I get a chance to use it more. So far so very good -smile.</li>
            <li> I’ve never used Argon Oil, to be honest before accepting the product I had to research what it was … it’s a palm tree oil. I was given this product for free as part of a promotion in exchange, I provided my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I’ve used this oil on my hair, skin and face. I like the oil and it feels great because it provides a great moisturizer. I’ve even used it on my children when they have very dry skin. I’ve tried several products from the goPURE manufacture and I’m satisfy with the consistent quality of their products. The products are great, but also I’m satisfy with the results I’ve seen. Also the products I’ve used also come with a 100% satisfaction guarantee. I think it’s wonderful to see that companies are willing to guarantee their product, so the consumer can see if the product works for them.</li>
            <li> Love this oil..leaves your face smooth and a nice glow..will  buy it again</li>
            <li> Super super LOVE this stiff! A Tiny little bit on my hands added to my behind length hair (starting at the ends) makes it so much easier to brush and there isn&#x27;t near as much shedding either!  It also works great at moisturizing my super dry hands in the process. There is absolutely no scent so I&#x27;m going to try adding this to some home made lotions and conditioners too. If it helps this much straight in tiny amounts it can only get better spread out in a lotion right? Oh and a bottle of less than a complete ounce of this stuff sells in the hair care section at Mall Mart for over $5 so seriously you&#x27;re getting your moneys worth plus!</li>
            <li> The argan oil works well for what my wife uses it for. She mixes it with an essential oil that she enjoys smelling, then applies it lightly to her face, she is fair-skinned and has a hard time finding something that does not make her break out. This works better than the $30 products that beauty places charge for. This works better and has none of the other harsh chemicals. This product works,cheaper, healthier, and readily available. What is not to like? Also this does not leaver her oily after use, it leaves her skin moisturized and does not dry her out.</li>
            <li> this oil is light and absorbs fast, its  perfect for the skin after shower.  i will definitely purchase this argan oil again</li>
            <li> It does seem to get rid of the frizz in my hair. I&#x27;m putting it in my condition to see if it adds more moisture to my hair. My hair seems to have more moisture and volume and is softer from this product. So far, I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> I use argan oil for hair treatment weekly. I apply it on my hair (I have long hair),  and leave it on for the night, then wash in the morning. My hair looks nourished, shiny and healthy - real salon look, obtain with just Argan Oil. I strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> After reading up on the benefits of Argan Oil I decided to give it a try and am very pleased.  I live in the desert and have pretty dry skin and just a few drops rubbed into my skin for a week is already showing benefits.</li>
            <li> I use goPURE Naturals&#x27; 100% USDA Organic Argan Oil, as a hair treatment, as a body moisturizer, as a makeup remover and as a treatment for my nails and cuticles. I love how it nourishes and moisturizes my hair, skin and nails! I have very dry scalp and skin - and this non comedogenic works well to retain moisture, without clogging my pores. It is made with organic ingredients and is very well priced - truly worth purchasing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end userÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s standpoint.</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing.  I have extremely dry skin.  I mix this half and half with my lotion.  soaks it quickly.  and it works !!  may start using it right out of the bottle soon as my skin is that dry.  I tried the hair, first time too much, next time not enough.  So I will keep working on this.</li>
            <li> Very good quality!! Will buy it again!!</li>
            <li> Love it!! Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> This stuff goes on so smooth you almost have skin as soft as a baby.  Great shine for your hair too. Once a week I put this in my colored hair wear a soft bonnet and go to bed. The next day it&#x27;s shiny and silky after I wash it.</li>
            <li> my hair is so soft! I love this Argon oil, been using on my face and skit too, works great</li>
            <li> Good product at a good price, and seller is very helpful.  Love the argan oil for my hair, does not weigh it down, and ads a healthy shine.</li>
            <li> Go Pure Argan Oil is for You &amp; Me. A quality product that helps you to grow hair &amp; nails. And promotes silky skin. A little drop will do you.Please check out my video on youtube.&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> When i received my Argan oil it had smell rancid and im sure argan oil isn&#x27;t supposed to smell that way.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I use it for hair after shampoo before and after blow  dry.  Make my hair looks shine and moistured.</li>
            <li> This is a nice Argan oil. I have been using it as a carrier oil for essential oils. It soaks into the skin well. I am very happy with this oil,</li>
            <li> I recently discovered argan oil. This oil is amazing, I use it in my shampoo, face cream, and foot lotion. I&#x27;ve tried other types of argan oil and I find this to be good quality oil. It was a dream to add to all of my recipes with essential oils.</li>
            <li> I love this Argan oil. It has so many uses and is a high quality oil.</li>
            <li> I love that the goPURE Naturals Argan Oil is 100% pure! I think this is the best natural moisturizer you can use  all over your face, and body. I really like the fact that goPURE Naturals Argan Oil is light-weight, absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since goPURE Naturals is in its purest form, it doesn&#x27;t have any fragrances, but you can smell a strong odor that I didn&#x27;t really like. The only thing I did to make the smell go away is to add a couple of drops of the Argan Oil unto the palm of my hands and mixed it with my body lotion. The smell goes away after a while, but when you don&#x27;t mix it with anything else, and use it on its own, it takes a while for the strong odor to fade away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a positive note, when I apply goPURE Naturals on my face I absolutely love how luminous my skin looks! I also love using the goPURE Naturals on the skin under my eyes to keep my under eye moisturized. I think it&#x27;s perfect to use to prep for concealer that way the concealer won&#x27;t settle into the fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels supple, and soft after each use. I especially love using the goPURE Naturals Argan Oil on my feet to soften them, and keep them moisturized, and on my hands concentrating on my cuticles since they tend to get dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with the goPURE Naturals Argan Oil. Although I don&#x27;t like the scent, I think it&#x27;s still a great product because its pure, and makes my skin, hair, and nails look healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: Sent for review purposes. However the opinions expressed are 100% my own based on my experience with the product.&lt;br /&gt;Overall,</li>
            <li> wonderful oil; doesn&#x27;t stay oily, penetrates skin quickly.  my skin feels sosoft. helps with psoriasis outbreaks.  very light scent</li>
            <li> My wife love this argan oil very match!!!</li>
            <li> I am an avid user of argan oil. At 62, my face needs it and my long thick wavy hair can&#x27;t do without it</li>
            <li> I seem to have inherited the eczema that my mother fought most of her adult life. I have tried many of the salves and lotions on the market, all without success. I found Argan Oil about a year ago. I apply Argan Oil with a cotton swab to affected areas twice a day. It has cleared up every problem area I&#x27;ve used it on. It takes anywhere from one day to several - it depends on how bad the flare up is. I have a lot of trouble with eczema and allergies. It is such a relief to have something that will control flaky skin issues. I just have to make sure the oil I buy is 100% pure with no additives AND no fragrances.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m such a fan or Argan oils! I have been dying my hair since I was about 30 years old. So my hair has been dry and frizzy and not healthy looking for a long time now. I had just reserved myself to dry, brittle, frizzy hair. I have used other Argan Oil treatments and none have left my hair this soft. I put a small amount in my hands and worked it through my freshly washed hair. I use more than the suggested amount because I have long hair with a lot of frizz, and always need more. I mainly use it on the bottom half of my hair because that is where I have my main issue. I put a little more in my hand and then put my hair product on top of it in my hand (mousse) I put that all over my hair and it doesn&#x27;t leave it weighed down especially at the crown. It leaves my hair very shiny and healthy looking. I&#x27;m very pleased with this oil. I have gotten several compliment on how shiny and healthy my hair looks now : )&lt;br /&gt;* I received this product free to evaluate and give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> quick delivery and very good product LOVE it will order again and again</li>
            <li> I love argan oil but this one smells sour, im sure it works ok but cant get over smell. I switched due to price instead of Josie Marans but may go back.</li>
            <li> I love Argan Oil. I have really frizzy hair. This is the only stuff I can put on my hair that keeps those little fly away hairs down without it looking greasy. It works great on my dry forehead to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product free for review. I am a blogger that states my true opinion.</li>
            <li> well packed and very fast shipping. love how its organically made. i use it in my hair and is loving it.</li>
            <li> Honestly, my skin is oily skin , so most of oily skin care products, I basically do not touch them, but I see a lot of benefits from this product, so I decided to try it, in order to avoid my skin feels oily, I only use 4 drops on my palm before going to bed, It doesn&#x27;t have special smell, I put it on my face and neck, and gently massage the face (especially focus on lines), and until I do not feel there is any oily feeling on my face , and then apply my lotion, Surprise happen when I get up the next day, my skin looks softer, the fine lines look a little bit not so deep, Love it~~I think I&#x27;ll continue to use it, thanks</li>
            <li> it is a good produce. the smell is good. when put on skin feels smooth and moisture. it is bigger than I thought, totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Good to skin and hair, thank u very much</li>
            <li> I USE A LOT ARGAN OIL FOR MY FAMILY.  BECAUSE OUR FAMILY&#x27;S SKIN ALWAYS FEEL SO DRY.  THIS ARGAN OIL HELP US A LOT. KEEP OUR SKIN MOISTURE, SOFT.  WE USE IT FOR WHOLE BODY.  THANKS  I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCTS AT DISCOUNT PRICE IN EXCHANGE MY REVIEW.</li>
            <li> I love to use argan oil on my hair. It keep my hair hydrated..feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I received this product right after a horrible trip to the hair dresser and she manages to fry my normally dark hair to a day flow yellow. I have been putting it in my hair 2 times aday to attempt to repair the damage instead of cutting it all off. In two weeks i have notices a complete difference and once again can get a brush thru the back of my hair... just wish it would fix the color..</li>
            <li> What I love most about this argan oil is it has no scent! I don&#x27;t have to worry about pairing it with other beauty products. To use, simply massage the organ oil directly into the skin wherever you wish to take advantage of its healing, nourishing and rejuvenating properties. Alternately, argan oil can be added to your favorite lotion to boost its ability to provide all day hydration. Whether you use it alone or add a few drops to a store-bought lotion, argan oil will provide deep, lasting moisture. I like to add it to my Aveeno daily moisturizer and it keeps my face oil free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil is also a great treatment for dry, brittle nails. When massaged into the nails and cuticles, it moisturizes and softens the skin and promotes the growth of strong, healthy nails. I like to do this twice a day, once in the morning and once before bed. I even add a couple drops to my hand cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A single bottle will last you a long time since a few drops go a long way. This product is a fantastic value, you get a ton for your money.</li>
            <li> Smells great.  I used the oil in my hair.  Omg it fells so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Glad I bought this . . . made my hair silky smooth and my nails shiny.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!! Great quality Argan oil! It moisturizes my hair and skin and has no odor unlike another brand I have tried before.</li>
            <li> I like this product, I have a mixed niece and I&#x27;m not that great at doing her hair but this oil made things much easier</li>
            <li> Love it.put it on my face, my hair, my hands, everywhere. The best!</li>
            <li> Love this product!! It makes my hair feel healthier and it moisturize my face and skin. Also has no odor.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair smooth and shiny.So happy to have got this as a promotional price , its amazing</li>
            <li> Love the way it feels in my hair, use right after a shower!</li>
            <li> Love it!  Works well in my health/bath/beauty products!  Will be back!</li>
            <li> I received the 100% goPure Argan oil very quickly in the mail. I used it on my hair after I shampooed it. There was no odor from the oil, and I was really worried that my hair would be oily after using it. I was impressed once my hair was dry because it made my hair extremely soft and smooth! I didn&#x27;t need a lot and my hair wasn&#x27;t oily at all. It only took one treatment to see a noticeable difference. I also used it on my dog when I gave her a bath and her hair was very soft and silky, too!&lt;br /&gt;#ARGANOIL</li>
            <li> Pretty amazing stuff.  I have been applying to my body as an after shower moisturizer.  A little goes a long way too when you are rubbing this on your skin after the shower.  I also use the remaining oil that&#x27;s left on my hands to rub through the ends of my hair when its wet.  It really helps with my ends that get dried out.  The bottle is actually a pretty decent size too so I&#x27;m happy this should last me awhile.</li>
            <li> I have been in love with this argan oil ! I got this free for testing and as soon as I got it I started using it . The directions say to use one or two drops on skin and rub in , I did this the first night and my skin soaked it up so fast it was crazy . The next night I used seven drops much better . I guess my skin is extra dry . I am always buying products to help my skin and I have had the best results with the goPOUR argan oil . I cant believe the amazing results I have had with the aragn oil . I use this two times a day on my hands and arms and it is oil so it is grease for a few but it dose soak in very fast , I would tell everyone if you have a problem with dry skin you have to give this a shot you will love it so much but your skin will love it moreI ! The change in my skin is amazing . I use to buy every new thing they came out with , but now i have found the best skin care ever . I would pay more than this retails for its that good !</li>
            <li> I use on skin and hair.  Feels great.</li>
            <li> My sensitive skin was irritated and turned red. It is a harsh product and smells bad</li>
            <li> I use it on my hair for deep oil treatments. Put it on at night, brush it through, let it set and wash it out the next day. It absorbs well into the hair and I haven&#x27;t seen any oily residue on my pillows.</li>
            <li> Argan Oil quickly became one of the most popular oils in the beauty industry used as a nourishing elixir from head-to-toe. Many cosmetic companies nowadays add Argan Oil to the ingredients of their products because of its benefits. However, getting a bottle of 100% pure Argan Oil is always better, because you know there are not additional chemicals, parabens and silicones. If you would like to simplify your beauty routine and reduce the number of products you put on your face and hair, Argan Oil is the product to choose. It is great as a nourishing face and body moisturizer, as well as hydrating hair and nails treatment. Since Argan Oil is considered a dry oil, absorbs quickly, leaving hair and body soft and moisturized without greasy or oily residues. It could be used on its own or added to any of your favorite cream, serum, lotion, exfoliator, hair mask or essential oil. Argan Oil can help prevent stretch marks by improving the elasticity of the skin and is also great for treating skin rashes or infections, acne and bug bites. Argan Oil is a natural product and is safe for pregnant women and kids, though you should do a spot test before start using anything new on your skin, in case of an allergic reaction. I always have a bottle of Argan Oil in my beauty cabinet and love using it for just about everything. Lately I have been using my 100% Pure Argan Oil by GoPURE  which is a premium grade Argan Oil from Morocco and is 100% certified organic. It comes in a 4 oz./120 ml. amber bottle with a dropper which makes the application easy and convenient. Argan Oil by GoPURE has the specific for all Argan Oils scent, which reminds me of the smell of an olive oil, however once the oil absorbs into the skin, the scent dissipates. If you have not tried Argan Oil yet, I strongly suggest to do so as soon as possible, because you are going to love all the benefits that will provide for your hair, face,body and nails.&lt;br /&gt;__________________________________&lt;br /&gt;Product provided complimentary for testing purposes.

            <li> This oil works so well in my hair. I love they way it shines and softens my hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair shiny and it seems oily and sticky compared to other Moroccan oil I have used.  I thought they were the same thing, and I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:200aa6db33399d9fbdd501cc40dcfeaf]]I&#x27;ve been using argan oil for years, but I never thought about how it would be so awesome on beards! So I smacked some onto my hairy Sasquatch man...... his beard was itching and I had just gotten this sent to me to review and I had an AHA moment and told him to rub some into his beard. It soothed his skin, made him beard soft and shiny and made the skin feel moisturized, Now he would like to take it for over from me on a regular basis :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil is amazing for just about everything. Skin, hair, nails, cuticles, dry patches- you name it. If you put some into your shampoo, you&#x27;ll have super shiny hair that&#x27;s extra soft and protected against the sun if you have colored or processed hair. Speaking of, mixing some into your dye before dying your hair makes the color grab on and last longer while looking more vibrant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hangnails? Flyaways? Split Ends? Rough elbows? All a thing of the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;goPure makes awesome products in general, i&#x27;ve used a number of their other products and they&#x27;ve all blown my socks off and this is no exception. You get an enormous bottle for the price of most that are 1/4 the size and it&#x27;s triple cold processed ensuring purity without sacrificing efficacy. Across the board, I can&#x27;t recommend it enough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR THE HONEST REVIEW</li>
            <li> I love this oil!!! It&#x27;s a wonderful oil that will soon be in my face creams and lotions. It&#x27;s smell and texture is high quality and it comes with a dropper for easy measuring. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> loved this argan oil it definitely passed all the test to see if it was really 100% aragan oil and it goes on so smoothly and absorbs into skin so quickly and wont leave any uncomfortable or sticky feeling after. this product does not have a nasty odor to it but it also does not have a pretty scent which is a good thing because that means it doesn&#x27;t have any added scented ingredients which would not make it pure argan oil. i did receive this free for me to review but that does not influence my opinion on any product i review these are 100% my own feeling and thoughts on this product.</li>
            <li> I use it like baby oil for everything and the smell of the oil is wonderful, very subtle and refreshing.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this and begin using it. However, the smell is quite funky. Almost like a spoiled food smell. I have other brands of argan oil and none have ever had such a pungent, off scent. Usually more of a subtle nutty hint to it. I&#x27;m afraid to use it now:/</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few days and have seen a difference with the way my hands, feet, face, elbows and knees. I used the oil at night on all the listed places and the next morning they were very morsturized. It takes a while for it to soak in, so I recommend using it at night.</li>
