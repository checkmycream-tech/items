            <li> I&#x27;ve used these a few times before reviewing to give an accurate review. These nails are indeed pretty, and look great when combined with a pink acrylic powder but they are cheap and flimsy. What can you expect for the price right? My acrylic nails are always strong but these nails are still flimsy no matter how much acrylic you use. I personally do not recommend.</li>
            <li> I ordered these but got Grey black and silver Zebra print. Since they&#x27;re shipped out of Hong Kong I won&#x27;t make a huge fuss about it. The zebra print is pretty cool though.</li>
            <li> Love these! They&#x27;re an excellent thickness, not too thin. They went on easy, and are holding up well. I will buy them again.</li>

            <li> Exactly like the picture!!  I love them sooo much!  They come in individuals numbered bags, which are al in one bigger bag.  They have a groove in them so you can get them straight and all the same!  I love them!</li>

            <li> They were exactly what I was looking for beacuse I love pink and I love cheetah. I took them to my nail salon and volia: gorgeously chic finished product.  They are the same quality as the nails at the nail salon.</li>
            <li> the black that is on the nail is just been painted so you can&#x27;t file on them very good to put on acrylic.</li>
            <li> I really liked them except I think some got smoothed on the way cuz some were cracked, but I fixed it with the powder so they were really cute</li>
