            <li>My wife was pleased with the iPad case.</li>
            <li>many friends have since purchased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got this to go with my new iPad 2 and it works great.</li>
            <li>excellent case, by far the best tough case for an ipad air 2.  </li>
            <li>Great item was exactly what I order fits perfectly, fast shipping</li>
            <li>For the price it is good but the protective plastic screen gives the impression that there is water etc underneath it when using instead of fitting nice and tight and smooth.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be cheap on your electronics case.</li>
            <li>The screen protector doesn´t fit.</li>

            <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>Decided to go with this case for my sons iPad from the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>I have owned and loved Otterbox cases in the past.  </li>
            <li>The only concern or wish I have is that it was a little thicker and/or had more cushioning which may benefit more if dropped from a higher distance.  </li>
            <li>This case is very comparable to the Otterbox at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>Have not used the stand yet due to reports that it is hard to pull out other wise very nice product</li>
            <li>Super solid case.</li>
            <li>Great to protect our expensive electronics from the abuse of little kiddos.</li>

            <li> did not think the stand was too tough to get out, but I can see it being difficult for some without nails or a key or something flat.</li>

            <li> Great case and much cheaper than the otter box</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with it functionally. You get what you pay for. Don&#x27;t be cheap on your electronics case. Or you will be buying 2 of them.</li>
            <li> I love itI am very pleased with thatthank you</li>
            <li> Great item was exactly what I order fits perfectly, fast shipping</li>
            <li> The case was what i expected.</li>
            <li> With the cost of a ipad Air 2 the case is what I needed. Kid proof and my wife loves it</li>
            <li> Very nice item thank you</li>
            <li> Works great, easy to fit on my IPad. Has withstood being dropped.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Have not used the stand yet due to reports that it is hard to pull out other wise very nice product</li>
            <li> I purchased this case for one of my child&#x27;s IPads.  So far after 4 months it&#x27;s doing a good job of protecting it.  The only concern or wish I have is that it was a little thicker and/or had more cushioning which may benefit more if dropped from a higher distance.  So far so good though</li>
            <li> This case is very comparable to the Otterbox at a fraction of the price. Been working great for my husband&#x27;s iPad for about 6 months now.</li>
            <li> It looks great but it doesn´t fit 100%. I feel it like a little bigger and when I take the ipad, I have the sensation that the ipad is moving inside the case. The screen protector doesn´t fit. When I touch the screen, I feel like bubbles between the screen protector and the ipad´s screen so I had to remove it.</li>
            <li> Super solid case. Well built. Thick. Great to protect our expensive electronics from the abuse of little kiddos.</li>
            <li> I have owned and loved Otterbox cases in the past.  Decided to go with this case for my sons iPad from the positive reviews.  The case is very nice and I am overall very pleased.  The only reason it&#x27;s not a 5 star is that the rubber part of the case, in my opinion, is not as heavy duty as an Otterbox case.</li>
            <li> Very nice, comfortable to hold and built in stand works great.</li>
            <li> not so childproof...the baby drools and the moistures get underneath the screen, needed to by another childproof case so our 500 investment did not get ruined</li>
            <li> These are the best cases for kids.  Never broke an IPAD with two kids using it.  Fits the iPAD Air 2 great!</li>
            <li> Wanted a case that covered the screen - my mistake</li>
            <li> My wife was pleased with the iPad case.</li>
            <li> excellent case, by far the best tough case for an ipad air 2.  many friends have since purchased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not think the stand was too tough to get out, but I can see it being difficult for some without nails or a key or something flat.</li>
            <li> This product, I do not recommend it. Because it broke me. Clamp case . in two months No me duró nada.Case   en 2 meses es un material malo </li>
            <li> Great little protective case, couldn&#x27;t be happier with quality and price!</li>
            <li> This is actually a very nice cover.  It does what you want every iPad cover to do.  That is protect those corners.  We are extremely happy with this. It is a non-slip case and gets the job done, nicely.</li>
            <li> The case was not the correct one because it did not fit. I ended up purchasing one from the local store. It just happen to be on clearance I returned it</li>
