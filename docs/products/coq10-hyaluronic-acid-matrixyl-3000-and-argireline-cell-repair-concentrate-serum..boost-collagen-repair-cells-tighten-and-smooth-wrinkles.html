            <li>The serum has a lot of good ingredients</li>
            <li>I spend a lot of time and effort on taking good care of my skin.</li>
            <li>asked me if I had \\&quot;work\\&quot; done because my skin looked so good.  </li>
            <li>Now if I could just find a good, moisturizing eye cream with sunscreen I would be all set.  </li>
            <li>On a good note it is not greasy and can be used under makeup.</li>
            <li>I received my order promptly and loved it immediately.  </li>
            <li>This is good stuff.  </li>
            <li>Price was good and delivery was as described.</li>
            <li>have received good results from it.  </li>
            <li>this serum is good for under makeup.</li>
            <li>product is quite good, but don&#x27;t even think about contacting the supplier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite good and met all my expectations.</li>
            <li>Feels good</li>
            <li>I am 53, fair, pretty good skin (stayed out of the sun since I was 25), but I was losing firmness, this takes care of that, get it!!!</li>
            <li>I hesitate to rave more as I wouldn&#x27;t want the price to escalate!  </li>
            <li>I also enjoyed the &amp;#34;ingredients&amp;#34; list!  </li>
            <li>I love this serum!</li>
            <li>Great product, great price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Product arrived in a timely fashion, but to date, has not been an effective addition to my skincare line.</li>
            <li>This product absorbs great, makes my skin nice and smooth and feels firmer.  </li>
            <li>I use this every night before bed and the Optimum Omega 3 Daytime Treatment Cream every morning and the results are outstanding.</li>
            <li>Overall very good serum at a great price.</li>
            <li>works great quick delivery</li>
            <li>I saw fairly rapid results in the orbital eye area (a lifted effect) and also a softening of the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Loving this product - light but really does a great job moisturizing!</li>
            <li>I got a great price and the shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>and I was expecting more I guess.</li>
            <li>this stuff is Fabulous!...</li>
            <li>It took about two months of using every night to notice the change and now many are commenting on the change in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why I love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, many skin care products over the years.  </li>
            <li>My hair stylist- who has been seeing me once or twice a month, close up with no make-up for many years-</li>
            <li>and after a couple of weeks my skin has that healthy look again.  </li>
            <li>and after a couple of weeks my skin has that healthy look again.  </li>
            <li>This serum is simply THE BEST !</li>
            <li>if you like Youth Code, you&#x27;ll like this better.</li>
            <li>I will review this again in 4 more weeks.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this stuff..</li>
            <li>I am so in love with this companies products.  </li>
            <li>The price is even better.</li>
            <li>Ok product</li>
            <li>but I think it has too many ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have looked many skin care products up on line, but reading doctor reports</li>
            <li>I love the no perfum added aroma also.</li>
            <li>so many anti wrinkle products do once they settle .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>word of advise as many others states, this serum comes in a plastic bottle</li>
            <li>so I expect to see greater improvements with continued use.</li>
            <li>Aside from this, I am extremely satisfied with this product and would recommend without hesitation.</li>
            <li>I like it better</li>
            <li>I love it, love it, love it.</li>
            <li>and I find that my skin is more taut and smoother.</li>
            <li>I love the price.  </li>
            <li>I notice more of a difference with this.</li>
            <li>I love the high-powered ingredients in this stuff.</li>
            <li>Now as soon as I wash my face the effect disappears for the most part.</li>
            <li>and then I will be able to deliver a better review.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this serum as it had COQ10, Hyaluronic Acid, and Matrixyl, everything I wanted!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised more people haven&#x27;t discovered what a great job it does evening skin tone.</li>
            <li>Skin Science seems to be more out of someone&#x27;s kitchen as opposed to a lab, but that suits me just fine.  </li>
            <li>All of that said, I would use it again, but I am not really that impressed with it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell that it does any good, but no harm either.  </li>
            <li>It has a gentle nature and really good ingredients.</li>
            <li>The liquid wipes on easily with fingertips from a dropper dispenser and dries and disappears almost immediately.</li>
            <li>It is very easily and quickly absorbed into the skin and provides a noticeable improvement in the texture of aging skin.  </li>
            <li>brighter and fine lines diminished...</li>
            <li>He asked if I was getting injections on the side because all the fine lines around my mouth have vanished.</li>
            <li>i still have my fine lines and if my skin is firmer</li>
            <li>which was repair fine lines.  </li>
            <li>It has a very light scent like a fresh squeezed lemon that fades almost immediately.</li>
            <li>is gonna smooth my frowns between my eyes</li>
            <li>For whatever reason when combined with my retinol products my skin looks fabulous- softer, firmer, fewer pores, minimized wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal Sublime Sun Advanced Sunscreen SPF 50+ Liquid Silk Sunshield For Face</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s comparatively cheap.</li>
            <li>and it goes on smooth</li>
            <li>I was looking for something comparable to &amp;#34;Oro Gold&amp;#34;, which is a great product, but at a TOTAL RIPOFF price.  </li>
            <li>goes on so smooth.  </li>
            <li>Since it is light weight and non-greasy</li>
            <li>Boost Collagen, Repair Cells, Tighten and Smooth Wrinkles</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this serum.</li>
            <li>I became acne free.</li>
            <li>The bottle looked cheap, as did the sticker.</li>
            <li>ALSO , the customer service of this company is remarkable , very helpful and fast !</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li>and yes it will tip over super easily.</li>
            <li>I believe this product is mostly hyalauronic acid, which is great as a completely non-greasy natural moisturizer, but not as a collagen renewer.</li>
            <li>I love supporting the underdogs and home businesses.  </li>
            <li>This is remarkable after only a couple of weeks of use and the effects are cumulative over time</li>
            <li>I am glad I discovered them now at a very affordable price , as they help diminish fine lines and wrinkles for</li>
            <li>kind of sad to think i&#x27;m at my best.</li>
            <li>It is reasonable in price and it works ok.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any big difference in my skin, but maybe my skin is as good as it&#x27;s going to be.</li>
            <li>The good thing to come out of this was the discovery of the Simple poduct.  </li>
            <li>The good thing to come out of this was the discovery of the Simple poduct.  </li>
            <li>While I really wanted to love this product.  </li>
            <li>than $200 face creams that are full of waxy fillers and moisturizers.</li>
            <li>But I do love it, soft skin, easy to apply.</li>
            <li>The serum is so smooth and my skin soaks it right up.</li>
            <li>it feels great on my skin and has all the active ingredients I&#x27;ve been looking for in a serum.</li>
            <li>I used this lotion for my face, hands and décolletage after a sunburn, and it was a tremendous help and improvement to my skin.  </li>
            <li>Although long-term use of this product will definitely lead to more permanent results, the most immediate visible results come from using under mineral make-up.</li>
            <li>Second, it has a slight, very nice, rose fragrance.</li>
            <li>Nice product,oil free, absorbs instantly as stated,only need to use a little of this product,very good price.</li>
            <li>This product does go on very silkt smooth.</li>
            <li>It smelled nice, but I think a quality moisturizer would do the same for the skin.</li>
            <li>For anyone who had the same reaction I did, I really missed how great my skin looked with this so went looking for an alternative with most of the same ingredients.  </li>
            <li>For anyone who had the same reaction I did, I really missed how great my skin looked with this so went looking for an alternative with most of the same ingredients.  </li>
            <li>So far i love it.</li>
            <li>I applied it after my toner and it absorbed well.</li>
            <li>and it has literally erased the smile lines around my mouth.  </li>
            <li>It is quickly absorbed with no residue on your skin.  </li>
            <li>I liked it enough to order a stronger version of this company&#x27;s product and I will be re-ordering.  </li>
            <li>Seems to have decent hydration.as for fine lines and wrinkles yet to be seen.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more of this great serum in the very near future.</li>
            <li>this stuff goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly, and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because, not only does it contain many of the top scientifically proven anti-aging ingedients, but it also excluded a lot of the fillers of many other anti-wrinkle products.  </li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t have the consistency of a normal serum, it&#x27;s somewhere between a light lotion and a serum.</li>
            <li>When you have product on your hands, it isn&#x27;t easy to get the lid on tight and it is very easy to knock over.  </li>
            <li>When you have product on your hands, it isn&#x27;t easy to get the lid on tight and it is very easy to knock over.  </li>
            <li>first thing in the morn and right before bed.</li>
            <li>thank u for making this a very reasonable price..</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable, too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;And there are many equivalent products available from other sellers.</li>
            <li>I experience a nice cooling effect upon application and while the serum is not particularly moisturizing, nor is it drying.</li>
            <li>Try this consistently and you will notice a difference.  </li>
            <li>my advice for maximum result , use the Skin science COQ10 serum along with Emu oil + tamamu oil , put them at night and remark the magic next day !</li>
            <li>much love and big hugs to all, Patty.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m at least happy about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So much better than Perricone, or actually any of the 1,000s products that I&#x27;ve tried from Sephora, HSN, QVC, Nordstrom&#x27;s, Neiman Marcus!  </li>
            <li>I really appreciate the characteristics of this Skin Science serum!</li>
            <li>I believe this serum is as potent if not more so than those high-end products that many of us cannot afford.</li>
            <li>I am looking for another product with the same ingredients but a better bottle.  </li>
            <li>and I could see fast results  right away.</li>
            <li>It is not as good as the just plain Matrixyl 3000.  </li>
            <li>but this has a light weight bottom and a heavy screw top.  </li>
            <li>but this has a light weight bottom and a heavy screw top.  </li>
            <li>have not used this product long enough to see remarkable results yet, but am looking forward to see these changes.</li>
            <li>Remember to wear a sunscreen though as it pretty much strips the outer layer over time.</li>
            <li>First off, this is really concentrated stuff with 60% hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li>It makes your face feel so fresh and new.</li>
            <li>specially that one , the \\&quot;COQ10..\\&quot; , it gave me FANTASTIC results within few days , 3 or 4 days , my skin looks tight , brighter , so smooth and wrinkle free !</li>
            <li>Have only used it for a week and have seen results, fine line are gone.</li>
            <li>and I had very high expectations after reading the raving reviews.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really do anything for me.  </li>
            <li>My skin is smoother and looks much healthier.</li>
            <li>A very underrated product.  </li>
            <li>they are really on to something here.it just didn&#x27;t work on my face and neck.</li>
            <li>Third, it has a smooth feel to it.</li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t see any difference</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t seem to hydrate very well</li>
            <li>&amp; I already see a difference in my skin, plus my skin feels so much softer...</li>
            <li>It works well under CeraVe hyaluronic acid lotion as a light constant conditioner for skin.</li>
            <li>This serum really does mitigate the crepey skin on my neck.  </li>
            <li>I really like this repair for my face and it does work very well as advertised.</li>
            <li>I really like this and have noticed a difference after about a month.  </li>
            <li>I use it twice a day and it absorbs in fast in the morning</li>
            <li>As compared to Manuka honey serum (which I also really like)</li>
            <li>This was not what I really wanted.  </li>
            <li>Really works.  </li>
            <li>I used up the whole bottle and still felt like it didn&#x27;t make a bit of difference to my skin.</li>
            <li>then apply my cinema secrets primer (a little goes such a long way , best primer ever ) and my cinema secrets make up , it is crème based.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since it has added ingredients vs. plain Hyaluronic Acid I will switch to this product , but will continue to use the Hyaluronic Acid as it is a bit more cost effective for like my arms and other parts of my body.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other serums , before using this serum</li>
            <li>However I&#x27;m glad other&#x27;s</li>
            <li>did not cure my wrinkles, but it is pleasant enough to use and seems to work as well as more expensive serums sold at department stores.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>If you are really concerned about your face looking older, try this.</li>
            <li>At times I go back and add a bit more of the CoQ10 Serum around the lip lines, love it as it does not leave like a white or any other residue</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel nice and soft, but doesn&#x27;t do anything for my few wrinkles----------not as advertised to lesson your wrinkles.</li>
            <li>and I did notice tightening around the eyes - particularly under the eyes.  </li>
            <li>It also is a great base for my makeup and helps it go on smoother and more even.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for skin that is beginning to age, and for sun-damaged skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The product claimed to have a highly concentrated serum that packs a punch against aging.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly can recommend all these products to help against the fight of wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to anyone to try these products.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, but I&#x27;m gonna have to use very tiny amounts of it because I have super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>but it goes on smooth without any residue like some other serums.</li>
            <li>Read the other reviews before I ordered the first time and they were right</li>
            <li>And, I like trying new things.</li>
            <li>This is now my new skin care product to replensh my clients skin when I am done.</li>
            <li>Seriously smooths all lines and kind of numbs the skin.</li>
            <li>first after I wash my face with only water in the morning, then after a couple minutes use Squalane (vs. Argon Oil which is to oily to apply under my make up , but</li>
            <li>I have tried other formulas with similar ingredients, but this one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>My skin is softer and firmer with less noticeable fine lines.</li>
            <li>It smooth my face, and made my pores less visible.</li>
            <li>I have only used this for a few days, but I love it so far!</li>
            <li>Hydrating Repair Peptide Wrinkle Cream (Post Peel) - Enhanced with Matrixyl® 3000, Argireline®, Hyaluronic Acid &amp; Natural Botanical Extracts]]</li>
            <li>Hydrating Repair Peptide Wrinkle Cream (Post Peel) - Enhanced with Matrixyl® 3000, Argireline®, Hyaluronic Acid &amp; Natural Botanical Extracts]]</li>
            <li>THAT skin smoothed out and the 54 year old celulite didn&#x27; look</li>
            <li>Does not feel oily and absorbs into skin completely.</li>
            <li>I think it did improve my 62 year old skin, but not dramatically.  </li>
            <li>and I so far can give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It lasts a reasonable amount of time with twice daily use.</li>
            <li>This product had all of the ingredients that I was reading up on to hydrate, promote collagen to plump up, and argireline is a bonus as an all natural relaxant.</li>
            <li>I had been trying various injections over the years and have tried deep microderms in addition to many creams and other products both otc and prescription.  </li>
            <li>I have used no other products or procedures during this time, so it has to be this!</li>
            <li>This serum is a must have for anyone who wants to stave off the aging process as long as they can.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to smells especially for skin care, but it fades away in seconds after you apply it )</li>
            <li>I find that it plumps wrinkes and works under makeup or other moisture lotions to help keep skin soft and smooth and less wrinkled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>not careful</li>
            <li>I shrugged off the first few zits, but then I began getting those major pimples that make you not want to leave your house.</li>
            <li>Not much difference or notice in skin, expect received blackheads on nose and chin, which I haven&#x27;t had any since high school.</li>
            <li>Has not had much effect if any on my dark spots.</li>
            <li>Apparently, my skin is not damaged enough to see the effects this product claims to offer.  </li>

            <li> The serum has a lot of good ingredients</li>
            <li> I spend a lot of time and effort on taking good care of my skin.</li>
            <li> asked me if I had \\&quot;work\\&quot; done because my skin looked so good.  </li>
            <li> Now if I could just find a good, moisturizing eye cream with sunscreen I would be all set.  </li>
            <li> On a good note it is not greasy and can be used under makeup.</li>
            <li> I received my order promptly and loved it immediately.  </li>
            <li> This is good stuff.  </li>
            <li> Price was good and delivery was as described.</li>
            <li> have received good results from it.  </li>
            <li> this serum is good for under makeup.</li>
            <li> product is quite good, but don&#x27;t even think about contacting the supplier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite good and met all my expectations.</li>
            <li> Feels good</li>
            <li> I am 53, fair, pretty good skin (stayed out of the sun since I was 25), but I was losing firmness, this takes care of that, get it!!!</li>
            <li> I hesitate to rave more as I wouldn&#x27;t want the price to escalate!  </li>
            <li> I also enjoyed the &amp;#34;ingredients&amp;#34; list!  </li>
            <li> I love this serum!</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in a timely fashion, but to date, has not been an effective addition to my skincare line.</li>
            <li> This product absorbs great, makes my skin nice and smooth and feels firmer.  </li>
            <li> I use this every night before bed and the Optimum Omega 3 Daytime Treatment Cream every morning and the results are outstanding.</li>
            <li> Overall very good serum at a great price.</li>
            <li> works great quick delivery</li>
            <li> I saw fairly rapid results in the orbital eye area (a lifted effect) and also a softening of the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Loving this product - light but really does a great job moisturizing!</li>
            <li> I got a great price and the shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> and I was expecting more I guess.</li>
            <li> this stuff is Fabulous!...</li>
            <li> It took about two months of using every night to notice the change and now many are commenting on the change in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, many skin care products over the years.  </li>
            <li> My hair stylist- who has been seeing me once or twice a month, close up with no make-up for many years-</li>
            <li> and after a couple of weeks my skin has that healthy look again.  </li>
            <li> and after a couple of weeks my skin has that healthy look again.  </li>
            <li> This serum is simply THE BEST !</li>
            <li> if you like Youth Code, you&#x27;ll like this better.</li>
            <li> I will review this again in 4 more weeks.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this stuff..</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this companies products.  </li>
            <li> The price is even better.</li>
            <li> Ok product</li>
            <li> but I think it has too many ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have looked many skin care products up on line, but reading doctor reports</li>
            <li> I love the no perfum added aroma also.</li>
            <li> so many anti wrinkle products do once they settle .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> word of advise as many others states, this serum comes in a plastic bottle</li>
            <li> so I expect to see greater improvements with continued use.</li>
            <li> Aside from this, I am extremely satisfied with this product and would recommend without hesitation.</li>
            <li> I like it better</li>
            <li> I love it, love it, love it.</li>
            <li> and I find that my skin is more taut and smoother.</li>
            <li> I love the price.  </li>
            <li> I notice more of a difference with this.</li>
            <li> I love the high-powered ingredients in this stuff.</li>
            <li> Now as soon as I wash my face the effect disappears for the most part.</li>
            <li> and then I will be able to deliver a better review.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this serum as it had COQ10, Hyaluronic Acid, and Matrixyl, everything I wanted!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised more people haven&#x27;t discovered what a great job it does evening skin tone.</li>
            <li> Skin Science seems to be more out of someone&#x27;s kitchen as opposed to a lab, but that suits me just fine.  </li>
            <li> All of that said, I would use it again, but I am not really that impressed with it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell that it does any good, but no harm either.  </li>
            <li> It has a gentle nature and really good ingredients.</li>
            <li> The liquid wipes on easily with fingertips from a dropper dispenser and dries and disappears almost immediately.</li>
            <li> It is very easily and quickly absorbed into the skin and provides a noticeable improvement in the texture of aging skin.  </li>
            <li> brighter and fine lines diminished...</li>
            <li> He asked if I was getting injections on the side because all the fine lines around my mouth have vanished.</li>
            <li> i still have my fine lines and if my skin is firmer</li>
            <li> which was repair fine lines.  </li>
            <li> It has a very light scent like a fresh squeezed lemon that fades almost immediately.</li>
            <li> is gonna smooth my frowns between my eyes</li>
            <li> For whatever reason when combined with my retinol products my skin looks fabulous- softer, firmer, fewer pores, minimized wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Sublime Sun Advanced Sunscreen SPF 50+ Liquid Silk Sunshield For Face</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s comparatively cheap.</li>
            <li> and it goes on smooth</li>
            <li> I was looking for something comparable to &amp;#34;Oro Gold&amp;#34;, which is a great product, but at a TOTAL RIPOFF price.  </li>
            <li> goes on so smooth.  </li>
            <li> Since it is light weight and non-greasy</li>
            <li> Boost Collagen, Repair Cells, Tighten and Smooth Wrinkles</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this serum.</li>
            <li> I became acne free.</li>
            <li> The bottle looked cheap, as did the sticker.</li>
            <li> ALSO , the customer service of this company is remarkable , very helpful and fast !</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li> and yes it will tip over super easily.</li>
            <li> I believe this product is mostly hyalauronic acid, which is great as a completely non-greasy natural moisturizer, but not as a collagen renewer.</li>
            <li> I love supporting the underdogs and home businesses.  </li>
            <li> This is remarkable after only a couple of weeks of use and the effects are cumulative over time</li>
            <li> I am glad I discovered them now at a very affordable price , as they help diminish fine lines and wrinkles for</li>
            <li> kind of sad to think i&#x27;m at my best.</li>
            <li> It is reasonable in price and it works ok.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any big difference in my skin, but maybe my skin is as good as it&#x27;s going to be.</li>
            <li> The good thing to come out of this was the discovery of the Simple poduct.  </li>
            <li> The good thing to come out of this was the discovery of the Simple poduct.  </li>
            <li> While I really wanted to love this product.  </li>
            <li> than $200 face creams that are full of waxy fillers and moisturizers.</li>
            <li> But I do love it, soft skin, easy to apply.</li>
            <li> The serum is so smooth and my skin soaks it right up.</li>
            <li> it feels great on my skin and has all the active ingredients I&#x27;ve been looking for in a serum.</li>
            <li> I used this lotion for my face, hands and décolletage after a sunburn, and it was a tremendous help and improvement to my skin.  </li>
            <li> Although long-term use of this product will definitely lead to more permanent results, the most immediate visible results come from using under mineral make-up.</li>
            <li> Second, it has a slight, very nice, rose fragrance.</li>
            <li> Nice product,oil free, absorbs instantly as stated,only need to use a little of this product,very good price.</li>
            <li> This product does go on very silkt smooth.</li>
            <li> It smelled nice, but I think a quality moisturizer would do the same for the skin.</li>
            <li> For anyone who had the same reaction I did, I really missed how great my skin looked with this so went looking for an alternative with most of the same ingredients.  </li>
            <li> For anyone who had the same reaction I did, I really missed how great my skin looked with this so went looking for an alternative with most of the same ingredients.  </li>
            <li> So far i love it.</li>
            <li> I applied it after my toner and it absorbed well.</li>
            <li> and it has literally erased the smile lines around my mouth.  </li>
            <li> It is quickly absorbed with no residue on your skin.  </li>
            <li> I liked it enough to order a stronger version of this company&#x27;s product and I will be re-ordering.  </li>
            <li> Seems to have decent hydration.as for fine lines and wrinkles yet to be seen.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more of this great serum in the very near future.</li>
            <li> this stuff goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly, and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because, not only does it contain many of the top scientifically proven anti-aging ingedients, but it also excluded a lot of the fillers of many other anti-wrinkle products.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t have the consistency of a normal serum, it&#x27;s somewhere between a light lotion and a serum.</li>
            <li> When you have product on your hands, it isn&#x27;t easy to get the lid on tight and it is very easy to knock over.  </li>
            <li> When you have product on your hands, it isn&#x27;t easy to get the lid on tight and it is very easy to knock over.  </li>
            <li> first thing in the morn and right before bed.</li>
            <li> thank u for making this a very reasonable price..</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable, too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;And there are many equivalent products available from other sellers.</li>
            <li> I experience a nice cooling effect upon application and while the serum is not particularly moisturizing, nor is it drying.</li>
            <li> Try this consistently and you will notice a difference.  </li>
            <li> my advice for maximum result , use the Skin science COQ10 serum along with Emu oil + tamamu oil , put them at night and remark the magic next day !</li>
            <li> much love and big hugs to all, Patty.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m at least happy about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So much better than Perricone, or actually any of the 1,000s products that I&#x27;ve tried from Sephora, HSN, QVC, Nordstrom&#x27;s, Neiman Marcus!  </li>
            <li> I really appreciate the characteristics of this Skin Science serum!</li>
            <li> I believe this serum is as potent if not more so than those high-end products that many of us cannot afford.</li>
            <li> I am looking for another product with the same ingredients but a better bottle.  </li>
            <li> and I could see fast results  right away.</li>
            <li> It is not as good as the just plain Matrixyl 3000.  </li>
            <li> but this has a light weight bottom and a heavy screw top.  </li>
            <li> but this has a light weight bottom and a heavy screw top.  </li>
            <li> have not used this product long enough to see remarkable results yet, but am looking forward to see these changes.</li>
            <li> Remember to wear a sunscreen though as it pretty much strips the outer layer over time.</li>
            <li> First off, this is really concentrated stuff with 60% hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li> It makes your face feel so fresh and new.</li>
            <li> specially that one , the \\&quot;COQ10..\\&quot; , it gave me FANTASTIC results within few days , 3 or 4 days , my skin looks tight , brighter , so smooth and wrinkle free !</li>
            <li> Have only used it for a week and have seen results, fine line are gone.</li>
            <li> and I had very high expectations after reading the raving reviews.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do anything for me.  </li>
            <li> My skin is smoother and looks much healthier.</li>
            <li> A very underrated product.  </li>
            <li> they are really on to something here.it just didn&#x27;t work on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> Third, it has a smooth feel to it.</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t see any difference</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t seem to hydrate very well</li>
            <li> &amp; I already see a difference in my skin, plus my skin feels so much softer...</li>
            <li> It works well under CeraVe hyaluronic acid lotion as a light constant conditioner for skin.</li>
            <li> This serum really does mitigate the crepey skin on my neck.  </li>
            <li> I really like this repair for my face and it does work very well as advertised.</li>
            <li> I really like this and have noticed a difference after about a month.  </li>
            <li> I use it twice a day and it absorbs in fast in the morning</li>
            <li> As compared to Manuka honey serum (which I also really like)</li>
            <li> This was not what I really wanted.  </li>
            <li> Really works.  </li>
            <li> I used up the whole bottle and still felt like it didn&#x27;t make a bit of difference to my skin.</li>
            <li> then apply my cinema secrets primer (a little goes such a long way , best primer ever ) and my cinema secrets make up , it is crème based.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since it has added ingredients vs. plain Hyaluronic Acid I will switch to this product , but will continue to use the Hyaluronic Acid as it is a bit more cost effective for like my arms and other parts of my body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other serums , before using this serum</li>
            <li> However I&#x27;m glad other&#x27;s</li>
            <li> did not cure my wrinkles, but it is pleasant enough to use and seems to work as well as more expensive serums sold at department stores.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> If you are really concerned about your face looking older, try this.</li>
            <li> At times I go back and add a bit more of the CoQ10 Serum around the lip lines, love it as it does not leave like a white or any other residue</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel nice and soft, but doesn&#x27;t do anything for my few wrinkles----------not as advertised to lesson your wrinkles.</li>
            <li> and I did notice tightening around the eyes - particularly under the eyes.  </li>
            <li> It also is a great base for my makeup and helps it go on smoother and more even.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for skin that is beginning to age, and for sun-damaged skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The product claimed to have a highly concentrated serum that packs a punch against aging.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly can recommend all these products to help against the fight of wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to anyone to try these products.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, but I&#x27;m gonna have to use very tiny amounts of it because I have super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> but it goes on smooth without any residue like some other serums.</li>
            <li> Read the other reviews before I ordered the first time and they were right</li>
            <li> And, I like trying new things.</li>
            <li> This is now my new skin care product to replensh my clients skin when I am done.</li>
            <li> Seriously smooths all lines and kind of numbs the skin.</li>
            <li> first after I wash my face with only water in the morning, then after a couple minutes use Squalane (vs. Argon Oil which is to oily to apply under my make up , but</li>
            <li> I have tried other formulas with similar ingredients, but this one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> My skin is softer and firmer with less noticeable fine lines.</li>
            <li> It smooth my face, and made my pores less visible.</li>
            <li> I have only used this for a few days, but I love it so far!</li>
            <li> Hydrating Repair Peptide Wrinkle Cream (Post Peel) - Enhanced with Matrixyl® 3000, Argireline®, Hyaluronic Acid &amp; Natural Botanical Extracts]]</li>
            <li> Hydrating Repair Peptide Wrinkle Cream (Post Peel) - Enhanced with Matrixyl® 3000, Argireline®, Hyaluronic Acid &amp; Natural Botanical Extracts]]</li>
            <li> THAT skin smoothed out and the 54 year old celulite didn&#x27; look</li>
            <li> Does not feel oily and absorbs into skin completely.</li>
            <li> I think it did improve my 62 year old skin, but not dramatically.  </li>
            <li> and I so far can give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It lasts a reasonable amount of time with twice daily use.</li>
            <li> This product had all of the ingredients that I was reading up on to hydrate, promote collagen to plump up, and argireline is a bonus as an all natural relaxant.</li>
            <li> I had been trying various injections over the years and have tried deep microderms in addition to many creams and other products both otc and prescription.  </li>
            <li> I have used no other products or procedures during this time, so it has to be this!</li>
            <li> This serum is a must have for anyone who wants to stave off the aging process as long as they can.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to smells especially for skin care, but it fades away in seconds after you apply it )</li>
            <li> I find that it plumps wrinkes and works under makeup or other moisture lotions to help keep skin soft and smooth and less wrinkled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not careful</li>
            <li> I shrugged off the first few zits, but then I began getting those major pimples that make you not want to leave your house.</li>
            <li> Not much difference or notice in skin, expect received blackheads on nose and chin, which I haven&#x27;t had any since high school.</li>
            <li> Has not had much effect if any on my dark spots.</li>
            <li> Apparently, my skin is not damaged enough to see the effects this product claims to offer.  </li>
            <li> but I do think crows feet are worse than they were originally.  </li>
            <li> but I do think crows feet are worse than they were originally.  </li>
            <li> Like this product and will order again I use it daily and have noticed that my skin feels soft and wrinkles less noticeable would recommend this product to others</li>
            <li> HAVNT BEEN USING LONG ENOUGH</li>
            <li> but I do believe that using a gentle cleanser, removing the dead skin cells once a week, drinking plenty of water and using &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; products along with other products such as this one can&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> I found that my skin was dry after using it, and there definitely has been any change in the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> One in particular that I&#x27;ve used in the past is $199.00 for 2 ounces.</li>
            <li> suddenly became very dry and irritated.  </li>
            <li> suddenly became very dry and irritated.  </li>
            <li> Not because the product doesn&#x27;t go a long way, it does.  </li>
            <li> After a few days, my skin was soft again</li>
            <li> Not because the product doesn&#x27;t go a long way, it does.  </li>
            <li> After a few days, my skin was soft again</li>
            <li> So for me (over 50, caucasian, living in a dry climate)</li>
            <li> My face felt dry after applying.  </li>
            <li> After about a month or so, the liquid turned a very deep yellow/brown color with a slight rancid smell, so I stopped using it.  </li>
            <li> If you are using only Hyaluronic Acid and find it to runny of a consistency try putting it in a spray bottle, works wonders and makes the texture less</li>
            <li> The product is too thick and does not last long enough!</li>
            <li> I appreciate minimal packaging</li>
            <li> I appreciate minimal packaging</li>
            <li> The only thing missing is the COQ10 which may have been what I had a problem with.</li>
            <li> I am 41 and expected to see results soon based on the reviews I read.</li>
            <li> I bought a few products to try at the same time.  </li>
            <li> It also sinks in within seconds.</li>
            <li> So if you have very sensitive skin, you only need a very small amount &amp; maybe water it down a little with distilled water.</li>
            <li> The only thing missing is the COQ10 which may have been what I had a problem with.he other junk out there.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put a little extra around my eyes and my lip line and notice less lines in those areas.</li>
            <li> Too Faced Cosmetics Lip Injection Extreme, 0.2-Ounce]], and L&#x27;oreal sublime</li>
            <li> At night- this product and Toofaced again, an expensive, intense 4% retinol solution on heavy sun damage areas (cheekbones, forehead, upper lip) and Watts retinol cream</li>
            <li> I have been using Hyaluronic Acid for the past Year, together with Argon Oil for my skin , as I read of the extra benefits of Argireline</li>
            <li> This serum is well priced when compared to other products containing comparable combined ingredients.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it works, but I use it once a week along with other products on other nights.  </li>
            <li> negative about this product that may sound silly-</li>
            <li> negative about this product that may sound silly-</li>
            <li> I have actually had migraines triggered from heavily scented face products in other brands in the past.</li>
            <li> Over the past few months I&#x27;ve been omiting one or another product and don&#x27;t get the same results.  </li>
            <li> I could swear it was lightening some dark spots too.</li>
            <li> May look for a dark glass bottle with dropper here on amazon and refill it.</li>
            <li> people , before buying any other product , PLEASE TRY THIS ONE !</li>
            <li> So you need to be less of a klutz than I am to avoid wasting some of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much less puffy and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2, 10-2-13.  </li>

            <li> Slightly stings&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is actually the only ingredient that truly works for lines around eye area &amp; all the skin care products for hundreds of dollars, dont have all these ingredients together &amp; if they do, it is so expensive...</li>
            <li> and when I started using Hyaluronic Acid and Argon Oil within half a year</li>
            <li> I have notice a subtle change in the appearance of my deep furrow line in between my brows, it appears to be softening.</li>
            <li> Not a full tube.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, i spilt some on my counter and not wanting to waste</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> so it wouldn&#x27;t be completely wasted.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> What a waste....</li>
            <li> But at least now I can quit wasting money on all the other junk out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this religiously for well over a month now, but unfortunately have not seen any noticeable results.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical but the price and the science behind it made it worth trying.  </li>
            <li> NOT SURE YET .</li>
            <li> disappeared, small lines around the eyes  </li>
            <li> a hard critic and have tried everything!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> That was a tiny bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> i actually like this product quite a bit and would buy it again except for the stupid eye dropper.  </li>
            <li> I try to understand the science behind any product claims and keep track of what seems to work well with my skin.  </li>
            <li> Its consistency was thin and watery.</li>
            <li> Seriously it has everything you could need!  </li>
            <li> me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also would like to add that I had horrible adult acne for 2 years</li>
            <li> how wrong I was...noticed my skin looking</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I am sad</li>
            <li> This serum contains all proven ingredients without diluted efficacy from a lot of useless additives.</li>
            <li> Sad to think that there would ever be a miracle in a bottle.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this product at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid I couldn&#x27;t tell any difference in my skin after using it.  </li>
            <li> disappointing...</li>
            <li> It has all the ingredients of very expensive so-called \\&quot;cosmeceutical\\&quot; products.</li>
            <li> Matrixyl 3000 can be very expensive.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The serum has a lot of good ingredients and I was expecting more I guess. It is reasonable in price and it works ok. I haven&#x27;t noticed any big difference in my skin, but maybe my skin is as good as it&#x27;s going to be. I spend a lot of time and effort on taking good care of my skin. And, I like trying new things. All of that said, I would use it again, but I am not really that impressed with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because, not only does it contain many of the top scientifically proven anti-aging ingedients, but it also excluded a lot of the fillers of many other anti-wrinkle products.  I&#x27;ve used this religiously for well over a month now, but unfortunately have not seen any noticeable results. I believe this product is mostly hyalauronic acid, which is great as a completely non-greasy natural moisturizer, but not as a collagen renewer.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do anything for me.  Saw no changes from using it, which I did every day.  It smelled nice, but I think a quality moisturizer would do the same for the skin.</li>
            <li> This makes your skin feel absolutely amazing! I am hooked! I have only used this for a few days, but I love it so far!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Remember to wear a sunscreen though as it pretty much strips the outer layer over time.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping is gonna smooth my frowns between my eyes I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks and I saw no improvement at all :-(( .I don&#x27;t know .... but maybe is just not working for me.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent skin texturizing moisturizer. It is very easily and quickly absorbed into the skin and provides a noticeable improvement in the texture of aging skin.  I highly recommend this for skin that is beginning to age, and for sun-damaged skin.  I used this lotion for my face, hands and décolletage after a sunburn, and it was a tremendous help and improvement to my skin.  It provided a healing that did not irritate my skin, even on my face.  I also use this in conjunction with PQQ lotion and toner to provide maximum benefits.</li>
            <li> I am reordering a second bottle...this stuff is Fabulous!...Read the other reviews before I ordered the first time and they were right on!...Didn&#x27;t think it would work as well as it does since it is so inexpensive...how wrong I was...noticed my skin looking brighter and fine lines diminished...I use a face cream over it during the day for moisture...try this ...you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Never write reviews, but this is remarkable.  Have been using for four months and even my husband has noticed the changes.  He asked if I was getting injections on the side because all the fine lines around my mouth have vanished. I had been trying various injections over the years and have tried deep microderms in addition to many creams and other products both otc and prescription.  In my fifties and this is turning back the clock. My skin is smoother and looks much healthier. I hesitate to rave more as I wouldn&#x27;t want the price to escalate!  Try this consistently and you will notice a difference.  It took about two months of using every night to notice the change and now many are commenting on the change in my skin.  I have used no other products or procedures during this time, so it has to be this!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I love it but I do.  I&#x27;ve tried many, many skin care products over the years.  I try to understand the science behind any product claims and keep track of what seems to work well with my skin.  This product seems to have a little bit of everything except retinol.  For whatever reason when combined with my retinol products my skin looks fabulous- softer, firmer, fewer pores, minimized wrinkles.  My hair stylist- who has been seeing me once or twice a month, close up with no make-up for many years- asked me if I had \\&quot;work\\&quot; done because my skin looked so good.  In my opinion it&#x27;s all about the texture and firmness of your skin, not wrinkles, that determines how young/healthy you look. Over the past few months I&#x27;ve been omiting one or another product and don&#x27;t get the same results.  So for me (over 50, caucasian, living in a dry climate) what works is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanse with Olay regenerist [[ASIN:B001F51TR2 Olay Regenerist Detoxifying Pore Scrub, 6.5 Ounce (Pack of 2)]], In the morning, this product, Too Faced lip injection [[ASIN:B000Z605H2 Too Faced Cosmetics Lip Injection Extreme, 0.2-Ounce]], and L&#x27;oreal sublime [[ASIN:B007P7TFV6 L&#x27;Oreal Sublime Sun Advanced Sunscreen SPF 50+ Liquid Silk Sunshield For Face (Quantity of 4)]].  At night- this product and Toofaced again, an expensive, intense 4% retinol solution on heavy sun damage areas (cheekbones, forehead, upper lip) and Watts retinol cream [[ASIN:B004YWS430 Watts Beauty Retinol Face Cream 1.5% or 150,000 IU Per Oz / 2oz with Treatment Pump]] over my entire face.  The best body lotion is still Amlactin but it is pricey.  My close second is Vaseline Renewal [[ASIN:B005OKPZ7O Renewal Age-Redefining Body Lotion]].  A very underrated product.  I&#x27;m surprised more people haven&#x27;t discovered what a great job it does evening skin tone. And it&#x27;s comparatively cheap. Now if I could just find a good, moisturizing eye cream with sunscreen I would be all set.  But at least now I can quit wasting money on all the other junk out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One negative about this product that may sound silly- I am on my third bottle of this.  Not because the product doesn&#x27;t go a long way, it does.  Because I keep spilling it!  I appreciate minimal packaging but this has a light weight bottom and a heavy screw top.  When you have product on your hands, it isn&#x27;t easy to get the lid on tight and it is very easy to knock over.  So you need to be less of a klutz than I am to avoid wasting some of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I regret to say that after using this for several months, I had a very negative reaction to it.  The skin around my eyes- an area where this is the only product I used- suddenly became very dry and irritated.  And wrinkled.  I stopped using this and only used the mildest thing I could find [[ASIN:B005TI7Q3C Simple Soothing Eye Balm, 0.5 Ounce]]  After a few days, my skin was soft again but I do think crows feet are worse than they were originally.  The good thing to come out of this was the discovery of the Simple poduct.  I was only looking for mildness but I do think it has improved the overall appearance of the eye area.  Much less puffy and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2, 10-2-13.  For anyone who had the same reaction I did, I really missed how great my skin looked with this so went looking for an alternative with most of the same ingredients.  I found [[ASIN:B00700H128 Hydrating Repair Peptide Wrinkle Cream (Post Peel) - Enhanced with Matrixyl® 3000, Argireline®, Hyaluronic Acid &amp; Natural Botanical Extracts]] and after a couple of weeks my skin has that healthy look again.  The only thing missing is the COQ10 which may have been what I had a problem with.he other junk out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One negative about this product that may sound silly- I am on my third bottle of this.

            <li> This serum is simply THE BEST ! I&#x27;ve tried many other serums , before using this serum i thought that \\&quot;philosophy Hope is not enough\\&quot; was the best one i ever tried ! because it gave me results in a matter of weeks . BUT I&#x27;M SOOOOO HAPPY i tried \\&quot;My skin science serums \\&quot; specially that one , the \\&quot;COQ10..\\&quot; , it gave me FANTASTIC results within few days , 3 or 4 days , my skin looks tight , brighter , so smooth and wrinkle free ! my advice for maximum result , use the Skin science COQ10 serum along with Emu oil + tamamu oil , put them at night and remark the magic next day ! ALSO , the customer service of this company is remarkable , very helpful and fast ! people , before buying any other product , PLEASE TRY THIS ONE ! it is AWESOME ! the best !</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m 54 and i know nothing will turn back time (except surgery) this stuff goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly, and leaves my skin soft. i still have my fine lines and if my skin is firmer i don&#x27;t see it. it could be that the skin on my face is saturated by me useing everything on the market. kind of sad to think i&#x27;m at my best. HOWEVER, i spilt some on my counter and not wanting to waste i scooped it up in my hands and put it on my thighs (that are not saturated by every product on the market) THAT skin smoothed out and the 54 year old celulite didn&#x27; look so bad.so they are really on to something here.it just didn&#x27;t work on my face and neck. if you like Youth Code, you&#x27;ll like this better.</li>
            <li> It has been a week now. I have noticed an improvement in the softening of my lines. I have not seen it starting to take them away. So I can&#x27;t rate it a 5 star yet. But I do love it, soft skin, easy to apply. I just wash my face and while it&#x27;s damp apply it twice a day, first thing in the morn and right before bed. This is probably the cheapest I have ever paid for my wrinkle regimen. So far i love it. I will review this again in 4 more weeks.</li>
            <li> It is not as good as the just plain Matrixyl 3000.  My face felt dry after applying.  Thank goodness for my ROC!</li>
            <li> First off, this is really concentrated stuff with 60% hyaluronic acid. Yikes! So if you have very sensitive skin, you only need a very small amount &amp; maybe water it down a little with distilled water. It will last you for awhile longer. Second, it has a slight, very nice, rose fragrance. Third, it has a smooth feel to it. I really like this product, but I&#x27;m gonna have to use very tiny amounts of it because I have super sensitive skin. Great product, great price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I am 41 and expected to see results soon based on the reviews I read. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several weeks now and can&#x27;t see a difference.  I won&#x27;t purchase it again.  The bottle is cumbersome.  On a good note it is not greasy and can be used under makeup.</li>
            <li> I received my order promptly and loved it immediately.  it feels great on my skin and has all the active ingredients I&#x27;ve been looking for in a serum.</li>
            <li> works great quick delivery</li>
            <li> Love this product. I am a massage therapist that also does facials. This is now my new skin care product to replensh my clients skin when I am done. It makes your face feel so fresh and new.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff.  Makes my skin feel smooth and clean.  Have not noticed any wrinkle reduction, but I have only been using it for about 2 weeks.  Will wait a little longer to pass judgement. Price was good and delivery was as described.</li>
            <li> At 1st i apply it to my under eyes &amp; it got so swollen,i got scar,it toke over a week half. I would use this only on my face only. And i would order again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Carmen Martinez&lt;br /&gt;234 Sylvia ave&lt;br /&gt;San Antonio, Tx. 78237</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this stuff..my skin feels amazing in the morning! ..will be purchasing again. I also recommend. ..much love and big hugs to all, Patty.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel nice and soft, but doesn&#x27;t do anything for my few wrinkles----------not as advertised to lesson your wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I keep using this and it goes on smooth</li>
            <li> My husband bought this for me at my request.  I have used two bottles.&lt;br /&gt;It did not cure my wrinkles, but it is pleasant enough to use and seems to work as well as more expensive serums sold at department stores.&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this serum as it had COQ10, Hyaluronic Acid, and Matrixyl, everything I wanted! I applied it after my toner and it absorbed well. I could swear it was lightening some dark spots too. But after a week or so, I started having breakouts. I shrugged off the first few zits, but then I began getting those major pimples that make you not want to leave your house. Granted, a lot of products make me break out. I stopped using this and my skin cleared in about a week. I am sad I have to stop using this product.</li>
            <li> While I really wanted to love this product.  I&#x27;m afraid I couldn&#x27;t tell any difference in my skin after using it.  After about a month or so, the liquid turned a very deep yellow/brown color with a slight rancid smell, so I stopped using it.  I was using it twice daily with my high-end skin care regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product claimed to have a highly concentrated serum that packs a punch against aging. This ultimate formula contains the highest quality ingredients that are clinically proven to tighten, plump and diminish lines and wrinkles.  I saw none of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a skincare/product SNOB and I had very high expectations after reading the raving reviews.  Apparently, my skin is not damaged enough to see the effects this product claims to offer.  It didn&#x27;t harm my skin so I&#x27;m at least happy about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product to my friends or family.  However I&#x27;m glad other&#x27;s have received good results from it.  I just happened to be one of those who didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Overall--useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Sticky&lt;br /&gt;2) No changes in 1 mnth&lt;br /&gt;3) Slightly stings&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t go into the skin well.  I felt it just sat on the surface of my skin.  Really didn&#x27;t see any difference</li>
            <li> Product arrived in a timely fashion, but to date, has not been an effective addition to my skincare line. I will use all of this bottle, hoping for delayed results.</li>
            <li> Loving this product - light but really does a great job moisturizing! Does not feel oily and absorbs into skin completely.</li>
            <li> Like this product and will order again I use it daily and have noticed that my skin feels soft and wrinkles less noticeable would recommend this product to others</li>
            <li> I bought a few products to try at the same time.  I was looking for something comparable to &amp;#34;Oro Gold&amp;#34;, which is a great product, but at a TOTAL RIPOFF price.  I am happy with this product.  Skin Science seems to be more out of someone&#x27;s kitchen as opposed to a lab, but that suits me just fine.  I love supporting the underdogs and home businesses.  I also enjoyed the &amp;#34;ingredients&amp;#34; list!  I could read and understand the products used in this line!  Will I buy again?  Totally.</li>
            <li> Has made any difference in my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month, and I was looking in the mirror and thinking \\&quot;my face actually looks firmer\\&quot;!  So much better than Perricone, or actually any of the 1,000s products that I&#x27;ve tried from Sephora, HSN, QVC, Nordstrom&#x27;s, Neiman Marcus!  Seriously it has everything you could need!  I am 53, fair, pretty good skin (stayed out of the sun since I was 25), but I was losing firmness, this takes care of that, get it!!!</li>
            <li> I have heard a lot about the ingredients contained in this serum, but if they are there, they must be in minute levels. I found that my skin was dry after using it, and there definitely has been any change in the appearance of my skin. Very disappointed. Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> I bought this about a month ago.  Been using twice a day and I can&#x27;t believe the difference!!  I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s and it has literally erased the smile lines around my mouth.  Looks like it actually has plumped up my skin and made it look not as slack.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a hard critic and have tried everything!&lt;br /&gt;This actually works!!</li>
            <li> After doing a great amount of research on Q10, I found this product! I tried it and I could see fast results  right away. It smooth my face, and made my pores less visible. Looking forward to continue using it.</li>
            <li> It sounds so wonderful, with all the latest ingredients in it.  I can&#x27;t really tell that it does any good, but no harm either.  I started using it alone, but when I couldn&#x27;t see any improvements I started just putting a couple of drops in my moisturizer each day so it wouldn&#x27;t be completely wasted.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical but the price and the science behind it made it worth trying.  I&#x27;ve been using it twice daily for about a month.  It is quickly absorbed with no residue on your skin.  I think it did improve my 62 year old skin, but not dramatically.  It definitely made my face feel smoother and I did notice tightening around the eyes - particularly under the eyes.  I liked it enough to order a stronger version of this company&#x27;s product and I will be re-ordering.  I recommend it - just don&#x27;t expect it to look like a face-lift.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this companies products.  I use this all over my face and eye area including my eyelids and my makeup goes on so smooth.  It&#x27;s an instant improvement.  The price is even better.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t seem to hydrate very well</li>
            <li> Ok product but I think it has too many ingredients.</li>
            <li> Since it is light weight and non-greasy this serum is good for under makeup. I have only used it 30 days or so and have not noticed a difference. I would prefer that the manufacturer used a glass bottle instead of plastic. It will tip over and spill if you&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;re not careful</li>
            <li> I ordered this item just a short time ago &amp; I already see a difference in my skin, plus my skin feels so much softer...I love this product &amp; will be ordering this again soon...and the price is very good....I have looked on line for this product many times &amp; it is quite expensive &amp; this is a price that works with my budget...I have looked many skin care products up on line, but reading doctor reports this is actually the only ingredient that truly works for lines around eye area &amp; all the skin care products for hundreds of dollars, dont have all these ingredients together &amp; if they do, it is so expensive...thank u for making this a very reasonable price..&lt;br /&gt;----------------------&lt;br /&gt;COQ10, Hyaluronic Acid, Matrixyl 3000 and Argireline Cell Repair Concentrate Serum..Boost Collagen, Repair Cells, Tighten and Smooth Wrinkles</li>
            <li> The product is too thick and does not last long enough!</li>
            <li> This product absorbs great, makes my skin nice and smooth and feels firmer.  I can tell especially on my neck.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a difference</li>
            <li> Great product .. thank you!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. Have only used it for a week and have seen results, fine line are gone. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Not much difference or notice in skin, expect received blackheads on nose and chin, which I haven&#x27;t had any since high school.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this serum. It has a gentle nature and really good ingredients. I love the no perfum added aroma also. I have actually had migraines triggered from heavily scented face products in other brands in the past. I really appreciate the characteristics of this Skin Science serum!</li>
            <li> I have been using Hyaluronic Acid for the past Year, together with Argon Oil for my skin , as I read of the extra benefits of Argireline I wanted to give this product a try and I so far can give it 5 stars. Beautiful texture, smell(addictive,and I am very sensitive to smells especially for skin care, but it fades away in seconds after you apply it )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it has added ingredients vs. plain Hyaluronic Acid I will switch to this product , but will continue to use the Hyaluronic Acid as it is a bit more cost effective for like my arms and other parts of my body. If you are using only Hyaluronic Acid and find it to runny of a consistency try putting it in a spray bottle, works wonders and makes the texture less runny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use COQ10, w. Hyaluronic Acid , Matrixyl and Argireline first after I wash my face with only water in the morning, then after a couple minutes use Squalane (vs. Argon Oil which is to oily to apply under my make up , but a drop at night as moisturizer or a drop rubbed in your hands and applied to your hair works amazingly !!!!) as my moisturizer. It also sinks in within seconds. At times I go back and add a bit more of the CoQ10 Serum around the lip lines, love it as it does not leave like a white or any other residue so many anti wrinkle products do once they settle .&lt;br /&gt;I then apply my cinema secrets primer (a little goes such a long way , best primer ever ) and my cinema secrets make up , it is crème based. Highly can recommend all these products to help against the fight of wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s face it nothing will make wrinkles go away, but there are products that I wish I would have known about and used 10 year ago (am now in my mid 40th) .But I am glad I discovered them now at a very affordable price , as they help diminish fine lines and wrinkles for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also would like to add that I had horrible adult acne for 2 years and when I started using Hyaluronic Acid and Argon Oil within half a year I became acne free. Highly recommend to anyone to try these products. Especially if you have tried everything else and spend a fortune in the mall at the cosmetic counters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only word of advise as many others states, this serum comes in a plastic bottle and yes it will tip over super easily. May look for a dark glass bottle with dropper here on amazon and refill it.</li>
            <li> This serum contains all proven ingredients without diluted efficacy from a lot of useless additives. I use it twice daily after cleansing and before applying my day and night creams. It has a very light scent like a fresh squeezed lemon that fades almost immediately. I experience a nice cooling effect upon application and while the serum is not particularly moisturizing, nor is it drying. However, unless your skin is oily, I would definitely recommend a hydrating cream over this product. I saw fairly rapid results in the orbital eye area (a lifted effect) and also a softening of the fine lines around my eyes. This is remarkable after only a couple of weeks of use and the effects are cumulative over time so I expect to see greater improvements with continued use. This serum is well priced when compared to other products containing comparable combined ingredients. One in particular that I&#x27;ve used in the past is $199.00 for 2 ounces. I believe this serum is as potent if not more so than those high-end products that many of us cannot afford. My only wish is that it came in a pump bottle versus the dropper type since serums remain stable longer when they are not exposed to air every day. Aside from this, I am extremely satisfied with this product and would recommend without hesitation.</li>
            <li> Nice product,oil free, absorbs instantly as stated,only need to use a little of this product,very good price. will order again.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t done was it was supposed to do at all which was repair fine lines.  I have not seen any improvement.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This serum is cloudy liquid that works wonders on my skin.  The liquid wipes on easily with fingertips from a dropper dispenser and dries and disappears almost immediately. I find that it plumps wrinkes and works under makeup or other moisture lotions to help keep skin soft and smooth and less wrinkled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasts a reasonable amount of time with twice daily use. I have tried other formulas with similar ingredients, but this one is my favorite.  I have ordered a replacement through my husband&#x27;s account so it does not show me buying it again, but I intend to keep replacing and using this.  I like it better than $200 face creams that are full of waxy fillers and moisturizers. It works well under CeraVe hyaluronic acid lotion as a light constant conditioner for skin. It has all the ingredients of very expensive so-called \\&quot;cosmeceutical\\&quot; products.</li>
            <li> This product does go on very silkt smooth.Seems to have decent hydration.as for fine lines and wrinkles yet to be seen.I will update you as I continue the use of this entire bottle.</li>
            <li> have not used this product long enough to see remarkable results yet, but am looking forward to see these changes.</li>
            <li> I love it, love it, love it. This serum is a must have for anyone who wants to stave off the aging process as long as they can. The serum is so smooth and my skin soaks it right up. I have been using this for a month now and I find that my skin is more taut and smoother. I put a little extra around my eyes and my lip line and notice less lines in those areas. It also is a great base for my makeup and helps it go on smoother and more even. I will definitely be buying more of this great serum in the very near future.</li>
            <li> NOT SURE YET . HAVNT BEEN USING LONG ENOUGH</li>
            <li> Zero customer support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is quite good, but don&#x27;t even think about contacting the supplier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In two years and multiple attempts, The Skin Science refused to answer even a simple message - by email or telephone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And there are many equivalent products available from other sellers.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it works, but I use it once a week along with other products on other nights.  Enough!</li>
            <li> This serum really does mitigate the crepey skin on my neck.  I love the price.  Matrixyl 3000 can be very expensive.</li>
            <li> IT HAS LOTS OF GREAT INGREDENTS IN IT. I USE THIS WITH  ARGAN OIL AND IT SEEMS TO BE HELPING</li>
            <li> I really like this repair for my face and it does work very well as advertised. However, the tube only had enough in it for three short uses. Not a full tube. That was a tiny bit disappointing. But you sure can&#x27;t go wrong with the product. It&#x27;s quite good and met all my expectations.</li>
            <li> Excellent service &amp; I love the product</li>
            <li> What a waste....I&#x27;d rather use Oil of Olay.  Sad to think that there would ever be a miracle in a bottle.  Stay out of the sun and use a sensible product.</li>
            <li> I received a facial at a local spa and these two ingredients were in one of the products they used on my face, so I did some research and found that these two ingredients are \\&quot;key\\&quot;.  I really like this and have noticed a difference after about a month.  I use it twice a day and it absorbs in fast in the morning and I can apply makeup no problem.  Does not leave streaks.  As compared to Manuka honey serum (which I also really like)...I notice more of a difference with this.</li>
            <li> This is a great product........LOVVVVVVVVEEEEEE it.Will buy again and recommend too my friends really great product.Please keep up the quality.</li>
            <li> Get 2 or 3! I&#x27;ve used 3 of the 4 ingredients individually before and knew how well they worked but now with the Matrixyl 3000,&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t believe what I was seeing! the marionette lines around my mouth poof! disappeared, small lines around the eyes  *Gone*&lt;br /&gt;overall appearance of my skin was beautiful and firmer in appearance. If you are really concerned about your face looking older, try this. You won&#x27;t be sorry. You will be so happy, it is quite possible you&#x27;ll run out of it in a hurry!</li>
            <li> I like that serum. I can see different after two weeks. I&#x27;ll check for another products . Thank you D</li>
            <li> This was not what I really wanted.  I wanted the Mlatrixyl and Hyluronic Acid but there were no return instructions in the package.</li>
            <li> Really works.  My eyes are looking great.</li>
            <li> Overall very good serum at a great price. My skin is softer and firmer with less noticeable fine lines. Has not had much effect if any on my dark spots.</li>
            <li> I love this serum! It smells like roses and has the best ingredients you can buy for antiaging! I got a great price and the shipping was fast! This serum will be my antiaging miracle for years to come. Im sold on this miracle in a bottle! Will continue to use forever...</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a week now so I can&#x27;t say what the future will bring but it goes on smooth without any residue like some other serums. I have notice a subtle change in the appearance of my deep furrow line in between my brows, it appears to be softening. I have tried hundreds of products and I don&#x27;t believe in miracles but I do believe that using a gentle cleanser, removing the dead skin cells once a week, drinking plenty of water and using &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; products along with other products such as this one can&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> This product had all of the ingredients that I was reading up on to hydrate, promote collagen to plump up, and argireline is a bonus as an all natural relaxant. I use it daily, under my makeup and my skin is softer and smoother since using it about a month now.  I would recommend this product--Yes.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this product at all. Its consistency was thin and watery. I used up the whole bottle and still felt like it didn&#x27;t make a bit of difference to my skin. The bottle looked cheap, as did the sticker. Looked like it was made at home. I think I got ripped off.</li>
            <li> This is liquid gold! I could tell a difference almost immediately. I use this every night before bed and the Optimum Omega 3 Daytime Treatment Cream every morning and the results are outstanding. The price is very reasonable, too.</li>
            <li> i actually like this product quite a bit and would buy it again except for the stupid eye dropper.  That darn thing made me tip the bottle and I lost 1/3 of the product--it made me feel like i was throwing my money away.  I am looking for another product with the same ingredients but a better bottle.  disappointing...</li>
            <li> I love the high-powered ingredients in this stuff. There is no irritation and can be used around the eyes. Using this serum under my daily moisturizer has helped plump out the lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Although long-term use of this product will definitely lead to more permanent results, the most immediate visible results come from using under mineral make-up. Seriously smooths all lines and kind of numbs the skin. Makes face appear flawless! Now as soon as I wash my face the effect disappears for the most part. Also, the bottle is tiny and I wish it was a pump mechanism instead of the pipette. This doesn&#x27;t have the consistency of a normal serum, it&#x27;s somewhere between a light lotion and a serum.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for a year and wonderful results. My skin tone has improved and my wrinkles have diminished dramatically</li>
            <li> Feels good but this is something I would need to use for awhile to discover the improvements.  Ask me in a month and then I will be able to deliver a better review.</li>
