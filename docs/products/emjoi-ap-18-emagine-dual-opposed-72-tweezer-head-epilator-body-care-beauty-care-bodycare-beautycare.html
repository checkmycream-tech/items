    <ol>
            <li>This one works the best of them all.  </li>
            <li>They were awesome.</li>
            <li>This is the best epilator I have purchased</li>
            <li>This is the best one I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>Completely awesome.</li>
            <li>Works better then any I have ever used!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did!!  </li>
            <li>Despite that, I am very happy with the results in most places.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and does not hurt at all</li>
            <li>I do have very fine hair there.</li>
            <li>Love love love this epilator!</li>
            <li>Works great and fast!</li>
            <li>I was not too pleased with this.  </li>
            <li>The rollers reduce glide friction, keep the tweezers from directly touching the skin, and also give a sort of massaging sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it worked famously.  </li>
            <li>That is something that may happen if you drop most things.  </li>
            <li>Seems like it breaks them most of the time.</li>
            <li>Waxing gets more hair</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t know if it was able to charge or not.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tolerable for sure though.</li>
            <li>So you might be ok if your skin can handle it.  </li>
            <li>-all, though, it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>I loved this when I first got it -</li>
            <li>but this does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li>I loved this product at first.  </li>
            <li>It came in a very quick time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit pulled out 90% of my fine, blond, fuzz on my face.  </li>
            <li>My primary purpose for this Emjoi was to get rid of my baby, blond, fine, hairs on my face.  </li>
            <li>Also the one they sent me had issues with the charging indicator light</li>
            <li>it is quick and clean.</li>
            <li>Because of that it is not painful at all for me to use on my legs.</li>
            <li>You should let your hairs grow out a little best results, again, much like waxing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used 3 other brands of epilators and this one is by far the very best!</li>
            <li>Understandable that they probably wanted to make a light weight tool that would be easy to maneuver while grooming, however, the plastic used to construct the body of the epilator certainly could have been manufactured with a sturdier plastic, I was very surprised to feel how light and flimsy this felt.</li>
            <li>it was much more powerful than my old epilator!  </li>
            <li>Having the light really does help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are a first time user then buy this one as it is not painful at all.</li>
            <li>The epilator is inexpensive, feels sturdy enough, looks nice, and fits well in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>They are totally worth it</li>
            <li>Much more efficient and pain free with the double heads!</li>
            <li>Deff worth the purchase</li>
            <li>I have been using one of the cheaper Braun epilators on my legs for several years, and i&#x27;ve always liked it pretty well</li>
            <li>I will probably still wax my legs from time to time but this epilator is most likely going to be my more frequent method for hair removal.</li>
            <li>What a great little invention!!</li>
            <li>Love this product, considering the smaller version.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s true of most epilators to some extent, but this one is even more so because the wide flat plastic really drags on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can still see some fine blond hairs in the sunlight but barely.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, it left my face smooth and foundation goes on so much smoother.</li>
            <li>I got much farther with it than i ever have before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is going to save me sooooo much money on waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>saw an entire review on how cheaply this device is manufactured and how it would break if it was dropped.  </li>
            <li>I think it works very well.</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves this thing.</li>
            <li>Also, on the legs you the areas that have a curve will require a little more attention to get it right.  </li>
            <li>The tweezer-head design works mostly as intended â€” given a &#x27;flat&#x27; surface, fewer passes are required to catch the same amount of hair compared to my single-head</li>
            <li>The shipping was on time, and packaged well, but the epilator itself, feels REALLY cheap and hollow.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much just a flat piece of plastic.</li>
            <li>Having used it for a few weeks now, i can say my feelings are mixed, but definitely more positive than not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is also very loud.  </li>
            <li>I was even able to use it on my bikini line which I was never able to do with my Braun.</li>
            <li>It is true that you will be left with a few strays but a quick shave will take care of that.  </li>
            <li>I suppose the reason it&#x27;s so large is that, since it doesn&#x27;t have rollers or anything, it&#x27;s necessary to keep it moving</li>
            <li>It is quite loud also.</li>
            <li>I no longer find epilating my legs painful at all, but i have never been able to get used to it in the more sensitive (e.g. bikini) areas.</li>
            <li>So far I don&#x27;t think it is working for me.</li>
            <li>the hair grows back too fast and stubbly.</li>
            <li>I feel like it may be causing some of the hairs to snap off though rather than be pulled out completely.</li>
            <li>I DO have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of irritatingly noisy.</li>
            <li>All epilators are loud, so the volume itself will be no surprise to anyone who&#x27;s ever used one before, but the tone of the sound is very different from my other one.</li>
            <li>Your legs will not be as smooth as shaving but after using the Emjoi and following up with a shave, you will go a week and a half to two weeks without having to think about shaving.  </li>
            <li>The tweezers on the Emagine seem to make direct contact with the skin, which is evidenced by the white marks and bits of skin i find after using it.</li>
            <li>I barely even notice the hairs being ripped out.</li>
            <li>The included charger and scrub pad are adequate, and the brush and bag are nicer than what i&#x27;ve usually seen with similar devices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The included charger and scrub pad are adequate, and the brush and bag are nicer than what i&#x27;ve usually seen with similar devices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Better not drop it, or you could find yourself with a very broken epilator.</li>
            <li> It worked the first two days, and now it&#x27;s pulsing is EXTREMELY slow, even when plugged in.</li>
            <li> The light on my Braun is really tiny and weak, so i used to feel like it was kind of useless, but having used one with no light at all now, i&#x27;ve decided that&#x27;s not true.</li>
            <li> The plastic cover seems unnecessarily large on the sides, which makes it more difficult to reach into smaller spaces (like behind the knee and where the thigh meets the abdomen).</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s lasted a long time!),</li>
            <li> My Braun has different covers you can use, my favourite of which is the one with little rollers on the front and back.</li>
            <li> The tweezers are placed on the device in such a way that it is hard to get to flat areas such as the upper thigh and underarms.  </li>
            <li> I tried the Emagine just to see how it would do, and i definitely feel like it hurt less.</li>
            <li> as stated earlier, one drop, and you could find yourself looking to buy a replacement, which is a bit worrisome, as these tools are not cheap.</li>
            <li> I have a Braun but wanted this for my peach fuzz which is blonde, it tells you to use only one side which does not grab it and the 2 sides are not good for your face, however it works well on my underarms and legs.</li>
            <li> The heads would turn, but with such little force that you could stop them by applying a little pressure.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t hurt like the other epiladies.</li>
            <li> I really hesitated on this purchase because I don&#x27;t need another expensive gadget that doesn&#x27;t work in my junk drawer.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t press down when using it, just run it on the surface of you</li>
            <li> It also is a lot quicker with it having 72 tweezers so done in half the time.  </li>
            <li> I have had other epilators in the past.  </li>
            <li> If you have gotten waxed or tweezed you are used to the little sting that pulling hair our by the root brings.  </li>
            <li> I would feel little stubs.</li>
            <li> The seller refused to refund because it has been a few weeks since the purchase.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no light.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see this mentioned in the marketing stuff, but i actually feel like this epilator may be less painful than my other one.</li>
            <li> I definitely feel like it&#x27;s faster, and probably less painful, than my other one, and i&#x27;ll probably keep using it full-time for my legs.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t yet had the tweezers pinch me, but i&#x27;m anxious that they</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s longer than usual when I shave, usually by day 2</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very time consuming and messy (and uncomfortable to stand in awkward positions for periods of time trying to not drip wax all over the floor.)</li>
            <li> It bloody hurts the first time but after that it&#x27;s bearable.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it, she wanted a hard wired Epilator not a rechargeable</li>
            <li> skin in slow circular motions.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s actually hollow, with very thin plastic serving as the body.</li>
            <li> First time will definetly be painful!</li>
            <li> The charger plug connects at a weird angle that makes it slightly awkward to store flat on a table or whatever.</li>
            <li> The tweezers grabbing on to your skin can have a sort of self-propelling effect (the epilator pulls itself along without you doing anything) which can make it difficult to control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The design of the cover makes the epilator really difficult to use if your skin is moist.</li>
            <li> On my face it left horrible rips and burns and did not do anything but break the hairs.</li>
            <li> So sad wish it would have worked for me.</li>
            <li> Bad purchase.</li>
            <li> I did follow all the instructions and had bad results.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed, however, because it stopped working within 6 months!  </li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible.</li>

            <li> The tweezers are placed on the device in such a way that it is hard to get to flat areas such as the upper thigh and underarms.  It seems to work well around the ankle area or any narrower part of the leg.  I was not too pleased with this.  It is quite loud also.</li>
            <li> Works better then any I have ever used!!</li>
            <li> I have had other epilators in the past.  This one works the best of them all.  Whit it&#x27;s dual head it is quick and clean.</li>
            <li> I have always had a braun epilator and when it finally gave up I seen the reviews on this one and decided to give it a go...I&#x27;m so glad I did!!  It is very easy to use and does not hurt at all I was even able to use it on my bikini line which I was never able to do with my Braun. It also is a lot quicker with it having 72 tweezers so done in half the time.  If you are a first time user then buy this one as it is not painful at all.</li>
            <li> It leaves a lot of hair after each pass.  It is also very loud.  The seller refused to refund because it has been a few weeks since the purchase.</li>
            <li> I have been using one of the cheaper Braun epilators on my legs for several years, and i&#x27;ve always liked it pretty well (it&#x27;s lasted a long time!), but recently i got irritated with how time-consuming it is, so i thought i&#x27;d finally try the Emagine. Having used it for a few weeks now, i can say my feelings are mixed, but definitely more positive than not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The epilator is inexpensive, feels sturdy enough, looks nice, and fits well in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The included charger and scrub pad are adequate, and the brush and bag are nicer than what i&#x27;ve usually seen with similar devices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. There seems to be an optional shaver attachment, although i haven&#x27;t seen it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The tweezer-head design works mostly as intended â€” given a &#x27;flat&#x27; surface, fewer passes are required to catch the same amount of hair compared to my single-head epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. I didn&#x27;t see this mentioned in the marketing stuff, but i actually feel like this epilator may be less painful than my other one. I no longer find epilating my legs painful at all, but i have never been able to get used to it in the more sensitive (e.g. bikini) areas. I tried the Emagine just to see how it would do, and i definitely feel like it hurt less. I got much farther with it than i ever have before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s kind of irritatingly noisy. All epilators are loud, so the volume itself will be no surprise to anyone who&#x27;s ever used one before, but the tone of the sound is very different from my other one. It&#x27;s a deeper, throatier, grinding-er noise which is more difficult to drown out with headphones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. There&#x27;s no light. The light on my Braun is really tiny and weak, so i used to feel like it was kind of useless, but having used one with no light at all now, i&#x27;ve decided that&#x27;s not true. Having the light really does help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The charger plug connects at a weird angle that makes it slightly awkward to store flat on a table or whatever. I don&#x27;t know why they didn&#x27;t just put the socket on the bottom end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The head cover (or whatever it&#x27;s called, the plastic bit surrounding the tweezers) doesn&#x27;t blow my mind. It&#x27;s pretty much just a flat piece of plastic. My Braun has different covers you can use, my favourite of which is the one with little rollers on the front and back. The rollers reduce glide friction, keep the tweezers from directly touching the skin, and also give a sort of massaging sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4a. The tweezers on the Emagine seem to make direct contact with the skin, which is evidenced by the white marks and bits of skin i find after using it. I haven&#x27;t yet had the tweezers pinch me, but i&#x27;m anxious that they might.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4b. The tweezers grabbing on to your skin can have a sort of self-propelling effect (the epilator pulls itself along without you doing anything) which can make it difficult to control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4c. The plastic cover seems unnecessarily large on the sides, which makes it more difficult to reach into smaller spaces (like behind the knee and where the thigh meets the abdomen). I suppose the reason it&#x27;s so large is that, since it doesn&#x27;t have rollers or anything, it&#x27;s necessary to keep it moving smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4d. The design of the cover makes the epilator really difficult to use if your skin is moist. That&#x27;s true of most epilators to some extent, but this one is even more so because the wide flat plastic really drags on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over-all, though, it&#x27;s pretty good. I definitely feel like it&#x27;s faster, and probably less painful, than my other one, and i&#x27;ll probably keep using it full-time for my legs.</li>
            <li> I really hesitated on this purchase because I don&#x27;t need another expensive gadget that doesn&#x27;t work in my junk drawer.  My primary purpose for this Emjoi was to get rid of my baby, blond, fine, hairs on my face.  So I gave it a go and it worked famously.  Read the instructions before you take it to your face because you are supposed hold it at a different angle when using it on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit pulled out 90% of my fine, blond, fuzz on my face.  If you have gotten waxed or tweezed you are used to the little sting that pulling hair our by the root brings.  It is manageable.  Additionally, it left my face smooth and foundation goes on so much smoother. I can still see some fine blond hairs in the sunlight but barely.  I do touch ups once a week because hair growth happens in phases so maintenance is required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this unit under my arms and my entire legs.  You should let your hairs grow out a little best results, again, much like waxing.  Don&#x27;t press down when using it, just run it on the surface of you skin in slow circular motions.  You will have some splotchy redness that will go away in a day.&lt;br /&gt;The only challenge is keeping my skin taut under the arm area.  I could have used another pair of hands to do that.  Also, on the legs you the areas that have a curve will require a little more attention to get it right.  It is true that you will be left with a few strays but a quick shave will take care of that.  Your legs will not be as smooth as shaving but after using the Emjoi and following up with a shave, you will go a week and a half to two weeks without having to think about shaving.  This is going to save me sooooo much money on waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried this on my lady bits yet so I can&#x27;t review that.  I use this while watching TV.  It is just as noisy as an electric shaver so I just set the caption options on the TV because it does interfere with me listening to my shows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw an entire review on how cheaply this device is manufactured and how it would break if it was dropped.  Nowhere, did the reviewer actually talk about the performance of the gadget.  I will however, somewhat agree with that poster.  I you drop the Emjoi it may break.  That is something that may happen if you drop most things.  It is not exclusive to the Emjoi.</li>
            <li> I loved this when I first got it - it was much more powerful than my old epilator!  I was disappointed, however, because it stopped working within 6 months!  The heads would turn, but with such little force that you could stop them by applying a little pressure.</li>
            <li> So far I don&#x27;t think it is working for me. I did use it on my arms and that seems to have worked. I do have very fine hair there. On my face it left horrible rips and burns and did not do anything but break the hairs. I don&#x27;t see that it removed any hairs anywhere else either. Seems like it breaks them most of the time. Maybe it is too soon to tell. I will continue to try but I don&#x27;t see any of the results I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> The shipping was on time, and packaged well, but the epilator itself, feels REALLY cheap and hollow. Better not drop it, or you could find yourself with a very broken epilator. It does work well, though, but the body of the epilator, is way cheeeeaply made, doesn&#x27;t feel solid at all, it&#x27;s actually hollow, with very thin plastic serving as the body. Understandable that they probably wanted to make a light weight tool that would be easy to maneuver while grooming, however, the plastic used to construct the body of the epilator certainly could have been manufactured with a sturdier plastic, I was very surprised to feel how light and flimsy this felt. as stated earlier, one drop, and you could find yourself looking to buy a replacement, which is a bit worrisome, as these tools are not cheap.</li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t hurt like the other epiladies. I barely even notice the hairs being ripped out. My last one I had to bite my lip.</li>
            <li> Never had an epilator before but have waxed for over ten years. Because of that it is not painful at all for me to use on my legs. I don&#x27;t like to shave bc the hair grows back too fast and stubbly. I like waxing but it&#x27;s very time consuming and messy (and uncomfortable to stand in awkward positions for periods of time trying to not drip wax all over the floor.) Altho I have no basis for comparison I think it works very well. Waxing gets more hair but this does a pretty good job. I will probably still wax my legs from time to time but this epilator is most likely going to be my more frequent method for hair removal. Also I believe I bought from the seller Shave Now...They were awesome. Ordered this epilator and they were out of stock so they upgraded me to the rechargeable epilator that works with or without the chord. It came in a very quick time. Also the one they sent me had issues with the charging indicator light so I didn&#x27;t know if it was able to charge or not. I emailed them and they promptly responded and sent me a replacement. Very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is the best epilator I have purchased</li>
            <li> This is the 4th enjoined we&#x27;ve purchased. We seem to go through about one a year. They are totally worth it and we will continue to purchase!</li>
            <li> Love love love this epilator! I&#x27;ve used 3 other brands of epilators and this one is by far the very best! Much more efficient and pain free with the double heads! If your going to buy one buy this one!</li>
            <li> I have a Braun but wanted this for my peach fuzz which is blonde, it tells you to use only one side which does not grab it and the 2 sides are not good for your face, however it works well on my underarms and legs.</li>
            <li> First time will definetly be painful! If you have ever had your legs waxed you will know what I&#x27;m talking about. I&#x27;m on week one and no hair! That&#x27;s longer than usual when I shave, usually by day 2 I would feel little stubs. Deff worth the purchase</li>
            <li> I have been using electronic hair removal devices since they invented them!  This is the best one I&#x27;ve used.  Works great and fast!</li>
            <li> It worked the first two days, and now it&#x27;s pulsing is EXTREMELY slow, even when plugged in. Bad purchase. Absolutely horrible. Paid a lot of money for this to work this way. Smdh</li>
            <li> What a great little invention!! It bloody hurts the first time but after that it&#x27;s bearable. I feel like it may be causing some of the hairs to snap off though rather than be pulled out completely. Despite that, I am very happy with the results in most places.</li>
            <li> Completely awesome. Does it hurt? Of course it does. It&#x27;s tolerable for sure though. Exfoliate before you do it, witch hazel after you do it not even a bit of redness.</li>
            <li> I loved this product at first.  After a day I had a rash then ingrown hairs.  I DO have sensitive skin. So you might be ok if your skin can handle it.  I did follow all the instructions and had bad results.  So sad wish it would have worked for me.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it, she wanted a hard wired Epilator not a rechargeable and she absolutely loves this thing.</li>
            <li> Love this product, considering the smaller version.</li>
