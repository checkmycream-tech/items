            <li>:o)</li>
            <li>Read online, that someone else had used this product and it was successful.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Yeah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have loved and used Mario Badescu products for about 8 years.</li>
            <li>So you can feel good AND look good.</li>
            <li>This cream is wonderful, calming the redness immediately from the first!</li>
            <li>read many great reviews.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I came upon this amazing product online and after reading excellent reviews, I hurried to the closest Nordstrom and bought one.</li>
            <li>there were more stars I would have rated it a 10!</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>many good reviews to not try it had lots of samples with the order which was nice</li>
            <li>I am THRILLED with Control Cream.</li>
            <li>Then I started doing my own searching on the web.  </li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s worked GREAT!</li>
            <li>what has worked best for me by far is ice.</li>
            <li>She stopped itching and her elbows were looking better.</li>
            <li>The Mario Badescu O.G. was the most miraculous skin product I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li>You can read more about the Control Cream issue here:</li>
            <li>I love this cream anytime</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to see a poll of how many people were helped by this product and how many hurt.  </li>
            <li>One more thing...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;ok</li>
            <li>I noticed that upon immediate application, the area around my eyes seemed more soothed like its thirst had been quenched.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about day 4 and my eye area is more cleared up than it has in weeks since my eczema</li>
            <li>if you have read the many reviews and were eager for relief and this product did not work for you; you might try the alba product.</li>
            <li>using a cube of ice on my eyes in the evening or when irritated has done the most to sooth them.</li>
            <li>I was thoroughly pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>By the time my husband came home that night he said I looked a lot better.  </li>
            <li>sure, another scam that won&#x27;t to anything.</li>
            <li>I used it for 3 days and ever since my skin is healthy again.</li>
            <li>-- I must say that I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to report your experience to the FDA through Medwatch.</li>
            <li>I had had this problem going on 1.5 years, with the skin on one lower eyelid becoming more and more noticeable swollen and flaky.</li>
            <li>After a week of using it, the dryness disappeared and the redness and swelling reduced significantly!  </li>
            <li>This has really done the trick, and I&#x27;ll probably even be able to go to using this just once a day with good control.</li>
            <li>Even fine wrinkles and the most minor&lt;br /&gt;of</li>
            <li>I got several nice sized samples of Mario Badescu products with my order...very nice!  </li>
            <li>Best $17 I&#x27;ve spent on this problem.</li>
            <li>This used to be a great product, and it was my &#x27;holy grail&#x27;, but very recently (early 2013)</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s quite rich) and in the morning, my face is so much more even</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product that lives up to all its positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Then I stumbled upon Mario Badescus&#x27; cream and in a matter of days I saw a huge difference.</li>
            <li>But yes, it is a great product and a definite must try when your skin is encountering problems.</li>
            <li>It also smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>I realize I now sound like a Kiehl&#x27;s rep, but I assure you, I am not.</li>
            <li>I swear by this product and hope it helps others who suffer from this bizarre problem.  </li>
            <li>It has been perfect now for 3 months, I use it everyday on my eyes.  </li>
            <li>This amazing cream does not burn either, in fact, it&#x27;s very cooling to my eyes.</li>
            <li>but when I ran out I didn&#x27;t want to go back for more because I didn&#x27;t think that using a steroid cream for an extended time would be good for me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty lightweight, non-scented and great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>my eye was 50% better, within 48 hours and 3 more applications my eye was completely normal again.  </li>
            <li>So it might not work for everyone, but this is definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>I wish I had tried this cream first, because I would have enjoyed the holidays a lot more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>UPDATE TO ORIGINAL POST (</li>
            <li>See original post below):  Control Cream has been pulled from the market because it is believed that it contained undisclosed corticosteroids.</li>
            <li>This is a great cream and goes a long way!  </li>
            <li>I suddenly experienced really dry skin, flaking and itching around my eyes.</li>
            <li>It seems like a pretty good moisturizer so far</li>
            <li>the company changed the formula WITHOUT informing it&#x27;s loyal customers.</li>
            <li>It worked from the very first try.</li>
            <li>Thank you SO much Mario Badescu!!</li>
            <li>THIS is why these products worked so very well for your ailments!!</li>
            <li>Through browsing google and forums, I came across really good reviews for this product and further positive reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This product WAS an amazing solution to itchy, red, flaky skin on my face.</li>
            <li>She loved it so much she wouldn&#x27;t give it back to me!</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when I got my product because they included a bunch of free gifts!  </li>
            <li>it hasn&#x27;t completely cured the symptoms as they will come back in a couple of weeks if I stop using, but I am happy to apply every couple days to keep the symptoms at bay.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it nightly for about a week and it hasn&#x27;t broken me out or caused any irritation, so I&#x27;m one happy girl!  </li>
            <li>Sounds good, but why would I trust your other products at this point.</li>
            <li>I then started applying the cream on the eczema Ive had on my right hand for years</li>
            <li>They were right.  </li>
            <li>Turns out it was the best $20 I&#x27;ve spent in a long time.  </li>
            <li>, I was experiencing and I finally came across someone who specifically named this cream and how it worked fast and amazingly well.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so smooth and soft now, I&#x27;m so grateful to have found this cream</li>
            <li>Visiting the dermatologist, the medication he gave me did not do much to help calm the redness on my face.  </li>
            <li>As soon as I received it, I applied several applications and my eyes were better over night.  </li>
            <li>This control cream had been recommended by many on the forum as the only thing that had brought relief (even moreso than prescription products).</li>
            <li>If you are suffering from this issue stop wasting your money on other products/doctor visits and give this one a try, I guarantee you will be satisfied!</li>
            <li>But Mario Badescu&#x27;s Control Cream really did the job!</li>
            <li>First, let me say, I never ever write reviews.</li>
            <li>this stuff really works!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you can use the cream by itself, but I only use it on certain areas.  </li>
            <li>My eyelids very dry, flaky, red, and inflamed-nothing I have ever experienced before.</li>
            <li>Everything about my experience with this company and their products (they sent samples of other products as well) has been amazing.</li>
            <li>I also advised my eye doctor so he could be able to help others with this strange condition.</li>
            <li>If you have dry or combo skin and are doing things to it to fight aging or break-outs, you will love treating it to this yummy cream.      </li>
            <li>Within 2 days my ears were healing and now continue to be dry and healthy.</li>
            <li>I had used hydrocortisone 1% cream and even triamcinolone cream occasionally with some relief, but I also knew that long term use of steroids on the face wasn&#x27;t a good idea.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin in the t zone but my cheeks are always dry and sensitive and this cream is great for my cheeks when they get red or irritated.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only cream I&#x27;ve tried that works so well and so quickly!</li>
            <li>This is really a miracle cream.  </li>
            <li>Steroid cremes, antibiotics, allergy meds were repeatedly prescribed and nothing really helped.</li>
            <li>I would have saved a ton of money and perhaps not have damaged the skin so much on my eyelids.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>I absolutely this product.</li>
            <li>I really thought I was never going to wear eye-make up again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this to anybody who has eczema and/or really dry/sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It seemed to lessen the swelling, but really didn&#x27;t make it go away.  </li>
            <li>I ran across a blog and two of the replies really resonated with me.  </li>
            <li>Very upset with the company.</li>
            <li>I have also found it works quite nicely in tandem with Kiehl&#x27;s Youth Regenerating Heavy Cream.</li>
            <li>And if you can find someone selling the &#x27;old&#x27; formula (pre-March 2013), DO NOT purchase it!!!</li>
            <li>The company has pulled most of the jars from the market, but they missed the ones that were packaged together with other items (calma mask and a cream face wash).</li>
            <li>i opted to stop using steroid creams since, like many of the other reviewers, the problem areas were by my eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li>If you suffer from red, dry and cracked skin particulary around the eye area this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>ive tried so many with no success</li>
            <li>And when corticosteroids are abruptly stopped, the skin will respond most negatively (redness, blistering, burning, stinging, itching, pustules, papules, dryness, etc.), sound familiar?</li>
            <li>It is truly a miracle product, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Or if you are still using the old formula, STOP!!</li>
            <li>In fact, just to prove it I will be neither the first, nor the last to say that until I found these two products, I have found Kiehl&#x27;s to be, by and large, offensively over priced.</li>
            <li>This cream (so far) is really working well.</li>
            <li>Really leaves skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li>Pretty much out of the blue, my eyes went from normal to swollen overnight</li>
            <li>For many of you who has globbed on vaseline, Eucerin, Vitamin E, coconut oil, olive oil and whatever else to moisturize the red, itchy, flaky, (mini paper cuts) rash (I know I did), Mario Badescu is the ONLY cream you need to get rid of it completely.</li>
            <li>and here I took antibiotics and didn&#x27;t start my probiotic afterward like I normally do because it was in drops form.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad to have come upon this product and will definitely recommend it to anyone with dry and inflamed skin problems.  </li>
            <li>Then I started to see the beginning of the same on my right eyelid.  </li>
            <li>I tried it and it gave me right away relief from this constant itching.</li>
            <li>Find me @RustiResta on Twitter where I posted photos of my face after using the new Control Cream.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Completely gone!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Aquaphor was my first attempt at relief, but it&#x27;s moisturizing factor didn&#x27;t last</li>
            <li>It gave me almost instant relief and cleared up my issues within the first 3 days.  </li>
            <li>I tried pretty much everything else on the market and being without insurance and not sure whether to spend the money to go to the doctor, I decided to give this product a try first.  </li>
            <li>It was most definitely eczema: red, patchy, dry, itchy skin.</li>
            <li>Think I&#x27;m going to be taking a break after I use up what I have--at least until I re-research their products and make sure nothing else has changed.</li>
            <li>so I applied an antifungal medication under my eye two times which cleared it up completely.  </li>
            <li>so I was really distressed about this skin issue suddenly popping up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would go as far as to call it a miracle cream,  </li>
            <li>and so far it has not come back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my skin cleared up completely and there is NO sign whatsoever of me ever having any problems with my skin.</li>
            <li>this cream not only heals but really soothes your skin - you can see and feel a difference in just a day.</li>
            <li>Recently I stopped using it to see if there was any change and the redness came right back.  </li>
            <li>My eyelid truly looks and feels like it&#x27;s back to normal!  </li>
            <li>I starting putting this cream on his eyelids on Friday and by Monday his eyes look normal!  </li>
            <li>I googled this condition and found several blogs where people talked about the same thing and how it just came out of the blue, overnight pretty much.  </li>
            <li>I tried so many different creams over the past year, but nothing helped.</li>
            <li>maybe a personal thing, but my high hopes for relief on the sore eyes from this product were not met.</li>
            <li>highly recommend for anyone with the same problem!</li>
            <li>After only a few days of applying the cream, the skin was completely healed and smooth.</li>
            <li>After 24 hours of applying this cream twice a day, my eyelids have returned back to normal.</li>
            <li>and my eyes are back to normal</li>
            <li>and I can say that after 3 days, my eyes looked normal again, the skin was no longer peeling and the itching had gone away almost instantly.  </li>
            <li>After just three days of using this cream twice a day, the skin on my eyelid is essentially back to normal.</li>
            <li>It all started with a tiny dry patch of skin on my right eyelid.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using my newly received batch for the last two weeks, and none of the symptoms have gone away.</li>
            <li>For all of you who are new here and suffering from what you think is a &#x27;reaction&#x27; to the &#x27;new formula&#x27; (Mario Badescu &#x27;reformulated&#x27; Control Cream--i.e., likely removed the working ingredients, the corticosteroids--in Feb/Mar 2013), be aware that you are likely suffering from topical corticosteroid withdrawal (TCW) as it is firmly believed that this very deceitful, unethical company had been adding undisclosed corticosteroids to both its Control Cream and Healing Cream, both of which the company is no longer selling.</li>
            <li>I had a stubborn rash on the inner part of my arm near my elbow.</li>
            <li>After the second night my eyelid was back to normal.</li>
            <li>I started using the cream right away and within minutes I could feel a difference, also within a few days</li>
            <li>I began to suffer with severe redness and peeling under my right eye - the eye doctor gave me a steroid ointment for blepharitis and it helped a little but the condition came back immediately.  </li>
            <li>There is a whole thread of people who found each other online who had severe reactions (please get in touch if you&#x27;re one of them!).</li>
            <li>Like many other reviewers on here stated, I have also tried everything you can name under the sun and although other products slightly relieved the symptoms, the problem still persisted.</li>
            <li>Within DAYS, I saw improvement, redness went away and the smalls cuts from it being so dry near my tear duc and on my lid healed.  </li>
            <li>it certainly did not neutralize the irritation as well as the alba green tea eye gel.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This used to be a great product, and it was my &#x27;holy grail&#x27;, but very recently (early 2013)</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s quite rich) and in the morning, my face is so much more even</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product that lives up to all its positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Then I stumbled upon Mario Badescus&#x27; cream and in a matter of days I saw a huge difference.</li>
            <li> But yes, it is a great product and a definite must try when your skin is encountering problems.</li>
            <li> It also smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> I realize I now sound like a Kiehl&#x27;s rep, but I assure you, I am not.</li>
            <li> I swear by this product and hope it helps others who suffer from this bizarre problem.  </li>
            <li> It has been perfect now for 3 months, I use it everyday on my eyes.  </li>
            <li> This amazing cream does not burn either, in fact, it&#x27;s very cooling to my eyes.</li>
            <li> but when I ran out I didn&#x27;t want to go back for more because I didn&#x27;t think that using a steroid cream for an extended time would be good for me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty lightweight, non-scented and great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> my eye was 50% better, within 48 hours and 3 more applications my eye was completely normal again.  </li>
            <li> So it might not work for everyone, but this is definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> I wish I had tried this cream first, because I would have enjoyed the holidays a lot more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> UPDATE TO ORIGINAL POST (</li>
            <li> See original post below):  Control Cream has been pulled from the market because it is believed that it contained undisclosed corticosteroids.</li>
            <li> This is a great cream and goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> I suddenly experienced really dry skin, flaking and itching around my eyes.</li>
            <li> It seems like a pretty good moisturizer so far</li>
            <li> the company changed the formula WITHOUT informing it&#x27;s loyal customers.</li>
            <li> It worked from the very first try.</li>
            <li> Thank you SO much Mario Badescu!!</li>
            <li> THIS is why these products worked so very well for your ailments!!</li>
            <li> Through browsing google and forums, I came across really good reviews for this product and further positive reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This product WAS an amazing solution to itchy, red, flaky skin on my face.</li>
            <li> She loved it so much she wouldn&#x27;t give it back to me!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I got my product because they included a bunch of free gifts!  </li>
            <li> it hasn&#x27;t completely cured the symptoms as they will come back in a couple of weeks if I stop using, but I am happy to apply every couple days to keep the symptoms at bay.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it nightly for about a week and it hasn&#x27;t broken me out or caused any irritation, so I&#x27;m one happy girl!  </li>
            <li> Sounds good, but why would I trust your other products at this point.</li>
            <li> I then started applying the cream on the eczema Ive had on my right hand for years</li>
            <li> They were right.  </li>
            <li> Turns out it was the best $20 I&#x27;ve spent in a long time.  </li>
            <li> , I was experiencing and I finally came across someone who specifically named this cream and how it worked fast and amazingly well.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so smooth and soft now, I&#x27;m so grateful to have found this cream</li>
            <li> Visiting the dermatologist, the medication he gave me did not do much to help calm the redness on my face.  </li>
            <li> As soon as I received it, I applied several applications and my eyes were better over night.  </li>
            <li> This control cream had been recommended by many on the forum as the only thing that had brought relief (even moreso than prescription products).</li>
            <li> If you are suffering from this issue stop wasting your money on other products/doctor visits and give this one a try, I guarantee you will be satisfied!</li>
            <li> But Mario Badescu&#x27;s Control Cream really did the job!</li>
            <li> First, let me say, I never ever write reviews.</li>
            <li> this stuff really works!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you can use the cream by itself, but I only use it on certain areas.  </li>
            <li> My eyelids very dry, flaky, red, and inflamed-nothing I have ever experienced before.</li>
            <li> Everything about my experience with this company and their products (they sent samples of other products as well) has been amazing.</li>
            <li> I also advised my eye doctor so he could be able to help others with this strange condition.</li>
            <li> If you have dry or combo skin and are doing things to it to fight aging or break-outs, you will love treating it to this yummy cream.      </li>
            <li> Within 2 days my ears were healing and now continue to be dry and healthy.</li>
            <li> I had used hydrocortisone 1% cream and even triamcinolone cream occasionally with some relief, but I also knew that long term use of steroids on the face wasn&#x27;t a good idea.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin in the t zone but my cheeks are always dry and sensitive and this cream is great for my cheeks when they get red or irritated.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only cream I&#x27;ve tried that works so well and so quickly!</li>
            <li> This is really a miracle cream.  </li>
            <li> Steroid cremes, antibiotics, allergy meds were repeatedly prescribed and nothing really helped.</li>
            <li> I would have saved a ton of money and perhaps not have damaged the skin so much on my eyelids.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> I absolutely this product.</li>
            <li> I really thought I was never going to wear eye-make up again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this to anybody who has eczema and/or really dry/sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It seemed to lessen the swelling, but really didn&#x27;t make it go away.  </li>
            <li> I ran across a blog and two of the replies really resonated with me.  </li>
            <li> Very upset with the company.</li>
            <li> I have also found it works quite nicely in tandem with Kiehl&#x27;s Youth Regenerating Heavy Cream.</li>
            <li> And if you can find someone selling the &#x27;old&#x27; formula (pre-March 2013), DO NOT purchase it!!!</li>
            <li> The company has pulled most of the jars from the market, but they missed the ones that were packaged together with other items (calma mask and a cream face wash).</li>
            <li> i opted to stop using steroid creams since, like many of the other reviewers, the problem areas were by my eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li> If you suffer from red, dry and cracked skin particulary around the eye area this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> ive tried so many with no success</li>
            <li> And when corticosteroids are abruptly stopped, the skin will respond most negatively (redness, blistering, burning, stinging, itching, pustules, papules, dryness, etc.), sound familiar?</li>
            <li> It is truly a miracle product, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Or if you are still using the old formula, STOP!!</li>
            <li> In fact, just to prove it I will be neither the first, nor the last to say that until I found these two products, I have found Kiehl&#x27;s to be, by and large, offensively over priced.</li>
            <li> This cream (so far) is really working well.</li>
            <li> Really leaves skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li> Pretty much out of the blue, my eyes went from normal to swollen overnight</li>
            <li> For many of you who has globbed on vaseline, Eucerin, Vitamin E, coconut oil, olive oil and whatever else to moisturize the red, itchy, flaky, (mini paper cuts) rash (I know I did), Mario Badescu is the ONLY cream you need to get rid of it completely.</li>
            <li> and here I took antibiotics and didn&#x27;t start my probiotic afterward like I normally do because it was in drops form.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad to have come upon this product and will definitely recommend it to anyone with dry and inflamed skin problems.  </li>
            <li> Then I started to see the beginning of the same on my right eyelid.  </li>
            <li> I tried it and it gave me right away relief from this constant itching.</li>
            <li> Find me @RustiResta on Twitter where I posted photos of my face after using the new Control Cream.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Completely gone!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Aquaphor was my first attempt at relief, but it&#x27;s moisturizing factor didn&#x27;t last</li>
            <li> It gave me almost instant relief and cleared up my issues within the first 3 days.  </li>
            <li> I tried pretty much everything else on the market and being without insurance and not sure whether to spend the money to go to the doctor, I decided to give this product a try first.  </li>
            <li> It was most definitely eczema: red, patchy, dry, itchy skin.</li>
            <li> Think I&#x27;m going to be taking a break after I use up what I have--at least until I re-research their products and make sure nothing else has changed.</li>
            <li> so I applied an antifungal medication under my eye two times which cleared it up completely.  </li>
            <li> so I was really distressed about this skin issue suddenly popping up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would go as far as to call it a miracle cream,  </li>
            <li> and so far it has not come back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my skin cleared up completely and there is NO sign whatsoever of me ever having any problems with my skin.</li>
            <li> this cream not only heals but really soothes your skin - you can see and feel a difference in just a day.</li>
            <li> Recently I stopped using it to see if there was any change and the redness came right back.  </li>
            <li> My eyelid truly looks and feels like it&#x27;s back to normal!  </li>
            <li> I starting putting this cream on his eyelids on Friday and by Monday his eyes look normal!  </li>
            <li> I googled this condition and found several blogs where people talked about the same thing and how it just came out of the blue, overnight pretty much.  </li>
            <li> I tried so many different creams over the past year, but nothing helped.</li>
            <li> maybe a personal thing, but my high hopes for relief on the sore eyes from this product were not met.</li>
            <li> highly recommend for anyone with the same problem!</li>
            <li> After only a few days of applying the cream, the skin was completely healed and smooth.</li>
            <li> After 24 hours of applying this cream twice a day, my eyelids have returned back to normal.</li>
            <li> and my eyes are back to normal</li>
            <li> and I can say that after 3 days, my eyes looked normal again, the skin was no longer peeling and the itching had gone away almost instantly.  </li>
            <li> After just three days of using this cream twice a day, the skin on my eyelid is essentially back to normal.</li>
            <li> It all started with a tiny dry patch of skin on my right eyelid.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my newly received batch for the last two weeks, and none of the symptoms have gone away.</li>
            <li> For all of you who are new here and suffering from what you think is a &#x27;reaction&#x27; to the &#x27;new formula&#x27; (Mario Badescu &#x27;reformulated&#x27; Control Cream--i.e., likely removed the working ingredients, the corticosteroids--in Feb/Mar 2013), be aware that you are likely suffering from topical corticosteroid withdrawal (TCW) as it is firmly believed that this very deceitful, unethical company had been adding undisclosed corticosteroids to both its Control Cream and Healing Cream, both of which the company is no longer selling.</li>
            <li> I had a stubborn rash on the inner part of my arm near my elbow.</li>
            <li> After the second night my eyelid was back to normal.</li>
            <li> I started using the cream right away and within minutes I could feel a difference, also within a few days</li>
            <li> I began to suffer with severe redness and peeling under my right eye - the eye doctor gave me a steroid ointment for blepharitis and it helped a little but the condition came back immediately.  </li>
            <li> There is a whole thread of people who found each other online who had severe reactions (please get in touch if you&#x27;re one of them!).</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers on here stated, I have also tried everything you can name under the sun and although other products slightly relieved the symptoms, the problem still persisted.</li>
            <li> Within DAYS, I saw improvement, redness went away and the smalls cuts from it being so dry near my tear duc and on my lid healed.  </li>
            <li> it certainly did not neutralize the irritation as well as the alba green tea eye gel.</li>
            <li> I normally wouldn&#x27;t spend 18.00 for a half ounce of something</li>
            <li> I had developed an extreme crusty scaly dryness on my left eyelid.  </li>
            <li> Symptoms abated in less than 7 days and were completely eliminated in 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give this a try if your skin is similar to mine and needs to calm down a little!</li>
            <li> and the redness has come down considerably since I&#x27;ve started using it.  </li>
            <li> On a further note, I gave this to my mom to try on her flaky, itchy, and dry elbows.</li>
            <li> It took away my extremely red, dry, flakey irratated skin all over my nose, and between my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Over a period of four months, the tiny dry patch started to spread and worsened.  </li>
            <li> It was the only thing that helped, and cured permanently, my dry cracked eylids.  </li>
            <li> My son had severe dry, red, peeling eyelids.</li>
            <li> Bought this after it was recommended online by several people for irritated, dry, flaky skin on the eyelid.</li>
            <li> Previously the cream would be a nearly over-night solution.</li>
            <li> When my dry patch started acting up again I looked on the internet for a solution and came across this product.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, pale skin that is prone to blotchiness and redness.  </li>
            <li> I actually picked this up in ULTA store; I wanted to see if I could get something (nonprescription) for the red, flaky skin I have due to rosacea.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews and the instant results it had on other similar cases, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid I would never be able to wear eye makeup again</li>
            <li> im afraid to use most things</li>
            <li> They were not surprised, mentioned that it was pulled to be \\&quot;reformulated,\\&quot; and suggested two things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When used for long periods of time, corticosteroids can cause irreparable damage to the skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going on week 4 now..been seen by 3 different docs and spent $$$ on them and meds.</li>
            <li> I will NEVER purchase anything from this irresponsible company again.going on week 4 now..been seen by 3 different docs and spent $$$ on them and meds.</li>
            <li> It got to a point where the dry skin on my eyelid looked swollen and red due to me constantly trying to peel the dry skin off.  </li>
            <li> From super expensive so called &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; creams to home remedies mixed out of honey and various other mixes.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have stated (and where I learned about this) this was a miracle cream for red, itchy flaking skin on the eyelid.  </li>
            <li> But my problem is horrifically chronic and I have used a panoply of products including a vast majority of both Kiehl&#x27;s and Mario Badescu&#x27;s OTHER products.</li>
            <li> Not only that but other areas on my face that I worked&lt;br</li>
            <li> but all it did was reduce the dry flakiness and not the swelling and redness.  </li>
            <li> I have suffered from, dry, scaly, cracked eyelids off and on for years.</li>
            <li> and my eyes would become dry and itchy again.</li>
            <li> Within a month I started noticing a flaky dry patch on my eye lid.  </li>
            <li> It has healed my dry, flaky eyelids.  </li>
            <li> for years i&#x27;ve struggled with eczema and sporadic dry skin patches on my face.</li>
            <li> I will be on antibiotics and prescribed topical preparations for at least two months as a direct result of using their product.</li>
            <li> A strange skin condition had appeared on a family member&#x27;s eyelids which caused them to be very dry and cracked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had eczema problems for three years and due to starting taking Prolia for osteoporosis the side effect of eczema in my ears was extreme itching &amp; all the nastiness that goes with this problem.</li>
            <li> In the morning I do the same, with the usual facial moisturizer, but without the vaseline.  </li>
            <li> It seemed to help with the puffiness and flaking, but the areas turned a nasty bright red.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching arduously and at long last found the ONLY product that has taken its stead:</li>
            <li> I used this product to help the rosacea problem I&#x27;ve had for the last few years.  </li>
            <li> Their Control Cream contained secret, unlabeled topical corticosteroids and many people suffered ill effects.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was definitely up for anything after a few weeks of this eczema around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Finally something that helps my 12 year old daughter&#x27;s skin behind her ears.</li>
            <li> I now have raw red swellings all over my face.</li>
            <li> A little dab goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t guarantee results, as I don&#x27;t know what other people have and what they&#x27;re using it for.</li>
            <li> I used to use it every night, but now that my rosacea is under control I can get away with using it every other night or</li>
            <li> This product completely healed my flaky, red, and painful upper eye lid - told it was dry eye, but NO relief from any other remedy including:  drops, ointments, or ANY other moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I thought I will have to live with broken, flaky, wrinkly skin around my eyes for life.</li>
            <li> I tried everything with no success.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes the eyes were almost swollen half shut, so it affected my eyesight too.</li>
            <li> Being one that typically does not write reviews I had to take the time to review this product.  </li>
            <li> This cream cleared up the scaly skin on my forehead in less than a week.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s been a little less than a week since I tried it.</li>
            <li> night, I just dab a little of the cream on both rashes and just out of habit, a little bit of the vaseline or Eucerin to seal it in.  </li>
            <li> Both before and after it was pulled off the shelves (and temporarily replaced with the epic fail replacement)  </li>
            <li> No creams, either OTC or prescription, have ever worked longer than a few months.</li>
            <li> I ordered some and it arrived in a few days.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to worry about the harsh chemicals or steroids in the creams that have been prescriped by her</li>
            <li> within a few days.</li>
            <li> Beware the Peru balsam may be a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product, but it is a harsh product.</li>
            <li> I read that Balsam of Peru, the active ingredient in this product, can be a common allergen.</li>
            <li> The dryness also made the skin on my eyelid feel tight, and as a result, the skin started to crack, which caused tiny painful open cuts on my eyelid.  </li>
            <li> Since she has had her ears pierced she has suffered from dry peeling skin behind her</li>
            <li> I also get dry patches behind my ears and this has worked wonders on that too.  </li>
            <li> Other reviews have mentioned this...but the reformulation is not a good thing.</li>
            <li> I was extremely skeptical about a botanical-based product having any effect on the itching-flaking-redness behind my ears due apparently to a yeast or fungal infection.</li>
            <li> After one night of a applying it a little thick it was almost resolved.  </li>
            <li> Not just does it look ugly, it just really itches and is unbearable.</li>
            <li> For the past year, I had been suffering from scaly, reddish skin around my eyes together with some itching.</li>
            <li> Sadly I must agree with the recent reviews.</li>
            <li> It would seem to get better and worst as time went on.</li>
            <li> It usually occurs during the winter months and it is a pain.</li>
            <li> Do your research before buying this waste of money!</li>
            <li> After doing some research on dry peeling painful eyelids on the web, I was led to this product after multiple people had suggested it.  </li>
            <li> The cream is velvety and thick and comes in a small container.  </li>
            <li> The new product BADLY damaged my skin.</li>
            <li> At some points my eyelids were cracked and bleeding and almost turned purple, so some damage remains on this delicate skin area.</li>
            <li> I seriously look like the Phantom of the Opera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It may have been a makeup allergy or the cold dry weather, but nonetheless I looked \\&quot;jacked up\\&quot; as my guy friend said</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t for this stuff I don&#x27;t know how much worse my eyelid could have gotten.  </li>
            <li> Had a skin problem behind my ear for a year.  </li>
            <li> [The steroids the doc prescribed did not work well and can thin skin over time].</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t help, and they seemed to make it worse and the redness and flakiness started under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad this product was forced out of existence.  </li>
            <li> Any how ill review in a week.&lt;br /&gt;O</li>

            <li> I had a rash there for months and this product made it worse!</li>
            <li> A very frustrating condition!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I was desperate for a cure.</li>
            <li> This company&#x27;s products are dangerous.</li>
            <li> Desperate for a solution</li>
            <li> I even tried it on a friend who suffers from psoriasis.</li>
            <li> But what can I say, I was desperate and bought it.</li>
            <li> read all the reviews raving about this stuff, and was very skeptical.</li>
            <li> It got so bad for awhile</li>
            <li> My son is a competitive swimmer and his eyelids would burn so bad when he got in the pool.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t go to my family&#x27;s Thanksgiving dinner because of how bad I looked.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Other reviews have mentioned this...but the reformulation is not a good thing. The company has pulled most of the jars from the market, but they missed the ones that were packaged together with other items (calma mask and a cream face wash). I had the control cream on my face for about 15 minutes. I now have raw red swellings all over my face. Called the company and let them know. They were not surprised, mentioned that it was pulled to be \\&quot;reformulated,\\&quot; and suggested two things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.Return the package, then repurchase the Calma Mask and Cream Soap. Sounds good, but why would I trust your other products at this point. I seriously look like the Phantom of the Opera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Brew some chamomile tea, chill it, and apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have loved and used Mario Badescu products for about 8 years. Think I&#x27;m going to be taking a break after I use up what I have--at least until I re-research their products and make sure nothing else has changed.</li>
            <li> I have found a miracle product. After 24 hours of applying this cream twice a day, my eyelids have returned back to normal. My eyelids very dry, flaky, red, and inflamed-nothing I have ever experienced before. It may have been a makeup allergy or the cold dry weather, but nonetheless I looked \\&quot;jacked up\\&quot; as my guy friend said and I was desperate for a cure. Luckily, I came upon this amazing product online and after reading excellent reviews, I hurried to the closest Nordstrom and bought one. I am so glad to have come upon this product and will definitely recommend it to anyone with dry and inflamed skin problems.  On a further note, I gave this to my mom to try on her flaky, itchy, and dry elbows. She has been experiencing this problem for twenty years and have never found a cure. After two days, she found the results to be favorable. She stopped itching and her elbows were looking better. She loved it so much she wouldn&#x27;t give it back to me! So I had to buy another one. But yes, it is a great product and a definite must try when your skin is encountering problems.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have stated (and where I learned about this) this was a miracle cream for red, itchy flaking skin on the eyelid.  After one night of a applying it a little thick it was almost resolved.  After the second night my eyelid was back to normal.</li>
            <li> For the past year, I had been suffering from scaly, reddish skin around my eyes together with some itching. This cream worked immediately. Completely gone!</li>
            <li> I actually picked this up in ULTA store; I wanted to see if I could get something (nonprescription) for the red, flaky skin I have due to rosacea. This cream (so far) is really working well. I also like the cleansing cream and toner. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I had tried everything from vaseline through baby oil though neosporin and prescription creams and nothing solved the intensely painful and scabby condition on my eyelid.  After three days of using this product, the rash, the scaly skin and the pain is gone.  Amazing.</li>
            <li> The Mario Badescu O.G. was the most miraculous skin product I&#x27;ve ever seen. It took away my extremely red, dry, flakey irratated skin all over my nose, and between my eyebrows. Both before and after it was pulled off the shelves (and temporarily replaced with the epic fail replacement)  I&#x27;ve been searching arduously and at long last found the ONLY product that has taken its stead: Kiehl&#x27;s &#x27;Midnight Recovery Concentrate.&#x27; I can&#x27;t guarantee results, as I don&#x27;t know what other people have and what they&#x27;re using it for. But my problem is horrifically chronic and I have used a panoply of products including a vast majority of both Kiehl&#x27;s and Mario Badescu&#x27;s OTHER products. THIS is IT. It also smells fantastic. I have also found it works quite nicely in tandem with Kiehl&#x27;s Youth Regenerating Heavy Cream. I realize I now sound like a Kiehl&#x27;s rep, but I assure you, I am not. In fact, just to prove it I will be neither the first, nor the last to say that until I found these two products, I have found Kiehl&#x27;s to be, by and large, offensively over priced.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream looking for a way to heal dryness around my eye which made the skin around my eye peel and swell up. Like many other reviewers on here stated, I have also tried everything you can name under the sun and although other products slightly relieved the symptoms, the problem still persisted. Then I stumbled upon Mario Badescus&#x27; cream and in a matter of days I saw a huge difference. I then started applying the cream on the eczema Ive had on my right hand for years and it helped with that too! My skin is so smooth and soft now, I&#x27;m so grateful to have found this cream and I recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> I used this product to help the rosacea problem I&#x27;ve had for the last few years.  Visiting the dermatologist, the medication he gave me did not do much to help calm the redness on my face.  Using the control cream really took away the redness in just a few days after use.  I used to use it every night, but now that my rosacea is under control I can get away with using it every other night or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a redness problem, maybe with rosacea, then try out this skin cream.</li>
            <li> Although this product is not formulated for or advertised to treat the under eye area, I read about this product helping others with a similar problem as mine and decided to give it a try.  I began to suffer with severe redness and peeling under my right eye - the eye doctor gave me a steroid ointment for blepharitis and it helped a little but the condition came back immediately.  After reading an online forum I realized I may have a yeast infection under my eye - so I applied an antifungal medication under my eye two times which cleared it up completely.  Afterwards I began to use this creme every day to keep the problem under control.  Recently I stopped using it to see if there was any change and the redness came right back.  I swear by this product and hope it helps others who suffer from this bizarre problem.  I was afraid I would never be able to wear eye makeup again and my eyes are back to normal and I know it&#x27;s from this cream.  I also advised my eye doctor so he could be able to help others with this strange condition.</li>
            <li> This company&#x27;s products are dangerous. Their Control Cream contained secret, unlabeled topical corticosteroids and many people suffered ill effects. You can read more about the Control Cream issue here: amazon.com/review/R2C14QW9V458VP There is a whole thread of people who found each other online who had severe reactions (please get in touch if you&#x27;re one of them!). I will be on antibiotics and prescribed topical preparations for at least two months as a direct result of using their product. This company is unethical and should be put out of business.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin in the t zone but my cheeks are always dry and sensitive and this cream is great for my cheeks when they get red or irritated. I love this cream anytime I put it on where redness occurs it takes out the redness and is not oily. I would highly recommend if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It all started with a tiny dry patch of skin on my right eyelid.  Over a period of four months, the tiny dry patch started to spread and worsened.  It got to a point where the dry skin on my eyelid looked swollen and red due to me constantly trying to peel the dry skin off.  The dryness also made the skin on my eyelid feel tight, and as a result, the skin started to crack, which caused tiny painful open cuts on my eyelid.  It was a nightmare.. I tried using moisturizers such as Cetaphill, aloe vera, and emu oil but all it did was reduce the dry flakiness and not the swelling and redness.  Desperate for a solution, I finally came across Mario Badescu Control Cream.  After a week of using it, the dryness disappeared and the redness and swelling reduced significantly!  My eyelid truly looks and feels like it&#x27;s back to normal!  If it wasn&#x27;t for this stuff I don&#x27;t know how much worse my eyelid could have gotten.  Thank you Mario Badescu!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad this product was forced out of existence.  It was the only thing that helped, and cured permanently, my dry cracked eylids.  I read the settlement at [...] and it looks to me like the attorneys plundered this company.  I&#x27;d like to see a poll of how many people were helped by this product and how many hurt.  As for me, I would definately be on the helped side.</li>
            <li> This cream is a miracle in a bottle for me.  I have been struggling for years with my eyes.  My eyelid gets itchy, swollen, and has been peeling on and off for years.  It got so bad for awhile I couldn&#x27;t even wear makeup.  I went to my dermotologist, she gave me a bunch of prescriptions to try (non steroid) nothing worked.  I tried everything you can try to no avail.  I was miserable!!  Then I read about this online, went to my local Ulta (they also have this at Nordstrom and Sephora) and no joke after one application of this my eye was 50% better, within 48 hours and 3 more applications my eye was completely normal again.  It has been perfect now for 3 months, I use it everyday on my eyes.  This is really a miracle cream.  Thank you SO much Mario Badescu!!</li>
            <li> I had an ongoing (over 4 mos.) eyelid severe redness/swelling problem that was a mystery to my doctors. I had never had anything like it before. I saw eye specialists, allergy specialists, about 12 doctor visits total - all seemed mystified. Steroid cremes, antibiotics, allergy meds were repeatedly prescribed and nothing really helped. My eyelids were itchy and the condition was very painful at times, even spreading to the undereye and my forehead. Sometimes the eyes were almost swollen half shut, so it affected my eyesight too. I finally ordered this cream and immediately got relief! I use it almost every day now a month later, or when my eyelids are red or itching.  I only wish I&#x27;d tried this soomer I would have saved a ton of money and perhaps not have damaged the skin so much on my eyelids. At some points my eyelids were cracked and bleeding and almost turned purple, so some damage remains on this delicate skin area. This cream is wonderful, calming the redness immediately from the first! I read that Balsam of Peru, the active ingredient in this product, can be a common allergen. So it might not work for everyone, but this is definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> Pretty much out of the blue, my eyes went from normal to swollen overnight and then the skin on my eyelids and under my eyes were chapped.  It was if my eyes had gotten a fever and then the skin started peeling around them.  They itched very badly as well and I suffer form allergies and thought maybe this was the problem.  I googled this condition and found several blogs where people talked about the same thing and how it just came out of the blue, overnight pretty much.  Everything I read, I was experiencing and I finally came across someone who specifically named this cream and how it worked fast and amazingly well.  I got onto Amazon and found it and ordered it immediately.  As soon as I received it, I applied several applications and my eyes were better over night.  I&#x27;ve continued to use it and I can say that after 3 days, my eyes looked normal again, the skin was no longer peeling and the itching had gone away almost instantly.  This amazing cream does not burn either, in fact, it&#x27;s very cooling to my eyes. Before I used this cream, I looked like I had aged 10 years and this cream took that away completely.  I recommend this cream to anyone with these symptoms, it&#x27;s amazing!  One more thing...I got several nice sized samples of Mario Badescu products with my order...very nice!  :o)</li>
            <li> My son had severe dry, red, peeling eyelids. I tried so many different creams over the past year, but nothing helped.I read all the reviews about this cream and decided to try it. I&#x27;m so glad I did. I starting putting this cream on his eyelids on Friday and by Monday his eyes look normal!  My son is a competitive swimmer and his eyelids would burn so bad when he got in the pool.I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have suffered from, dry, scaly, cracked eyelids off and on for years. No creams, either OTC or prescription, have ever worked longer than a few months. A very frustrating condition!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read all the reviews raving about this stuff, and was very skeptical. But eventually an extra-bad flareup convinced me to try it. So far, it&#x27;s worked GREAT! I&#x27;ve only been using it for a month though...time will tell if the effectiveness wears off!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after searching online forums. A strange skin condition had appeared on a family member&#x27;s eyelids which caused them to be very dry and cracked. This control cream had been recommended by many on the forum as the only thing that had brought relief (even moreso than prescription products). Our experience was the same. After only a few days of applying the cream, the skin was completely healed and smooth. I even tried it on a friend who suffers from psoriasis. It hepled ease her flare-ups as well. Everything about my experience with this company and their products (they sent samples of other products as well) has been amazing. I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> If you are using the retinol products, getting IPL done, getting microdermabrasion or using salicylic acid... your skin likely needs some TLC.  This creamy soothing product hydrates and calms, knocking out redness and dryness.  I use the lotion version in the summer and this one in the winter, because my skin is combo.  If you have dry or combo skin and are doing things to it to fight aging or break-outs, you will love treating it to this yummy cream.      And it doesn&#x27;t cost and arm and a leg, AND Badescu doesn&#x27;t test on animals.  So you can feel good AND look good.</li>
            <li> Just got this today hope it will help my red face ive tried so many with no success&lt;br /&gt;to many good reviews to not try it had lots of samples with the order which was nice&lt;br /&gt;but im afraid to use most things just make me reder is that a word.Any how ill review in a week.&lt;br /&gt;O THE 1 STAR WAS BECAUSE I HAD TO GIVE A RATING</li>
            <li> I suddenly experienced really dry skin, flaking and itching around my eyes. It was most definitely eczema: red, patchy, dry, itchy skin. I&#x27;ve never had anything like this in my 23 years of living so I was really distressed about this skin issue suddenly popping up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aquaphor was my first attempt at relief, but it&#x27;s moisturizing factor didn&#x27;t last and my eyes would become dry and itchy again. Putting on make-up was difficult because I didn&#x27;t want to irritate my skin, yet I didn&#x27;t want to look horrible either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was definitely up for anything after a few weeks of this eczema around my eyes. Through browsing google and forums, I came across really good reviews for this product and further positive reviews on Amazon. I was wondering, \\&quot;ok so what&#x27;s the hype about?\\&quot; so I ordered and in desperation did 2-day delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it&#x27;s been a little less than a week since I tried it. I noticed that upon immediate application, the area around my eyes seemed more soothed like its thirst had been quenched. It was unlike Aquaphor&#x27;s thickness, but it surpassed Aquaphor&#x27;s moisturizing capabilities. It&#x27;s about day 4 and my eye area is more cleared up than it has in weeks since my eczema started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is this greenish color that neutralizes the red areas of your skin. It&#x27;s pretty lightweight, non-scented and great for sensitive skin. It seems like a pretty good moisturizer so far and I&#x27;m very happy with the results!</li>
            <li> I had a stubborn rash on the inner part of my arm near my elbow. I tried antibiotic ointment, antifungal cream, and povidone iodine. Nothing worked. Then I realized that the rash might not be an infection, but instead might be an eczema-like reaction. I did some online research and found out about Mario Badescu Control Cream. I ordered some and it arrived in a few days. After a couple of applications, the cream cleared up the rash. I also have some dryness on my eyelids and around my nose and that was corrected even faster by this cream. This is an amazing product that lives up to all its positive reviews.</li>
            <li> This cream is not at all oily and does lessen the redness associated with inflammation. I apply it after the drying lotion or buffering lotion and let it sink in and then apply the seaweed night cream. Really leaves skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li> Finally something that helps my 12 year old daughter&#x27;s skin behind her ears. Since she has had her ears pierced she has suffered from dry peeling skin behind her ears.&lt;br /&gt;This cream is wonderful and I don&#x27;t have to worry about the harsh chemicals or steroids in the creams that have been prescriped by her doctors.&lt;br /&gt;It is the one thing we have found that actually has worked and is soothing.</li>
            <li> Bought this after it was recommended online by several people for irritated, dry, flaky skin on the eyelid. I had had this problem going on 1.5 years, with the skin on one lower eyelid becoming more and more noticeable swollen and flaky. After just three days of using this cream twice a day, the skin on my eyelid is essentially back to normal. I had used hydrocortisone 1% cream and even triamcinolone cream occasionally with some relief, but I also knew that long term use of steroids on the face wasn&#x27;t a good idea. This has really done the trick, and I&#x27;ll probably even be able to go to using this just once a day with good control. Best $17 I&#x27;ve spent on this problem.</li>
            <li> This product WAS an amazing solution to itchy, red, flaky skin on my face. Sadly I must agree with the recent reviews. The formula has definitely been changed. I&#x27;ve been using my newly received batch for the last two weeks, and none of the symptoms have gone away. Previously the cream would be a nearly over-night solution.</li>
            <li> I absolutely this product. It has changed my life. It moisturizes my skin without being greasy and controls my rosacea.</li>
            <li> Had a skin problem behind my ear for a year.  Read online, that someone else had used this product and it was successful.  They were right.  It was gone in two days and it never came back.</li>
            <li> I have had a patch of psoriasis on the back of my neck for a couple of years.  I went to the dermatologist and she prescribed a steroid cream, I have used that and it worked sometimes but when I ran out I didn&#x27;t want to go back for more because I didn&#x27;t think that using a steroid cream for an extended time would be good for me.  When my dry patch started acting up again I looked on the internet for a solution and came across this product.  I normally wouldn&#x27;t spend 18.00 for a half ounce of something but I had some Amazon credit so I used that.  I was pleasantly surprised when I got my product because they included a bunch of free gifts!  I started using the cream right away and within minutes I could feel a difference, also within a few days my patch was gone!  My neck didn&#x27;t itch at all!  I also get dry patches behind my ears and this has worked wonders on that too.  It is truly a miracle product, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Being one that typically does not write reviews I had to take the time to review this product.  After doing some research on dry peeling painful eyelids on the web, I was led to this product after multiple people had suggested it.  I tried pretty much everything else on the market and being without insurance and not sure whether to spend the money to go to the doctor, I decided to give this product a try first.  Turns out it was the best $20 I&#x27;ve spent in a long time.  It gave me almost instant relief and cleared up my issues within the first 3 days.  I would go as far as to call it a miracle cream,  it hasn&#x27;t completely cured the symptoms as they will come back in a couple of weeks if I stop using, but I am happy to apply every couple days to keep the symptoms at bay.  If you are suffering from this issue stop wasting your money on other products/doctor visits and give this one a try, I guarantee you will be satisfied!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had eczema problems for three years and due to starting taking Prolia for osteoporosis the side effect of eczema in my ears was extreme itching &amp; all the nastiness that goes with this problem. I read about this cream on an eczema website and in desperation tried it. [The steroids the doc prescribed did not work well and can thin skin over time]. Within 2 days my ears were healing and now continue to be dry and healthy. The cream dries up the rash but moisturizes the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I suppose time will tell if this is a long-lasting \\&quot;cure\\&quot;, but for now I am just thankful I found some relief.</li>
            <li> If I could, I&#x27;d be a spokesperson for this product! This cream has truly cured the rash on my eyelid that I have had for years...YEARS! I also have a similar rash above my lip area. For many of you who has globbed on vaseline, Eucerin, Vitamin E, coconut oil, olive oil and whatever else to moisturize the red, itchy, flaky, (mini paper cuts) rash (I know I did), Mario Badescu is the ONLY cream you need to get rid of it completely. I found Mario Badescu cream through a google search, while trying to find the cause of this never ending rash. I really thought I was never going to wear eye-make up again. After reading reviews and the instant results it had on other similar cases, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  Within DAYS, I saw improvement, redness went away and the smalls cuts from it being so dry near my tear duc and on my lid healed.  It&#x27;s been almost two weeks and so far it has not come back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At night, I just dab a little of the cream on both rashes and just out of habit, a little bit of the vaseline or Eucerin to seal it in.  In the morning I do the same, with the usual facial moisturizer, but without the vaseline.  I&#x27;m sure you can use the cream by itself, but I only use it on certain areas.  The cream is velvety and thick and comes in a small container.  I&#x27;d recommend this to anybody who has eczema and/or really dry/sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews for this product, while searching for help with red, swollen eyelids,&lt;br /&gt;I ordered and I am totally STUNNED at the results! My problems that had been&lt;br /&gt;stubborn, unsightly and painful - to the point my eyelids cracked and bled -&lt;br /&gt;for 6 weeks with NOTHING helping, were totally&lt;br /&gt;gone within a few days. Not only that but other areas on my face that I worked&lt;br /&gt;diligently at with moisturizers, masks, etc. cleared immediately. I am 64 and&lt;br /&gt;my face looks like I have had a facelift.  Even fine wrinkles and the most minor&lt;br /&gt;of blemishes are now gone.  I am THRILLED with Control Cream.</li>
            <li> read many great reviews. it did not sooth my eyes. in fact i could feel stinging. it certainly did not neutralize the irritation as well as the alba green tea eye gel. maybe a personal thing, but my high hopes for relief on the sore eyes from this product were not met. if you have read the many reviews and were eager for relief and this product did not work for you; you might try the alba product. what has worked best for me by far is ice. using a cube of ice on my eyes in the evening or when irritated has done the most to sooth them. you can also wrap the ice cube in a paper towel...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good luck!</li>
            <li> If you suffer from red, dry and cracked skin particulary around the eye area this stuff is amazing.  I tried everything with no success.  I read on the internet that someone tried this product and their condition was cleard up in 3 days.  I was skeptical but ordered Mario Badescu from Amazon.  And to my amazment I saw almost immediate improvement and w/i 3 days my condition was cleared up!&lt;br /&gt;If there were more stars I would have rated it a 10!</li>
            <li> I had developed an extreme crusty scaly dryness on my left eyelid.  I could literally lift off the scales with a tweezers.  This went on for months and none of the moisturizers I tried worked.  Then I started to see the beginning of the same on my right eyelid.  I definitely started to panic and I searched around on the net and kept seeing references to Mario Badescu products. It worked from the very first try. this stuff is AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li> This product completely healed my flaky, red, and painful upper eye lid - told it was dry eye, but NO relief from any other remedy including:  drops, ointments, or ANY other moisturizer.  Thank you Mario Badescu Control Creme!</li>
            <li> I was extremely skeptical about a botanical-based product having any effect on the itching-flaking-redness behind my ears due apparently to a yeast or fungal infection. Prescription meds had no effect. But Mario Badescu&#x27;s Control Cream really did the job! Symptoms abated in less than 7 days and were completely eliminated in 2 weeks! I have no side effects or contraindications. I was thoroughly pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> In July I had an eye infection, I was given antibiotic drops and it was gone.  Within a month I started noticing a flaky dry patch on my eye lid.  It would seem to get better and worst as time went on. I kept throwing away makeup thinking it was the cause.  One day in November I woke with my eyelids all puffy and swollen.  I had a discharge from my eyes.  I thought I had another infection, so I started using the drops again.  It didn&#x27;t help, and they seemed to make it worse and the redness and flakiness started under my eyes.  I had stopped wearing makeup and I looked hideous.  I didn&#x27;t go to my family&#x27;s Thanksgiving dinner because of how bad I looked.  I went to the eye doctor and he told me I had contact dermatitis and gave me an ointment with antibiotic and steroids in it.  It seemed to lessen the swelling, but really didn&#x27;t make it go away.  Then I started doing my own searching on the web.  I ran across a blog and two of the replies really resonated with me.  One was about the puffy scaly eyelids being a \\&quot;yeast infection\\&quot; in the eyes.  Candidiasis can rear it&#x27;s ugly head just about anywhere in the body and here I took antibiotics and didn&#x27;t start my probiotic afterward like I normally do because it was in drops form.  That reply recommended coconut oil for it&#x27;s anti-fungal properties and detoxing benefits.  I happened to have some of that and used it immediately.  It seemed to help with the puffiness and flaking, but the areas turned a nasty bright red.  I had ordered Mario Badescu Control Cream as a back up and tried that as soon as I opened the box.  By the time my husband came home that night he said I looked a lot better.  Today I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s 75% cleared up.  I also stopped at the store and purchased some probotic because I believe just controlling the symptom, doesn&#x27;t make it a cure.  I wish I had tried this cream first, because I would have enjoyed the holidays a lot more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend for anyone with the same problem!</li>
            <li> First, let me say, I never ever write reviews. NEVER. But here is the thing, this cream is AMAZING!!! I have been suffering from scaly, burning, red and flaky skin around my eyes all my life. It usually occurs during the winter months and it is a pain. Not just does it look ugly, it just really itches and is unbearable. I tried EVERYTHING out there. From super expensive so called &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; creams to home remedies mixed out of honey and various other mixes. Nothing helped. So I&#x27;ve searched the internet for about the five thousands time and stumbled upon a rave review about Mario Badescu&#x27;s Control Cream. I thought, yeah sure, another scam that won&#x27;t to anything. But what can I say, I was desperate and bought it. I tried it and it gave me right away relief from this constant itching. Three days later (I&#x27;ve used it in the mornings and before bed) my skin cleared up completely and there is NO sign whatsoever of me ever having any problems with my skin. And I have to repeat, my skin looked awful. I thought I will have to live with broken, flaky, wrinkly skin around my eyes for life. This cream is truly magic!! I used it for 3 days and ever since my skin is healthy again. I didn&#x27;t even have to use the cream again. If you want lasting relief, this cream is what you should buy!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This cream cleared up the scaly skin on my forehead in less than a week.  It&#x27;s the only cream I&#x27;ve tried that works so well and so quickly!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, pale skin that is prone to blotchiness and redness.  I wouldn&#x27;t say I have rosacea, but it&#x27;s definitely something similar.  I have been trying out the Mario Badescu line of products and came upon this one -- I must say that I absolutely love it.  I use it after I cleanse and tone my face at night in place of a moisturizer (it&#x27;s quite rich) and in the morning, my face is so much more even and the redness has come down considerably since I&#x27;ve started using it.  I&#x27;ve used it nightly for about a week and it hasn&#x27;t broken me out or caused any irritation, so I&#x27;m one happy girl!  I&#x27;d give this a try if your skin is similar to mine and needs to calm down a little!</li>
            <li> I bought this product about a month after having an allergic reaction to a face cleaner. It left me with redness and irritation around the eyes and one spot on my face. I had found some products that helped, but nothing that took care of the issue. Within three days of using this product, the problem was taken care of. I won&#x27;t be without this in the future.</li>
            <li> this stuff really works!  Too bad it is not longer produced.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  I use this twice a day, before my regular face creams.  It has healed my dry, flaky eyelids.  i will keep using it.  A little dab goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This product has changed recently. Cause redness, swelling, pustules, itchiness and pain. Do not use this. Has always been an awesome product until now. Very upset with the company.</li>
            <li> This is a great cream and goes a long way!  I use it to help with my flair ups of Psoriasis....It works well!  This was a Good Transaction!</li>
            <li> UPDATE TO ORIGINAL POST (See original post below):  Control Cream has been pulled from the market because it is believed that it contained undisclosed corticosteroids. And if you can find someone selling the &#x27;old&#x27; formula (pre-March 2013), DO NOT purchase it!!! Or if you are still using the old formula, STOP!! For all of you who are new here and suffering from what you think is a &#x27;reaction&#x27; to the &#x27;new formula&#x27; (Mario Badescu &#x27;reformulated&#x27; Control Cream--i.e., likely removed the working ingredients, the corticosteroids--in Feb/Mar 2013), be aware that you are likely suffering from topical corticosteroid withdrawal (TCW) as it is firmly believed that this very deceitful, unethical company had been adding undisclosed corticosteroids to both its Control Cream and Healing Cream, both of which the company is no longer selling. In short, you have been applying harmful, addictive corticosteroids to your face!!! THIS is why these products worked so very well for your ailments!! BUT corticosteroids are intended to be used for only 14 days maximum! (And some corticosteroids, the ones suspected to have been added to Control Cream and Healing Cream, should NEVER BE APPLIED TO THE FACE!) When used for long periods of time, corticosteroids can cause irreparable damage to the skin.  And when corticosteroids are abruptly stopped, the skin will respond most negatively (redness, blistering, burning, stinging, itching, pustules, papules, dryness, etc.), sound familiar?

Google FDA Medwatch and report!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***ORIGINAL COMMENT ***. This used to be a great product, and it was my &#x27;holy grail&#x27;, but very recently (early 2013) the company changed the formula WITHOUT informing it&#x27;s loyal customers. The new product BADLY damaged my skin. Find me @RustiResta on Twitter where I posted photos of my face after using the new Control Cream. I&#x27;m going on week 4 now..been seen by 3 different docs and spent $$$ on them and meds. Do Not Buy this! I will NEVER purchase anything from this irresponsible company again.going on week 4 now..been seen by 3 different docs and spent $$$ on them and meds. Do Not Buy this!

            <li> for years i&#x27;ve struggled with eczema and sporadic dry skin patches on my face. i opted to stop using steroid creams since, like many of the other reviewers, the problem areas were by my eyes and mouth. this cream not only heals but really soothes your skin - you can see and feel a difference in just a day. i even got my brother into it! i recommend this cream to anyone with eczema.</li>
            <li> After all the wonderful reviews, i decided to try this under my eyes. I had a rash there for months and this product made it worse! Instantly it burned and made it it chief than ever! Beware the Peru balsam may be a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product, but it is a harsh product. Do your research before buying this waste of money!</li>
