    <ol>
            <li> While I absolutely love love love the scent of this line of products I find the shower gel lacks the luxury foam of other equally priced shower gel. When I use bath and bodyworks or philosophy products a dime sized bit of the soap on my mesh shower poofy gives mountains of foamy luxurious suds. The Victoria&#x27;s Secret shower soap suds requires me to use much more and it still does not perform like others that I pay a relatively similar price. The aroma is great but even layering the products it doesn&#x27;t have the staying power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If these things matter to you, well then this review will assist you on your choice. That being said I still love the scent even with low staying power.</li>
            <li> The product is exactly what I needed for a great smell, price, and pick me up.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for providing me with this fancy shower gel!</li>
            <li> I use the body wash, body spray, and lotion. The fragrance is absolutely unbeatable and amazing!</li>
            <li> Smells delicious. Love it.</li>
            <li> I continue to order this...the scent is beautiful and I adore the product!</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loves VS and this great deal makes it so easy to take care of her VS fix!</li>
            <li> I received Victoria Secret Love Spell body wash and hand and body cream for a Christmas gift and it&#x27;s now my favorite scent. I gave it a 5 star rating because there is nothing I do not like about it. It smells great with no heavy perfume stench so I can use it first thing in the morning.  I get compliments all day, &amp;#34;you smell good.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Smells great use it everyday!!!</li>
            <li> I love any Victoria&#x27;s Secret Fragrance. I use the body wash everyday and it leaves my skin soft and the scent lasts just like perfume would.</li>
            <li> Just like the original product, only in a more convenient package and easy home delivery instead of a trip to the mall. Not fruity and not an antique smell.</li>
            <li> I use Victoria Secret for quite a long time. And these series have never disappointed me. The quality is good, smell is perfect and the price is not high.</li>
            <li> I absolutely 1,000,000% LOVE THIS!!!!!  Love Spell has beeea favorite scent of mine for over 15 years and it smells just as now as it did when I first used it like 15 years ago!!! I LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> I like this mist but for me the scent does not last for long. Other wise it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scent and this body wash! Fantastic smell...</li>
            <li> not the smell I imagined, I use the spray version of this and the body wash, although it smells good, is definitely not the same and smells more like soap than fragrance.</li>
