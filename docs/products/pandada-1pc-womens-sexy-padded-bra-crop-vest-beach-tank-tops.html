            <li>I know the cost was cheap</li>
            <li>Did not even fit correctly.</li>
            <li>The material is discusting and it&#x27;s so cheap that there is no point on wearing it.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made</li>

            <li>Cheaply Made, but you get what you pay for &amp; this is ecactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Took forever to arrive and doesn&#x27;t fit well at all.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t fit well.</li>
            <li>cheap.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t fit me</li>
            <li>but hey it was cheap af</li>
            <li>So cheap, save yourself from buying.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable, just too large for me, so I gave it to a friend.</li>
            <li>I am a 34A and this doesn&#x27;t fit me at all but at 4$ it was worth the try.</li>
            <li>Cool for around the house</li>
            <li>A very lightweight top.</li>
            <li>just doesnt fit right</li>
            <li>n didnt fit right at all</li>
            <li>Still enjoy the item very much.</li>
            <li>Pretty cheaply made.</li>
            <li>It runs small and its dainty.  </li>
            <li>Worth what I paid for, which was about $4.</li>
            <li>Is it worth the buy ?</li>
            <li>My 7 year old could sew better.</li>
            <li>None of the stitching is finished and what appeared to be a nice clean attachment on the top of the back is actually strings just folded over another strings so they can slide and twist around.</li>
            <li>So, that says it right there.</li>
            <li>cheaply made but still cute, we shall see how long it lasts!</li>
            <li>Walmart sells a $5 bikini top with multicolor straps and black body that is so much better.</li>
            <li>Super cute but its way too big</li>
            <li>I just ordered it in white because it&#x27;s cheap and works fine under tank tops.</li>
            <li>Very cute but, very cheaply made one side is bigger then the other.  </li>
            <li>Super cute top unfortunately it runs a kinase big size wise.</li>
            <li>I love the back though</li>
            <li>the picture on the site that shows a cute back with lots of straps doesn&#x27;t exactly look like that.</li>
            <li>BUT if you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;re buying this for the cute strappy back because you cannot go 100% braless.</li>
            <li>Really cute although it looks like it may be tangled in the back when it arrived.</li>
            <li>The back does look lovely in open shirts tho, so it&#x27;s not horrible.</li>
            <li>like the product, can&#x27;t wait to wear it on a hot sunny day, wish it had arrived sooner.</li>
            <li>First, it takes forever to arrive.</li>
            <li>at all supportive enough for someone with C cup.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made nothing like the pictures very loose fit.</li>
            <li>To large for me I&#x27;m 32A</li>
            <li>I can still wear it over other bras to give the illusion of a cool scrappy bra, but would not be comfortable wearing this piece by itself.</li>
            <li>so if you&#x27;re smaller it&#x27;s going to be huge.</li>
            <li>It is going straight to the trash.</li>
            <li>Very flimsy.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t imagine it working/being comfortable for anyone larger than a B.</li>
            <li>This is much better quality than expected</li>
            <li>I was very unsatisfied with this order</li>
            <li>Very flimsy and when I tried to return it</li>
            <li>I found out the shipping cost is almost 3x as much as the item.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t complain to much seeing as I didn&#x27;t pay that much for it</li>
            <li>Very similar to free people but</li>
            <li>It is very confortable.</li>
            <li>Its cute, not very fitted.</li>
            <li>Looks like absolute s</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t have much expectation considering the price.</li>
            <li>The material on this bra is very stretchy</li>
            <li>Love the back of this bra, the padding is super cheap and hard</li>
            <li>but overall it&#x27;s worth the buy!</li>
            <li>Made very cheap and not worth your money.</li>
            <li>Very cheap quality, not worth the money at all..</li>
            <li>Strange fit.</li>
            <li>the length of the straps was too short causing the whole top to sit above where it is supposed to.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clearer bad quality and a refund is more than fair</li>
            <li>It is not really padded so you have to have natural boobs:)</li>
            <li>The quality isn&#x27;t so bad, the back is amazingly cute the padding isn&#x27;t great</li>
            <li>I can see how it would be fun to wear in the bedroom, but not practical underneath clothing if you are planning to go out in public.</li>
            <li>but i wasted time waiting on this to not even be able to wear it.</li>
            <li>so i couldn&#x27;t get the back to lay right.</li>
            <li>It looks cute from the back, yes, but it&#x27;s loose,</li>
            <li>Really not a great fit, but it was cheap</li>
            <li>Very professional company.</li>
            <li>When I first put it on I noticed that the 2 cups are completely different sizes!</li>
            <li>I ordered a small and it fits more like a med</li>
            <li>Not good for anyone with any kind of chest at all.</li>
            <li>The shirt is to large, and it has zero support around your middle.</li>
            <li>but the fitting of the bra is really awkward looking and doesn&#x27;t fit well.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money thus is so cheaply made I think</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s swim suit material, which doesn&#x27;t bother me since Id wear it under clothes, the thing is tho, it rides up really far in the front..</li>
            <li>Cute but very small.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a huge deal for me because I have a small chest.</li>
            <li>so I am not sure who this would fit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not small and it is big, if I lift up my arms I&#x27;d be flashing everyone.</li>
            <li>Way too big, it was not a small by any means.</li>
            <li>Very cheap, poorly made.</li>
            <li>Only if you have really small boobs and want to be comfortable</li>
            <li>No support at all and the cups that are inside barely move.</li>
            <li>the material is not what was expected and padding is really flimsy,</li>
            <li>Fits kind of weird.</li>
            <li>so the fact that the large didn&#x27;t cover my boobs as well was a bit of a let down</li>
            <li>i little small but is ok</li>
            <li>Loose threads, loose seams, very unfinished, I could have made this myself.</li>
            <li>Very disappointed- super low quality and doesn&#x27;t fit right at all.</li>
            <li>Does not fit well - too large</li>
            <li>The band is super loose and not supportive and</li>

            <li> The shirt is to large, and it has zero support around your middle.</li>
            <li> but the fitting of the bra is really awkward looking and doesn&#x27;t fit well.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money thus is so cheaply made I think</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s swim suit material, which doesn&#x27;t bother me since Id wear it under clothes, the thing is tho, it rides up really far in the front..</li>
            <li> Cute but very small.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a huge deal for me because I have a small chest.</li>
            <li> so I am not sure who this would fit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not small and it is big, if I lift up my arms I&#x27;d be flashing everyone.</li>
            <li> Way too big, it was not a small by any means.</li>
            <li> Very cheap, poorly made.</li>
            <li> Only if you have really small boobs and want to be comfortable</li>
            <li> No support at all and the cups that are inside barely move.</li>
            <li> the material is not what was expected and padding is really flimsy,</li>
            <li> Fits kind of weird.</li>
            <li> so the fact that the large didn&#x27;t cover my boobs as well was a bit of a let down</li>
            <li> i little small but is ok</li>
            <li> Loose threads, loose seams, very unfinished, I could have made this myself.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed- super low quality and doesn&#x27;t fit right at all.</li>
            <li> Does not fit well - too large</li>
            <li> The band is super loose and not supportive and</li>
            <li> The padding is really boxy and stiff and makes it look like your boobs are square.  </li>
            <li> The padding is flat.</li>
            <li> The middle strap in the back is too short so the other straps are baggie</li>
            <li> Way too loose and big.  </li>
            <li> the back goes way up and is kinda loose.</li>
            <li> I rated this 5 stars because I wear a 38D so the likelihood of this item not fitting was high.</li>
            <li> Way bigger than expected</li>
            <li> The material is soft but you can see the round padding that is stitched into the cups through the material.</li>
            <li> Only reason I didn&#x27;t contact for a refund is because I don&#x27;t want to waste my time sending it back.</li>
            <li> Not flattering on petite small breasted figures that can be easily overpowered by poorly designed and ill-fitting clothing.</li>
            <li> On the top pf that, very, very, very poor quality!</li>
            <li> Too loose.</li>
            <li> does not fit for small or large breasted women.  </li>
            <li> Uncomfortable, cheap material, not worth it.</li>
            <li> the padding was crooked and all the strappy parts were way too big :/</li>
            <li> This is too small, but if it had an elastic round the bottom I could possibly pull it off if only the back were to show.</li>
            <li> Was a little bigger than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> It was way too big, baggy, and had little to no elastic support.</li>
            <li> A little big</li>
            <li> A little on the big side</li>
            <li> Dudes are very loose.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> Will not fit anything above a B cup.</li>
            <li> Really not what I expected.</li>
            <li> so I guess I should have expected that</li>
            <li> Very very loose.</li>
            <li> very loose.</li>
            <li> (Pictured is front and back as well as the raw edges fully exposed)</li>
            <li> way too small and not equal to the inagen</li>
            <li> Should have expected that!</li>
            <li> I ordered a small but it is too big</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a little loose.</li>
            <li> The strings in the top hang weird and it looks like it might be poorly made.</li>
            <li> but the cups are average size</li>
            <li> The quality is not great and it offers no support</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little bit skinner than average</li>
            <li> The fit is terrible - way too big.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Terrible jersey silk kind of material.</li>
            <li> The cups on this are thick and sewn down so you can&#x27;t adjust them</li>
            <li> with the raw edges hanging below the bottom band.</li>
            <li> Product really disappointed me, came very late, doesn&#x27;t fit like it should, looks NOTHING like the picture</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a small girl and</li>
            <li> As this is an item from Asia, the sizing is extremely small (if you read reviews, you will know this).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect some stellar lululemon or brandi melville quality and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Sorry I purchased this, will think it through next time.</li>
            <li> Way too small.</li>
            <li> Should be a size but small</li>
            <li> really small, ill-fitting</li>
            <li> The bottom doesn&#x27;t hold at all and even though I have fairly small breasts, they still kept falling out.</li>
            <li> Too small.</li>
            <li> and usually I am s medium.</li>
            <li> however I will say it was just a tad too small for me.</li>
            <li> This bra is very narrow across the front.  </li>
            <li> Not very good quality.</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m pulling it down every 5 mins, which is irritating.</li>
            <li> Please i do not recommend at all even though it is not expensive it is not worth your money or the wait Horrible material, arrived almost a month after purchase, the bralette was even ripped when i opened the package, not supportive at all, looks nothing like pictures</li>
            <li> Quality actually sucks.</li>

            <li> I am a 34A and this doesn&#x27;t fit me at all but at 4$ it was worth the try. It&#x27;s too big in the cups. I love the back though so I will try to rig up something. Customer service is prompt and nice to deal.</li>
            <li> Quality actually sucks. I have to alter it to actually fit me, the material does not hold its shape/hold you in...</li>
            <li> way too small and not equal to the inagen</li>
            <li> Was a little bigger than I thought it would be. Dudes are very loose.</li>
            <li> Is not what I was expecting quality is really bad</li>
            <li> this does not have any kind of support or whatsoever. The padding is flat. Total waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> Love it! Fits as good as it feels! Will order again, soon! Gotta have the white!</li>
            <li> Awful. The fit is terrible - way too big. The padding is really boxy and stiff and makes it look like your boobs are square.  The band is super loose and not supportive and the picture on the site that shows a cute back with lots of straps doesn&#x27;t exactly look like that. It&#x27;s like floppy strips of tee shirt material sort of sagging between your shoulders and back. Def don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> Awfull! Slopily sewed. Had to throw away.</li>
            <li> Very poorly made. I just threw it out.</li>
            <li> Fits kind of weird. I&#x27;m a 32 b and it&#x27;s a little loose. Cool for around the house but it&#x27;s always moving around. Still nice looking.</li>
            <li> CHEAP and POORLY FITTED</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly love it</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t have any elastic in the  bottom so it doesn&#x27;t stay in play. It was cheap so I didn&#x27;t expect perfect but this is unwearable. Very unhappy. It is going straight to the trash.</li>
            <li> Product really disappointed me, came very late, doesn&#x27;t fit like it should, looks NOTHING like the picture</li>
            <li> Terrible Quality and Does not give any support</li>
            <li> Way too loose and big.  I&#x27;m a D cup, so I thought I&#x27;d fill it, but no way - I have to wear a regular bra underneath, which defeats the purpose.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying unless you know how to sew and are prepared to make drastic alterations to this piece. It was way too big, baggy, and had little to no elastic support. Not flattering on petite small breasted figures that can be easily overpowered by poorly designed and ill-fitting clothing. I took all these possibilities into consideration before purchasing, considering how inexpensive it was I figured I would give it a shot. So I guess my expectations were met...</li>
            <li> Very comfortable, just too large for me, so I gave it to a friend.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed- super low quality and doesn&#x27;t fit right at all.</li>
            <li> Poor quality. Should have expected that! What a joke of a product.</li>
            <li> Very flimsy. Sewn edges are frayed. Will not fit anything above a B cup.</li>
            <li> Pretty cheaply made. Don&#x27;t recommend because your boobs will pop out</li>
            <li> Terrible, crappy fabric, not tight, waste of money</li>
            <li> Love the back of this bra, the padding is super cheap and hard so I took it out with a pair of scissors fits a thousand times better.</li>
            <li> Horrible quality. I&#x27;m a small girl and the length of the straps was too short causing the whole top to sit above where it is supposed to. Uncomfortable, cheap material, not worth it. I rate it below one star.</li>
            <li> Runs big. Had to sew it to make it smaller. I wear a 34D.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok for the price. When I first put it on I noticed that the 2 cups are completely different sizes! It wasn&#x27;t a huge deal for me because I have a small chest. This also doesnt offer any support so I can&#x27;t imagine it working/being comfortable for anyone larger than a B. I just ordered it in white because it&#x27;s cheap and works fine under tank tops.</li>
            <li> Does not fit well - too large</li>
            <li> If you are any bigger than 34B, maybe even a 32C, I would reccommend not buying this product. As this is an item from Asia, the sizing is extremely small (if you read reviews, you will know this). The quality is not great and it offers no support BUT if you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;re buying this for the cute strappy back because you cannot go 100% braless. Don&#x27;t expect some stellar lululemon or brandi melville quality and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It runs small and its dainty.  Very hard to put on.</li>
            <li> Worth what I paid for, which was about $4. So, that says it right there.</li>
            <li> This is much better quality than expected</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. There is literally no structure to this bra. I can see how it would be fun to wear in the bedroom, but not practical underneath clothing if you are planning to go out in public. I am a small cup, a 34B to be exact, and it was unflattering even on me. It&#x27;s a one size fits all so if you&#x27;re smaller it&#x27;s going to be huge.</li>
            <li> To big look nothing like the picture</li>
            <li> Very poorly made. Loose threads, loose seams, very unfinished, I could have made this myself. Theres a reason the picture doexnt show the front of it either... Walmart sells a $5 bikini top with multicolor straps and black body that is so much better. As sad as that is to say. Sorry I purchased this, will think it through next time.</li>
            <li> Way too small. No support.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made, no elastic. This is too small, but if it had an elastic round the bottom I could possibly pull it off if only the back were to show. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product</li>
            <li> Super cute top unfortunately it runs a kinase big size wise.</li>
            <li> I 36 c this fit me i little small but is ok</li>
            <li> Cute but very small. Should be a size but small</li>
            <li> Terrible! The shirt is to large, and it has zero support around your middle. Meaning your breasts will fall out or slip out, even if you have B cups like I do:/</li>
            <li> really small, ill-fitting</li>
            <li> Do not get this item, poor material used and does not fit well at all!</li>
            <li> Came torn!!! Literally falling apart. It&#x27;s clearer bad quality and a refund is more than fair</li>
            <li> Sizes run big. I ordered a small and it fits more like a med</li>
            <li> wife looks great in it</li>
            <li> It is not really padded so you have to have natural boobs:)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money thus is so cheaply made I think or I got some string am see through material I could make the top.</li>
            <li> Way bigger than expected</li>
            <li> Sadly does not look cute in person. The material is soft but you can see the round padding that is stitched into the cups through the material. Overall it was too big so i couldn&#x27;t get the back to lay right.</li>
            <li> Very professional company. I&#x27;ll recommend them any time.</li>
            <li> does not fit for small or large breasted women.  the cups are sewn in awkwardly so it looks lumpy and your boob hangs out the side.  Not made for humans.</li>
            <li> I was not very happy with this product and will be returning it. The bottom doesn&#x27;t hold at all and even though I have fairly small breasts, they still kept falling out.</li>
            <li> Very cute but, very cheaply made one side is bigger then the other.  It looks like something my daughter could have made in class.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> too big... not well represented in pictures</li>
            <li> This bra is very narrow across the front.  Im a 32 or 34 and it didn&#x27;t reach across front.  Very cute though.</li>
            <li> Horrible, just horrible</li>
            <li> this is terrible.  there is no elastic and no support.</li>
            <li> Super cute but its way too big</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit well at all, I thew it away after one use</li>
            <li> No support at all and the cups that are inside barely move. However, to be fair I did not expect much support wise. i wanted the back design which I got. i will wear it under a shirt that has a build in bra.</li>
            <li> The s***tiest I have ever bought. The padding is horrible and the back looks nothing like the picture. Made very cheap and not worth your money.</li>
            <li> they dont support anything more than an A cup</li>
            <li> Very poor quality. No support and runs really big. I can still wear it over other bras to give the illusion of a cool scrappy bra, but would not be comfortable wearing this piece by itself.</li>
            <li> I am a double D and it fits perfectly! Super stylish and looks awesome under a sheerish loose fitted t-shirt</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made. Too big around but the cups are average size so I am not sure who this would fit. Would have helped if it was elastic.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this if your looking for any kind of support. It looks cute from the back, yes, but it&#x27;s loose, has zero elasticity and my boobs practically hang out of it at the bottom.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t fit at all like promised in the picture. I was very unsatisfied with this order</li>
            <li> Looks nothing like the picture. Very flimsy and when I tried to return it I found out the shipping cost is almost 3x as much as the item. Waste of money. Really not what I expected.</li>
            <li> small and poorly sowed.</li>
            <li> Really not a great fit, but it was cheap so you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Is it worth the buy ?</li>
            <li> Very cheap and light weight. Easy to rip and no support. A little big</li>
            <li> I liked it. I don&#x27;t have the biggest boobs so the fact that the large didn&#x27;t cover my boobs as well was a bit of a let down but I can&#x27;t complain to much seeing as I didn&#x27;t pay that much for it</li>
            <li> My daughter likes this is comfortable to her</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s swimsuit material like, I just took the pads off! Very similar to free people but 18 bucks cheaper lol I got a lot of compliments!</li>
            <li> When I received this I thought it was a joke. My 7 year old could sew better. Terrible jersey silk kind of material. Not good for anyone with any kind of chest at all. (Pictured is front and back as well as the raw edges fully exposed)</li>
            <li> I love it. It fits well</li>
            <li> just doesnt fit right the back goes way up and is kinda loose.</li>
            <li> It is very confortable.</li>
            <li> Too small. Can&#x27;t be bigger than an A cup.</li>
            <li> Very cheap quality, not worth the money at all.. the padding was crooked and all the strappy parts were way too big :/</li>
            <li> Very bad quality. Too loose. Does not stay in place. Very disappointed</li>
            <li> Its cute, not very fitted.</li>
            <li> the material is not what was expected and padding is really flimsy,</li>
            <li> None of the stitching is finished and what appeared to be a nice clean attachment on the top of the back is actually strings just folded over another strings so they can slide and twist around. The cups on this are thick and sewn down so you can&#x27;t adjust them and they stand out like crazy. Each of the back strings is an unfinished looped piece of fabric attached with about two stitches. with the raw edges hanging below the bottom band. All in all it didn&#x27;t cost a lot but i wasted time waiting on this to not even be able to wear it.</li>
            <li> Really cute although it looks like it may be tangled in the back when it arrived. The strings in the top hang weird and it looks like it might be poorly made. Kept riding up my boobs when I wore it</li>
            <li> Not very good quality. The price reflects the product. Kept riding up. Won&#x27;t stay in place</li>
            <li> cheap material and doesn&#x27;t fit as shown</li>
            <li> My daughter is a 34 b. It fit ok. It&#x27;s not adjustable but it still wasnt baggy to the point where her boobs are revealed.</li>
            <li> Cute, but no support. Not for bigger women.</li>
            <li> If I could give this no stars I would. It&#x27;s like they didn&#x27;t even try and finish the product. Looks like absolute s***. Threw it away the second I got it.</li>
            <li> This product just looks cheap, &amp; yes I know the cost was cheap so I guess I should have expected that but the fitting of the bra is really awkward looking and doesn&#x27;t fit well. I&#x27;m a little bit skinner than average so it&#x27;s not the shape of my body just the material of the cloth.</li>
            <li> size are  label wrong, the small should be xs</li>
            <li> Did not even fit correctly. Very disappointed. Only reason I didn&#x27;t contact for a refund is because I don&#x27;t want to waste my time sending it back.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE quality, I can&#x27;t even wear it. Don&#x27;t buy anything from this vendor!    Lopsided and the strings aren&#x27;t the correct length.</li>
            <li> Cute, but zero support. I&#x27;m not small and it is big, if I lift up my arms I&#x27;d be flashing everyone. But will be nice under a strappy tank or something.</li>
            <li> The middle strap in the back is too short so the other straps are baggie and it cannot be worn, bummer. I know it was a cheep item but still!</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Very cheap, poorly made. Strange fit.</li>
            <li> Very poorly made and falling apart when I got it. Also WAY too big</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s swim suit material, which doesn&#x27;t bother me since Id wear it under clothes, the thing is tho, it rides up really far in the front.. I feel like I&#x27;m pulling it down every 5 mins, which is irritating. The back does look lovely in open shirts tho, so it&#x27;s not horrible. But you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> To large for me I&#x27;m 32A</li>
            <li> This is just horrible . The material is discusting and it&#x27;s so cheap that there is no point on wearing it.</li>
            <li> like the product, can&#x27;t wait to wear it on a hot sunny day, wish it had arrived sooner.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made but I didn&#x27;t have much expectation considering the price.</li>
            <li> Not like the picture n didnt fit right at all</li>
            <li> Very poorly made. I just threw it out!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered a small but it is too big and usually I am s medium. One wrong move it comes up and showed everything.</li>
            <li> Very nice item. Light weight... however I will say it was just a tad too small for me. I rated this 5 stars because I wear a 38D so the likelihood of this item not fitting was high. Not the seller fault. Still enjoy the item very much.</li>
            <li> The bra is very comfortable.  I purchased it for a more dressy looking design for backless tops or dresses and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even think to buy this! First, it takes forever to arrive. Second, &amp;#34;one size fits all&amp;#34; but its too big, and won&#x27;t give any support. On the top pf that, very, very, very poor quality!</li>
            <li> Cheaply Made, but you get what you pay for &amp; this is ecactly what I wanted. A very lightweight top.</li>
            <li> It moves up when I lift my arms up so my boobs kind of hang out, and it&#x27;s not the easiest to be flexible in.</li>
            <li> Terrible quality. Very very loose. I will be throwing it away.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made nothing like the pictures very loose fit. Would not east your money on this</li>
            <li> This was a piece of crap fell apart as soon as I opened it very disappointing</li>
            <li> Please i do not recommend at all even though it is not expensive it is not worth your money or the wait Horrible material, arrived almost a month after purchase, the bralette was even ripped when i opened the package, not supportive at all, looks nothing like pictures</li>
            <li> Thread was falling to pieces! Took forever to arrive and doesn&#x27;t fit well at all. It&#x27;s more or a slip than a bra.( No support! Can&#x27;t wear it as a bra!)</li>
            <li> With all due respect product quality is horrible, nothing to do with photos.</li>
            <li> This was not quite what I hoped for.&lt;br /&gt;Not at all supportive enough for someone with C cup.</li>
            <li> Poorly made. Fell apart before I could even try it on</li>
            <li> There were two rips in my bralet. It&#x27;s cheap and was not in good condition. I didn&#x27;t want to spend money sending it back so I haven&#x27;t even worn it yet</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t fit well. very loose. cheap.</li>
            <li> Way too big, it was not a small by any means.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very comfortable feels like you have nothing on! The quality isn&#x27;t so bad, the back is amazingly cute the padding isn&#x27;t great but overall it&#x27;s worth the buy! 😊</li>
            <li> It is not a good quality i wouldn&#x27;t recommended it. Only if you have really small boobs and want to be comfortable yes, if your boobs are big they will pop out!</li>
            <li> cheaply made but still cute, we shall see how long it lasts!</li>
            <li> The material on this bra is very stretchy it doesn&#x27;t fit me I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> This item is a piece of shxttttttt I am mad but hey it was cheap af</li>
            <li> A little on the big side but I am wearing it okay.</li>
            <li> Looked nothing like the picture. It was way thicker and poor quality. It felt like plastic and hung off because it was so poorly made. So cheap, save yourself from buying.</li>
