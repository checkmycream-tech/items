            <li>Been using this product over three years now, works great for cleaning bacteria off the tongue.</li>
            <li>Tongue scraper is great</li>
            <li>They sell it here on Amazon and its great.</li>
            <li>Truly a good product for tongue care.</li>
            <li>your&#x27;e all good, so unsure of why this happens.</li>
            <li>I, THANK THE GOOD LORD GOD, have found &amp;#34;Tung Gel&amp;#34; and a tongue brush with a scraper.</li>
            <li>Good price</li>
            <li>So, let me just start out by saying that I&#x27;ve been using these tongue scrapers for many years now to good degrees of effectiveness.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Best for long days and good breath</li>
            <li>Provides a good clean taste that lasts.  </li>
            <li>great, easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>Best and only product of its kind.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>This is the sure thing.</li>
            <li>I bought most of their products.  </li>
            <li>I love it, come with 2 scrappers.</li>
            <li>Be sure to spray on your teeth too before brushing.</li>
            <li>the spray may or may not work better for tongue scraping</li>
            <li>Love the tongue scrapers.</li>
            <li>I was unmoved, at best, as to how useful a spray would be in getting that gunk off when the scrapers were already doing fine, but I suppose I was in a good enough mood and bought the set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It should be as easy to buy as toothepaste.</li>
            <li>This product works amazingly, shake it first then spray on your tongue and scrap your tongue</li>
            <li>Wish they were available for purchase in stores.</li>
            <li>The simple stainless steel one I had, which cost 50 cents (bought in India), is the best solution I had.  </li>
            <li>My dentist gave me this exact product more than 10 years ago.</li>
            <li>its too straightforward.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this exact product since 1999, and I love it.</li>
            <li>Great at keeping your breathe fresh long term.  </li>
            <li>Arrived the next day in good packaging.  </li>
            <li>It is very flexible which allows you to bend it and move it easily around the surface of your tongue.</li>
            <li>and I love how they don&#x27;t burn and keep your mouth fresh for a long time</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast!  </li>
            <li>I just give it a few quick jabs of the stuff before I take the scraper to my tongue and it comes off with more gunk and leaves my tongue cleaner than it ever has before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t like the tongue cleaners much</li>
            <li>would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This spray really works.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really know if breath spray works.</li>
            <li>I just used it a few times and so far so good.</li>
            <li>i dont plan on repurchasing spray product because my original goal was tongue scraper only.</li>
            <li>Spraying the product directly on the tongue really works!</li>
            <li>i bought this mainly for the tongue scraper because i felt like i needed to upgrade my mouth washing routine for the ladies.</li>
            <li>I have even eaten a meal and been able to keep talking for a little while before I need to scrape and tongue</li>
            <li>But, if you want something more effective that will probably make your scrapers last longer (because you need to make less passes over your tongue) and keep your tongue irritated less, this kit is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Just brush normally and use the scraper with water, then rinse with mouthwash.</li>
            <li>You can still get fine results just by using the scraper itself and forgetting about this little kit.</li>
            <li>Great price, unfortunately this is only sold online, before they used to sell this in stores as well.</li>
            <li>I would do 3 sprays directly after eating and use the tongue scraper.</li>
            <li>but I just used my old one.</li>
            <li>I have used a tongue scraper like this one for years and it is the ONLY one that really works.  </li>
            <li>It removes all white stuff from your tongue in 2-3 sprays and keeps your breath fresh all day and the white stuff doesnt come back.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After my last scraper was losing its edge and effectiveness, I set myself out to buy a new one and came across this kit that came with the spray.</li>
            <li>Two small squirts and scrape your tongue and no bad breath  for 24 hours.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m still single</li>
            <li> Nothing i used in the past such as brushing my tongue ever even touched the white stuff</li>
            <li> small bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> My tongue is actually pink now.</li>
            <li> and it is getting harder to find.  </li>
            <li> I noticed less than half the white stuff returns since I started using this.  </li>
            <li> This product seems to have worked for other people, so again, it may just be a me thing.</li>
            <li> I have used this a few times and found that it did not perform as I hoped.</li>
            <li> They work, plain and simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They get really close and continue conversations without any sign that my breath is bad.</li>
            <li> This spray really does kill bad breath and for hours at a time.</li>
            <li> Price is rock bottom and the small bottle lasts for 6 months.</li>
            <li> not sure what must be in it</li>
            <li> The tongue cleaner is quite flimsy and small.</li>
            <li> get me wrong, the spray isn&#x27;t necessary at all.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I can never smell my own horrible breath to try and fix it myself.</li>
            <li> Although you should use it at least twice a day.</li>
            <li> Thank God my husband has a horrible sense of smell when it comes to my breath, otherwise he may have just been a friend, HAHAHAHA!</li>
            <li> I carry in my purse to use in case of bad breath, but it tastes bad -- too much like medicine.</li>
            <li> It seemed to make it worse, based on peoples reactions.</li>
            <li> I wake up with considerably less bad morning breath.</li>
            <li> I have had some moments when it was less horrifying than others.</li>
            <li> No more bad breath!!</li>
            <li> with this, I never have bad breath...</li>
            <li> My brother dosen&#x27;t have bad breath.</li>
            <li> over 90% of bad breath comes from the tongue and this gets rid of it.</li>
            <li> I hate it when my mouth is yucky and this helps.</li>
            <li> I. It scrapes all the nasty stuff on your tongue that you cant brush off with a tooth brush</li>
            <li> I, for whatever reason, have horrible breath.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Only thing that works!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Best for long days and good breath</li>
            <li> BreathRx is part of my daily oral hygiene practice. with this, I never have bad breath... you don&#x27;t even need a mouth wash. Price is rock bottom and the small bottle lasts for 6 months.</li>
            <li> Works great! No more bad breath!!</li>
            <li> Been using this product over three years now, works great for cleaning bacteria off the tongue. Great price, unfortunately this is only sold online, before they used to sell this in stores as well.</li>
            <li> just what the doctor order</li>
            <li> Tongue scraper is great</li>
            <li> My dentist recommends that I use this for mouth health. I did not have problems but use it for maintenance. I think it helps with the germs in my mouth. Her clinic sells this product for $15. I like it a lot, don&#x27;t want to be without it.</li>
            <li> Great at keeping your breathe fresh long term.  Spraying the product directly on the tongue really works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. It works.</li>
            <li> Arrived the next day in good packaging.  This product works amazingly, shake it first then spray on your tongue and scrap your tongue and you will be surprise to see the gunk from your tongue.  Truly a good product for tongue care. Works perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. Two small squirts and scrape your tongue and no bad breath  for 24 hours. This is the sure thing. Mouth wash covers up the problem; this solves it.</li>
            <li> Awesome!! My man&#x27;s breath is so heavenly now!!</li>
            <li> did not buy just the tongue care it.  I bought most of their products.  have been using them for  years but  walgreens no longer stocks them on west coast of florida.  why not?????</li>
            <li> Provides a good clean taste that lasts.  I&#x27;ve used it for years.  I hate it when my mouth is yucky and this helps.</li>
            <li> The tongue scrapers work well, but the spray caused my tongue to break out in bumps!  Just brush normally and use the scraper with water, then rinse with mouthwash. Save you&#x27;re tongue from the spray...not sure what must be in it</li>
            <li> I love it, come with 2 scrappers. one for my husband and I. It scrapes all the nasty stuff on your tongue that you cant brush off with a tooth brush</li>
            <li> Be sure to spray on your teeth too before brushing. I use on a daily basis and this stuff is the bomb. small bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I carry in my purse to use in case of bad breath, but it tastes bad -- too much like medicine.</li>
            <li> The tongue cleaner is quite flimsy and small. The plastic is almost foldable...so doesn&#x27;t give you the firmness you need. This still gives me a gag reaction when I try to reach the back of my tongue.  I&#x27;m wondering if it is the plastic that is giving me the gag reaction.  The simple stainless steel one I had, which cost 50 cents (bought in India), is the best solution I had.  I can&#x27;t seem to find it here</li>
            <li> I have used this a few times and found that it did not perform as I hoped. I, for whatever reason, have horrible breath. Always have. Been to plenty dentists who always say its not halitosis, and I&#x27;ve been to doctors for check ups that say, your&#x27;e all good, so unsure of why this happens. I have had some moments when it was less horrifying than others. My mother had problems with her breath as well, so I think its genetic. My brother dosen&#x27;t have bad breath. Perhaps I didn&#x27;t use it properly, idk. I would do 3 sprays directly after eating and use the tongue scraper. It seemed to make it worse, based on peoples reactions. Sadly, I can never smell my own horrible breath to try and fix it myself. Thank God my husband has a horrible sense of smell when it comes to my breath, otherwise he may have just been a friend, HAHAHAHA! I, THANK THE GOOD LORD GOD, have found &amp;#34;Tung Gel&amp;#34; and a tongue brush with a scraper. It WORKS SO WELL that it almost freaks me out to talk to people. They get really close and continue conversations without any sign that my breath is bad. I have even eaten a meal and been able to keep talking for a little while before I need to scrape and tongue brush again. They sell it here on Amazon and its great. This product seems to have worked for other people, so again, it may just be a me thing. If you have the struggles I have though, please do try &amp;#34;Tung Brush and Gel&amp;#34;. Best to you all.</li>
            <li> I just used it a few times and so far so good. Didn&#x27;t like the tongue cleaners much but I just used my old one.</li>
            <li> So, let me just start out by saying that I&#x27;ve been using these tongue scrapers for many years now to good degrees of effectiveness. They work, plain and simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my last scraper was losing its edge and effectiveness, I set myself out to buy a new one and came across this kit that came with the spray. I was unmoved, at best, as to how useful a spray would be in getting that gunk off when the scrapers were already doing fine, but I suppose I was in a good enough mood and bought the set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHY DIDN&#x27;T I TRY THIS EARLIER?!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how or why, but I&#x27;ll be darned if that spray doesn&#x27;t help take off this stuff! I just give it a few quick jabs of the stuff before I take the scraper to my tongue and it comes off with more gunk and leaves my tongue cleaner than it ever has before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the spray isn&#x27;t necessary at all. You can still get fine results just by using the scraper itself and forgetting about this little kit. But, if you want something more effective that will probably make your scrapers last longer (because you need to make less passes over your tongue) and keep your tongue irritated less, this kit is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> This spray really works. It removes all white stuff from your tongue in 2-3 sprays and keeps your breath fresh all day and the white stuff doesnt come back. Although you should use it at least twice a day. I use this spray and scaper in the morning sometimes in the evening and always at night. I wake up with considerably less bad morning breath. My tongue looks and feels fresher and cleaner and I dont worry about my breath anymore. I plan to get the breathrx mints and mouthwash maybe but breathrx definitely works. Nothing i used in the past such as brushing my tongue ever even touched the white stuff it would still be there. over 90% of bad breath comes from the tongue and this gets rid of it. I noticed less than half the white stuff returns since I started using this.  My tongue is actually pink now. I would definitely recommend this spray.</li>
            <li> My dentist gave me this exact product more than 10 years ago. I guess it works. I&#x27;m still single so I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> I have been using these products for quite some time and I love how they don&#x27;t burn and keep your mouth fresh for a long time</li>
            <li> This is definitely helpful for dry mouth!</li>
            <li> I use this daily.  Good price and it is getting harder to find.  It should be as easy to buy as toothepaste.</li>
            <li> i bought this mainly for the tongue scraper because i felt like i needed to upgrade my mouth washing routine for the ladies. great, easy to use and clean. the spray may or may not work better for tongue scraping but i use it until i run out. i dont plan on repurchasing spray product because my original goal was tongue scraper only. there are no complaints about this. its too straightforward.</li>
            <li> Love the tongue scrapers. Wish they were available for purchase in stores. Don&#x27;t really know if breath spray works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this exact product since 1999, and I love it. Durable, thorough, best tongue scraper on the market in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast!  The product works as described.  Very easy to use.  I have used a tongue scraper like this one for years and it is the ONLY one that really works.  It is very flexible which allows you to bend it and move it easily around the surface of your tongue.</li>
            <li> Best and only product of its kind. This spray really does kill bad breath and for hours at a time. I have been usinh breath rx for over 13 years and will always use it.</li>
