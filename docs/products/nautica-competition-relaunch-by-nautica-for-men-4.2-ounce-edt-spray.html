            <li>but at this price I am enjoying it.</li>
            <li>Scent is good and not overpowering and the price is right for this product.</li>
            <li>Nice clean scent.</li>
            <li>Smells Pretty Good.</li>
            <li>This product was just as expected and a great value for the product!  </li>
            <li>This cologne smells so good and why nautica wants to discontinue it</li>
            <li>1) love the 4.2 oz EDT spray yellow packaging 2) great combo between citrus and spice 3) silage</li>
            <li>Scent fades very quickly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as strong.</li>
            <li>This is a great deal, especially to prime subscribers, because you are not going to find it this inexpensively anywhere else.</li>
            <li>Really enjoy and still have been using this fragrance for a while....</li>
            <li>So when I saw it for $19 and free shipping and handling I had to buuy it for my man.</li>
            <li>Which explains why everyone is leaving reviews that they&#x27;re so cheap.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to see that they brought it back.</li>
            <li>will last you about 6 months or even more thums up to nautica!!</li>
            <li>The scent is very nice, but doesn&#x27;t expect to last any longer than 1-2 hours....</li>
            <li>/&gt;No huele como la original, el aroma dura unos pocos minutos.</li>
            <li>Got it and it smell nothing like the original.  </li>
            <li>My sense of smell is impeccable and this one is total junk.</li>
            <li>In fact I was not disappointed at all..&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>its not like the original</li>
            <li>If you liked the original, you will most likely like this as well.</li>
            <li>Mother special about its scent.</li>
            <li>Thanks for having this love it</li>
            <li>I am surprising him with it tonight as his Valentine&#x27;s present.</li>
            <li>and i recomend this product for people cool.</li>
            <li>This smells more like something guys in high school would wear, but to tell you the truth, if the ladies like it, then it&#x27;s worth wearing!  </li>
            <li>typically safe scents for me are CoolWater, original Curve, Sexy for him, CK one, Polo Blue, Nautica Lat</li>
            <li>great fresh citrus smell makes feel fresh, stays on all day long the 3.4 oz  </li>
            <li>Delivery was quick.</li>
            <li>I am always pleased with colognes by Nautica.....will purchase more in the future.  </li>
            <li>My first time trying Competition was in the form of a Christmas gift by my aunt before she turned cheap and started handing out gift cards.</li>
            <li>very grateful and pleased with you, thank you very much for your help</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn this since I was 18 years old and still love it.</li>
            <li>By far, my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>Glad it&#x27;s back and hoping it stays available for years to come.</li>
            <li>Still worth the purchase though.</li>
            <li>I however am not crazy about it, but that&#x27;s what he wanted.</li>
            <li>Smells great warm and casual</li>
            <li>Great woodsy spice smell to it without overpowering folks around you......unless you use half he bottle!</li>
            <li>The original was so much stronger, it lasted all day with one or 2 squirts.  </li>
            <li>smells are great, costs are small</li>
            <li>this is a good scent and last more than other nautica perfumes</li>
            <li>I was very excited about this purchase because my boyfriend has been missing his favorite cologne, he couldnt find it in department stores around here...</li>
            <li>Great deal for these hard economic times!</li>
            <li>glad to see it come back</li>
            <li>I was 13 when this was first purchased for me by my aunt and it came with a gym bag and</li>
            <li>I won my first bottle in a basket of toiletries at a charity poker tournament years ago.</li>
            <li>of course thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>I wear a lot of different cologne, and this is the one that I get the most compliments on.  </li>
            <li>Came fast, just what I ordered!  </li>
            <li>My hubby wore this when we first met</li>
            <li>It shipped promptly and arrived on the first day they gave me.</li>
            <li>I used hot water and dawn to get it off.</li>
            <li>Shipping was right on time and was packaged very well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have had this cologne in the past and the deal here for the amount was too good to pass up.  </li>
            <li>I was a huge fan of this back in the day!</li>
            <li>enjoy wearing it on everyday usage... enjoy it when people comment of the smell...</li>
            <li>the bottle was a light blue</li>
            <li>it real rockawear,</li>
            <li>I like it so much...</li>
            <li>My lady loves it and that is all that I was really looking for.</li>
            <li>I. Have 8 bottles of cologne $150 to $300, and for a cologne much cheaper, it serves it&#x27;s purpose.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anybody who wants to buy a cologne and is very indecisive.  </li>
            <li>So i tried looking for Nautica Competition after nearly a decade after using up my first bottle.</li>
            <li>but I live in Guyana and the hassle is too much.</li>
            <li>good scent, weak projection.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice cologne - not too sweet like some of the other men&#x27;s products that have been launched lately, but also not too manly like the old Polo and Aramis products.  </li>
            <li>but I wanted to shop around a little more.</li>
            <li>all of my past girlfriends love it.</li>
            <li>Cheap bottle design leaks a lot down the spray cap and covers your hands in it.</li>
            <li>Fantastic for high schoolers as a more casual cologne, but for anyone above the age of 18, I would say this cologne wouldn&#x27;t suit them.</li>
            <li>The perfume is trash and doesn&#x27;t last more than half an hour even when I put it on to sleep at night.</li>
            <li>Not glass - but more of a hard sport-like bottle which makes transporting it</li>
            <li>a 30 year old man and</li>
            <li>I want my money back or the real deal cause this one sucked.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>I purchased this cologne not knowing what to expect, and I must say I was truly surprised.</li>
            <li>I was sad to find that the original was no longer available.</li>
            <li>Such a classic.</li>
            <li>This time the scent seems to be much lighter and not very long lasting.</li>
            <li>It smell nothing like the original one, besides the scent last a few minutes.</li>
            <li>This was a unexpected gift for him since the cologne had been discontinued several years ago.</li>
            <li>The scent barely lasts twenty mi utes after it is applied.</li>
            <li>This cologne has changed names and barely stuck around after a relaunch.</li>
            <li>The scent doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like, but it still is highly recommended.</li>

            <li> its not like the original</li>
            <li> If you liked the original, you will most likely like this as well.</li>
            <li> Mother special about its scent.</li>
            <li> Thanks for having this love it</li>
            <li> I am surprising him with it tonight as his Valentine&#x27;s present.</li>
            <li> and i recomend this product for people cool.</li>
            <li> This smells more like something guys in high school would wear, but to tell you the truth, if the ladies like it, then it&#x27;s worth wearing!  </li>
            <li> typically safe scents for me are CoolWater, original Curve, Sexy for him, CK one, Polo Blue, Nautica Lat</li>
            <li> great fresh citrus smell makes feel fresh, stays on all day long the 3.4 oz  </li>
            <li> Delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> I am always pleased with colognes by Nautica.....will purchase more in the future.  </li>
            <li> My first time trying Competition was in the form of a Christmas gift by my aunt before she turned cheap and started handing out gift cards.</li>
            <li> very grateful and pleased with you, thank you very much for your help</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this since I was 18 years old and still love it.</li>
            <li> By far, my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> Glad it&#x27;s back and hoping it stays available for years to come.</li>
            <li> Still worth the purchase though.</li>
            <li> I however am not crazy about it, but that&#x27;s what he wanted.</li>
            <li> Smells great warm and casual</li>
            <li> Great woodsy spice smell to it without overpowering folks around you......unless you use half he bottle!</li>
            <li> The original was so much stronger, it lasted all day with one or 2 squirts.  </li>
            <li> smells are great, costs are small</li>
            <li> this is a good scent and last more than other nautica perfumes</li>
            <li> I was very excited about this purchase because my boyfriend has been missing his favorite cologne, he couldnt find it in department stores around here...</li>
            <li> Great deal for these hard economic times!</li>
            <li> glad to see it come back</li>
            <li> I was 13 when this was first purchased for me by my aunt and it came with a gym bag and</li>
            <li> I won my first bottle in a basket of toiletries at a charity poker tournament years ago.</li>
            <li> of course thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I wear a lot of different cologne, and this is the one that I get the most compliments on.  </li>
            <li> Came fast, just what I ordered!  </li>
            <li> My hubby wore this when we first met</li>
            <li> It shipped promptly and arrived on the first day they gave me.</li>
            <li> I used hot water and dawn to get it off.</li>
            <li> Shipping was right on time and was packaged very well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had this cologne in the past and the deal here for the amount was too good to pass up.  </li>
            <li> I was a huge fan of this back in the day!</li>
            <li> enjoy wearing it on everyday usage... enjoy it when people comment of the smell...</li>
            <li> the bottle was a light blue</li>
            <li> it real rockawear,</li>
            <li> I like it so much...</li>
            <li> My lady loves it and that is all that I was really looking for.</li>
            <li> I. Have 8 bottles of cologne $150 to $300, and for a cologne much cheaper, it serves it&#x27;s purpose.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anybody who wants to buy a cologne and is very indecisive.  </li>
            <li> So i tried looking for Nautica Competition after nearly a decade after using up my first bottle.</li>
            <li> but I live in Guyana and the hassle is too much.</li>
            <li> good scent, weak projection.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice cologne - not too sweet like some of the other men&#x27;s products that have been launched lately, but also not too manly like the old Polo and Aramis products.  </li>
            <li> but I wanted to shop around a little more.</li>
            <li> all of my past girlfriends love it.</li>
            <li> Cheap bottle design leaks a lot down the spray cap and covers your hands in it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic for high schoolers as a more casual cologne, but for anyone above the age of 18, I would say this cologne wouldn&#x27;t suit them.</li>
            <li> The perfume is trash and doesn&#x27;t last more than half an hour even when I put it on to sleep at night.</li>
            <li> Not glass - but more of a hard sport-like bottle which makes transporting it</li>
            <li> a 30 year old man and</li>
            <li> I want my money back or the real deal cause this one sucked.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cologne not knowing what to expect, and I must say I was truly surprised.</li>
            <li> I was sad to find that the original was no longer available.</li>
            <li> Such a classic.</li>
            <li> This time the scent seems to be much lighter and not very long lasting.</li>
            <li> It smell nothing like the original one, besides the scent last a few minutes.</li>
            <li> This was a unexpected gift for him since the cologne had been discontinued several years ago.</li>
            <li> The scent barely lasts twenty mi utes after it is applied.</li>
            <li> This cologne has changed names and barely stuck around after a relaunch.</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like, but it still is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Sad to see it be discontinued though, a very soft yet clean scent that got a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> He loves the classic nautica (green liquid, not blue)</li>
            <li> It is long lasting and smells yummy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this product for a long time</li>
            <li> She didn&#x27;t like my other colognes, but this brand she can&#x27;t get enough of.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that every bottle of the relaunch I&#x27;ve purchased leaks just a little up near the sprayer.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few others here and there, but always end up going back to this.</li>
            <li> I split my iPad screen between Amazon and a cologne review website to see what other people say about the product.</li>
            <li> and so do all the other girls at work</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it sometimes drips after spraying and becomes sticky.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite colognes and I was disappointed when it was discontinued a few years ago.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting harder to find now that it&#x27;s been discontinued for quite a few years.</li>
            <li> Seems watered down but what do I know.</li>
            <li> but you won&#x27;t go wrong buying it at such a low price.</li>
            <li> Still gets five stars because I&#x27;d be lying if I said I got less than four bottles this time around out of paranoia that this line might be discontinued again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Luckly it does&#x27;nt go bad quickly.</li>
            <li> Maybe my nose is going blind but it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in Amazon for selling this as an original scent, smh.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money in this</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a poor value man&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li> /Long to name a few.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> This was hard to find for me</li>
            <li> late .keep</li>
            <li> Smells the same, but disappointing.</li>
            <li> At least that was in my case.</li>
            <li> (duration of scent itself (decreased) &amp; amount dispersed per spray (increased).</li>
            <li> and he was a little disappointed that it wasn&#x27;t what he thought it was.</li>
            <li> it a try guys... or ladies for your guy... can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Have used this in the past and was disappointed when it was discontinued.  </li>
            <li> We were sad when they discontinued it.</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> glad to see it come back</li>
            <li> A great cologne, so you don&#x27;t want to use it. Great size, lasts a long time and definitely a great price, but you don&#x27;t want to use it. You can&#x27;t have it! It&#x27;s mine!!!</li>
            <li> I was 13 when this was first purchased for me by my aunt and it came with a gym bag and the bottle was a light blue then however still wear to this day and the bag is still intact and in my closet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this since I was 18 years old and still love it. I will def buy again.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like the original which was still better to me, but it still smells really good. It&#x27;s not as strong.</li>
            <li> This product was just as expected and a great value for the product!  Would order this product again without a thought.</li>
            <li> I would never suggest an aroma to someone.  This is a great deal, especially to prime subscribers, because you are not going to find it this inexpensively anywhere else.</li>
            <li> By far, my favorite scent. I have tried a few others here and there, but always end up going back to this.</li>
            <li> I Love this product, the way it smells, the ease in applying and Everyone who encounters me with this scent on, seems to HANG CLOSE to me...(SMILE)</li>
            <li> I won my first bottle in a basket of toiletries at a charity poker tournament years ago. Have never let my supply run out.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my husband.  And he loved it.  I also got it before christmas which was perfect even though when I ordered it amazon says that I would receive it after.  Very satisfied with this product and of course thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I split my iPad screen between Amazon and a cologne review website to see what other people say about the product. 1) love the 4.2 oz EDT spray yellow packaging 2) great combo between citrus and spice 3) silage last  a good 6-8 hrs on me. Definitely a great buy!!!!highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great scent and received very quick from time of purchase.  Can&#x27;t beat the price for this size bottle.  Will be stocking up on this item!</li>
            <li> It smell nothing like the original one, besides the scent last a few minutes. Don&#x27;t waste your money in this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No huele como la original, el aroma dura unos pocos minutos. No gastes tu dinero en este perfume, no vale la pena.</li>
            <li> got for my son-in-law and he was a little disappointed that it wasn&#x27;t what he thought it was. he was looking for something else.</li>
            <li> I bought it for a gift. I love it because i remember that my brother used it. I hope that my nephew likes it</li>
            <li> My fiance loves this. When we met, this is the scent I smelled before I knew it was coming from him. It caught my attention before he did. We are engaged now and good job Nautica Competion. I just got him more for Christmas.It is long lasting and smells yummy.</li>
            <li> I remember using this fragrance years ago and it had a much more citrus like scent. This time the scent seems to be much lighter and not very long lasting. Perhaps it was a defective bottle.</li>
            <li> I was very excited about this purchase because my boyfriend has been missing his favorite cologne, he couldnt find it in department stores around here...so when I  found it and got it for his birthday it made everyone happy</li>
            <li> This sent is woody as well citrus,the original nautica competition is the absout best of all with the out of the world babby powder floral&lt;br /&gt;Sent,very uniqe.one of a kind to many imatations way to late .keep it real rockawear,</li>
            <li> Stocked up on this cologne because of it&#x27;s awesome price. It may not be the best cologne but you won&#x27;t go wrong buying it at such a low price.</li>
            <li> I was sooooo happy to find this discontinued cologne for my husband! This was a unexpected gift for him since the cologne had been discontinued several years ago.</li>
            <li> great fresh citrus smell makes feel fresh, stays on all day long the 3.4 oz  will last you about 6 months or even more thums up to nautica!!</li>
            <li> im a 30 year old man and this one rocks smells stays for hours love it and so do all the other girls at work lol</li>
            <li> I have looked for this stuff for 7 years since I ran out.  I hope they will keep making it this time</li>
            <li> I bought this knowing the price was too good. Got it and it smell nothing like the original.  I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product. I want my money back or the real deal cause this one sucked. My sense of smell is impeccable and this one is total junk. no offense.</li>
            <li> well, I bought this for my Dad for the holidays. It is a really nice smell and he gets lots of compliments on it. Luckly it does&#x27;nt go bad quickly.I like that it is a smell for all occations, works for anyone.</li>
            <li> The original was so much stronger, it lasted all day with one or 2 squirts.  This stuff only lasts about an hour.  Smells the same, but disappointing.</li>
            <li> My son loves this cologne...  he never forget to use it when he goes to school.</li>
            <li> I was a huge fan of this back in the day! I was sad to find that the original was no longer available. The relaunch is the next best thing. My only complaint is that it sometimes drips after spraying and becomes sticky. I&#x27;ve purchased three bottles and they all do it. At the end of the day, not a deal breaker for me. If you liked the original, you will most likely like this as well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this one based on the good reviews and the description that it&#x27;s the citrus smell. In fact I was not disappointed at all..&lt;br /&gt;Well in brief, this one is a mix between the &amp;#34;Eau de sauvage&amp;#34; and the &amp;#34;Aqua Di Gio&amp;#34;. And it stays for a while.&lt;br /&gt;I am a Banker, and I prefer to wear refreshing EDT in the morning. For me this is just prefect.</li>
            <li> Another scent that I wear during daylight &amp; work time hours.  The scent doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like, but it still is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> smells are great, costs are small</li>
            <li> Was happy to see Nautica Competition on Amazon for this great price. I love this cologne and have been wearing it for years. Ladies compliment it all the time :) And the bottle is great too. Not glass - but more of a hard sport-like bottle which makes transporting it (if traveling or keeping in your car) a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try guys... or ladies for your guy... can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of it. Fiance doesn&#x27;t care for it though. He loves the classic nautica (green liquid, not blue) and I wanted to get him to try something different.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy and still have been using this fragrance for a while....&lt;br /&gt;really enjoy wearing it on everyday usage... enjoy it when people comment of the smell...</li>
            <li> Eactly what i wanted. I buy this for my brother for christmas every year and he loves it.  Delivery was quick. I have nothing bad to say.</li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing this clone it&#x27;s a very good product smells good but the good price original Nautica men&#x27;s cologne</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a poor value man&#x27;s cologne. Mother special about its scent. The scent barely lasts twenty mi utes after it is applied. Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> Good cologne, scent stays strong.</li>
            <li> Great spray!!! It have a good smell and great price... I like it so much... it&#x27;s realy a great aroma lol</li>
            <li> Favorite Nautica scent.</li>
            <li> My lady loves it and that is all that I was really looking for. She didn&#x27;t like my other colognes, but this brand she can&#x27;t get enough of. Great buy! (^_^)</li>
            <li> this is definitely an awesome buy, it smells just like it should smell, it came in a very good retail box, definitely as described.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what I remembered it to be.  Nice clean scent.</li>
            <li> love the smell of this on my husband!</li>
            <li> This cologne smells so good and why nautica wants to discontinue it I have no idea. Here in California this discontinued bottle starts at $36. So when I saw it for $19 and free shipping and handling I had to buuy it for my man. I was going to get it for him anyway but I wanted to shop around a little more.</li>
            <li> The design of the bottle is different but the smell is the same. My first time trying Competition was in the form of a Christmas gift by my aunt before she turned cheap and started handing out gift cards. Being that I&#x27;m allergic to various scents, I&#x27;m picky as to what i wear......typically safe scents for me are CoolWater, original Curve, Sexy for him, CK one, Polo Blue, Nautica Lat/Long to name a few. So i tried looking for Nautica Competition after nearly a decade after using up my first bottle. Found out that the department stores stop carrying them cause Nautica discontinued the scent. Which explains why everyone is leaving reviews that they&#x27;re so cheap. Sad to see it be discontinued though, a very soft yet clean scent that got a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this stuff for years. Girls I&#x27;ve dated all love it. It&#x27;s getting harder to find now that it&#x27;s been discontinued for quite a few years.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cologne not knowing what to expect, and I must say I was truly surprised. It really had a great smell to it. I just use it for work and maybe lounging around the house, but the wife and every one at work has commented on this cologne. The best part about it, it&#x27;s cheap. I. Have 8 bottles of cologne $150 to $300, and for a cologne much cheaper, it serves it&#x27;s purpose.  Would definitely recommend this cologne.</li>
            <li> Was the cheapest I could find online. Hard to find in stores. This cologne has changed names and barely stuck around after a relaunch. Shipping was right on time and was packaged very well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> La entrega fue r&amp;aacute;pida y en excelentes condiciones, recomiendo 100% al vendedor y el producto. El perfume le encanta a mi novio.</li>
            <li> Scent fades very quickly</li>
            <li> Ive bought nautical competition before. I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere so when I seen it on amazon.com I didn&#x27;t think twice. Its one of my favorite cologne. I would recommend it to anybody who wants to buy a cologne and is very indecisive.  just thank me later.</li>
            <li> Love it but that&#x27;s subjective</li>
            <li> Great Nautica Fresh Perfum</li>
            <li> GOT HERE QUICK , EVERYTHING COOL !!!</li>
            <li> good scent, weak projection.</li>
            <li> This smells more like something guys in high school would wear, but to tell you the truth, if the ladies like it, then it&#x27;s worth wearing!  Most women I am around like the smell.</li>
            <li> I wear a lot of different cologne, and this is the one that I get the most compliments on.  Smell great and doesn&#x27;t overwhelm you.  I would recommend this product to anyone.  I bought one for my brother in law and you would have thought I have give him gold.  Makes a great gift.</li>
            <li> for the money this is one of the best deals out there. Now just filling up the required min of words</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite colognes and I was disappointed when it was discontinued a few years ago. But while searching for another fragrance on Amazon, I stumbled across this and ordered it. The Nautica Competition (Relaunch) is just like I remember. Glad it&#x27;s back and hoping it stays available for years to come.</li>
            <li> Such a classic. Absolutely love this scent! As do the ladies. Only complaint is that every bottle of the relaunch I&#x27;ve purchased leaks just a little up near the sprayer. Still worth the purchase though.</li>
            <li> The perfume is trash and doesn&#x27;t last more than half an hour even when I put it on to sleep at night. That&#x27;s what I use this thrash of scent for, to sleep. I would return it but I live in Guyana and the hassle is too much. Disappointed in Amazon for selling this as an original scent, smh.</li>
            <li> The scent is very nice, but doesn&#x27;t expect to last any longer than 1-2 hours.... At least that was in my case.</li>
            <li> Maybe my nose is going blind but it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long. (duration of scent itself (decreased) &amp; amount dispersed per spray (increased). Seems watered down but what do I know. Still gets five stars because I&#x27;d be lying if I said I got less than four bottles this time around out of paranoia that this line might be discontinued again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NAUTICA: Bring back the Competition Sports Bag Gift Set!!! (the one w/ the yellow basketball)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other favorites: Unforgiveable / Nautica Blue / 212 / Lacoste Essential</li>
            <li> The cologne came as said, 4.2oz. Smells Pretty Good. I had this when I was in 7th grade, 1999. This was hard to find for me but I found it here!</li>
            <li> Have used this in the past and was disappointed when it was discontinued.  Glad to have found it and it was shipped promptly and arrived as advertised.</li>
            <li> this is a good scent and last more than other nautica perfumes</li>
            <li> Fantastic for high schoolers as a more casual cologne, but for anyone above the age of 18, I would say this cologne wouldn&#x27;t suit them.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice cologne - not too sweet like some of the other men&#x27;s products that have been launched lately, but also not too manly like the old Polo and Aramis products.  It smells great on my husband and the price was awesome - only 25% of the retail price.  Great deal for these hard economic times!</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve been looking for this product for a long time and I finally found it and it is great!</li>
            <li> Smell like the way she loves :p</li>
            <li> all of my past girlfriends love it.</li>
            <li> Thanks for having this love it</li>
            <li> Came fast, just what I ordered!  My boyfriend likes this scent.  I however am not crazy about it, but that&#x27;s what he wanted.</li>
            <li> My hubby wore this when we first met and I loved it. We were sad when they discontinued it. I was so happy to see that they brought it back. I am surprising him with it tonight as his Valentine&#x27;s present. It smells just like I remember it,Amazing!!! It shipped promptly and arrived on the first day they gave me. The packaging was awesome although the cap was kind of gooey/greasy when I touched it. I used hot water and dawn to get it off. I am very pleased with Amazon and Myfragrancestore!</li>
            <li> Shipped and arrived on time. Smells great. Great price...</li>
            <li> This is my husband fav!</li>
            <li> Smells great warm and casual</li>
            <li> very grateful and pleased with you, thank you very much for your help</li>
            <li> Scent is good and not overpowering and the price is right for this product.</li>
            <li> This has always been my favorite cologne, so I was upset when I heard it had been discontinued.  Being able to find it made me happy!</li>
            <li> Great scent and lasts for hours.  I have had this cologne in the past and the deal here for the amount was too good to pass up.  Great woodsy spice smell to it without overpowering folks around you......unless you use half he bottle!</li>
            <li> smells great.  Girlfriend loves me wearing it.</li>
            <li> This worked out so well for my boyfriend he loved the smell of it!!</li>
            <li> Smells good like it used to. Cheap bottle design leaks a lot down the spray cap and covers your hands in it.</li>
            <li> Nice scent...its not like the original but at this price I am enjoying it.</li>
            <li> Smells so handsome and what a wonderful price</li>
            <li> I am always pleased with colognes by Nautica.....will purchase more in the future.  I can always tell when my husband is in the room without even seeing him</li>
            <li> excelent fragance, the quality is good and the arom is nice, i &amp;ntilde;like it and i recomend this product for people cool.</li>
