            <li>I heard from a friend that this fig based perfume was a good one, I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores to try it out, so when I saw the fragrance on Amazon at the discounted price I took the risk and ordered it.  </li>

            <li>you can wear it to a nice dinner or to the symphony</li>

            <li>Another review described it as &#x27;rich&#x27;, and that&#x27;s a good word for it.</li>
            <li>Womanity by T. Mugler is my favorite fragrance at the moment.</li>
            <li>Not only is the fragrance wonderful</li>
            <li>not that satisfied at all</li>
            <li>Interesting thing</li>
            <li>Most of the time when you spray perfume on, after a while you can&#x27;t smell it on you anymore (because you are used to it) but others can still smell it on you.  </li>
            <li>sure you put the product on your skin (if buying for yourself).</li>
            <li>I just love the scent</li>
            <li>They love the smell on</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>This was a gift to one of my daughter&#x27;s Birthday, it is her favorite fragrance, therefore, I made her day.</li>
            <li>The word &amp;#34;code&amp;#34; was listed on the top of the box, but no code number.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li>Love this perfume, love the smell</li>
            <li>and I love the Thierry Mugler Line.  </li>
            <li>Oh my....this is my favorite perfume</li>
            <li>men love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>Love the ocean notes.</li>
            <li>Love the grapefruit notes.</li>
            <li>I LOVE fragrances, and I love to wear them, and for me about 1 in 200 are appealing.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>The Womanity is very good, but can bother because the fragance&#x27;s very strong.&lt;br /&gt;Eau de Parfum, woody, sweet and savoury.</li>
            <li>I love the sweet savory warm provocativeness of this fragrance.</li>
            <li>So unique!</li>
            <li>This size is the best value available, and you will definitely use it all!</li>
            <li>However, as it wears it transforms into a sweet and slightly salty, beautiful, absolutely fascinating, utterly captivating scent.</li>
            <li>It also sticks to your clothes (strong smelling - does not weaken like others when sprayed on clothes)  and the smell does not go away until your clothes are washed.</li>
            <li>I have worn it at work, though I am always hesitant because it is initially so strong...</li>
            <li>My husband liked it to, and he&#x27;s pretty fussy.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s important to be cautious with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the fragrance is still legit and the price is beyond fantastic)</li>
            <li>Smells great and this is our second bottle.  </li>
            <li>This fragrance is unique, intriguing, and sexy.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a very distinct smell</li>
            <li>It came really fast and came packaged brand new not ever been touched smells great</li>
            <li>that keeps this really unique ...&lt;</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that when she wears this I make sure this is the only thing she is wearing if you catch my drift.</li>
            <li>The ideal color should be mostly clear with maybe just a barely noticeable hint of pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I need a refill I will go directly through the designer, as they sell through their own website.</li>
            <li>Great choice as a gift or other and is not a tester</li>
            <li>Fresh, clean, and seductive.</li>
            <li>She normally pays $90 pr more</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m giving this four stars because it overwhelms so easily and gives me a headache if I put too much.  </li>
            <li>So crisp and my boyfriend luvs it also!</li>
            <li>It blended with our individual skin chemistry to make it smell amazing.  </li>
            <li>I get frequent compliments from both men and women while wearing it, along with bonus points for originality, because most have never heard of it.</li>
            <li>fragrance has great longevity, especially when it is worn on hot days and projects really well within the first 2-3 hours.</li>
            <li>Fresh woodsy scent with a hint of floral.</li>
            <li>The packaging was very well done and the cover is so unique.</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t the right color.</li>
            <li>I purchased the .33 ounce bottle from Fragrancenet - the juice was not pink, but a light yellowy-orange color, which tends to happen to fragrance that has sat around for a while - do not let this turn you off!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>the little boys and girls all tell her that she smells good</li>
            <li>I wear this fragrance daily, and find it appropriate for both daytime and evening use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my first Thierry Mugler fragrance</li>
            <li>(call beforehand to make sure they have this product) and try out a bunch of different perfumes or colognes, not just this one.</li>
            <li>Also, department stores sell it for $98.00...which is where I got my first bottle.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like it at first</li>
            <li>The order came really fast!</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite perfume (next to Angel).  </li>
            <li>At first the smell is very strong and by about an hour it tones down to a great smell that is hard to describe.</li>
            <li>first spray it is very VERY intense and even overwhelming - there is something smoky and even masculine about it that I was initially uncertain about.</li>
            <li>I was simply elated to find it available for not arm, leg first born.</li>
            <li>Very mature, classy, rich girl fragrance.</li>
            <li>The bottle design is refreshingly modern and also refillable.</li>
            <li>though the color did not seem to affect the smell hardly much at all.  </li>
            <li>This did not smell like the real one.</li>
            <li>I highly recommed it!</li>
            <li>I really adore Angel but one of my employees can&#x27;t stand the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Musky, exotic use carefully; prefer it for night time wear.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much and stays all day.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that this is larger than my original and can be refilled.</li>
            <li>Well that is true of any fragrance, but this one just does something different.  </li>
            <li>Cheesy name but beautiful scent.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Such</li>
            <li>After that, it begins to settle down making suitable for intimate moments where you&#x27;d like to have your significant other near you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It opens with a lively, sweet-and-sour hint of fruit (fig and a slight citrus note), then settles into an earthy undertone that gives it greater sophistication and balance.</li>
            <li>- I feel a little extra special knowing that I am one of the few lucky people who can wear this unique perfume and smell fantastic all the while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I decided to purchase the fragrance considering Summer was approaching and was looking for something unique from all the typical sweet and floral fragrances that usually become overbearing in warm weather.</li>
            <li>I usually buy it a retail store but got such a good deal.  </li>
            <li>the perfume was yellow and not pink like the original.  </li>
            <li>The thing about this perfume is the unusual scent, it is hard to describe but very nice smelling almost like a hint of a musk and green tea.  </li>
            <li>this is a polarizing fragrance because it does not work well with a lot of people&#x27;s body chemistry - very few people love it and</li>
            <li>It is a clean sort of jasmine like smell and it seems to last a really long time.</li>
            <li>It has a \\&quot;youthful\\&quot; vibe to it rather than how some fragrances have that \\&quot;old lady</li>
            <li>, I get compliments from complete strangers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unexpectedly (to me)</li>
            <li>This is actually what initially got me interested in Womanity</li>
            <li>suggest you go to your local department store first and try it on, since perfume smells different on everyone.</li>
            <li>Only high quality products last all day and even after a shower.</li>
            <li>I was very dissatified that the perfume is not the pink color</li>
            <li>I would not claim that it is counterfeit, mine came wrapped with a commissary price tag on it, so maybe it has just sat in a hot warehouse too long, as other reviewers mentioned, the perfume color is yellowed.</li>
            <li>I adored this stuff from the first whiff, and am not even waiting for the dry down to review it.</li>

            <li> This is my absolute favorite perfume (next to Angel).  </li>
            <li> At first the smell is very strong and by about an hour it tones down to a great smell that is hard to describe.</li>
            <li> first spray it is very VERY intense and even overwhelming - there is something smoky and even masculine about it that I was initially uncertain about.</li>
            <li> I was simply elated to find it available for not arm, leg first born.</li>
            <li> Very mature, classy, rich girl fragrance.</li>
            <li> The bottle design is refreshingly modern and also refillable.</li>
            <li> though the color did not seem to affect the smell hardly much at all.  </li>
            <li> This did not smell like the real one.</li>
            <li> I highly recommed it!</li>
            <li> I really adore Angel but one of my employees can&#x27;t stand the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Musky, exotic use carefully; prefer it for night time wear.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take much and stays all day.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this is larger than my original and can be refilled.</li>
            <li> Well that is true of any fragrance, but this one just does something different.  </li>
            <li> Cheesy name but beautiful scent.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Such</li>
            <li> After that, it begins to settle down making suitable for intimate moments where you&#x27;d like to have your significant other near you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It opens with a lively, sweet-and-sour hint of fruit (fig and a slight citrus note), then settles into an earthy undertone that gives it greater sophistication and balance.</li>
            <li> - I feel a little extra special knowing that I am one of the few lucky people who can wear this unique perfume and smell fantastic all the while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase the fragrance considering Summer was approaching and was looking for something unique from all the typical sweet and floral fragrances that usually become overbearing in warm weather.</li>
            <li> I usually buy it a retail store but got such a good deal.  </li>
            <li> the perfume was yellow and not pink like the original.  </li>
            <li> The thing about this perfume is the unusual scent, it is hard to describe but very nice smelling almost like a hint of a musk and green tea.  </li>
            <li> this is a polarizing fragrance because it does not work well with a lot of people&#x27;s body chemistry - very few people love it and</li>
            <li> It is a clean sort of jasmine like smell and it seems to last a really long time.</li>
            <li> It has a \\&quot;youthful\\&quot; vibe to it rather than how some fragrances have that \\&quot;old lady</li>
            <li> , I get compliments from complete strangers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unexpectedly (to me)</li>
            <li> This is actually what initially got me interested in Womanity</li>
            <li> suggest you go to your local department store first and try it on, since perfume smells different on everyone.</li>
            <li> Only high quality products last all day and even after a shower.</li>
            <li> I was very dissatified that the perfume is not the pink color</li>
            <li> I would not claim that it is counterfeit, mine came wrapped with a commissary price tag on it, so maybe it has just sat in a hot warehouse too long, as other reviewers mentioned, the perfume color is yellowed.</li>
            <li> I adored this stuff from the first whiff, and am not even waiting for the dry down to review it.</li>
            <li> The bottles we had in stock in our particular store and other stores in our district, had to be damaged out due to the color.  </li>
            <li> It is very long lasting - when I spray it on my wrist in the morning (a single, tiny spray)</li>
            <li> Fragrance not as lasting as expected.</li>
            <li> Color not pink as in previous purchases.</li>
            <li> I used to work at a Perfumania (last day was the other day).  </li>
            <li> Then one day one of the other store managers sent an email to all the stores saying try it on that it smells completely different on.  </li>
            <li> This perfume smells so different from other scents.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s versatile, which means you can use this fragrance as a casual scent or for special occasions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I put it on a few hours before I have to go to work, I find that the intensity has worn off by then, but then again you never know how sensitive other people&#x27;s noses are.</li>
            <li> Then again, ours were only slightly off color.  </li>
            <li> Like I said earlier, I don&#x27;t like typical smells</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t that pink as it should.</li>
            <li> I can tell you a few different things about this fragrance.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The dry down on the fragrance has a combination of citrus, woods, and floral notes.</li>
            <li> Neither of the notes overpower each other, their presence compliment each other.</li>
            <li> It mixes extremely well with my oils</li>
            <li> Did not come with the Thierry Mugler code number that came with all the other Thierry Mugler products that I have purchased.  </li>
            <li> I have worn this fragrance before, this bottle does not seem to be as fragrant as previous bottles.</li>
            <li> she bought it on here for half the price.</li>
            <li> yet again wasted my money</li>
            <li> I have been using Angel for few years.</li>
            <li> a lot more seem to hate it in the fragrance fanatic world (just read the reviews on fragrantica</li>
            <li> since its been discontinued :-):&#x27;(</li>
            <li> When we first got this in and sprayed it on the scent strips, we were like UGH what is this crap.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll see what I mean).</li>
            <li> Was not happy.</li>
            <li> Never wanting to smell like anyone else, or go with the crowd, I have quite a difficult time finding perfumes that I like.</li>
            <li> you can never go wrong ...</li>
            <li> This stuff stinks.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Womanity by T. Mugler is my favorite fragrance at the moment. Absolutely love it! Loved the expeditious order fulfillment and delivery. Will consider it again in the future.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is unique, intriguing, and sexy. It opens with a lively, sweet-and-sour hint of fruit (fig and a slight citrus note), then settles into an earthy undertone that gives it greater sophistication and balance. This lingering salty-savory quality reminds me of the way the scent of the ocean clings to my skin after spending a sunny day at the beach. I get frequent compliments from both men and women while wearing it, along with bonus points for originality, because most have never heard of it. The bottle design is refreshingly modern and also refillable. This size is the best value available, and you will definitely use it all! I wear this fragrance daily, and find it appropriate for both daytime and evening use.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance!!!  It&#x27;s feminine and somewhat woodsy, but does not smell overpowering.  My husband liked it to, and he&#x27;s pretty fussy.</li>
            <li> Fresh, clean, and seductive. I purchased this fragrance for my girlfriend for her birthday and she absolutely loved it. I decided to purchase the fragrance considering Summer was approaching and was looking for something unique from all the typical sweet and floral fragrances that usually become overbearing in warm weather. It&#x27;s versatile, which means you can use this fragrance as a casual scent or for special occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dry down on the fragrance has a combination of citrus, woods, and floral notes. Neither of the notes overpower each other, their presence compliment each other. It has a \\&quot;youthful\\&quot; vibe to it rather than how some fragrances have that \\&quot;old lady smell\\&quot; vibe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance has great longevity, especially when it is worn on hot days and projects really well within the first 2-3 hours. After that, it begins to settle down making suitable for intimate moments where you&#x27;d like to have your significant other near you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is a safe blind buy, but as I always say about buying fragrances, \\&quot;Try it before you buy it!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> She smells good when wearing it and she loves the product. I can honestly say that when she wears this I make sure this is the only thing she is wearing if you catch my drift. Wink Wink...</li>
            <li> I order this because of all the great reviews and this being one of my favorite fragraces.  However, when I received my&lt;br /&gt;purchase I was very dissatified that the perfume is not the pink color it should be but a yellow color.  This is the second bottle&lt;br /&gt;I ordered and both bottles the perfume was yellow and not pink like the original.  I&#x27;m very disappointed because&lt;br /&gt;I yet again wasted my money and I can&#x27;t return it.  I will not purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY DISSATIFIED WITH THE PURCHASE</li>
            <li> Color not pink as in previous purchases. Fragrance not as lasting as expected. I have worn this fragrance before, this bottle does not seem to be as fragrant as previous bottles.</li>
            <li> Great delivery and great product.</li>
            <li> A great purchase!!! Love the scent!!! Very different from anything else!! Have had numerous compliments!!! Highly recommend it!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Such a great price, and wonderful perfume!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my daughter who requested it.  Not only is the fragrance wonderful the bottle is a work of art and is also refillable.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t that pink as it should. I will check if the smell is still the same...not that satisfied at all</li>
            <li> This is my signature scent! I love the sweet savory warm provocativeness of this fragrance. So sexy and seductive! It get the MOST compliment when I am wearing this from men and woman alike!</li>
            <li> I used to work at a Perfumania (last day was the other day).  I can tell you a few different things about this fragrance.  For starters, those of you that are complaining about the color, please take note.  This fragrance from what we were told is on its way out the door aka: being discontinued.  The bottles we had in stock in our particular store and other stores in our district, had to be damaged out due to the color.  Interesting thing though the color did not seem to affect the smell hardly much at all.  Then again, ours were only slightly off color.  The ideal color should be mostly clear with maybe just a barely noticeable hint of pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for my review of the fragrance.  When we first got this in and sprayed it on the scent strips, we were like UGH what is this crap.  This stuff stinks.  That was when we were smelling it on paper.  Then one day one of the other store managers sent an email to all the stores saying try it on that it smells completely different on.  Well that is true of any fragrance, but this one just does something different.  We tried it on and it smelled different on each of us.  It blended with our individual skin chemistry to make it smell amazing.  Everytime I wear this fragrance, I get compliments from complete strangers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, be forewarned, if you try to &amp;#34;bathe&amp;#34; in this one, you will not only overwhelm others, you will also overwhelm yourself.  Most of the time when you spray perfume on, after a while you can&#x27;t smell it on you anymore (because you are used to it) but others can still smell it on you.  That does not apply to this one.  This one, stays on you and you can continue smelling it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this four stars because it overwhelms so easily and gives me a headache if I put too much.  It also sticks to your clothes (strong smelling - does not weaken like others when sprayed on clothes)  and the smell does not go away until your clothes are washed.</li>
            <li> I would not claim that it is counterfeit, mine came wrapped with a commissary price tag on it, so maybe it has just sat in a hot warehouse too long, as other reviewers mentioned, the perfume color is yellowed. I couldn&#x27;t find it in the store so I came to Amazon, thinking it had been discontinued. If I need a refill I will go directly through the designer, as they sell through their own website.</li>
            <li> Womanity is the type of fragrance I could go on and on about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon first spray it is very VERY intense and even overwhelming - there is something smoky and even masculine about it that I was initially uncertain about. However, as it wears it transforms into a sweet and slightly salty, beautiful, absolutely fascinating, utterly captivating scent. It is very long lasting - when I spray it on my wrist in the morning (a single, tiny spray), I can still smell it the following day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this makes a great going out scent and will also be great for the summer. I have worn it at work, though I am always hesitant because it is initially so strong... If I put it on a few hours before I have to go to work, I find that the intensity has worn off by then, but then again you never know how sensitive other people&#x27;s noses are. So it&#x27;s important to be cautious with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You also have to keep in mind this is a polarizing fragrance because it does not work well with a lot of people&#x27;s body chemistry - very few people love it and a lot more seem to hate it in the fragrance fanatic world (just read the reviews on fragrantica and you&#x27;ll see what I mean). This is actually what initially got me interested in Womanity - I feel a little extra special knowing that I am one of the few lucky people who can wear this unique perfume and smell fantastic all the while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first Thierry Mugler fragrance and I can say without a doubt that I am officially a fan!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(FYI I purchased the .33 ounce bottle from Fragrancenet - the juice was not pink, but a light yellowy-orange color, which tends to happen to fragrance that has sat around for a while - do not let this turn you off! the fragrance is still legit and the price is beyond fantastic)</li>
            <li> This perfume I ordered strictly based on the reviews and without ever smelling it (which I never do!). It smells absolutely awesome and I have had a ton of compliments. It is a clean sort of jasmine like smell and it seems to last a really long time. The shipping was fast and I thought it was an excellent price. Will definitely be ordering again soon! A+++++</li>
            <li> Never wanting to smell like anyone else, or go with the crowd, I have quite a difficult time finding perfumes that I like. Even though, I am a woman, I have used a variety of colognes because of the way the product mixes with the oils in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a five star product:&lt;br /&gt;1) It mixes extremely well with my oils&lt;br /&gt;2) It lasts all day and even after a shower&lt;br /&gt;3) Compliments from people (whoa, that smells good...what are you wearing)&lt;br /&gt;4) Caviar &amp; Figs ... you can never go wrong ... no one else will ever smell like you&lt;br /&gt;5) It smells different on me as it would on you ... that keeps this really unique ...&lt;br /&gt;6) Richness &amp; Class ... you can wear it to a nice dinner or to the symphony&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned - Like I said earlier, I don&#x27;t like typical smells, I recommend you visit a Perfumania or some such store like that (call beforehand to make sure they have this product) and try out a bunch of different perfumes or colognes, not just this one. *Perfumania even has a book that tells you the different types of genres within the perfume industry*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you put the product on your skin (if buying for yourself). Some smells totally disappear in minutes on my skin. Only high quality products last all day and even after a shower. Thierry Mugler&#x27;s Womanity does just that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before Womanity it was Just Me by Paris Hilton (Men&#x27;s) [I wore this product for 3 years]</li>
            <li> Womanity is a perfume that I have been using now for over a year.  I just love the scent, it&#x27;s a very distinct smell and yet it&#x27;s not a perfume that everyone is wearing.  I decided to go on Amazon because the prices are so amazing, I would have paid double for this perfume if I had gone to the Mall to purchase it.  I am so happy that I visited Amazon, the price was great and I got the perfume in two days.  I will definately visit this site again.  Great packaging and great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> They love the smell on me!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t get enough.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m constantly getting compliments.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the best fragrance ever.&lt;br /&gt;I love it</li>
            <li> This did not smell like the real one. I will not buy this online again</li>
            <li> This was a gift to one of my daughter&#x27;s Birthday, it is her favorite fragrance, therefore, I made her day.</li>
            <li> I love it , my favorite scent !!!!</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it!  This is my absolute favorite perfume (next to Angel).  I highly recommed it! All you need is one spray.  At first the smell is very strong and by about an hour it tones down to a great smell that is hard to describe. There is nothing like it on the market.  I found out there is caviar in it before I smelled it and the thought of that kinda grossed me out. You  can not smell it though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest you go to your local department store first and try it on, since perfume smells different on everyone. Also, department stores sell it for $98.00...which is where I got my first bottle.  I was so happy to find it on amazon for $48.00!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thierry Mugler you are  the best! I am looking forward to your next prrfume!</li>
            <li> Excellent timing. The packaging was very well done and the cover is so unique. Its makes a great birthday gift, my wife just loved it.</li>
            <li> My daughter requested this perfume for Christmas same as last year. She teaches kindergarten and the little boys and girls all tell her that she smells good</li>
            <li> Smells great and this is our second bottle.  Great choice as a gift or other and is not a tester</li>
            <li> It was a good price. My daughter and wife really liked the perfume. Realy smells good and has a realy decorative container.</li>
            <li> I got it on time. Great fragrance</li>
            <li> This was on sale for around $40 and I bought it as a gift for my sister. She absolutely loved it so I can recommend this!</li>
            <li> Did not come with the Thierry Mugler code number that came with all the other Thierry Mugler products that I have purchased.  The word &amp;#34;code&amp;#34; was listed on the top of the box, but no code number.  I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite scent and this is a great deal. I was so glad to find this deal!</li>
            <li> I am almost done with a bottle I purchased at Christmas 2011. I really adore Angel but one of my employees can&#x27;t stand the fragrance. She doesn&#x27;t seem to mind Womanity so for now, it&#x27;s what I wear to work. I like the fact that this is larger than my original and can be refilled.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume.  I usually buy it a retail store but got such a good deal.  I don&#x27;t care for floral perfumes.  This one is not - it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Musky, exotic use carefully; prefer it for night time wear.</li>
            <li> Cheesy name but beautiful scent.  I get compliments on it all the time and my mom even asked for it for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume, love the smell but it wasn&#x27;t the right color. I think it went &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; sitting in a warehouse, but still smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I heard from a friend that this fig based perfume was a good one, I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores to try it out, so when I saw the fragrance on Amazon at the discounted price I took the risk and ordered it.  I get a lot of compliments from both men and women, smells great!!</li>
            <li> This is one of my Christmas gifts from my husband. Hadn&#x27;t worn it yet, but I&#x27;ve had Angel and Lily By Angel and I love the Thierry Mugler Line.  One of my favs.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it at first but my husband loved it so I kept it. Eventually it grew on me and now i wear it often.</li>
            <li> The Womanity is very good, but can bother because the fragance&#x27;s very strong.&lt;br /&gt;Eau de Parfum, woody, sweet and savoury.</li>
            <li> Oh my....this is my favorite perfume I was simply elated to find it available for not arm, leg first born. It came really fast and came packaged brand new not ever been touched smells great I will be buying another soon....since its been discontinued :-):&#x27;(</li>
            <li> She loves it. She normally pays $90 pr more she bought it on here for half the price. The order came really fast! She loves it! I will order this for her again and again. It smells GREAT!</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance! I get a ton of compliments from strangers. I need a lifetime supply! Doesn&#x27;t take much and stays all day. Fresh woodsy scent with a hint of floral. Very mature, classy, rich girl fragrance.</li>
            <li> Was not happy. Did not smell like any of the others that I have bought. I&#x27;m seeding it back.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells so different from other scents.  That is why I love it!  No one will have it.  I don&#x27;t like the perfumes that are &amp;#34;fad&amp;#34; perfumes and everyone is wearing the same scent.  The thing about this perfume is the unusual scent, it is hard to describe but very nice smelling almost like a hint of a musk and green tea.  I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is as close as I have to a signature scent. Womanity is an attention getter. Unexpectedly (to me) men love this fragrance. Although no citrus notes are listed on my skin it smells like grapefruit with salt &amp; sugar. Love the ocean notes. So unique!</li>
            <li> I have been using Angel for few years. Needed a change and read the reviews on Womanity.&lt;br /&gt;Luv luv luv the smell. Love the grapefruit notes. So crisp and my boyfriend luvs it also!</li>
            <li> I LOVE fragrances, and I love to wear them, and for me about 1 in 200 are appealing. I adored this stuff from the first whiff, and am not even waiting for the dry down to review it. I love it. Another review described it as &#x27;rich&#x27;, and that&#x27;s a good word for it. Gorgeous. I am so thrilled to find a scent I like. If I could name it myself, I&#x27;d call it \\&quot;Renaissance Fair\\&quot;.</li>
