            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a defective one, because every time I use it I feel how rough it feels</li>
            <li> I think they are sending a replacement, but I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> but it feels dull.</li>
            <li> my blades on razor were getting dull from use and I needed these to replace them for a closer and cleaner shave again</li>
            <li> This was just what i ordered needed replacement due to carelessly dropping my razor causing clips to break holding foil.</li>
            <li> The item arrived broken.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I bought the wrong blades and lost all of my paperwork.</li>
            <li> If you won a Conair Shaver, like I do, and you begin having problems with the sharpness of the shaving blades as I did, you can&#x27;t go wrong with these items!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t EVER order from them--unless you LIKE to be ignored and disappointed.</li>
            <li> AWFUL business practice.  </li>

            <li> Fantastic!  Fixed the razor quickly.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is my razor is green and this replacement in purple....New Fashion Statement, Tee Hee  Thank you for the quick delivery and the reasonable price</li>
            <li> I could not find this replacement locally and was pleasantly surprised to find it here. Arrived so fast and fit. Great.</li>
            <li> I sent this email a week ago:  \\&quot;The item I ordered from you was supposedly \\&quot;out of stock,\\&quot; but you gave me no notice of that during the purchase process, and it was several days after the fact before I received notice of the out of stock situation.  I am VERY dissatisfied!\\&quot;  They have not bothered to answer me.  AWFUL business practice.  Don&#x27;t EVER order from them--unless you LIKE to be ignored and disappointed.</li>
            <li> These replacements are like the originals.  No problems with them.</li>
            <li> I have a Conair razor MODEL LW375W(green)and this fits!&lt;br /&gt;So happy to find replacement parts for it. It is old!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure from the photo if it was going to be the correct one or not but it was. Fit perfectly and was easy to replace.</li>
            <li> I bought these for the Ms. She hasn&#x27;t had to use them yet, I bought them when I purchased the shaver to have extra.</li>
            <li> This was just what i ordered needed replacement due to carelessly dropping my razor causing clips to break holding foil.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife&#x27;s Conair shaver. The item is a different color but fits and cuts perfectly. I started using it and it shaves surprisingly close. The item was shipped in an original bubble package. I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> These replacements were good quality and a perfect fit.</li>
            <li> I was so happy when I got it. I was so lost until I found this item. I got it earlier than expected as well. Happy Customer!</li>
            <li> I bought these when I dropped my Conair rechargeable wet/dry Satiny Smooth shaver and broke the clip that holds on the foil.  This is an exact replacement, and the extra blades will come in handy later when I need them.  Perfect!</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s razor broke &amp;#34;The foil cover&amp;#34; so I ordered this and she put it on in seconds and used it that day. It sure bets buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife to replace her worn out foil and cutter. This is the original manufacturers replacement and it fit and worked just like the original that came with the razor. Price was good. Shipping was fast and reasonable.</li>
            <li> The replacement parts fit perfectly, replacing the part that I accidentally broke.  Easy fix. Arrived on time with my Amazon Prime benefit.</li>
            <li> The replacement product itself is fine, I suppose, but i wish you could buy just the foil replacement without getting extra cutters.  The side clip snapped off 3 days after I started using this, so obviously I have no need for the cutters for quite a while.  It&#x27;d be nice to be able to just cheaply replace the foil as needed.</li>
            <li> Meets my expectations, satisfactory.</li>
            <li> Love the shaver..the replacement foil and cutters are for the future.</li>
            <li> Very easy to install. Works great. I would recommend anyone ordering one of the shavers that go with these items to purchase them at the same time so you always have a spare at hand, just in case. Cheap enough to do that.</li>
            <li> Item is as promised and the razor is now good as new. My razor is the green one and it looks a little funny but works great!</li>
            <li> These replacement parts were exactly what I was looking for. They fit perfectly and the price was better than buying a new razor</li>
            <li> The item arrived broken. I had to send an email to the company. I think they are sending a replacement, but I&#x27;m not sure.It would be nice if you were able to talk to a person...</li>
            <li> This was purchased for a young teen who is happy with its performance. It was a great deal. I would recommend it</li>
            <li> just change the cutters and foil and the razor is brand new again! i had dropped it in the shower and the foil broke, so i ordered this and back to being brand new.</li>
            <li> It fit perfectly into my electric razor. It&#x27;s a different color from the original (mine was a teal color, this one is purple), but works just the same!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I bought the wrong blades and lost all of my paperwork. I wish I could return the item listed.</li>
            <li> I give a 0, it sucks!!!&lt;br /&gt;I opened and used but when I try it to take it off it just fall a part!&lt;br /&gt;The material its too fragile and the quality very poor!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> The blades work great. Beats buying a new razor.  I used standard delivery (2 - 5 days) and had them in 2 days.</li>
            <li> Handy to have on hand as a back up</li>
            <li> If you won a Conair Shaver, like I do, and you begin having problems with the sharpness of the shaving blades as I did, you can&#x27;t go wrong with these items!  The make the shaver feel and act as if it&#x27;s brand new!</li>
            <li> I bought these because I needed to replace my old ones. These last pretty long. I don&#x27;t really shave much because I&#x27;m not that hairy. I shave maybe 2x a month. One replacement lasts me almost a year. I make sure to clean it always with alcohol. No bumps no cuts. Really good product. I bought about 2  packs of these. Easy to put it. Great deal</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a defective one, because every time I use it I feel how rough it feels and I take my time because I feel like it might cut me, it doesn&#x27;t but it feels dull.</li>
            <li> Even though my daughter&#x27;s razor is green and the replacement blades are purple, they fit great and work great. This is the second time we have ordered these. Wish they were cheaper, but oh well...</li>
            <li> needed replacement heads this was at a better price than the manufacturer and received them in just a few days.</li>
            <li> Needed the parts for the razor and love the razor. It efficiently works for me. needed replacements for the razor.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE my Conair razor and when the foil broke I bought a new razor. It just didnt compare to my old razor and I couldnt do without it and then it hit me that I could just buy a replacement foil. Fit perfect and now I&#x27;m back using my good razor!! Even got replacement blades!</li>
            <li> The item I purchased  worked well for my old shaver.</li>
            <li> Just replacement cutters.  What more can I say.</li>
            <li> It worked, as a replacement.  All that was needed.</li>
            <li> This is a great value and was what I was looking for. Fits perfect and it does just like it should. Thanks!</li>
            <li> my blades on razor were getting dull from use and I needed these to replace them for a closer and cleaner shave again</li>
