    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It worked flawlessly out of the box and has a two yr warranty.  </li>
            <li>I replaced a Conair beard/mustache trimmer whose battery had died, and I&#x27;ve been very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>I gave it the benifit of the doubt and hoped for the best.</li>
            <li>I thought this was the best brand out there, but Conair beats them by a mile.</li>
            <li>It made a wonderful gift for Christmas</li>
            <li>I have used this haircut kit on myself and in a friend, and it&#x27;s working very good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll either return it to the manufacturer (has a 2-yr. warranty) or just use it over the sink rather than standing in the tub (LOL).</li>
            <li>The battery powered feature is great too.</li>
            <li>If you had a contest to try to build the crappiest clipper this would win.</li>
            <li>Its great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s giving me good results and saving me money.</li>
            <li>Everybody has to make their own choice when buying these kits</li>
            <li>Blades did not cut the hair on the side of the head of on the top.  </li>
            <li>still working after many years.</li>
            <li>so maybe someone else will have a better experience</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I really wanted these clippers to be a good replacement, but the quality is abysmal.</li>
            <li>Combs are not sturdy; bends easily.  </li>
            <li>Fine for trimming sideburns.  </li>
            <li>perhaps as a cheap beard trimmer they might suffice,</li>
            <li>Cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li>Everything in the kit feels cheap.    </li>
            <li>The motor is just too cheap.</li>
            <li>cheap plastic not realy for haircuts, looks like a beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>When I first received it, it felt very light and cheaply made.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like that kind of comb, go spend a buck or two for a good, stiff comb or three.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, change attachments, clean, and seems pretty durable</li>
            <li>I wear a full beard and often neglect shaving my neck and cheeks for days, and the trimmer with no comb is great to knock down the stubble before I shave it.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if they will let me exchange it for a different model or full refund.</li>
            <li>you will probably enjoy this product as much as I do.</li>
            <li>This allows me to cut my own hair between  regular cuts.  </li>
            <li>Cordless, powerful.  </li>
            <li>right ear combs for this trimmer, though.</li>
            <li>I used the clipper right out of the box without charging the battery (I used it with the cord attached).  </li>
            <li>I have used a Wahl hairclipper for many years, but wanted one that was more portable and had guidecombs that would allow me to cut my hair a little longer.  </li>
            <li>(but I have soft, fine hair).  </li>
            <li>I purchased this 8 months ago and absolutely love it--the only clippers on the face of the earth that have attachments up to 1 3/4\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>The positive reviews here are from first impressions.</li>
            <li>Not a very powerful motor, feels very light and flimzy...</li>
            <li>It does an excellent job of cutting hair.  </li>
            <li>Wahl really messed up on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They should really consider discontinueing this model because it is hurting their image.</li>
            <li>He thanks us all the time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s battery has plenty of life to manage a whole haircut with juice to spare.</li>
            <li>but we like it so much</li>
            <li>Not too many other cordless options out there for this price.</li>
            <li>I am surprised Wahl is willing to put it&#x27;s name on these.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, if you want a clipper set that is lightweight, cordless, comes with two easy to adjust 1/8 to 1 3/4 inch comb guides at a reasonable price</li>
            <li>so I had to use my older yet stronger combs..</li>
            <li>The adjustable combs work fine, and I couldn&#x27;t find any other with that much range of sizes.</li>
            <li>When I first came across this item I was happy to find a hair cutting kit with a quality name and at a affordable price but that&#x27;s where my excitement stopped..</li>
            <li>I took the risk to buy it, although previous reviews weren&#x27;t that good, I&#x27;m happy it didn&#x27;t disappointed me.</li>
            <li>I use it to dump most of the water prior to toweling it dry.  </li>
            <li>They may look decent in the picture, but they are very cheap plastic, extremely weak motor</li>
            <li>wait i take that back - the little tube of oil and the packing foam work just fine.</li>
            <li>While these clippers should not be considered a replacement for a proper plug-in model they are a resonable substitute particularly if one is traveling outside the US where 50</li>
            <li>The short comb attachment seems OK, while the long comb attachment is poorly designed - hair gets trapped easily and builds up in the comb, I had to constantly shake or blow on the comb to get the hair out.  </li>
            <li>I bought the clipper because it had two features most important to me: (1) cordless operation; (2) adjustable-length comb attachments to eliminate the need to constantly change comb attachments.  </li>

            <li> I bought the clipper because it had two features most important to me: (1) cordless operation; (2) adjustable-length comb attachments to eliminate the need to constantly change comb attachments.  </li>
            <li> I have found them to be quite good at cutting short military style haircuts.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have noted, if you need heavy duty cutting clippers there are much better products available.    </li>
            <li> After cutting the hair on the back of my head, the machine just simply refused to cut any more.  </li>
            <li> clipper comes with two adjustable-length comb attachments - one for short hair lengths and one for long lengths.</li>
            <li> First the combs I received were so thin and bendable that you could barely get them thru the hair</li>
            <li> The guidecombs allow me to cut my hair up to 1 and 3/4 inches long.  </li>
            <li> I find it works well for me when I&#x27;m done washing my long hair in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I like this cutter, but it&#x27;s not so good for heavy duty cutting and the battery will drain after a little while.  </li>
            <li> First impression:  Poorly built.  </li>
            <li> Last time it worked, the motor slowed down to almost a halt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised at the negative comments in the other reviews, since I&#x27;ve never had the adjustable comb (which controls how long it leaves your hair) fall off.  </li>
            <li> It does not appear to be as durable as my other Wahl clipper, but that is an acceptable tradeoff.  </li>
            <li> And costs less than a single haircut!  </li>
            <li> plastic atachments extend up and down, don&#x27;t seem durable.</li>
            <li> However, I have had this clipper close to a year but with probably less then 5 hours use.</li>
            <li> The adjustable slider combs are horrible and I found the Conair where you had several combs to choose from worked better for me.  </li>
            <li> Even when fully charged they offer very little power and tend to bog down when clipping only mildly thick hair.</li>
            <li> A little flimsy but servicable.</li>
            <li> Next the clipper comes with a sliding thumb-operated switch that allows you adjust the combs to the proper cutting height however in my case</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any trouble regarding the adjusting lock nor the weakness of the combs.</li>
            <li> All it did was waste money and electricity to charge the battery.  </li>
            <li> plugged in, it struggles to keep up with normal hair cutting.</li>
            <li> Lastly the cut hair became clogged at the bottom of the clipper comb and that made it difficult to cut.</li>
            <li> Im not sure what the company Wahl was thinking when they made this product.</li>
            <li> Run away from this clipper - there are no redeeming features.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what happened, but my haircutter has lasted for years.</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t hold a charge and will hardly work when plugged in.</li>
            <li> I especially like the clipper combs that help control the cutting process.</li>
            <li> if i could rate this a negative 5 stars i would.</li>
            <li> So I was disappointed when after only a few months of use, it was broken.</li>
            <li> This is not good value at any price.</li>
            <li> I do agree that one of the combs in the kit is thin, but I like that factor.  </li>
            <li> poor.</li>
            <li> I found the motor was extremely weak, stalled every few seconds (requring me to turn the clipper off/on repeatedly), and the clipper pulled my kid&#x27;s hair out painfully.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First (and Last) use:  very painful experience.  </li>
            <li> Too bad we held onto this past the 30 day return policy.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very disappointed with this Wahl clipper.</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers for cutting hair at home.</li>
            <li> The Wahl 9627 hair cutting kit is a winner.</li>
            <li> the cut was always bad.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed in it.</li>
            <li> even the case is crap.</li>
            <li> Upon receiving and trying the kit I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very disappointed with this since we got it.</li>

            <li> I purchased this 8 months ago and absolutely love it--the only clippers on the face of the earth that have attachments up to 1 3/4\\&quot;.  Easy to use, change attachments, clean, and seems pretty durable (but I have soft, fine hair).  And costs less than a single haircut!  My only gripe is that after about 6 months, it stopped holding a charge at all.  I&#x27;ll either return it to the manufacturer (has a 2-yr. warranty) or just use it over the sink rather than standing in the tub (LOL).</li>
            <li> I have used a Wahl hairclipper for many years, but wanted one that was more portable and had guidecombs that would allow me to cut my hair a little longer.  The Wahl model 9627 is compact and flexible.  The guidecombs allow me to cut my hair up to 1 and 3/4 inches long.  The unit can be used with or without a cord and the smaller size makes it easier to maneuver than larger ones.  It does an excellent job of cutting hair.  It does not appear to be as durable as my other Wahl clipper, but that is an acceptable tradeoff.  It worked flawlessly out of the box and has a two yr warranty.  The money I am saving on haircuts makes that a bargain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Wahl corded clippers to cut my hair for the last 15 years or so, the same set! I really wanted these clippers to be a good replacement, but the quality is abysmal. They may look decent in the picture, but they are very cheap plastic, extremely weak motor (even when plugged in), these just don&#x27;t work very well on hair, they get constantly bogged down/loaded up even when plugged in, &amp; they also get clogged, for some reason they won&#x27;t release the hair, it just piles up in the blade... perhaps as a cheap beard trimmer they might suffice, but I didn&#x27;t find them acceptable at any price, so I had to send them back. I am surprised Wahl is willing to put it&#x27;s name on these.</li>
            <li> Not a very powerful motor, feels very light and flimzy... Fine for trimming sideburns.  For $16.99 you get what you pay for.  Not too many other cordless options out there for this price.</li>
            <li> First impression:  Poorly built.  Cheap plastic.  Combs are not sturdy; bends easily.  Wahl really messed up on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First (and Last) use:  very painful experience.  my hair keeps on getting caught in the blades and it ripped off several hair.  The motor stalled ALL the time.  I had to turn it off and on to keep using.  After cutting the hair on the back of my head, the machine just simply refused to cut any more.  Blades did not cut the hair on the side of the head of on the top.  Also the adjustable combs seem to move out of place when you have a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> I replaced a Conair beard/mustache trimmer whose battery had died, and I&#x27;ve been very happy with it.  I like the fact that it can run with the power supply plugged in, not an option with the Conair.  I&#x27;m surprised at the negative comments in the other reviews, since I&#x27;ve never had the adjustable comb (which controls how long it leaves your hair) fall off.  I do agree that one of the combs in the kit is thin, but I like that factor.  I find it works well for me when I&#x27;m done washing my long hair in the shower.  I use it to dump most of the water prior to toweling it dry.  If you don&#x27;t like that kind of comb, go spend a buck or two for a good, stiff comb or three.  I wear a full beard and often neglect shaving my neck and cheeks for days, and the trimmer with no comb is great to knock down the stubble before I shave it.</li>
            <li> A little flimsy but servicable.You get what you pay for</li>
            <li> still working after many years.</li>
            <li> When I first came across this item I was happy to find a hair cutting kit with a quality name and at a affordable price but that&#x27;s where my excitement stopped.. Upon receiving and trying the kit I was very disappointed. First the combs I received were so thin and bendable that you could barely get them thru the hair so I had to use my older yet stronger combs.. Next the clipper comes with a sliding thumb-operated switch that allows you adjust the combs to the proper cutting height however in my case it just moved on its own while cutting hair. Lastly the cut hair became clogged at the bottom of the clipper comb and that made it difficult to cut. Everybody has to make their own choice when buying these kits so maybe someone else will have a better experience then I had, but I could not recommend this one. So I sent it back..</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have noted, if you need heavy duty cutting clippers there are much better products available.    On the other hand, if you want a clipper set that is lightweight, cordless, comes with two easy to adjust 1/8 to 1 3/4 inch comb guides at a reasonable price you will probably enjoy this product as much as I do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very disappointed with this since we got it. Even with the unit fully charged &amp; operating with the cord plugged in, it struggles to keep up with normal hair cutting. It takes multiple passes to cut, what would have taken our last trimmer, a Norelco plug in model that lasted 8 years, one pass.    Build quality: poor. Everything in the kit feels cheap.    Too bad we held onto this past the 30 day return policy. Do not buy this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers for cutting hair at home. Even when fully charged they offer very little power and tend to bog down when clipping only mildly thick hair. The charge doesn&#x27;t last through one haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer blades come off when you try to advance them with the thumb slider to adjust the length of hair being cut, and they don&#x27;t trim evenly. I finally gave up on the trimmer attachment and went with just the trimmer blade over a comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone. I was extremely disappointed in it.</li>
            <li> I like this cutter, but it&#x27;s not so good for heavy duty cutting and the battery will drain after a little while.  Otherwise it does cut okay and there is no cord to hassle with when the wife cuts my hair.</li>
            <li> The Wahl 9627 hair cutting kit is a winner. I especially like the clipper combs that help control the cutting process. This allows me to cut my own hair between  regular cuts.  The battery powered feature is great too. It&#x27;s everything I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because of the trustworthy name and cordless feature. The positive reviews here are from first impressions. However, I have had this clipper close to a year but with probably less then 5 hours use. When I first received it, it felt very light and cheaply made. I gave it the benifit of the doubt and hoped for the best. Last time it worked, the motor slowed down to almost a halt. I keep it cleaned and oiled. The motor is just too cheap. Im not sure what the company Wahl was thinking when they made this product. They should really consider discontinueing this model because it is hurting their image. I would not even attempt to use my warranty because it&#x27;s not defected parts. It&#x27;s a total LEMON. It would be nice if they will let me exchange it for a different model or full refund. I would even pay the difference. &lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Bought this at Canadian Tire. Wahl used to be a name to trust. not anymore. i don&#x27;t know how the makers of this thing sleep at night. If you had a contest to try to build the crappiest clipper this would win. even the case is crap. i&#x27;ve had it maybe 9 months and its dying already. won&#x27;t hold a charge and will hardly work when plugged in. the cut was always bad. i could get closer with a pair of children&#x27;s scissors. if i could rate this a negative 5 stars i would. This is not good value at any price. Run away from this clipper - there are no redeeming features. wait i take that back - the little tube of oil and the packing foam work just fine.</li>
            <li> I have used this haircut kit on myself and in a friend, and it&#x27;s working very good. The adjustable combs work fine, and I couldn&#x27;t find any other with that much range of sizes. I haven&#x27;t had any trouble regarding the adjusting lock nor the weakness of the combs. It&#x27;s giving me good results and saving me money. I took the risk to buy it, although previous reviews weren&#x27;t that good, I&#x27;m happy it didn&#x27;t disappointed me. I would like to have left/right ear combs for this trimmer, though.</li>
            <li> The adjustable slider combs are horrible and I found the Conair where you had several combs to choose from worked better for me.  I cannot get it to cut the hair on my husband who likes it very short, it would not even take any hair off.  All it did was waste money and electricity to charge the battery.  I thought this was the best brand out there, but Conair beats them by a mile. I think I will take it back and get a refund and go buy a Conair with the money.</li>
            <li> It made a wonderful gift for Christmas hes used it twicw already. He thanks us all the time.Its great. Thank You!</li>
            <li> I gave this item as a gift. So I was disappointed when after only a few months of use, it was broken. I&#x27;m not sure what happened, but my haircutter has lasted for years.</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers to take on deployemnt to Iraq. I have found them to be quite good at cutting short military style haircuts. It&#x27;s battery has plenty of life to manage a whole haircut with juice to spare. The guides work well, but do not have enough variety of adjustment in the shorter lengths for \\&quot;buzz cuts\\&quot; and I would like the blades to cut a bit closer to the scalp without the guides. The clippers lack heft and I wonder about their durability over time. While these clippers should not be considered a replacement for a proper plug-in model they are a resonable substitute particularly if one is traveling outside the US where 50 Hz power makes regular clippers unusable.</li>
            <li> I bought the clipper because it had two features most important to me: (1) cordless operation; (2) adjustable-length comb attachments to eliminate the need to constantly change comb attachments.  I used the clipper right out of the box without charging the battery (I used it with the cord attached).  I found the motor was extremely weak, stalled every few seconds (requring me to turn the clipper off/on repeatedly), and the clipper pulled my kid&#x27;s hair out painfully.  Perhaps I should have charged up the clipper&#x27;s battery fully before using it, but according to its manual, it is supposed to work as a corded clipper with the cord attached when the battery is depleted. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The clipper comes with two adjustable-length comb attachments - one for short hair lengths and one for long lengths. The short comb attachment seems OK, while the long comb attachment is poorly designed - hair gets trapped easily and builds up in the comb, I had to constantly shake or blow on the comb to get the hair out.  Overall, I&#x27;m very disappointed with this Wahl clipper.</li>
            <li> cheap plastic not realy for haircuts, looks like a beard trimmer. shortest length is 6-8 mm and not as stated. can&#x27;t adjust the blades. plastic atachments extend up and down, don&#x27;t seem durable.</li>
            <li> Cordless, powerful.  They wear out but we like it so much, we just buy a replacement.</li>
