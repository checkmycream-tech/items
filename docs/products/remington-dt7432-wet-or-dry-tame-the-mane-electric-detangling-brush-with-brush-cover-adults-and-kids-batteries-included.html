            <li>This was the perfect solution.</li>

            <li>but in case they don&#x27;t PLEASE MAKE MORE COLORS!!!!</li>
            <li>Not the greatest contraption out there for hair detanglement....</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recommend this for fussy pets and even tried it on one of our cats to remove the matted fur â€“ worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Thought it was ruined, but it has worked perfectly regardless!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We love it!!!</li>
            <li>So the product is ideal for this type of hair.</li>
            <li>Works great on both myself and my 6 y/o daughter.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve also discovered that it works great for combing hair after washing it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been great for my family.</li>
            <li>I am so happy I can get a replacement one even if it has to sit around another year before I might need</li>
            <li>This works great.  </li>
            <li>but my daughter was so happy about it</li>
            <li>Had for 1 year, does a great job of getting out the knots in curly hair for our daughter.  </li>
            <li>Amazing!  </li>
            <li>Amazing!  </li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>

            <li>I really loved this product and I think you will, too, if you have hair like mine or have a child with unruly</li>
            <li>I really loved this product and I think you will, too, if you have hair like mine or have a child with unruly hair.    </li>
            <li>this comb thingy is good and will help get through the tangled messes easier.</li>
            <li>(I also didn&#x27;t like the idea of giving up an outlet or precious counter space to charge my brush!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Can I just say that I have never been so pleased with a $12 purchase in my life?!  </li>
            <li>and it is AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>My daughter liked the \\&quot;look\\&quot; of the Mercier brush, &amp; begged me to buy it for her</li>
            <li>It would be nice to see some blues, greens, reds, whites, blacks or what</li>
            <li>I thought maybe it was just because we were brushing slower, but I wanted to see on my own hair if I could notice any difference.  </li>
            <li>I found this right before Christmas &#x27;10.&lt;br /&gt;Really did not think it would work, but figured it would be a great stocking</li>
            <li>While she loved the color and the flower stand and was all excited about brushing her hair, once I turned it on it</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made and it pulls her hair.</li>
            <li>was comb able.  </li>
            <li>OK.  </li>
            <li>I had doubts about this product, but I am so glad I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>I feel so much better now that my hair is under control.</li>
            <li>I feel so much better now that my hair is under control.</li>
            <li>We almost always use it plugged in because it seems to have more power that way.  </li>
            <li>I wanna make sure I have plenty in stock just in case</li>
            <li>Instead of bearing the pain, she mostly decides to leave it alone.</li>
            <li>At a time in my life when every strand of hair was precious.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more &amp;#34;krinkly&amp;#34; (and tangle-prone) than curly.</li>
            <li>While most of the reviews on the Remington Tangle Tamer are focused on use by humans, my usage intent was for my pets.</li>
            <li>I bought two in hopes that I would love this.</li>
            <li>so I can offer a more comprehensive review, but for now it&#x27;sjust \\&quot;meh\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>OK, this thing arrived at my house</li>
            <li>Now I keep this baby charged up and on the top of my counter in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>I notice this for myself and my daughters love that about it too.</li>
            <li>I notice this for myself and my daughters love that about it too.</li>
            <li>(Pantene for curly hair) and there would be so many knots, she would scream and yell and cry</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s not saying \\&quot;ouch\\&quot; any more.</li>
            <li>Glad I took the chance on it.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that tangles easily.  </li>
            <li>I have a long beard and in the morning this is perfect.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see a huge improvement over my favorite detangling brush though.  </li>
            <li>If you get split ends easily</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>but it works like magic and is worth every penny and more.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s because of the fine texture of my hair.</li>
            <li>, the comb works wonderfully and with little fuss from the pets.  </li>
            <li>With in minutes by hair was combed out and tangled free.  </li>
            <li>This is so nice that gently gets the tangles out.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product</li>
            <li>tangle free</li>
            <li>The product was fabulous.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I am so happy with it that I purchased a second one just in case</li>
            <li>The texture remained the same, just comb able and more importantly Manageable!</li>
            <li>And I have super fine hair</li>
            <li>I felt so excited, happy and all the happiness related feelings that the next day I sent the link to all my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Went right through my hair!</li>
            <li>I purchased this as an impulse buy because I got an email stating it was on sale for pretty cheap and had free shipping at the time (if memory serves).</li>
            <li>would not pay full price but</li>
            <li>, I am amazed and I am able to say that this item really is something of a miracle worker.</li>
            <li>This Tangle Tamer is only good for seemingly untangled hair.</li>
            <li>This is a dream come true.</li>
            <li>I love love love this comb, even the pink and purple.</li>
            <li>Especially my older daughter who has a 4b/4c texture.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>I was extremely skeptical that it would help at all...or even be able to get through any of her hair but to my very great surprise....</li>
            <li>Stays charged for a long time so is good for travel.</li>
            <li>I did try it when I first got it, and it did get the tangles out, I just find it to be more of a pain to get it out, plug it in and use it when I don&#x27;t really need it.</li>
            <li>Kind of a novelty item unless you really know someone whose hair gets very tangled and would be interested in taking the time to plug it in to use it.</li>
            <li>I have straight, fine to medium textured hair and a lot of it.</li>
            <li>I am nineteen years old and I enjoyed using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am nineteen years old and I enjoyed using it.    </li>
            <li>This is worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I liked how it went through my hair and began using it regularly on myself.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth a shot based on all the 5 star reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, when I found out that this item existed, I figured it was worth a shot.  </li>
            <li>I think this gadget is worth it to try if you are having problems.</li>
            <li>and WOW is all I can really say!!!!  </li>
            <li>The vibration cuts right through the mats around the neck.</li>
            <li>(yes, you read that right).  </li>
            <li>but if you follow the directions, it gets right through the tangles.</li>
            <li>If you get stuck somewhere, just use a comb or brush and try to brush it out the best you can, then go back to using this little device to try to get out what the comb or brush could not.</li>
            <li>/&gt;~ Lizmewhere, just use a comb or brush and try to brush it out the best you can, then go back to using this little device to try to get out what the comb or brush could not.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item with a fair dose of skepticism, but I was willing to try it based on the previous positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>I finally had to use the scissors and cut off huge chunks of hair!  </li>
            <li>I am definitely buying more in case anything happens to ours.  </li>
            <li>for the cost of a regular brush its an okay deal</li>
            <li>So now all the ladies in our house are using this comb on a daily basis, and we love it.  </li>
            <li>I tried this thing for the first time yesterday and almost fainted.</li>
            <li>You just turn it on and start combing gently and voila- the tangles slowly go away leaving hair nice and smooth!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It fell off the counter on the first day, didn&#x27;t have the guard on it and it broke a tooth.  </li>
            <li>I have had better results with a big shower comb in a shorter amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>handle my kids&#x27; very curly hair!</li>
            <li>First time in his life he hasn&#x27;t cried when I combed his hair.</li>
            <li>and now I can finally start saving. :-)</li>
            <li>The only time we could comb her hair was right out of the shower and only with lots of good conditioner and spray.  </li>
            <li>Probably where I have been buying too many hair brushes in the search for &#x27;the one&#x27; for my waist line long hair.</li>
            <li>After first use I looked at the brush to see how much hair I lost this time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite large and noisy as well.  </li>
            <li>It charges just fine, but it just doesn&#x27;t seem to have the same power when it&#x27;s cordless.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t say this brush does a 130% job because it still pulls at the knots some and with the size of the brush in comparison to her 5 year old head, I sometimes knock the hard plastic &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; on her scalp if I&#x27;m not cautious; however, it is a great improvement from anything we have ever tried.</li>
            <li>this thing is really cool.\\</li>
            <li>I also like the charging cord so it is always ready when we need it.</li>
            <li>Suffice to say, the Remington didn&#x27;t get much use after trying them both side by side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would often wear hooded clothing to try to conceal my hair because it would get knotted up so much that I couldn&#x27;t always brush it out no matter what I did.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Tangled hair has been a part of my whole life.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this wonder product!</li>
            <li>My daughter has very curly hair.</li>
            <li>, it is just very time consuming.</li>
            <li>Though it is just a comb, it is very indiscreet.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t really paying attention.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used wide toothed combs and they were ok, but still there were tears and screaming, and you know, in the process her hair gets ripped out.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have very tangly hair anyway, but it went through like butter.  </li>
            <li>(better wet)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m numb yet mystified yet happy yet excited yet freaked yet ready to go wash my hair again......................</li>
            <li>If I were rich enough (hah!)</li>
            <li>The true length of my hair is 20 inches total.</li>
            <li>She didn&#x27;t want it at the time (though she might now that she&#x27;s older)</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, for the Tangle Tamer, I bought the \\&quot;Wet\\&quot; Brush at the same time, so I wasn&#x27;t impressed.  </li>
            <li>Grand kids who HATE brushing their hair use this with joy.</li>
            <li>She will now willingly sit down and let me brush her hair without going into a fit of tears from pain.</li>
            <li>I think the best improvement over my tangle tamer brush is less hair loss and as we know hair breakage is damage so that is not good.  </li>
            <li>Send it back to the manufacturer and get it replaced because it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>I got mine for a ridiculously low price here on Amazon so it was worth experimenting with.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought the hand brushes (like you groom a horse with) &amp; even the new Michel Mercier Detangling Brush.</li>
            <li>Remington has come out with a new improved model of this which I was hoping to get my hands on.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve ordered the new model twice, which by the way, Amazon is advertising yet on both occasions</li>

            <li>However, I&#x27;ve ordered the new model twice, which by the way, Amazon is advertising yet on both occasions</li>
            <li>I bought this new at a grocery store for $7 years ago.</li>
            <li>My 7 year old has nearly waist length hair and a very tender head.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is also very loud.</li>
            <li>I bought this last week and used it for the first yesterday.</li>
            <li>My hair was completely tangle-free after using it!</li>
            <li>When it was sold on Amazon it priced at $10.00, now third party sellers are selling it for $55.00 and higher.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is so simple that I cannot figure out exactly why it works so well.  </li>
            <li>We use it everyday, usually twice a day, so I&#x27;d say that is a pretty good length of time to not be needing a charge.</li>
            <li>We love it so much I&#x27;m buying my second one right now for my down stairs bathroom!!!!</li>
            <li>If you use a regular comb you can feel the snags as you move along and be more careful, but with this you really can&#x27;t unless it&#x27;s a big knot.</li>
            <li>I feared that old faithful might break down so bought 2 more as back ups.</li>
            <li>Brush\\&quot; is is by far the clear winner.  </li>
            <li>I see that they have recommended this for children with my problem, but please don&#x27;t let that scare you from buying this product if you are an adult.</li>

            <li>She wakes up every day with a mass of tangled hair in the back of her head, and combing her hair has been a real battle.  </li>
            <li>Every time a friend or family member notices it, they use it and are like WOW I WANT ONE.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;ve sent the old model</li>

            <li>I frequently cut out mats (like your Persian cat!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They stopped making it, and mine, despite much TLC,  finally died</li>
            <li>+ year old will never break.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>my unexpected surprise</li>
            <li>The gentle vibrations and low hum from the twisting teeth do not appear to bother the dogs.</li>
            <li>I have Curly/Kinky hair that is transitioning to natural.</li>
            <li>Of those, 6\\&quot; are natural, the rest is relaxed.</li>
            <li>I will revisit this product again when my hair is fully natural</li>
            <li>But I am a white woman with straight hair.</li>
            <li>but it really doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as regular combs do.</li>
            <li>but it really doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as regular combs do.</li>
            <li>I bought this comb for a close friend of mine after seeing it mentioned on a bunch of natural hair forums.</li>
            <li>me tell you, my 4 year old daughter has curly curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Since she&#x27;s 2 years old</li>
            <li>NO CRYING.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Initially I bought it for my three year old daughter.</li>
            <li>I saw that it worked on African-American hair, their hair can be thick and coarse, as mine is at times, so I wanted to try it on my own hair.</li>
            <li>it is broken off and the package is still fully intact if it breaks so easily before even bring used I can&#x27;t imagine it being able to handle my tight curls</li>
            <li>As long as you&#x27;re very patient and have the time, this works pretty well to untangle my daughter&#x27;s very long hair.  </li>
            <li>This product actually works quite well for fine hair that is very straight and very long... both wet and dry.  </li>
            <li>It only got broken because of our own negligence.  </li>
            <li>The Tangle Tamer vibrates to help remove the tangles, so it grabs her fine hairs and pulls so hard that it snaps and breaks the strands.  </li>
            <li>My mom had bought it from Dollar General some years ago.  </li>
            <li>daughter just turned 5 and is willing to keep her hair long as long as we have her detangling</li>
            <li>The wet brush is so gentle yet it gets through tangled hair (</li>
            <li>I still have to use a smaller toothed comb to get the hair completely combed out.</li>
            <li>No wide tooth comb can compare to this.  </li>
            <li>and my daughter has such &#x27;texture&#x27; naturally.  </li>
            <li>Sorry, I know this supposed to be a review for the Remington Tangle Tamer, but I can&#x27;t stop loving on my \\&quot;Wet\\&quot; brush.  </li>
            <li>as of today, they&#x27;re advertising the new purple model but keep shipping the old pink model.</li>
            <li>as of today, they&#x27;re advertising the new purple model but keep shipping the old pink model.</li>
            <li>but I should have known from the super straight thin hair of the model they used however</li>
            <li>I put in a leave-in conditioner first and then hit the button on this odd looking tool.  </li>
            <li>This tool help tremendously with that, but I still have to be patient and take small sections.</li>
            <li>This is damaging if you have any hair texture other than straight.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a lot of similar brushes that claim to be gentle while detangling but the \\&quot;Wet</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think that this product is truly a life saver for the life of my hair and my social life.</li>
            <li>Overall, I think that this product is truly a life saver for the life of my hair and my social life.</li>
            <li>I initially considered purchasing this item because I have a 4 year old daughter with long, curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Two have long thick hair and one has fine long hair and this tool gets through it all with ease.</li>
            <li>My mom ended up giving me hers, but I felt bad, especially since she truly loved the product; therefore, I will be purchasing this product and giving it to her.  </li>

            <li> Thought it was ruined, but it has worked perfectly regardless!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We love it!!!</li>
            <li> So the product is ideal for this type of hair.</li>
            <li> Works great on both myself and my 6 y/o daughter.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve also discovered that it works great for combing hair after washing it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been great for my family.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I can get a replacement one even if it has to sit around another year before I might need</li>
            <li> This works great.  </li>
            <li> but my daughter was so happy about it</li>
            <li> Had for 1 year, does a great job of getting out the knots in curly hair for our daughter.  </li>
            <li> Amazing!  </li>
            <li> Amazing!  </li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing!  </li>
            <li> :o)</li>
            <li> I really loved this product and I think you will, too, if you have hair like mine or have a child with unruly</li>
            <li> I really loved this product and I think you will, too, if you have hair like mine or have a child with unruly hair.    </li>
            <li> this comb thingy is good and will help get through the tangled messes easier.</li>
            <li> (I also didn&#x27;t like the idea of giving up an outlet or precious counter space to charge my brush!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Can I just say that I have never been so pleased with a $12 purchase in my life?!  </li>
            <li> and it is AMAZING.  </li>
            <li> My daughter liked the \\&quot;look\\&quot; of the Mercier brush, &amp; begged me to buy it for her</li>
            <li> It would be nice to see some blues, greens, reds, whites, blacks or what</li>
            <li> I thought maybe it was just because we were brushing slower, but I wanted to see on my own hair if I could notice any difference.  </li>
            <li> I found this right before Christmas &#x27;10.&lt;br /&gt;Really did not think it would work, but figured it would be a great stocking</li>
            <li> While she loved the color and the flower stand and was all excited about brushing her hair, once I turned it on it</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made and it pulls her hair.</li>
            <li> was comb able.  </li>
            <li> OK.  </li>
            <li> I had doubts about this product, but I am so glad I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> I feel so much better now that my hair is under control.</li>
            <li> I feel so much better now that my hair is under control.</li>
            <li> We almost always use it plugged in because it seems to have more power that way.  </li>
            <li> I wanna make sure I have plenty in stock just in case</li>
            <li> Instead of bearing the pain, she mostly decides to leave it alone.</li>
            <li> At a time in my life when every strand of hair was precious.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more &amp;#34;krinkly&amp;#34; (and tangle-prone) than curly.</li>
            <li> While most of the reviews on the Remington Tangle Tamer are focused on use by humans, my usage intent was for my pets.</li>
            <li> I bought two in hopes that I would love this.</li>
            <li> so I can offer a more comprehensive review, but for now it&#x27;sjust \\&quot;meh\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> OK, this thing arrived at my house</li>
            <li> Now I keep this baby charged up and on the top of my counter in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I notice this for myself and my daughters love that about it too.</li>
            <li> I notice this for myself and my daughters love that about it too.</li>
            <li> (Pantene for curly hair) and there would be so many knots, she would scream and yell and cry</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s not saying \\&quot;ouch\\&quot; any more.</li>
            <li> Glad I took the chance on it.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that tangles easily.  </li>
            <li> I have a long beard and in the morning this is perfect.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a huge improvement over my favorite detangling brush though.  </li>
            <li> If you get split ends easily</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> but it works like magic and is worth every penny and more.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s because of the fine texture of my hair.</li>
            <li> , the comb works wonderfully and with little fuss from the pets.  </li>
            <li> With in minutes by hair was combed out and tangled free.  </li>
            <li> This is so nice that gently gets the tangles out.</li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product</li>
            <li> tangle free</li>
            <li> The product was fabulous.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I am so happy with it that I purchased a second one just in case</li>
            <li> The texture remained the same, just comb able and more importantly Manageable!</li>
            <li> And I have super fine hair</li>
            <li> I felt so excited, happy and all the happiness related feelings that the next day I sent the link to all my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Went right through my hair!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as an impulse buy because I got an email stating it was on sale for pretty cheap and had free shipping at the time (if memory serves).</li>
            <li> would not pay full price but</li>
            <li> , I am amazed and I am able to say that this item really is something of a miracle worker.</li>
            <li> This Tangle Tamer is only good for seemingly untangled hair.</li>
            <li> This is a dream come true.</li>
            <li> I love love love this comb, even the pink and purple.</li>
            <li> Especially my older daughter who has a 4b/4c texture.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> I was extremely skeptical that it would help at all...or even be able to get through any of her hair but to my very great surprise....</li>
            <li> Stays charged for a long time so is good for travel.</li>
            <li> I did try it when I first got it, and it did get the tangles out, I just find it to be more of a pain to get it out, plug it in and use it when I don&#x27;t really need it.</li>
            <li> Kind of a novelty item unless you really know someone whose hair gets very tangled and would be interested in taking the time to plug it in to use it.</li>
            <li> I have straight, fine to medium textured hair and a lot of it.</li>
            <li> I am nineteen years old and I enjoyed using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am nineteen years old and I enjoyed using it.    </li>
            <li> This is worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I liked how it went through my hair and began using it regularly on myself.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth a shot based on all the 5 star reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, when I found out that this item existed, I figured it was worth a shot.  </li>
            <li> I think this gadget is worth it to try if you are having problems.</li>
            <li> and WOW is all I can really say!!!!  </li>
            <li> The vibration cuts right through the mats around the neck.</li>
            <li> (yes, you read that right).  </li>
            <li> but if you follow the directions, it gets right through the tangles.</li>
            <li> If you get stuck somewhere, just use a comb or brush and try to brush it out the best you can, then go back to using this little device to try to get out what the comb or brush could not.</li>
            <li> /&gt;~ Lizmewhere, just use a comb or brush and try to brush it out the best you can, then go back to using this little device to try to get out what the comb or brush could not.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item with a fair dose of skepticism, but I was willing to try it based on the previous positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> I finally had to use the scissors and cut off huge chunks of hair!  </li>
            <li> I am definitely buying more in case anything happens to ours.  </li>
            <li> for the cost of a regular brush its an okay deal</li>
            <li> So now all the ladies in our house are using this comb on a daily basis, and we love it.  </li>
            <li> I tried this thing for the first time yesterday and almost fainted.</li>
            <li> You just turn it on and start combing gently and voila- the tangles slowly go away leaving hair nice and smooth!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It fell off the counter on the first day, didn&#x27;t have the guard on it and it broke a tooth.  </li>
            <li> I have had better results with a big shower comb in a shorter amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> handle my kids&#x27; very curly hair!</li>
            <li> First time in his life he hasn&#x27;t cried when I combed his hair.</li>
            <li> and now I can finally start saving. :-)</li>
            <li> The only time we could comb her hair was right out of the shower and only with lots of good conditioner and spray.  </li>
            <li> Probably where I have been buying too many hair brushes in the search for &#x27;the one&#x27; for my waist line long hair.</li>
            <li> After first use I looked at the brush to see how much hair I lost this time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite large and noisy as well.  </li>
            <li> It charges just fine, but it just doesn&#x27;t seem to have the same power when it&#x27;s cordless.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say this brush does a 130% job because it still pulls at the knots some and with the size of the brush in comparison to her 5 year old head, I sometimes knock the hard plastic &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; on her scalp if I&#x27;m not cautious; however, it is a great improvement from anything we have ever tried.</li>
            <li> this thing is really cool.\\</li>
            <li> I also like the charging cord so it is always ready when we need it.</li>
            <li> Suffice to say, the Remington didn&#x27;t get much use after trying them both side by side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would often wear hooded clothing to try to conceal my hair because it would get knotted up so much that I couldn&#x27;t always brush it out no matter what I did.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tangled hair has been a part of my whole life.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this wonder product!</li>
            <li> My daughter has very curly hair.</li>
            <li> , it is just very time consuming.</li>
            <li> Though it is just a comb, it is very indiscreet.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t really paying attention.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used wide toothed combs and they were ok, but still there were tears and screaming, and you know, in the process her hair gets ripped out.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have very tangly hair anyway, but it went through like butter.  </li>
            <li> (better wet)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m numb yet mystified yet happy yet excited yet freaked yet ready to go wash my hair again......................</li>
            <li> If I were rich enough (hah!)</li>
            <li> The true length of my hair is 20 inches total.</li>
            <li> She didn&#x27;t want it at the time (though she might now that she&#x27;s older)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, for the Tangle Tamer, I bought the \\&quot;Wet\\&quot; Brush at the same time, so I wasn&#x27;t impressed.  </li>
            <li> Grand kids who HATE brushing their hair use this with joy.</li>
            <li> She will now willingly sit down and let me brush her hair without going into a fit of tears from pain.</li>
            <li> I think the best improvement over my tangle tamer brush is less hair loss and as we know hair breakage is damage so that is not good.  </li>
            <li> Send it back to the manufacturer and get it replaced because it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> I got mine for a ridiculously low price here on Amazon so it was worth experimenting with.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought the hand brushes (like you groom a horse with) &amp; even the new Michel Mercier Detangling Brush.</li>
            <li> Remington has come out with a new improved model of this which I was hoping to get my hands on.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve ordered the new model twice, which by the way, Amazon is advertising yet on both occasions</li>
            <li> Remington has come out with a new improved model of this which I was hoping to get my hands on.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve ordered the new model twice, which by the way, Amazon is advertising yet on both occasions</li>
            <li> I bought this new at a grocery store for $7 years ago.</li>
            <li> My 7 year old has nearly waist length hair and a very tender head.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is also very loud.</li>
            <li> I bought this last week and used it for the first yesterday.</li>
            <li> My hair was completely tangle-free after using it!</li>
            <li> When it was sold on Amazon it priced at $10.00, now third party sellers are selling it for $55.00 and higher.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is so simple that I cannot figure out exactly why it works so well.  </li>
            <li> We use it everyday, usually twice a day, so I&#x27;d say that is a pretty good length of time to not be needing a charge.</li>
            <li> We love it so much I&#x27;m buying my second one right now for my down stairs bathroom!!!!</li>
            <li> If you use a regular comb you can feel the snags as you move along and be more careful, but with this you really can&#x27;t unless it&#x27;s a big knot.</li>
            <li> I feared that old faithful might break down so bought 2 more as back ups.</li>
            <li> Brush\\&quot; is is by far the clear winner.  </li>
            <li> I see that they have recommended this for children with my problem, but please don&#x27;t let that scare you from buying this product if you are an adult.</li>

            <li> She wakes up every day with a mass of tangled hair in the back of her head, and combing her hair has been a real battle.  </li>
            <li> Every time a friend or family member notices it, they use it and are like WOW I WANT ONE.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;ve sent the old model</li>

            <li> I frequently cut out mats (like your Persian cat!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They stopped making it, and mine, despite much TLC,  finally died</li>
            <li> + year old will never break.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> my unexpected surprise</li>
            <li> The gentle vibrations and low hum from the twisting teeth do not appear to bother the dogs.</li>
            <li> I have Curly/Kinky hair that is transitioning to natural.</li>
            <li> Of those, 6\\&quot; are natural, the rest is relaxed.</li>
            <li> I will revisit this product again when my hair is fully natural</li>
            <li> But I am a white woman with straight hair.</li>
            <li> but it really doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as regular combs do.</li>
            <li> but it really doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as regular combs do.</li>
            <li> I bought this comb for a close friend of mine after seeing it mentioned on a bunch of natural hair forums.</li>
            <li> me tell you, my 4 year old daughter has curly curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Since she&#x27;s 2 years old</li>
            <li> NO CRYING.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Initially I bought it for my three year old daughter.</li>
            <li> I saw that it worked on African-American hair, their hair can be thick and coarse, as mine is at times, so I wanted to try it on my own hair.</li>
            <li> it is broken off and the package is still fully intact if it breaks so easily before even bring used I can&#x27;t imagine it being able to handle my tight curls</li>
            <li> As long as you&#x27;re very patient and have the time, this works pretty well to untangle my daughter&#x27;s very long hair.  </li>
            <li> This product actually works quite well for fine hair that is very straight and very long... both wet and dry.  </li>
            <li> It only got broken because of our own negligence.  </li>
            <li> The Tangle Tamer vibrates to help remove the tangles, so it grabs her fine hairs and pulls so hard that it snaps and breaks the strands.  </li>
            <li> My mom had bought it from Dollar General some years ago.  </li>
            <li> daughter just turned 5 and is willing to keep her hair long as long as we have her detangling</li>
            <li> The wet brush is so gentle yet it gets through tangled hair (</li>
            <li> I still have to use a smaller toothed comb to get the hair completely combed out.</li>
            <li> No wide tooth comb can compare to this.  </li>
            <li> and my daughter has such &#x27;texture&#x27; naturally.  </li>
            <li> Sorry, I know this supposed to be a review for the Remington Tangle Tamer, but I can&#x27;t stop loving on my \\&quot;Wet\\&quot; brush.  </li>
            <li> as of today, they&#x27;re advertising the new purple model but keep shipping the old pink model.</li>
            <li> as of today, they&#x27;re advertising the new purple model but keep shipping the old pink model.</li>
            <li> but I should have known from the super straight thin hair of the model they used however</li>
            <li> I put in a leave-in conditioner first and then hit the button on this odd looking tool.  </li>
            <li> This tool help tremendously with that, but I still have to be patient and take small sections.</li>
            <li> This is damaging if you have any hair texture other than straight.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a lot of similar brushes that claim to be gentle while detangling but the \\&quot;Wet</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I think that this product is truly a life saver for the life of my hair and my social life.</li>
            <li> Overall, I think that this product is truly a life saver for the life of my hair and my social life.</li>
            <li> I initially considered purchasing this item because I have a 4 year old daughter with long, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Two have long thick hair and one has fine long hair and this tool gets through it all with ease.</li>
            <li> My mom ended up giving me hers, but I felt bad, especially since she truly loved the product; therefore, I will be purchasing this product and giving it to her.  </li>
            <li> does take an extra minute to brush through, as you have to go slow, but it is well worth it in my book.</li>
            <li> I thought I would give it to my niece who has very, very thick, long red hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li> And, my normally non-reflective, rough-scratchy hair is now shinier and smoother (less ripping and abrasion, I imagine).</li>
            <li> So it gets very tangled, especially since over the past year I have suffered a lot of postpartum shedding, which creates a lot of knots that take forever to get out.  </li>
            <li> Two minutes of gentle combing and no more knots.(even after being out in the wind or neglecting to detangle before bedtime).  </li>
            <li> If there was a possibility of it being brushed out somehow, it would have taken hours and hours, my hair is extremely long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though it works for some, this product was clearly not designed for big curly hair.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is true that it gets the tangles out, but the pain is worse than any brush.  </li>
            <li> Not bad, but certainly not great.</li>
            <li> The little stand thing that comes with it does a fine job of keeping it upright and it takes up very little space!</li>
            <li> I am African American and have spent a life time of pulling and tugging at my hair.</li>
            <li> it was unbelievably smooth and knocked down brushing time from about 5 minutes to 1 !!!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Wearing my hair short only makes it worse - it tangles at the base of the scalp and when it&#x27;s short, its fine texture makes it fly all over the place and tangle worse.  </li>
            <li> As a mother of 3 girls with long hair, this is a life saver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for so long</li>
            <li> Buy this if you or your child have long hair.</li>
            <li> You do not want to be in a bathroom in a shared house for a long time with something</li>
            <li> used to drag having to wash my hair only because of the time I would have to spend trying to brush it afterwards.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews and researching many similar products, being very skeptical, I thought what the</li>
            <li> Before this product:&lt;br /&gt;My hair would get tangled very easily and end up in mats/knots that seemed nearly impossible to remove.</li>
            <li> If only it could cover a larger amount of hair then this would be a higher rated product from my end, but since it can only cover a small amount at a time with since it&#x27;s small comb, it&#x27;s a waste of time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That is why I use this after a shampoo and stick to the manual detangler brush when the hair is dry for convenience sake of just tossing that in the purse.  </li>
            <li> So I started sending her to bed with a single pony tail and that seemed to help.  </li>
            <li> Wet or dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product and we&#x27;ve used it on wet hair and dry hair</li>
            <li> These knots were balled up tightly in a knot as big as my fist sometimes, just from showering alone or from sleeping and rolling over a lot.</li>
            <li> Who needs/wants to mess with a big &#x27;ole cordless brush (even if it was pink) buzzing in your ear when the \\&quot;Wet\\</li>
            <li> Half the time I didn&#x27;t even brush it because it was such a big hassle with her crying.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair that goes half way down my back.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall: Not for little girls or women with massive amounts of hair like me.</li>
            <li> Awkward and cheap.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has the most stubborn and painful tangles in her hair.</li>
            <li> and she complains that it is painful on her scalp when untangling the hair on the top of her head.  </li>
            <li> Dead ends are a nightmare to manage after a long, long time of not having them treated.</li>
            <li> Have used it daily at least once, and have only charged it 2 times since Christmas</li>
            <li> (I was also curious</li>
            <li> even wet tangled hair)</li>
            <li> This comb makes combing our wet hair a breeze.  </li>
            <li> I have tried everything from Denman brushes, wide teeth combs, tangle TEEZERS, bone teeth combs, just everything.</li>
            <li> Then a few years ago [as I got into my 60s] I would wake up in the morning and find that my hair had matted in several areas.  </li>
            <li> The comb had a pink flower to hold it upright.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It sat for almost two months unopened UNTIL I woke this morning with a mammoth matted spot just under my left ear measuring about 2 inches round.  </li>
            <li> I have waist length hair and always used one of those wide tooth rakes.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, and did not work in my daughters hair.</li>
            <li> With this brush I untangle my wet hair in no time, I don&#x27;t even need to use the detangler spray anymore.  </li>
            <li> While using it on wet hair</li>
            <li> This product does travel well, hold a charge and get you through a rough spot on a trip when you need your hair done.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I would definitely recommend this product for anyone with thick or curly hair.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it gets into her thick hair enough to properly brush it.  </li>
            <li> Fine straight very long hair is the worst nightmare of tangles in all the hair world.</li>
            <li> My wife has tight, curly hair and can wear it long because of this de-tangler.</li>
            <li> You just very slowly move the comb down your hair while it&#x27;s turned on and it will gently and gradually shake the tangles away.</li>
            <li> My children are mixed races and their hair is very tightly curled.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin but highly dense.</li>
            <li> I use it on my 5 year old and it is not good at all.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical about this</li>
            <li> P.S., my child is african-american and has very thick, naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> The teeth on it are made out of hard plastic, so if it touches her head or back she cries.  </li>
            <li> the hassle of returning the item is just not worth the stress</li>
            <li> My daughter will actually willingly sit down and let me comb her hair now that it&#x27;s no longer such a painful process for her.  </li>
            <li> When it arrived it was a magenta comb with pale pink highlights.  </li>
            <li> I used to send her to bed with her hair down and damp</li>
            <li> It looked like it wouldn&#x27;t do anything much less</li>
            <li> I see a slight improvement ...</li>
            <li> My little girl has hair down to her booty</li>
            <li> The problem is that it is too slow, specially in long hair and it often snags your hair without you noticing.</li>
            <li> My youngest daughter has super curly hair that tangles badly.  </li>
            <li> The little osscillating bristles separate and slide through tangles without having to tug or pull.  </li>
            <li> it looked like My Little Pony or Barbie packaging.  </li>
            <li> even if you&#x27;re no longer a little girl.  </li>
            <li> The colors are designed for a child but mattered little to me.</li>
            <li> My hair gets uber tangled and when I say uber tangled I really mean it, whether it be wet or dry but slightly worse when wet.</li>
            <li> After using it, I had all dead ends cut off from my hair.</li>
            <li> After a few months I dug it out and tried it on my hair...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to use adult expensive shampoos, conditioners, treatments</li>
            <li> So, I washed my hair and didn&#x27;t use conditioner, towel dried it, and then went at it with the &amp;#34;Remington Tangle Tamer.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> cause nothing I found or tried would effect the birds nest of a knot that we had to deal with everyday but the moment I ran this through her hair</li>
            <li> She has very thick, long hair.  </li>
            <li> I like that they can even do it themselves and we need to use very little detangling spray.</li>
            <li> comb is SO SMALL, covers very little hair at a time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more tears or even fears</li>
            <li> and now I walk past the barbershop instead of peering into.</li>
            <li> I was extremely skeptical of it actually working.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why.</li>
            <li> My stick-straight hair had this horrible chemical process one too many times, I guess, because fast-forward twenty years</li>
            <li> My 9 year old gets the worst tagles in her hair especially in the underneath stuff closed to her neck.  </li>
            <li> While we still have to work through small sections to get through the tangles, this does not pull her hair</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the battery and questioned if it would constantly need to be charged.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable, indeed.</li>
            <li> Finally, my girls don&#x27;t hate having their hair brushed!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like that you have to plug it in because the kids always get water everywhere on the sink so that dosent really work:(</li>
            <li> long so I began the tedious task of almost literally pulling the hair apart strand by strand.</li>
            <li> It would have been impossible to brush my hair wet, dry, with or without oils/conditioners because of the severity of the tangles this time.</li>
            <li> With that in mind, it would be unreasonable to hold this too hard against Remington, since it is not aimed for this consumer market.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe.</li>
            <li> I was shocked, surprised and  well</li>
            <li> I had this item overnighted to me because I just had to see if it was actually going to work or not, I was extremely desperate to find an answer to my extremely thick and knotted hair.</li>
            <li> and I have thick hair, and it can be somewhat difficult to comb through when wet.  </li>
            <li> The dogs hated to be brushed and always put up a fight to traditional combs and brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve noticed it doesn&#x27;t keep a charge quite like it once</li>
            <li> You have to go slow</li>
            <li> It can be a slow process</li>
            <li> My daughter has thick curly hair which knots up with the slightest movement.</li>
            <li> Big thumbs down:(</li>
            <li> I mean I felt light-headed.</li>
            <li> I still have to use the same process of starting at the bottom for the worst tangles, but the comb does all the work.  </li>
            <li> Seriously...</li>
            <li> and it has seriously just made a world of difference in our house.&lt;br</li>
            <li> bad white mommy!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less painful for her now when I comb with Tangle Tamer and hence less fights between us!</li>
            <li> Well at least I can help someone else get off of the anti-detangling-anxiety pills!</li>
            <li> It gets the tangles out you just have to run it very slowly through the hair.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is mid-back length, very thick, and I relax it every 12 weeks.  </li>
            <li> but so FEW!!!  </li>
            <li> I have loaded my hair with conditioner to help work the tangles out and NOTHING except broken hairs EVERYWHERE.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be re-ordering until they fix this issue as it&#x27;s become too frustrating.</li>
            <li> They probably got broken ones.  </li>
            <li> Plus, I receive it damaged with one of the bristles broken off</li>
            <li> I mean she would scream and cry so loud that the people downstairs probably thought the worst of us.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was skeptical after all it was a bargain price</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it difficult to detangle as is</li>
            <li> Now don&#x27;t get me wrong....</li>
            <li> but it did loosen up the horrible knots and tangles enough to take hours</li>
            <li> We were both skeptical when it arrived because it looks like it would tangle the heck out of hair--it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> It is bulky and awkward to hold.  </li>
            <li> It truly does do the impossible.</li>
            <li> I now use this product every morning and every night to prevent the bad tangles and knots from happening again.</li>
            <li> and I felt sooo bad for her.  </li>
            <li> In fact I was so frustrated I had resorted to braiding my hair and keeping it braided.</li>
            <li> I thought this was going to be a painful experience.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t combed out my hair in week as I was sick in bed.  </li>
            <li> We bought it based on all of the five star reviews, but are so disappointed in it.  </li>
            <li> I also use it on my son who hated having his hair combed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> because I couldn&#x27;t find a stupid comb!</li>
            <li> tangled mane drove me insane until I found this tool.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work for my daughters hair</li>
            <li> I purchased this as an impulse buy because I got an email stating it was on sale for pretty cheap and had free shipping at the time (if memory serves). I thought I would give it to my niece who has very, very thick, long red hair that tangles easily. She didn&#x27;t want it at the time (though she might now that she&#x27;s older) and I have never used it since a regular comb works well enough for me. I do believe I have it in a bag for my next yard sale. Kind of a novelty item unless you really know someone whose hair gets very tangled and would be interested in taking the time to plug it in to use it. I did try it when I first got it, and it did get the tangles out, I just find it to be more of a pain to get it out, plug it in and use it when I don&#x27;t really need it. Not a big fan of this one.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that tangles easily.  In fact I was so frustrated I had resorted to braiding my hair and keeping it braided. However recently I have been leaving it out and combing out my hair has been work. I contemplated going in for the bald look or getting a buzz cut.  Anything to stop my daily struggle.  I bought this last week and used it for the first yesterday. I was skeptical after all it was a bargain price and well you get what you pay for.  I was shocked, surprised and  well DE-TANGLED!  I followed the directions and even the kitchen was comb able.  I hadn&#x27;t combed out my hair in week as I was sick in bed.  I thought this was going to be a painful experience. I put in a leave-in conditioner first and then hit the button on this odd looking tool.  No Tugging! If I hit a snag I took it out and started again. With in minutes by hair was combed out and tangled free.  The texture remained the same, just comb able and more importantly Manageable! I am buying another one as we speak to keep as a back up.  \\&quot;My tangled mane drove me insane until I found this tool.  No more tears or even fears this thing is really cool.\\&quot; The title implied a ballad that&#x27;s the best I could do.. and now I walk past the barbershop instead of peering into.</li>
            <li> Awkward and cheap.  Didn&#x27;t work for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Amazing!  Amazing!  Amazing! Did I mention that it is absolutely Amazing?!?!?!?!?!  How did I not hear about this sooner??  I just received mine on Friday and I can&#x27;t even imagine detangling my daughters&#x27; hair without it ever again.  I am definitely buying more in case anything happens to ours.  This is a MUST HAVE for every girl and boy with curly hair.  My girls have Type 4 coily hair and this comb is the only comb that has ever run through their hair with ease.  Thank you Remington for a brush that doesn&#x27;t tug and pull and hurt!  They aren&#x27;t kidding when they say no tears!  Finally, my girls don&#x27;t hate having their hair brushed!  We love it!!!</li>
            <li> As a mother of 3 girls with long hair, this is a life saver. My girls used to scream and cry when we brushed hair. This is so nice that gently gets the tangles out. Two have long thick hair and one has fine long hair and this tool gets through it all with ease. I like that they can even do it themselves and we need to use very little detangling spray. I also like the charging cord so it is always ready when we need it. Must have in this house!</li>
            <li> I bought the Remington Tangle Tamer Wet/Dry &amp; it was...OK.  Unfortunately, for the Tangle Tamer, I bought the \\&quot;Wet\\&quot; Brush at the same time, so I wasn&#x27;t impressed.  Who needs/wants to mess with a big &#x27;ole cordless brush (even if it was pink) buzzing in your ear when the \\&quot;Wet\\&quot; Brush just gets it done lickety split (I also didn&#x27;t like the idea of giving up an outlet or precious counter space to charge my brush! Suffice to say, the Remington didn&#x27;t get much use after trying them both side by side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a lot of similar brushes that claim to be gentle while detangling but the \\&quot;Wet Brush\\&quot; is is by far the clear winner.  I&#x27;ve bought the hand brushes (like you groom a horse with) &amp; even the new Michel Mercier Detangling Brush. My daughter liked the \\&quot;look\\&quot; of the Mercier brush, &amp; begged me to buy it for her (I was also curious so I relented). But nothing has beat the \\&quot;Wet\\&quot; brush. Sorry, I know this supposed to be a review for the Remington Tangle Tamer, but I can&#x27;t stop loving on my \\&quot;Wet\\&quot; brush.  I don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;s different but it is VERY different. I am losing my hair (darn thyroid!) so I try not to help it by ripping it out with a regular brush. The wet brush is so gentle yet it gets through tangled hair (even wet tangled hair)....it&#x27;s a miracle brush. Wet or dry. Plus it&#x27;s cheaper and comes in different colors - even metallic.</li>
            <li> It gets the tangles out you just have to run it very slowly through the hair.&lt;br /&gt;One of the bristles broke off when my daughter opened the packaged, but the rest of the bristles seem sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not pay full price but for the cost of a regular brush its an okay deal</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to add pics but not seeing that option I&#x27;m using my phone. The bottom prong/tooth whatever you call it is broken off and the package is still fully intact if it breaks so easily before even bring used I can&#x27;t imagine it being able to handle my tight curls but I should have known from the super straight thin hair of the model they used however the hassle of returning the item is just not worth the stress</li>
            <li> I had doubts about this product, but I am so glad I gave it a try. LOVE IT! Works great on both myself and my 6 y/o daughter.</li>
            <li> Before this product:&lt;br /&gt;My hair would get tangled very easily and end up in mats/knots that seemed nearly impossible to remove. These knots were balled up tightly in a knot as big as my fist sometimes, just from showering alone or from sleeping and rolling over a lot. I have very thick hair. I am Caucasian and still have this problem. I saw that it worked on African-American hair, their hair can be thick and coarse, as mine is at times, so I wanted to try it on my own hair. It would have been impossible to brush my hair wet, dry, with or without oils/conditioners because of the severity of the tangles this time. If there was a possibility of it being brushed out somehow, it would have taken hours and hours, my hair is extremely long. Dead ends are a nightmare to manage after a long, long time of not having them treated. Dealing with my hair was a living nightmare that took part of me away. I would often wear hooded clothing to try to conceal my hair because it would get knotted up so much that I couldn&#x27;t always brush it out no matter what I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After this product:&lt;br /&gt;Wow, I am amazed and I am able to say that this item really is something of a miracle worker. I was extremely skeptical of it actually working. I had this item overnighted to me because I just had to see if it was actually going to work or not, I was extremely desperate to find an answer to my extremely thick and knotted hair. This was the perfect solution. This managed my entire head of knotted hair within thirty minutes. My hair was completely tangle-free after using it! After using it, I had all dead ends cut off from my hair. I now use this product every morning and every night to prevent the bad tangles and knots from happening again. I&#x27;m so happy to have found this item! It truly does do the impossible. You just very slowly move the comb down your hair while it&#x27;s turned on and it will gently and gradually shake the tangles away. Its vibration and twisting seems to do the trick. If you get stuck somewhere, just use a comb or brush and try to brush it out the best you can, then go back to using this little device to try to get out what the comb or brush could not. I see that they have recommended this for children with my problem, but please don&#x27;t let that scare you from buying this product if you are an adult. I am nineteen years old and I enjoyed using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think that this product is truly a life saver for the life of my hair and my social life. I feel so much better now that my hair is under control. I really loved this product and I think you will, too, if you have hair like mine or have a child with unruly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- seruki.com&lt;br /&gt;~ Lizmewhere, just use a comb or brush and try to brush it out the best you can, then go back to using this little device to try to get out what the comb or brush could not.

            <li> I initially considered purchasing this item because I have a 4 year old daughter with long, curly hair.  She wakes up every day with a mass of tangled hair in the back of her head, and combing her hair has been a real battle.  I purchased this item with a fair dose of skepticism, but I was willing to try it based on the previous positive reviews.  And what do you know...it actually works!  It slides through tangles with relative ease.  I still have to use the same process of starting at the bottom for the worst tangles, but the comb does all the work.  The little osscillating bristles separate and slide through tangles without having to tug or pull.  My daughter will actually willingly sit down and let me comb her hair now that it&#x27;s no longer such a painful process for her.  We&#x27;ve also discovered that it works great for combing hair after washing it.  My oldest daughter and I have thick hair, and it can be somewhat difficult to comb through when wet.  This comb makes combing our wet hair a breeze.  So now all the ladies in our house are using this comb on a daily basis, and we love it.  It can be used cordless, or plugged in.  We almost always use it plugged in because it seems to have more power that way.  It charges just fine, but it just doesn&#x27;t seem to have the same power when it&#x27;s cordless.  However, the plug doesn&#x27;t bother us in any way when we use it.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this product for anyone with thick or curly hair.  It&#x27;s been great for my family.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m speechless. I don&#x27;t know where to start. My hair gets uber tangled and when I say uber tangled I really mean it, whether it be wet or dry but slightly worse when wet. I was told by a hair stylist it&#x27;s because of the fine texture of my hair. I am African American and had natural hair for years and got a relaxer for a few years and now transitioning to natural again. Tangled hair has been a part of my whole life. I literally feel like I need anti-anxiety meds to cope with the detangling process! I have tried everything from Denman brushes, wide teeth combs, tangle TEEZERS, bone teeth combs, just everything. I have loaded my hair with conditioner to help work the tangles out and NOTHING except broken hairs EVERYWHERE. I tried this thing for the first time yesterday and almost fainted. I mean I felt light-headed. It went through my hair like water. I&#x27;ve never had that happen before. I didn&#x27;t know what to do, what to think.............why hadn&#x27;t I discovered this years ago?? I&#x27;m numb yet mystified yet happy yet excited yet freaked yet ready to go wash my hair again......................OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/9/2014............I just received my 6th tangle tamer today. Every time a friend or family member notices it, they use it and are like WOW I WANT ONE. Then I have to give em one from my stash.....RATS! Well at least I can help someone else get off of the anti-detangling-anxiety pills! I wanna make sure I have plenty in stock just in case they stop making these. I&#x27;ve seen products come and go so you never know but in case they don&#x27;t PLEASE MAKE MORE COLORS!!!! It would be nice to see some blues, greens, reds, whites, blacks or what have you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8/7/2015....They have officially sold out or discontinued this item.....I knew the day would come! When it was sold on Amazon it priced at $10.00, now third party sellers are selling it for $55.00 and higher. I saw one on Ebay for $75.00!! Let&#x27;s hope they bring it back. This thing is a miracle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update....2/15/2017&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently Remington has come out with a new improved model of this which I was hoping to get my hands on. However, I&#x27;ve ordered the new model twice, which by the way, Amazon is advertising yet on both occasions they&#x27;ve sent the old model so I&#x27;ve had to return them both. Hopefully Amazon will fix this issue. But buyer beware....as of today, they&#x27;re advertising the new purple model but keep shipping the old pink model. I won&#x27;t be re-ordering until they fix this issue as it&#x27;s become too frustrating.r /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update....2/15/2017&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently Remington has come out with a new improved model of this which I was hoping to get my hands on.

            <li> We bought it based on all of the five star reviews, but are so disappointed in it.  My 7 year old has nearly waist length hair and a very tender head.  Yes, it is true that it gets the tangles out, but the pain is worse than any brush.  It is bulky and awkward to hold.  The teeth on it are made out of hard plastic, so if it touches her head or back she cries.  The Tangle Tamer vibrates to help remove the tangles, so it grabs her fine hairs and pulls so hard that it snaps and breaks the strands.  We used it 3 times before I gave up.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is truly a 5 star product! My daughter has the most stubborn and painful tangles in her hair. Instead of bearing the pain, she mostly decides to leave it alone. I decided to try this after reading the reviews and let me tell you, they are all correct.  This can be used as corded or cordless after charging it.  You just turn it on and start combing gently and voila- the tangles slowly go away leaving hair nice and smooth! This is one product that I would say to grab at this price. I highly recommend this wonder product!</li>
            <li> This Tangle Tamer is only good for seemingly untangled hair. This is damaging if you have any hair texture other than straight.</li>
            <li> I bought this new at a grocery store for $7 years ago. Fantastic. My wife has tight, curly hair and can wear it long because of this de-tangler. I have a long beard and in the morning this is perfect. Grand kids who HATE brushing their hair use this with joy. I found another at a garage sale for $2...never used but no charger. One charger for the two is enough. Fantastic product and it does what it claims.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that goes half way down my back. And I have super fine hair that tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was younger, I used baby hair de-tangling spray which helped somewhat.  Then a few years ago [as I got into my 60s] I would wake up in the morning and find that my hair had matted in several areas.  Nothing worked to de-tangle.  I finally had to use the scissors and cut off huge chunks of hair!  At a time in my life when every strand of hair was precious.  I gave in to looking like a muskrat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fed up, I searched Amazon for a detangled ... anything.  I bought this item.  When it arrived it was a magenta comb with pale pink highlights.  it looked like My Little Pony or Barbie packaging.  The comb had a pink flower to hold it upright.  i groaned and tossed it back into the box ... a  TOY!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sat for almost two months unopened UNTIL I woke this morning with a mammoth matted spot just under my left ear measuring about 2 inches round.  I vowed to try the comb when I got home from work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT WORKS!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I worked on the mat for about 5 minutes.  Eventually, the mat totally was gone.  Yes, there were some hairs that came out but so FEW!!!  If you have tangle problems, buy it ... even if you&#x27;re no longer a little girl.  :o)</li>
            <li> Not the greatest contraption out there for hair detanglement.... Don&#x27;t like that you have to plug it in because the kids always get water everywhere on the sink so that dosent really work:(</li>
            <li> My earliest memory of my hair is my screaming while my Mom raked a comb through it.  It&#x27;s more &amp;#34;krinkly&amp;#34; (and tangle-prone) than curly. Conditioners donâ€™t detangle it.  I&#x27;ve been tempted to just give up and sport dreadlocks.  I can comb my hair tangle free (yes, it takes 15-20 minutes), walk across the room, then it&#x27;s tangled again.  I frequently cut out mats (like your Persian cat!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wearing my hair short only makes it worse - it tangles at the base of the scalp and when it&#x27;s short, its fine texture makes it fly all over the place and tangle worse.  Back in the 1970&#x27;s, I had an electric comb called &amp;#34;Purrr detangler&amp;#34; by Gillete.  They stopped making it, and mine, despite much TLC,  finally died and I&#x27;d given  up hope.  Then I found out about this miracle! Two minutes of gentle combing and no more knots.(even after being out in the wind or neglecting to detangle before bedtime).  If I were rich enough (hah!), I&#x27;d buy the company so they would never stop making this!  And, my normally non-reflective, rough-scratchy hair is now shinier and smoother (less ripping and abrasion, I imagine).</li>
            <li> I borrowed this item from my mom in hopes of easing the combing process of my child&#x27;s hair.  The product was fabulous.  It allowed me to comb the tangled hair with ease, which was beneficial to my child.  My mom had bought it from Dollar General some years ago.  I tried searching stores for it, but with no luck.  My mom ended up giving me hers, but I felt bad, especially since she truly loved the product; therefore, I will be purchasing this product and giving it to her.  P.S., my child is african-american and has very thick, naturally curly hair.  So the product is ideal for this type of hair.</li>
            <li> I found one of these in a closeout section of a drug store years ago and decided to try it. The colors are designed for a child but mattered little to me. I have waist length hair and always used one of those wide tooth rakes. This is a dream come true. The vibration cuts right through the mats around the neck. I&#x27;ve used it for so long I can&#x27;t imagine anything else. I feared that old faithful might break down so bought 2 more as back ups. One for our summer cottage. Of course now the 15+ year old will never break.&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation: Buy this if you or your child have long hair. Stays charged for a long time so is good for travel. I love love love this comb, even the pink and purple.</li>
            <li> This is worth the purchase. My daughter has very curly hair. It&#x27;s less painful for her now when I comb with Tangle Tamer and hence less fights between us!</li>
            <li> While most of the reviews on the Remington Tangle Tamer are focused on use by humans, my usage intent was for my pets. I have west highland and scottish terriers that are constantly getting their skirts tangled and matted. The dogs hated to be brushed and always put up a fight to traditional combs and brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my unexpected surprise, the comb works wonderfully and with little fuss from the pets.  The gentle vibrations and low hum from the twisting teeth do not appear to bother the dogs. You just comb though the skirt letting the bush set the pace (no need to pull the comb â€“ and the fur).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend this for fussy pets and even tried it on one of our cats to remove the matted fur â€“ worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li> This thing works wonders on my relaxed hair!  I used to spend about 3 hours detangling my hair (yes, you read that right).  My hair is mid-back length, very thick, and I relax it every 12 weeks.  So it gets very tangled, especially since over the past year I have suffered a lot of postpartum shedding, which creates a lot of knots that take forever to get out.  This tool help tremendously with that, but I still have to be patient and take small sections.</li>
            <li> I found this right before Christmas &#x27;10.&lt;br /&gt;Really did not think it would work, but figured it would be a great stocking stuffer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter just turned 5 and is willing to keep her hair long as long as we have her detangling brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It fell off the counter on the first day, didn&#x27;t have the guard on it and it broke a tooth.  Thought it was ruined, but it has worked perfectly regardless!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing holds a charge like nothing I have ever owned!  Have used it daily at least once, and have only charged it 2 times since Christmas Day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We do not keep the guard on it, in fact threw it away.  It only got broken because of our own negligence.  The little stand thing that comes with it does a fine job of keeping it upright and it takes up very little space!</li>
            <li> I have owned this product for years now.  I used to work for Remington and they gave away \\&quot;bucks\\&quot; as a bonus for the holiday period.  I didn&#x27;t know what to spend them on and I already had purchased an electric razor for everyone in the family and then some.  So, I saw this and purchased it.  I keep my hair in a perm all of the time.  I get split ends and tangles.&lt;br /&gt;This product has been a lifesaver.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt when trying to get the tangles out.  I&#x27;ve had mine for about 8 years now and still running well.  Lately I&#x27;ve noticed it doesn&#x27;t keep a charge quite like it once did so I decided to come online and see if they were still around.  They are..and only 12.99 at that.  I am so happy I can get a replacement one even if it has to sit around another year before I might need it.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product.  If you have kids it is a must have.  If you get split ends easily it is a must have.</li>
            <li> I bought two in hopes that I would love this. Very disappointed.  I use it on my 5 year old and it is not good at all. Very cheaply made and it pulls her hair. Big thumbs down:(</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, and did not work in my daughters hair.</li>
            <li> I have Curly/Kinky hair that is transitioning to natural. My hair is thin but highly dense. The true length of my hair is 20 inches total. Of those, 6\\&quot; are natural, the rest is relaxed. I don&#x27;t find it difficult to detangle as is, it is just very time consuming. I was in the market for something to reduce the time I spend at it and found this here on amazon. This comb does what it says it does: It glides through the hair and it&#x27;s easy to use. The problem is that it is too slow, specially in long hair and it often snags your hair without you noticing. If you use a regular comb you can feel the snags as you move along and be more careful, but with this you really can&#x27;t unless it&#x27;s a big knot. If only it could cover a larger amount of hair then this would be a higher rated product from my end, but since it can only cover a small amount at a time with since it&#x27;s small comb, it&#x27;s a waste of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Great value.&lt;br /&gt;Works as described.&lt;br /&gt;Lasting Battery.&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a dock to make it stand upright&lt;br /&gt;Cute design&lt;br /&gt;Cordless&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;Very slow.&lt;br /&gt;The comb is SO SMALL, covers very little hair at a time.&lt;br /&gt;It is also very loud. Though it is just a comb, it is very indiscreet. You do not want to be in a bathroom in a shared house for a long time with something so loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Not for little girls or women with massive amounts of hair like me. I have had better results with a big shower comb in a shorter amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though it works for some, this product was clearly not designed for big curly hair. With that in mind, it would be unreasonable to hold this too hard against Remington, since it is not aimed for this consumer market. However, this review might be helpful for someone with similar hair texture who is also transitioning and looking to purchase this. I will revisit this product again when my hair is fully natural so I can offer a more comprehensive review, but for now it&#x27;sjust \\&quot;meh\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing!  My youngest daughter has super curly hair that tangles badly.  Half the time I didn&#x27;t even brush it because it was such a big hassle with her crying.  This works great.  You have to go slow but if you follow the directions, it gets right through the tangles.</li>
            <li> OK, this thing arrived at my house and I took one look at it and shoved it into the bathroom cabinet. It looked like it wouldn&#x27;t do anything much less handle my kids&#x27; very curly hair! After a few months I dug it out and tried it on my hair...because I couldn&#x27;t find a stupid comb! ARGH! Anyway, I liked how it went through my hair and began using it regularly on myself. But I am a white woman with straight hair. My children are mixed races and their hair is very tightly curled. Especially my older daughter who has a 4b/4c texture.&lt;br /&gt;Then, one day, my younger daughter came to me after a week or two of swimming and being at camp and showed me her hair...it had been kept in a pony tail so I wasn&#x27;t really paying attention. (I know...bad white mommy!) She literally had one solid dread lock on the back of her head!&lt;br /&gt;I am not one to run from a challenge and I like my daughters&#x27; hair long so I began the tedious task of almost literally pulling the hair apart strand by strand. That&#x27;s when I decided to try this Tangle Tamer. I was extremely skeptical that it would help at all...or even be able to get through any of her hair but to my very great surprise....it helped a lot!! Now don&#x27;t get me wrong....it wasn&#x27;t sliding through like butter but it did loosen up the horrible knots and tangles enough to take hours (yes I meant HOURS) off of that combing job. Now I keep this baby charged up and on the top of my counter in my bathroom. I use on my hair daily and I use it on my girls&#x27; hair regularly. It&#x27;s rotating tines go through the hair like when you take your fingers into a knotted bunch of strings and sort of rotate through till the tangles are loosened. It&#x27;s hard to describe. But it works.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: this comb thingy is good and will help get through the tangled messes easier. It will not be the only comb you need. I still have to use a smaller toothed comb to get the hair completely combed out. Another thing...it doesn&#x27;t hurt. Seriously...I am not sure why. Maybe it&#x27;s the vibrations of it or the fact that the comb sort of loosens the knot as you go through but it really doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as regular combs do. I notice this for myself and my daughters love that about it too. I recommend this thing.&#x27;s the vibrations of it or the fact that the comb sort of loosens the knot as you go through but it really doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as regular combs do. I notice this for myself and my daughters love that about it too. I recommend this thing.</li>
            <li> I bought this comb for a close friend of mine after seeing it mentioned on a bunch of natural hair forums. We were both skeptical when it arrived because it looks like it would tangle the heck out of hair--it doesn&#x27;t. In fact, this comb has cut hours out of her conditioning/detangling routine, literally hours.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical about this but I figured for $8 it&#x27;s worth a shot based on all the 5 star reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you, my 4 year old daughter has curly curly hair.  Since she&#x27;s 2 years old I&#x27;ve had to use adult expensive shampoos, conditioners, treatments, you name it, she&#x27;s used it.  I used to send her to bed with her hair down and damp and she would wake up with 1 million knots.  So I started sending her to bed with a single pony tail and that seemed to help.  I would comb her hair in the shower while it had conditioner in it (Pantene for curly hair) and there would be so many knots, she would scream and yell and cry and I felt sooo bad for her.  Her father and I don&#x27;t have curly hair and I&#x27;ve never had to deal with this before.  I&#x27;ve used wide toothed combs and they were ok, but still there were tears and screaming, and you know, in the process her hair gets ripped out.  I mean she would scream and cry so loud that the people downstairs probably thought the worst of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product and we&#x27;ve used it on wet hair and dry hair and it is AMAZING.  No wide tooth comb can compare to this.  I am considering ordering another one just to have on the side if and when this one breaks or dies.  It gets out every knot with ease, NO PAIN NO SCREAMING NO CRYING.  My husband and I are elated that we made this purchase, it has saved our sanity and our daugher&#x27;s.  I read the 2 one star reviews and I don&#x27;t understand how someone says this doesn&#x27;t work.  They probably got broken ones.  Send it back to the manufacturer and get it replaced because it is worth it.  This has saved our bedtime routine!!  THANK YOU REMINGTON!!!</li>
            <li> Saw this online and read the reviews. I am African American and have spent a life time of pulling and tugging at my hair. Nothing I have ever tried worked as well as the Tangle Tamer. Went right through my hair! I am totally sold on this and would recommend this to any and every one. I don&#x27;t know how someone dreamed this up but it works like magic and is worth every penny and more. I also use it on my son who hated having his hair combed. First time in his life he hasn&#x27;t cried when I combed his hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter likes that it doesn&#x27;t pull her hair but I don&#x27;t think it gets into her thick hair enough to properly brush it.  Plus, I receive it damaged with one of the bristles broken off but my daughter was so happy about it I didn&#x27;t want to return it.</li>
            <li> As long as you&#x27;re very patient and have the time, this works pretty well to untangle my daughter&#x27;s very long hair.  It does not seem to work nearly as well when her hair is wet and she complains that it is painful on her scalp when untangling the hair on the top of her head.  It&#x27;s quite large and noisy as well.  Not bad, but certainly not great.</li>
            <li> Had for 1 year, does a great job of getting out the knots in curly hair for our daughter.  It can be a slow process but it works.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t what I thought I bought</li>
            <li> Did you ever get a perm in the &#x27;80s-&#x27;90s just &#x27;for extra texture&#x27; (aka frizz)?  My stick-straight hair had this horrible chemical process one too many times, I guess, because fast-forward twenty years and my daughter has such &#x27;texture&#x27; naturally.  I don&#x27;t know if they even sell pics anymore, but I will tell you that every day for about two years we have fought and yelled and cried and whined every time I&#x27;ve brushed her shoulder-length frizz.  So, when I found out that this item existed, I figured it was worth a shot.  Can I just say that I have never been so pleased with a $12 purchase in my life?!  This thing has turned our nightmare mornings into slightly-less-nightmarish!  We no longer cry or scream or yell... about hair... and it has seriously just made a world of difference in our house.&lt;br /&gt;It is so simple that I cannot figure out exactly why it works so well.  I thought maybe it was just because we were brushing slower, but I wanted to see on my own hair if I could notice any difference.  So, I washed my hair and didn&#x27;t use conditioner, towel dried it, and then went at it with the &amp;#34;Remington Tangle Tamer.&amp;#34;  Mind you, I don&#x27;t have very tangly hair anyway, but it went through like butter.  I was amazed.&lt;br /&gt;It does take an extra minute to brush through, as you have to go slow, but it is well worth it in my book.</li>
            <li> This actually works.  My 9 year old gets the worst tagles in her hair especially in the underneath stuff closed to her neck.  She has very thick, long hair.  The only time we could comb her hair was right out of the shower and only with lots of good conditioner and spray.  While we still have to work through small sections to get through the tangles, this does not pull her hair and she&#x27;s not saying \\&quot;ouch\\&quot; any more. And, we can actually comb it now in between washings.  Yay!</li>
            <li> My daughter has thick curly hair which knots up with the slightest movement. I have tried numerous brushes/combs/products advertising painless untangling before buying this brush. I won&#x27;t say this brush does a 130% job because it still pulls at the knots some and with the size of the brush in comparison to her 5 year old head, I sometimes knock the hard plastic &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; on her scalp if I&#x27;m not cautious; however, it is a great improvement from anything we have ever tried. She will now willingly sit down and let me brush her hair without going into a fit of tears from pain. Brushing is no longer an ordeal! I was skeptical about the battery and questioned if it would constantly need to be charged. I let it charge fully when we received it (January) and it hasn&#x27;t shown signs of low battery life till now (March). We use it everyday, usually twice a day, so I&#x27;d say that is a pretty good length of time to not be needing a charge. All-in-all I am so thankful for this brush and wish I would have found it sooner!</li>
            <li> I came across this brush as one of the Amazon recommendations. Probably where I have been buying too many hair brushes in the search for &#x27;the one&#x27; for my waist line long hair. For the price I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially I bought it for my three year old daughter. While she loved the color and the flower stand and was all excited about brushing her hair, once I turned it on it was a big turn off for her and she ran away. She likes watching me using it, but she wouldn&#x27;t allow me to use it on her hair. Her loss, Mommy&#x27;s gain, I guess :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was somewhat reluctant as to how it can untangle your hair while using a spinning motion. Even now, with the brush in my hand I still don&#x27;t understand how the mechanism works but it did wonders to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to drag having to wash my hair only because of the time I would have to spend trying to brush it afterwards. Not to mention the amount of hair would break or pull during the process. I have straight, fine to medium textured hair and a lot of it. With this brush I untangle my wet hair in no time, I don&#x27;t even need to use the detangler spray anymore.  While using it on wet hair I can basically see the hair turning and spinning and all the knots opening up. After first use I looked at the brush to see how much hair I lost this time. I could only find one hair. Yes, there is no misspell, ONE hair. Unbelievable, indeed. I felt so excited, happy and all the happiness related feelings that the next day I sent the link to all my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy with it that I purchased a second one just in case this one would break or the manufacturer will discontinue it. It comes with a two year manufacturer warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end it turned out that this is &#x27;THE ONE&#x27; for me and now I can finally start saving. :-)</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews and researching many similar products, being very skeptical, I thought what the heck it&#x27;s I&#x27;ll give it a try and WOW is all I can really say!!!!  My little girl has hair down to her booty and I was almost to the point of having to cut it off and break her dream of being Rapunzel cause nothing I found or tried would effect the birds nest of a knot that we had to deal with everyday but the moment I ran this through her hair it was unbelievably smooth and knocked down brushing time from about 5 minutes to 1 !!!!! We love it so much I&#x27;m buying my second one right now for my down stairs bathroom!!!!</li>
            <li> This product actually works quite well for fine hair that is very straight and very long... both wet and dry.  (better wet)  I don&#x27;t see a huge improvement over my favorite detangling brush though.  I see a slight improvement ... but it is an improvement.  I think the best improvement over my tangle tamer brush is less hair loss and as we know hair breakage is damage so that is not good.  That is why I use this after a shampoo and stick to the manual detangler brush when the hair is dry for convenience sake of just tossing that in the purse.  This product does travel well, hold a charge and get you through a rough spot on a trip when you need your hair done.  I got mine for a ridiculously low price here on Amazon so it was worth experimenting with.  Glad I took the chance on it.  Fine straight very long hair is the worst nightmare of tangles in all the hair world. I think if it worked on my hair... it can work for anyone.  I have never had a hairdresser yet who will do my comb out after washing.  So yeah... I think this gadget is worth it to try if you are having problems.</li>
