            <li>I&#x27;ve even been commented on by a dentist saying I&#x27;d had the most healthy teeth he&#x27;d seen in months.</li>
            <li>very good, doesn&#x27;t taste that good like other over the counter products but way healthier!</li>
            <li>A friend gave us our first tube of this toothpaste and we loved it.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li>Love the taste - earthy - light grit - are my teeth</li>
            <li>Happily, my hygienist said I was back on track again and had healthy teeth/</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the clean feeling after brushing.</li>
            <li>My sensitivity has gone down as well which is a wonderful surprise.</li>
            <li>Not all natural toothpastes seem to lasts because they disolve too quickly, but this one does great and foams a bit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light milky brown color.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it&#x27;s cruelty free.</li>
            <li>My dentist is even a big fan and sees monks from a nearby buddhist monastery that use this toothpaste and they have great teeth, he says.</li>
            <li>I love the way it leaves my breath fresh and my teeth feel clean and shinny.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feels pretty clean, and the toothpaste feels very smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li>Clean feeling afterward.</li>
            <li>I am making a conscious choice to switch to all natural products and at first - this was not the most pleasant but after continuous use</li>
            <li>my mouth feels naturally clean and fresh all day.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean, and my breath is fresh.</li>
            <li>The minty flavor is mild, and once your mouth is rinsed, the mint doesn&#x27;t stay in your mouth or breath.</li>
            <li>I may have to try even more flavors when I run low :)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them to anyone that wants to have healthy lifestyles !</li>
            <li>This is the first cruelty free toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Because of the lack of minty after taste, my mouth doesn&#x27;t feel super fresh.</li>
            <li>Keeps teeth cleaned and breath fresh.  </li>
            <li>I like the Fresh Mint taste.</li>
            <li>Ditch your old toothpaste and do something healthy for yourself.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a natural tasting, healthy toothpaste with no fluoride, and I found it.</li>
            <li>Getting the pack of 5 was definitely cost effective.</li>
            <li>Noticed results after the first two brushings.</li>
            <li>It is interesting and different.</li>
            <li>I never have cavities, and for the most part, my teeth are naturally white.</li>
            <li>No yellow, no stains, just healthy.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the bundling discount!</li>
            <li>and he is very picky.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it seems to leave my toothbrush in a light shade of brown.</li>
            <li>She asked what I had done to my dental routine, because she had never seen so much plaque on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I always have had sensibility for cold foods, but looks like not anymore with this wonderful toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I did some research and let&#x27;s just say everything I found was very eye-opening.</li>
            <li>It whitens and removes tartar really well.</li>
            <li>I really recommend it...</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is by far better than any other flouride free, natural product.</li>
            <li>I love about this product (including less time in the dentist&#x27;s chair)</li>
            <li>Right around age 50, I began experiencing sensitivity on one and then two of my teeth, not only to hot/cold, but when getting my teeth cleaned at the dentist office, in particular.</li>
            <li>First off, I bought it for my baby sister who was 6 at the time though she brushed he teeth very fervently.</li>
            <li>No fluoride, nothing to destroy my enamel (whitening), and it still makes my mouth feel very clean.  </li>
            <li>First off, I already knew fluoride was a poison, but in low quantities I assumed it killed bacteria and nothing more.</li>
            <li>She had cavities all the time, and 2-3 new ones every time we visited a dentist.</li>
            <li>I was getting low on my last 5-tube purchase and was about to buy more when I saw only two reviews on Auromere&#x27;s toothpaste, so had to chime in.</li>
            <li>It is very smooth, and it foams a little, but not as much as regular toothpaste like Crest and Colgate.</li>
            <li>The color reminds me of soft coffee ice-cream.</li>
            <li>So I had to switch, and I chose to go the natural route.  </li>
            <li>The fact at it&#x27;s all natural sold me on staying with this product.</li>
            <li>I tried this toothpaste for my sensitive teeth and gums</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d always had very healthy teeth and gums, and I floss regularly, so this was pretty disturbing to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am slowly switching to using cruelty free products as much as I can.</li>
            <li>read The Fluoride Deception a few years ago and quit all fluoride after that, but my dentist managed to convince me to go back to using fluoridated toothpaste as he was sure that was the problem.</li>
            <li>Freshens breath and whitens plus it doesn&#x27;t dry my family&#x27;s lips to the point that they bleed, crack, peel, and blister, neither does it make me and my daughter break out in SERIOUS acne like the popular name brands.</li>
            <li>I used that for another stupid six months, with no results, so after yet one more painful cleaning (in which he kindly offered to give me a needle full of numbing agent - which I said no to), I went home and did some research... and found this product at my local mostly organic market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Flavor is mild mint, not strong.</li>
            <li>I purchased one tube at the local health food store near my house</li>
            <li>I have no sensitivity now and my gums are much improved from before using it - I have been using it now for about 4 years and cannot imagine using any other paste on my teeth.</li>
            <li>Not a single dentist I have seen since using this has ever question whether or not I floss or rinse with mouth wash.</li>
            <li>My entire family started using it after I realized how good it was, and if any of us have a bad report when we go next week, I&#x27;ll update this post!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m about to go to the dentist for my usual 6-month cleaning, and can&#x27;t wait to enjoy that process like I used to, which I expect since all the sensitivity to hot or cold has completely vanished.</li>
            <li> I actually bought 6 of them to give to my adult children and keep a few on the shelf for my husband and myself</li>
            <li> His next suggestion was to start using a prescription of fluoride paste directly on the trouble areas.</li>
            <li> In fact most seem shocked when I tell them all I do is brush twice a day...</li>
            <li> A company should at least get back to a customer when there is a problem with their product - especially a problem like that.</li>
            <li> Maybe not movie star, &amp;#34;enough to blind you with the sheer white glow of my teeth&amp;#34; white, but they&#x27;re white.</li>
            <li> Well as it turns out, fluoride is not only dangerous, which is obvious, but even in small quantities, it can melt through solid concrete.</li>
            <li> Again, six months later, they actually felt worse.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t buy any other brand!</li>
            <li> is that it doesn&#x27;t have anything harsh in it.  </li>
            <li> And well, for the past few years I use it myself.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I used Auromere in the past</li>
            <li> During the two-something year process of trying to find an answer, I had also begun to feel pain if I breathed in air past the problem teeth, and even that has disappeared since using this toothpaste.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more excessive buildup of plaque, no more cavities.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to artificial sweetener, fluoride toothpaste.</li>
            <li> its not worth the money i paid for it.too expensive in comparison to the results.</li>
            <li> unlikely to recommend a friend.</li>
            <li> I called and left a voice message and wrote and email to find out what that awful taste could be</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what was wrong with the bad tube</li>
            <li> but I am afraid to try it again.</li>
            <li> not too bad tasting ... and</li>
            <li> you are in luck, when you get a bad batch, you will know it.</li>
            <li> but  when we got a bad batch, I tried to discreetly switch my with his tube</li>
            <li> Customer service for Auromere is awful.</li>

            <li> Great toothpaste. If you&#x27;re looking for a healthy and safe alternative to the junk the sell these days, get this!</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste, just don&#x27;t like the after taste. My teeth have never felt cleaner! Noticed results after the first two brushings.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste.  So does my husband and he is very picky.  Keeps teeth cleaned and breath fresh.  Safe to use on my dogs too.</li>
            <li> This is the only toothpaste I will use the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> best toothpaste ever!  Great price!</li>
            <li> its not worth the money i paid for it.too expensive in comparison to the results. unlikely to recommend a friend.</li>
            <li> This is the first cruelty free toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried. It is interesting and different. The color reminds me of soft coffee ice-cream. It&#x27;s a light milky brown color. It is very smooth, and it foams a little, but not as much as regular toothpaste like Crest and Colgate. I like the Fresh Mint taste. The minty flavor is mild, and once your mouth is rinsed, the mint doesn&#x27;t stay in your mouth or breath. Because of the lack of minty after taste, my mouth doesn&#x27;t feel super fresh. My teeth feels pretty clean, and the toothpaste feels very smooth. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it seems to leave my toothbrush in a light shade of brown. I like this toothpaste, and I will continue to use it. It&#x27;s different and just need getting used to. I like the fact that it&#x27;s cruelty free. I am slowly switching to using cruelty free products as much as I can.</li>
            <li> I love whitening toothpastes, and now my teeth hurt.  So I had to switch, and I chose to go the natural route.  I switched to Tom&#x27;s and I felt good about my purchase...but my hygienist did not. She asked what I had done to my dental routine, because she had never seen so much plaque on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had heard about Auromere from a naturopathic doctor and thought I would give it a try.  Happily, my hygienist said I was back on track again and had healthy teeth/gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about this product (including less time in the dentist&#x27;s chair) is that it doesn&#x27;t have anything harsh in it.  No fluoride, nothing to destroy my enamel (whitening), and it still makes my mouth feel very clean.  I actually bought 6 of them to give to my adult children and keep a few on the shelf for my husband and myself</li>
            <li> Love the taste - earthy - light grit - are my teeth sparkly white ,you ask.  No.  But that could also be cause I only brush at night And I drink lemon water.</li>
            <li> I am making a conscious choice to switch to all natural products and at first - this was not the most pleasant but after continuous use - I cannot imagine going back to regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is amazing! I have been trying to find a toothpaste that my husband will use besides his beloved Colgate. I&#x27;ve tried Earth Paste and I immediately knew he would not like it. Auromere&#x27;s flavor, consistency, and  refreshing feeling when you are done is perfect. My husband loves it and we have officially made the switch. I&#x27;m planning on giving this as stocking stuffers for Christmas too.</li>
            <li> PERFECT -- IT&#x27;S WONDERFUL.</li>
            <li> I have to say when you get a good batch you are in luck, when you get a bad batch, you will know it. It has a chemical taste/smell and essence that seems like bleach got into it. Both my husband and I used Auromere in the past but  when we got a bad batch, I tried to discreetly switch my with his tube and I heard him as he spit it out in horror and yell to me that he just got poisoned. I don&#x27;t know what was wrong with the bad tube but I am afraid to try it again. Customer service for Auromere is awful. I called and left a voice message and wrote and email to find out what that awful taste could be but no reply to either. Hence the 2 stars. A company should at least get back to a customer when there is a problem with their product - especially a problem like that.</li>
            <li> Taste great and covers wonderfully. Not all natural toothpastes seem to lasts because they disolve too quickly, but this one does great and foams a bit. I&#x27;ve tried another one with the Caradom &amp; Fennel flavor and I liked it; even though it doesn&#x27;t foam like this one, it stayed on the teeth making it more spreadable. Also I noticed that both keep the plaque from forming that slimy film on my teeth by the time I wake up. Freshens breath and whitens plus it doesn&#x27;t dry my family&#x27;s lips to the point that they bleed, crack, peel, and blister, neither does it make me and my daughter break out in SERIOUS acne like the popular name brands. I may have to try even more flavors when I run low :)</li>
            <li> very good, doesn&#x27;t taste that good like other over the counter products but way healthier!</li>
            <li> Great taste. Clean feeling afterward. Love this product.  I buy it in bulk.  This is the only toothpaste my husband likes.</li>
            <li> I purchased one tube at the local health food store near my house and I got hooked.  I bought a five-pack from Amazon because this will be my tooth paste from now on.  I love the way it leaves my breath fresh and my teeth feel clean and shinny.  The fact at it&#x27;s all natural sold me on staying with this product.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is by far better than any other flouride free, natural product. I have no sensitivity now and my gums are much improved from before using it - I have been using it now for about 4 years and cannot imagine using any other paste on my teeth. Maybe baking soda.</li>
            <li> I tried this toothpaste for my sensitive teeth and gums and I&#x27;m in love. My sensitivity went away after using this for about a week. Now I&#x27;m stocking up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this company and their products! I highly recommend them to anyone that wants to have healthy lifestyles !</li>
            <li> Right around age 50, I began experiencing sensitivity on one and then two of my teeth, not only to hot/cold, but when getting my teeth cleaned at the dentist office, in particular. I&#x27;d always had very healthy teeth and gums, and I floss regularly, so this was pretty disturbing to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d read The Fluoride Deception a few years ago and quit all fluoride after that, but my dentist managed to convince me to go back to using fluoridated toothpaste as he was sure that was the problem. Six months later, nothing had improved, so he then suggested fluoridated sealants on the \\&quot;weak\\&quot; areas of the problem teeth. Reluctantly, I agreed.  Again, six months later, they actually felt worse. His next suggestion was to start using a prescription of fluoride paste directly on the trouble areas. Against everything I believe about fluoride, I did it anyway, with zero results. Next suggestion was to use Sensodyne Pronamel, which has the claim of strengthening and re-hardening the enamel. I used that for another stupid six months, with no results, so after yet one more painful cleaning (in which he kindly offered to give me a needle full of numbing agent - which I said no to), I went home and did some research... and found this product at my local mostly organic market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week, I noticed a difference, and things only improved during the next six months.  I was getting low on my last 5-tube purchase and was about to buy more when I saw only two reviews on Auromere&#x27;s toothpaste, so had to chime in. I&#x27;m about to go to the dentist for my usual 6-month cleaning, and can&#x27;t wait to enjoy that process like I used to, which I expect since all the sensitivity to hot or cold has completely vanished. During the two-something year process of trying to find an answer, I had also begun to feel pain if I breathed in air past the problem teeth, and even that has disappeared since using this toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this product to everyone, whether you have sensitivity or not.  My entire family started using it after I realized how good it was, and if any of us have a bad report when we go next week, I&#x27;ll update this post!</li>
            <li> I found it at TJ Maxx and decided to try. Just after a week (yesterday) I was eating a big ice cream and figured out the sensibility of my teeth is gone, yes, gone! I always have had sensibility for cold foods, but looks like not anymore with this wonderful toothpaste. I have tried natural and top brand toothpastes but this is the best and will keep buying it. The texture is different, like chalky. Flavor is mild mint, not strong. I enjoyed the clean feeling after brushing. I am happy to be able to buy it here in Amazon :)</li>
            <li> Provides really clean teeth with a great taste. Will purchase more and give as presents. Do not be put off by the brown color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this toothpaste for years. First off, I bought it for my baby sister who was 6 at the time though she brushed he teeth very fervently. She had cavities all the time, and 2-3 new ones every time we visited a dentist. I did some research and let&#x27;s just say everything I found was very eye-opening. First off, I already knew fluoride was a poison, but in low quantities I assumed it killed bacteria and nothing more. Well as it turns out, fluoride is not only dangerous, which is obvious, but even in small quantities, it can melt through solid concrete. And we put that in our water supply??? Anyhow, after ditching the fluoride, the sugars, the dyes and everything else that should NOT be in a toothpaste and finding this gem, my sister&#x27;s teeth immediately became healthier. No more excessive buildup of plaque, no more cavities. If fact her teeth are 100% whiter than most kids her age. And well, for the past few years I use it myself. I don&#x27;t floss or use mouth wash. Just this toothpaste. Not a single dentist I have seen since using this has ever question whether or not I floss or rinse with mouth wash. In fact most seem shocked when I tell them all I do is brush twice a day... and that&#x27;s all I do for my oral care. I&#x27;ve even been commented on by a dentist saying I&#x27;d had the most healthy teeth he&#x27;d seen in months. I never have cavities, and for the most part, my teeth are naturally white. Maybe not movie star, &amp;#34;enough to blind you with the sheer white glow of my teeth&amp;#34; white, but they&#x27;re white. No yellow, no stains, just healthy. Ditch your old toothpaste and do something healthy for yourself.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural tasting, healthy toothpaste with no fluoride, and I found it. I will never go back to artificial sweetener, fluoride toothpaste. It&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li> A friend gave us our first tube of this toothpaste and we loved it. It whitens and removes tartar really well.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!!! Won&#x27;t buy any other brand! Great for sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 6 months. My dentist is even a big fan and sees monks from a nearby buddhist monastery that use this toothpaste and they have great teeth, he says. Of course, they don&#x27;t eat a lot of sweets either. Getting the pack of 5 was definitely cost effective. Thanks for the bundling discount!</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used that actually halts and reverses cavities. I think it&#x27;s the ingredients and it is absolutely spectacular.</li>
            <li> Great product. My teeth feel clean, and my breath is fresh.</li>
            <li> Everything I wanted to find in a tooth paste Auromere Ayurvedic Formula has it... I really recommend it...</li>
