            <li>Once again Estee Lauder succeeds in making a unique gorgeous fragrance !&lt;</li>
            <li>there is so much more to this Eau de Parfum than that!  </li>
            <li>It smells amazing on Mommy</li>
            <li>I got this for Christmas and really liked it and was out</li>
            <li>It kind of reminds me of a Faith Hill perfume I used to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the scent of this perfume</li>
            <li>Another thing i wasnt pleased with was my perfume box looked as if it&#x27;d been tampered with...</li>
            <li>I love this scent.</li>
            <li>so I ordered more..</li>
            <li>This parfum is sexy, sexy, sexy - from start to finish (but</li>
            <li>Both of us love this Estee Lauder fragrance for its softness.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more of a night time scent</li>
            <li>LOVE the scent</li>
            <li>Love it..</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance.</li>
            <li>This perfume was a gift for my Mom who loves strong but elegant fragrants.</li>
            <li>But for now, it&#x27;s one of my very special night fragrances.  </li>
            <li>IT WAS EASY TO ORDER AND FIND..</li>
            <li>but it fades very quickly.</li>
            <li>but  it did not stay easy disappear</li>
            <li>For one thing, you will probably love the smell of this on yourself; I do, and I receive ever so many compliments from men, when I am wearing Modern Muse!  </li>
            <li>It fades so quickly!</li>
            <li>#34;soft florals and smooth woods&amp;#34</li>
            <li>should she was excited and all arrived as it should.  </li>
            <li>Estee Lauder has such nice parfumes!</li>
            <li>Always smells rich, though.</li>
            <li>but I love it so much that I wear it during the day as well.</li>
            <li>A fresh clean scent</li>
            <li>Quick Shipping</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s neither too floral nor too citrusy, each of which create issues for me, but the fragrance fades rather quickly compared to others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Selected by my daughter as a gift, this is a new option for me (favorites include Amber by Prada, Vera Wang by Vera Wang, Cashmere Mist by Donna Karan, and Lovely by Sarah Jessica Parker).</li>
            <li>then, but the actual scent was so much better on the skin!</li>
            <li>Very refreshing scent for all seasons, layers well with other brands.</li>
            <li>Liked it so much I changed perfumes for the first time in several years.</li>
            <li>I can still scent it on myself the next day, and I never apply more than 2 spritzes the day before...  </li>
            <li>.. Smelled this for the first time in a magazine</li>
            <li>My wife really likes this perfume</li>
            <li>it appears and smells like the real thing.</li>
            <li>Much lighter than most of the other perfumes.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you&#x27;re looking for a fragrance that&#x27;s not too sweet, but is noticeable enough to not fade away immediately.</li>
            <li>The smooth floral and slightly spicy fragrance adds an essential feminine touch for my days at the office and smells equally delicious with that little black dress for a night at the club.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Tried the sample at a local Macy&#x27;s store and found it much cheaper on here.  </li>
            <li>Both the top and base notes are gorgeous, and as far as lasting power?  </li>

            <li> this was a xmas gift it hasn&#x27;t been long enough to get feed back</li>
            <li> I do apply it over a bit of unscented oil, rubbed into my skin - makes every fragrance last longer, if your skin is DRY (or, if perfumes just never seem to last long enough on your skin - try it!)</li>
            <li> The spray top also looks like the unfortunate result of a mating between Mickey Mouse and a robotic circuit board.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how someone with long, manicured nails or wide fingertips could manage without doing damage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit expensive but you don&#x27;t have to use very much</li>
            <li> Not exactly the aesthetics or pampering</li>
            <li> It wears down from floral to slightly spicy (think it might have sandalwood in it?)</li>
            <li> ; - but those few words don&#x27;t do it justice:  </li>
            <li> If this EDP had a bit of green in it, I might think of it as an everyday scent.  </li>
            <li> few sprays in the morning and the perfume</li>
            <li> Not satisfied.  </li>
            <li> but I was not satisfied.</li>
            <li> The push button is encased on three sides and has slightly sharp corners, and I find it awkward and uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical that the spray might be a knock off.  </li>
            <li> Maybe there is a way to create a fake product</li>
            <li> That was disappointing.</li>
            <li> Too bad, Estee Lauder.</li>

            <li> I absolutely love the scent of this perfume but I could tell it&#x27;s been sitting on a shelf for quite sometime.  It fades so quickly! Another thing i wasnt pleased with was my perfume box looked as if it&#x27;d been tampered with... However, the bottle was intact so this won&#x27;t stop me from making future purchases via Amazon.</li>
            <li> Item As Described. Great Price. Quick Shipping</li>
            <li> this was a xmas gift it hasn&#x27;t been long enough to get feed back</li>
            <li> I love this scent. It smells great. A fresh clean scent but it fades shortly after you spray it on.</li>
            <li> I got this for Christmas and really liked it and was out so I ordered more..Thank you......IT WAS EASY TO ORDER AND FIND..</li>
            <li> Smells like it should she was excited and all arrived as it should.  Great job.</li>
            <li> Tried the sample at a local Macy&#x27;s store and found it much cheaper on here.  Placed it on my wish list and got it!  Estee Lauder has such nice parfumes!</li>
            <li> The description of &amp;#34;Modern Muse&#x27;s&amp;#34; components are described as &amp;#34;soft florals and smooth woods&amp;#34; - but those few words don&#x27;t do it justice:  there is so much more to this Eau de Parfum than that!  For one thing, you will probably love the smell of this on yourself; I do, and I receive ever so many compliments from men, when I am wearing Modern Muse!  This parfum is sexy, sexy, sexy - from start to finish (but especially so when the mid notes tease themselves out to play in the air immediately surrounding you)!  Both the top and base notes are gorgeous, and as far as lasting power?  I can still scent it on myself the next day, and I never apply more than 2 spritzes the day before...  If this EDP had a bit of green in it, I might think of it as an everyday scent.  But for now, it&#x27;s one of my very special night fragrances.  I do apply it over a bit of unscented oil, rubbed into my skin - makes every fragrance last longer, if your skin is DRY (or, if perfumes just never seem to last long enough on your skin - try it!)... Have fun smelling like an unforgettable Muse!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you&#x27;re looking for a fragrance that&#x27;s not too sweet, but is noticeable enough to not fade away immediately.</li>
            <li> Selected by my daughter as a gift, this is a new option for me (favorites include Amber by Prada, Vera Wang by Vera Wang, Cashmere Mist by Donna Karan, and Lovely by Sarah Jessica Parker). Both of us love this Estee Lauder fragrance for its softness. It&#x27;s neither too floral nor too citrusy, each of which create issues for me, but the fragrance fades rather quickly compared to others I&#x27;ve used. That was disappointing. My biggest objection, however, has to do with the container itself. The push button is encased on three sides and has slightly sharp corners, and I find it awkward and uncomfortable to use. (I like to spray a veil of fragrance over my head and let it settle). I don&#x27;t know how someone with long, manicured nails or wide fingertips could manage without doing damage. The spray top also looks like the unfortunate result of a mating between Mickey Mouse and a robotic circuit board. Not exactly the aesthetics or pampering I want to experience when using a perfume. Too bad, Estee Lauder. With a bit of tweaking, it could potentially become one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> A gift for another by request.</li>
            <li> Do not like..... I dont like that it can&#x27;t be returned</li>
            <li> Very refreshing scent for all seasons, layers well with other brands.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this one. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more of a night time scent but I love it so much that I wear it during the day as well. It kind of reminds me of a Faith Hill perfume I used to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few sprays in the morning and the perfume last all day. It&#x27;s a bit expensive but you don&#x27;t have to use very much each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> this was a fraction of what the malls charge.  Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE the scent but it fades very quickly.</li>
            <li> I purchased Estee Lauder Muse perfume after sniffing samples in Vogue and Marie Claire magazines.  The smooth floral and slightly spicy fragrance adds an essential feminine touch for my days at the office and smells equally delicious with that little black dress for a night at the club.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to re-touch it during the day, but that&#x27;s probably my individual skin absorption.  It wears down from floral to slightly spicy (think it might have sandalwood in it?) by noon.  Always smells rich, though.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes this perfume</li>
            <li> Much lighter than most of the other perfumes.  Liked it so much I changed perfumes for the first time in several years.</li>
            <li> This perfume was a gift for my Mom who loves strong but elegant fragrants. It smells amazing on Mommy and she likes it a lot .</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical that the spray might be a knock off.  After checking is out (bottle markings, etc.) it appears and smells like the real thing.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied.  Did not smell like the store.  Maybe there is a way to create a fake product but I was not satisfied.</li>
            <li> Once again Estee Lauder succeeds in making a unique gorgeous fragrance !&lt;br /&gt;Very woodsy and floral as well.. Smelled this for the first time in a magazine and I loved&lt;br /&gt;it then, but the actual scent was so much better on the skin! Love it..</li>
            <li> I like the smell but  it did not stay easy disappear</li>
            <li> Arrived in plenty of time for our daughter&#x27;s Christmas gift!  She loved it!</li>
            <li> Very pleased! I love the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Great smelling product</li>
