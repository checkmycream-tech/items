    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>My daughter introduced me to these products and she is seeing great results as well.  </li>
            <li>now is great shampoo</li>
            <li>the government without a doubt would step in and turn it over to the good ol boys network.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t rule out the possibility of there being good and bade versions of this product (maybe it&#x27;s manufactured in differing locations).</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would pass on the conditioner and just get the shampoo and get a good conditioner that helps your hair.  </li>
            <li>I had to buy the biggest bottles, this product is effective.</li>
            <li>Did Nothing for me really..smells nice</li>
            <li>If it stops being effective, I&#x27;ll try something else.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excellent product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>So maybe that&#x27;s why it hasn&#x27;t grown any more since I&#x27;ve used this duo.  </li>
            <li>Love the product, but do not like the packaging.  </li>
            <li>but I must say the volume I get from this product is much better.</li>
            <li>It always seemed as though the container would pop before it would squeeze out of the top.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not seeing as many hairs in my brush.  </li>
            <li>i didnt notice any change in my part r on top</li>
            <li>i wish i would have waited to give revita more of a chance</li>
            <li>As with most women, I was devestated with the diagnosis.</li>
            <li>Some people need to use more Minoxidil, some people need a stronger Kena shampoo than Revita (like Nizoral).</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>TOO SURE ABOUT THE SPRAY PRODUCT &amp;#34;SPECTRAL RS&amp;#34</li>
            <li>SO LETS SEE AFTER 2 MORE MONTHS</li>
            <li>Although in the more recent reviews I noticed a trend of people complaining that this once great product must of changed their ingredients, because  the experience of it causing hair to fall out</li>
            <li>So I keep spending huge bucks to buy it.  </li>
            <li>as it mentions more hair will fall out first couple of weeks</li>
            <li>I would love to know if those who have had positive results received a conditioner that wasn&#x27;t like squeezing out cement?</li>
            <li>I have always had baby fine hair, but always enough to style and still make a good full style with the right</li>
            <li>The good news though, the hair that fell out wasn&#x27;t permanent it came back.</li>
            <li>Other than that the product works great.</li>
            <li>From the very first use I noticed the differance.</li>
            <li>Totally worth buying.</li>
            <li>, UR GETTING 1000$ WORTH OF STUFF</li>
            <li>I RECOMMEND THIS ONE OBVIOUSLY, &amp;#34;PURA D OR PREMIUM OR REGULAR SHAMPOO&amp;#34; BOTH ARE SUPER NATURAL, AND THE COMPANY &amp;#34;JUSTNATURAL&amp;#34; MAKE VERY GREAT PRODUCTS</li>
            <li>But I love the shampoo because it seems to make what&#x27;s left seem thicker.  </li>
            <li>and I can definitely see more hair</li>
            <li>It never fails this product always leaks a bit during transit.  </li>
            <li>I also only use it 4-5 times a week, because I find it drying and rub it into the scalp more than all over my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I also another sulfate free shampoo and conditioner on my off days as well as argan oil to keep my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I am not completely bald, nor can you see my scalp through my hair on top except in the front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No  company would change the ingredients on a successful product unless they were forced too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I do believe the price is too high, but I&#x27;m willing to pay for the results.</li>
            <li>Have lost much of the conditioner and some shampoo.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo&#x27;s bottle does not seal well and over time water gets in and makes it very runny.</li>
            <li>Very hopeful.</li>
            <li>I have used these for over a year and it really works.</li>
            <li>It really grows hair.</li>
            <li>But, I am not going to conclude so fast as it takes time for the products to work.</li>
            <li>I bought everything in sight without giving much thought to what I was buying.</li>
            <li>did a bunch of research prior to this purchase and this product came up frequently as the top, if not the #1 hair loss product out there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 37 years old and for the last 10 years I&#x27;ve been able to maintain 75% of the full head of hair I had in my prime, using various hair loss shampoos (nothing with minoxidil).</li>
            <li>The conditioner, on the other hand, flattens my hair like all conditioners do, so I&#x27;ve given it to my son to keep his rapidly thinning hair from receding any more.  </li>
            <li>dermatologist said I had AGA or something akin more to Male pattern baldness than female.</li>
            <li>; THE PRICE SEEMS HIGH</li>
            <li>, GOOD RESULTS USUALLY TAKE UP TO 90 DAYS TO SEE WITH ANYTHING, LIKE WEIGHT LOSS, HAIR GROWTH, AND WORKING OUT, BUT IK SHAMPOO ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH FOR HAIR LOSS OR HAIR THINNING</li>
            <li>but i saw new blond hairs in my hairline after about 2 weeks has been lil over month now and my baby bangs that i had have grown and the blond hairs</li>
            <li>Product is okay but not better than what I used before.</li>
            <li>But to get the results so far, I have just used Living Proof shampoo, a quality conditioner (usually redken though I am changing to morrocan oil because it seems to do better) on my off days from Revita.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Specifically on Regenepure, the hair gets volume and with the hair shedding &amp; flat hair due to Revita, I am still able to look okay at least on weekends when I use Regenepure.</li>
            <li>I have been using the shampoo for about a month now (this review will cover some on the conditioner, as I found it too heavy for my fine</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be clear, I am doing lots of things to help my hair situation and Revita is just one of them.</li>
            <li>My hair is noticeably thicker and feels soft.  </li>
            <li>But so far, this is working for me.</li>
            <li>, I ACTUALLY ORDERED THE WHOLE SYSTEM FROM THEM</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am a female, 44 years old and have a front receding hairline and some diffuse thinning.</li>
            <li>Revita made my hair flat and crispy in the first few applications.</li>

            <li> haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if is helping my hair to stop falling out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if there are suppliers out there sabotaging the product or a supplier of a particular ingredient</li>
            <li> My hair continued to come out &amp; it left it very dry, almost straw</li>
            <li> seems to be a frequent complaint among several recent reviews.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> Hoping long term use will make something happen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was because of the new products I&#x27;ve been using or what.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like to use the same product as the same time, I used only shampoo in the past and like it.</li>
            <li> I use to use the other product similar to this</li>
            <li> Other than those claims, it is still a quality product especially the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> The only other possibility is, if it was a hair loss product that was working too well</li>
            <li> Have only used for 1 month and see less fallout but no new growth yet.</li>
            <li> and she said she can see new growth where I was almost completely without hair and very thin before.</li>
            <li> is what most reviews say the bottle is bad</li>
            <li> the time I made this purchase (almost a year ago) there were only a few people claiming this</li>
            <li> r growing and starting to look browner and have a few growing on my forehead but</li>
            <li> So in other words after 27 I&#x27;ve maintained my hair, a little receding with thinning in the back, until I used this shampoo and</li>
            <li> The caffeine and other stimulating ingredients in this product are keeping me awake at night.</li>
            <li> CALLED &amp;#34;THE EXTREME HAIR LOSS KIT&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I have calmed down somewhat and have found what seems to be working for</li>
            <li> Since I started using I see that hair is stronger and with lot less losses.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no true telling if this stuff works for slowing the loss of hair or speeding up the growth of existing hair.  </li>
            <li> used the Shampoo and Conditioner set for a little over 3 weeks, but I didn&#x27;t want to risk anymore</li>
            <li> AND THE SPRAY FOR A FEW WEEKS</li>
            <li> Hoping that this brings in stronger hair as this is what is expected; if they don&#x27;t come then it will mean that I have lost whatever I had after using the shampoo.</li>
            <li> It is especially hard when you are an older person.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s a connection, but several of the people who had a bad experience had a similar description of the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of the shampoo, and I use very little of it at a wash.</li>
            <li> only complaint is the packaging is ridiculous as it is very difficult to get the conditioner out without taking the entire lid off.  </li>
            <li> I am giving 4 stars for Revita as the efficacy of the product will be known over prolonged use for at least 2-3 months as recommended by the manufacturer and others.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s tough to say what&#x27;s going on here.</li>
            <li> The conditioner I received was difficult to squeeze out.</li>
            <li> ill take it ..</li>
            <li> so guess ill be buying both</li>
            <li> A friend of mine that is really afraid of hair loss indicated this to me.</li>
            <li> I was wrong!</li>
            <li> usually it&#x27;s a bad thing.</li>

            <li> Like to use the same product as the same time, I used only shampoo in the past and like it.</li>
            <li> The caffeine and other stimulating ingredients in this product are keeping me awake at night.</li>
            <li> Product Delivery is wasteful and not convenient. Have lost much of the conditioner and some shampoo.  Product is okay but not better than what I used before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman with shoulder length hair, and washing my hair every day (which involves styling also) is just too onerous and I can&#x27;t keep it up.  So maybe that&#x27;s why it hasn&#x27;t grown any more since I&#x27;ve used this duo.  But I love the shampoo because it seems to make what&#x27;s left seem thicker.  So I keep spending huge bucks to buy it.  The conditioner, on the other hand, flattens my hair like all conditioners do, so I&#x27;ve given it to my son to keep his rapidly thinning hair from receding any more.  He hasn&#x27;t reported the results to me yet.</li>
            <li> My hair is noticeably thicker and feels soft.  It&#x27;s too soon to know if it helps grow back hair.  From the very first use I noticed the differance.</li>
            <li> Love the product, but do not like the packaging.  It has made a big difference in the texture of my hair.</li>
            <li> Used religiously with Spectral RS treatment and didn&#x27;t help my thinning hair at all.  Used for over 4 months and if anything, thinned my hair.  Hoping my hair gets back to where it was before trying the Spectral products.  Didn&#x27;t work for me at all!</li>
            <li> I use to use the other product similar to this but I must say the volume I get from this product is much better.</li>
            <li> I did not notice anything with this yet. Still using it though.. Hoping long term use will make something happen.</li>
            <li> This stuff works, I noticed my roots showing sooner usually it&#x27;s a bad thing. But this is how I know this stuff is working.&lt;br /&gt;I can only imagine combining this shampoo with Biotin. That will be my next step. Totally worth buying.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no true telling if this stuff works for slowing the loss of hair or speeding up the growth of existing hair.  My hair grows like a snail and with persistent application over the months of this product shows no different.  Other than those claims, it is still a quality product especially the conditioner.  The shampoo&#x27;s bottle does not seal well and over time water gets in and makes it very runny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 37 years old and for the last 10 years I&#x27;ve been able to maintain 75% of the full head of hair I had in my prime, using various hair loss shampoos (nothing with minoxidil). So in other words after 27 I&#x27;ve maintained my hair, a little receding with thinning in the back, until I used this shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I did a bunch of research prior to this purchase and this product came up frequently as the top, if not the #1 hair loss product out there. Although in the more recent reviews I noticed a trend of people complaining that this once great product must of changed their ingredients, because  the experience of it causing hair to fall out seems to be a frequent complaint among several recent reviews.&lt;br /&gt;At the time I made this purchase (almost a year ago) there were only a few people claiming this so I took a chance.&lt;br /&gt;I used the Shampoo and Conditioner set for a little over 3 weeks, but I didn&#x27;t want to risk anymore hair loss from it. There was that side of me hanging on, thinking it would eventually turn around and cause my hair to grow, but no way in hell did I want to chance it any further so I stopped. The good news though, the hair that fell out wasn&#x27;t permanent it came back. It didn&#x27;t come back fuller (about the same). I&#x27;m not sure if it was because of the new products I&#x27;ve been using or what.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s tough to say what&#x27;s going on here. I&#x27;m not sure if there are suppliers out there sabotaging the product or a supplier of a particular ingredient is sending this manufacturer some bunk stuff or what?  The only other possibility is, if it was a hair loss product that was working too well the government without a doubt would step in and turn it over to the good ol boys network. No  company would change the ingredients on a successful product unless they were forced too.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t rule out the possibility of there being good and bade versions of this product (maybe it&#x27;s manufactured in differing locations). For the record, because the descriptionof the conditioner seemed to vary on a couple of the reviews. The conditioner I received was difficult to squeeze out. It always seemed as though the container would pop before it would squeeze out of the top. I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s a connection, but several of the people who had a bad experience had a similar description of the conditioner. I would love to know if those who have had positive results received a conditioner that wasn&#x27;t like squeezing out cement?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these products for over a year and I can definitely see more hair and I&#x27;m not seeing as many hairs in my brush.  My daughter introduced me to these products and she is seeing great results as well.  I do believe the price is too high, but I&#x27;m willing to pay for the results. My daughter, to save money, only uses the conditioner.  I may begin doing that.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the packaging is ridiculous as it is very difficult to get the conditioner out without taking the entire lid off.  It is especially hard when you are an older person.</li>
            <li> My hair continued to come out &amp; it left it very dry, almost straw like  hoped it would work as it was costly to purchase</li>
            <li> Have only used for 1 month and see less fallout but no new growth yet. Very hopeful.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try this thinking it would never stop the thinning of my hair. I was wrong! 3 weeks later, it&#x27;s working so well!  i&#x27;m reordering today!  My friend who is a hairdresser suggested I try it.  I do not see any thickening yet but am hopeful as it&#x27;s only been 3 weeks and I don&#x27;t expect miracles!  My hair will grow back.</li>
            <li> I had to buy the biggest bottles, this product is effective.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if is helping my hair to stop falling out.  as it mentions more hair will fall out first couple of weeks and that is definitely happening.</li>
            <li> I have used these for over a year and it really works. It really grows hair. If you want to speed up the process, use the Spectral DNC by D S Labs ( same company, but a hair regrowth product)</li>
            <li> Did Nothing for me really..smells nice</li>
            <li> I am giving 4 stars for Revita as the efficacy of the product will be known over prolonged use for at least 2-3 months as recommended by the manufacturer and others. I am using this shampoo and conditioner in conjunction with Regenepure. Revita made my hair flat and crispy in the first few applications. Also, I had a lot of shedding for 2 weeks. Hoping that this brings in stronger hair as this is what is expected; if they don&#x27;t come then it will mean that I have lost whatever I had after using the shampoo. But, I am not going to conclude so fast as it takes time for the products to work. So this is my regime - 5 Days a Week Revita Shampoo &amp; Conditioner and 2 days I use Regenepure Shampoo and Conditioner. Specifically on Regenepure, the hair gets volume and with the hair shedding &amp; flat hair due to Revita, I am still able to look okay at least on weekends when I use Regenepure. I am in the 3rd week now and will update regularly.</li>
            <li> It never fails this product always leaks a bit during transit.  Other than that the product works great. I Recommend it.</li>
            <li> is what most reviews say the bottle is bad n leaks but i saw new blond hairs in my hairline after about 2 weeks has been lil over month now and my baby bangs that i had have grown and the blond hairs r growing and starting to look browner and have a few growing on my forehead but ill take it .. i didnt notice any change in my part r on top so did start using pantene minoxidil for that about 2 weeks ago now.. i wish i would have waited to give revita more of a chance but i just cant stand idea of loosing my hair so guess ill be buying both now is great shampoo no matter what</li>
            <li> I have been using the shampoo for about a month now (this review will cover some on the conditioner, as I found it too heavy for my fine hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a female, 44 years old and have a front receding hairline and some diffuse thinning. I am not completely bald, nor can you see my scalp through my hair on top except in the front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dermatologist said I had AGA or something akin more to Male pattern baldness than female. As with most women, I was devestated with the diagnosis. I have always had baby fine hair, but always enough to style and still make a good full style with the right product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I found out what was going on I bought everything in sight without giving much thought to what I was buying. I have calmed down somewhat and have found what seems to be working for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be clear, I am doing lots of things to help my hair situation and Revita is just one of them. I only use the shampoo now, since I found the conditioner too heavy and it didn&#x27;t condition very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to my stylist yesterday and she said she can see new growth where I was almost completely without hair and very thin before. I like the smell of the shampoo, and I use very little of it at a wash. I also only use it 4-5 times a week, because I find it drying and rub it into the scalp more than all over my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this in conjunction withe DS Labs Spectral DNC 5% minoxidil solution (once a day) Biotin, Vitamin E, Vitamin B-12, Vitamin C, Zinc and increased protein consumption. I also another sulfate free shampoo and conditioner on my off days as well as argan oil to keep my hair soft and manageable. I use Moroccan Oil shampoo and conditioner (just started). But to get the results so far, I have just used Living Proof shampoo, a quality conditioner (usually redken though I am changing to morrocan oil because it seems to do better) on my off days from Revita.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found in my quest to protect my hair and to regrow what I can, nothing works for everyone. Some people need to use more Minoxidil, some people need a stronger Kena shampoo than Revita (like Nizoral). But so far, this is working for me. If it stops being effective, I&#x27;ll try something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would pass on the conditioner and just get the shampoo and get a good conditioner that helps your hair.  Moroccan oil or perhaps Living Proof .</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT I THINK IT GAVE ME SOME RESULTS BUT IM NOT TOO SURE ABOUT THE SPRAY PRODUCT &amp;#34;SPECTRAL RS&amp;#34; MAYBE IT ALSO CONTRIBUTED OR MAYBE NOT, AND I ONLY BEEN USING THE SHAMPOOS FOR ABOUT A MONTH NOW AND THE SPRAY FOR A FEW WEEKS SO LETS SEE AFTER 2 MORE MONTHS, GOOD RESULTS USUALLY TAKE UP TO 90 DAYS TO SEE WITH ANYTHING, LIKE WEIGHT LOSS, HAIR GROWTH, AND WORKING OUT, BUT IK SHAMPOO ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH FOR HAIR LOSS OR HAIR THINNING IM GONNA DO A LIVER AND COLON CLEANSE AND START TAKING A DHT BLOCKING SUPPLEMENT FROM WWW.HAIRGROWTHLAB.COM, I ACTUALLY ORDERED THE WHOLE SYSTEM FROM THEM CALLED &amp;#34;THE EXTREME HAIR LOSS KIT&amp;#34; THE PRICE SEEMS HIGH BUT ITS ACTUALLY NOT FOR EVERYTHING UR GETTING, UR GETTING 1000$ WORTH OF STUFF THAT HELP HAIRLOSS NOT JUST EXTERNELY BUT INTERNALY FOR 645$, AFTER MAKING ALOT OF RESEARCH ON DIFFERENT PRODUCTS I RECOMMEND THIS ONE OBVIOUSLY, &amp;#34;PURA D OR PREMIUM OR REGULAR SHAMPOO&amp;#34; BOTH ARE SUPER NATURAL, AND THE COMPANY &amp;#34;JUSTNATURAL&amp;#34; MAKE VERY GREAT PRODUCTS BUT I HAVE NOT TRIED IT YET...</li>
            <li> A friend of mine that is really afraid of hair loss indicated this to me. Since I started using I see that hair is stronger and with lot less losses.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and fast shipping. Will buy from again.</li>
            <li> The merchandise I received expired in Oct 2013</li>
