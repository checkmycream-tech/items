            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Over the years I have used many creams, lotions, balms...spend a lot of money on them.</li>
            <li>Also, if you wash your hands too often, put some lanolin on top of Glysolid on your hands as a protector and you will see how much better Glysolid will work.   </li>
            <li>but i m getting better now.</li>
            <li>Love it  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love glysoilid.  </li>
            <li>I will surely order more when this supply is used up.</li>
            <li>This is THE BEST cream for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>If you thought that you&#x27;ve tried everything to help those stubborn dry hands and feet regain some moisture in the fall and winter months-and you haven&#x27;t tried Glysolid-then you haven&#x27;t found the best solution.</li>
            <li>This is the best skin conditioner for extremely dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I wish the product was more readily available in the US.  </li>
            <li>This seller is great, super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT &amp; worth the $$$ .</li>
            <li>Works great on everything you have that is dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different products and have found Glysolid to be outstanding.  </li>
            <li>I ordered it for the first time from Amazon and use it, but it was really easy to order it and useful for use.</li>
            <li>First bought in Italy and OF COURSE available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I live in desert country where a good moisturizer is essential.</li>
            <li>I have used it on my daughters chapped face after a day of sledding and my winter dry heels both with amazing results.  </li>
            <li>They shipped fast too!</li>
            <li>i have used it for more than ten years.</li>
            <li>There are many prices for the same product.  </li>
            <li>Glysolid has helped tremendously in keeping my wintry skin in good condition--my dry thumbs and forefingers and heels especially.</li>
            <li>I have used Glysolid for many years as a dry skin product.</li>
            <li>yet it really moisturizes my skin and helps alleviate the dryness of the winter months here in the deserts of Arizona.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look like much</li>
            <li>thanks for  all  .</li>
            <li>If you will use only Glysolid on your face it might start flake because of high amount of allantoin in it, which is very healing but it speeds up the regeneration of the skin and as a result-too strong and too much exfoliation for the face skin.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, and just a dab goes a long way-and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this seller and product to everyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>This cream is a must during New England winters.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an ER nurse - hands in water all the time, &amp; live in the NE.</li>
            <li>on bottom of feet, cannot live without this product.</li>
            <li>The only items you need to keep your skin soft, supple and young are:  - glycerin based soap (I use on my face and body Clearly Natural 25% glycerin with vitamin E soap)  - face scrub (use 2-3 times per week)  - zinc oxyde sun screen (if you are outside for more than 15 min.)  </li>
            <li>This  source is very clear and does not try and trick you.  </li>
            <li>The Glysolid definitely provided her much needed moisture.</li>
            <li>Learned about this product from a mani/pedi professional.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>I no longer have that alligator look of old lady skin.</li>
            <li>It is very soothing and healing for really dry hands.</li>
            <li>I use it year round, but during the winter it is the only thing that keeps my hands moist and free of cracks.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I purchase several containers of Glysolid each fall for the winter as my hands dry out and crack.  </li>
            <li> I use this after a shower while I&#x27;m still wet, a little goes a long way, then is really penetrates.</li>
            <li> My hands get very dry and this is the only stuff I found that works.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry hands, this product not only soothes my hands, it has a healing effect.</li>

            <li> I find it&#x27;s one of the few products that has a lasting effect.</li>
            <li> I mainly use it at night because it is a little thick.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy several at a time, because I usually end up giving one away, and we can make 2 containers easily last a couple winters-</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount</li>
            <li> I have purchased other similiar products but return to this wishing I hadn&#x27;t even bothered to look anywhere else.  </li>
            <li> The other source that dominates Amazon does a lot of mystery and ambiguity in their product descriptions.  </li>
            <li> but you only need a very small amount.  </li>
            <li> It is a difficult product to find in stores, so online is more efficient and less expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all - my hands and cuticles are always a mess.  </li>
            <li> - Glysolid cream (put a little of it after shower on damp skin on your face and body).   </li>

            <li> Glysolid has helped tremendously in keeping my wintry skin in good condition--my dry thumbs and forefingers and heels especially.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 10 years.  It is a great cream for exposed body part  when they are chaped.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  In fact I need to re-order.</li>
            <li> This cream is a must during New England winters.  I use it year round, but during the winter it is the only thing that keeps my hands moist and free of cracks.  My sister battles eczema and suffers during the winter.  The Glysolid definitely provided her much needed moisture.</li>
            <li> Glysolid cream is the best moisturizer I have ever used on my face(with Lanolin), hands, body and feet. Over the years I have used many creams, lotions, balms...spend a lot of money on them. I, also, used to sell very famous skin care line ($100-$200 face creams), but none of them come close to the effectivness of Glysolid.   The only items you need to keep your skin soft, supple and young are:  - glycerin based soap (I use on my face and body Clearly Natural 25% glycerin with vitamin E soap)  - face scrub (use 2-3 times per week)  - zinc oxyde sun screen (if you are outside for more than 15 min.)  - Glysolid cream (put a little of it after shower on damp skin on your face and body).   - Anhydrous Lanolin pharmaceutical grade (Australia). Put it after Glysolid on your face, eye area and lips at night as an extra moisturizer, protector and wrinkle fighter. Lanolin is the best known moisturizer and healer for the skin. You do not have to take my word for it. Read about it, try it and see for yourself. If you will use only Glysolid on your face it might start flake because of high amount of allantoin in it, which is very healing but it speeds up the regeneration of the skin and as a result-too strong and too much exfoliation for the face skin. That is why you need lanolin for face, plus to fight wrinkles. Also, if you wash your hands too often, put some lanolin on top of Glysolid on your hands as a protector and you will see how much better Glysolid will work.   By the way this deal 4 jars and a tube from this seller is the best deal for the money! They shipped fast too!</li>

            <li> Absolutely the best cream ever. i have used it for more than ten years. you have to try it  to see.</li>

I put in on my hands at night and then sleep in cotton gloves the very next day I can see a noticable difference.  I would not go through the winter without this on hand.  It doesn&#x27;t look like much but you only need a very small amount.  I have used it on my daughters chapped face after a day of sledding and my winter dry heels both with amazing results.  I have purchased other similiar products but return to this wishing I hadn&#x27;t even bothered to look anywhere else.  I had also purchased the lotion product they make for travel in my purse and when off snowmobiling.</li>
            <li> i will buy another  . and this product is very good .  thanks for  all  . i will buy again</li>
            <li> This is an awesome cream, the best one I&#x27;ve ever used, plus it works on my mothers rashes when nothing else would. I use this after a shower while I&#x27;m still wet, a little goes a long way, then is really penetrates. This seller is great, super fast shipping. I would highly recommend this seller and product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I purchase several containers of Glysolid each fall for the winter as my hands dry out and crack.  This produce greatly reduces&lt;br /&gt;damage to the skin and will continue to purchase each year. Thank you</li>
            <li> I would recommend this cream to fellow quilters and to others whose hands suffer from dryness.  This is truly wonderful.</li>
            <li> I love glysoilid.  I wish the product was more readily available in the US.  This particular source is excellent.  The other source that dominates Amazon does a lot of mystery and ambiguity in their product descriptions.  There are many prices for the same product.  This  source is very clear and does not try and trick you.  The product is the best -just make sure you buy it from the right distributor...this one.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff ever. It helps my skin when it is extremely dry. My skin feels so soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> Everything went without a hitch! The best product ever!&lt;br /&gt;I use Glysolid on my heals, legs, arms and hands. I no longer have that alligator look of old lady skin. Brown age spots on my hands are gone. My salon girl is amazed. She started me on it for my heals.....my legs look great and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hands, this product not only soothes my hands, it has a healing effect. I am very pleased that it doesen&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling on your hands.&lt;br /&gt;I gave the travel sizes to friends and they also loved it . I will surely order more when this supply is used up.</li>
            <li> Any product from Germany is quality, have used for years, stays on after washing hands,&lt;br /&gt;great on bottom of feet, cannot live without this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all - my hands and cuticles are always a mess.  This cream is the best.  I mainly use it at night because it is a little thick.  I highly recommend this product.  The cover doesn&#x27;t screw on, so not as convenient for travel.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Works great on everything you have that is dry. We use it on our hands, feet, lips, etc...</li>
