            <li>easy to install works great</li>
            <li>it did more harm than good.</li>
            <li>What might be good is that Jerdon add a brighter light with a dimmer knob.  </li>
            <li>Yes, the light isn&#x27;t that bright</li>
            <li>Then the user could select exactly how much light worked best for their eyes in their room.</li>
            <li>Love this mirror.</li>
            <li>Better looking than the hotel silver.  </li>
            <li>They work wonderfully and my daughter and wife both love them and use them daily.</li>
            <li>Glad I got the 8x.</li>
            <li>Made bathroom look more elegant.</li>
            <li>The wife loved it, thanks.</li>
            <li>I put this in my bathroom on the wall and it matches perfectly to the other oil bronze fixtures I have in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>Easy to install</li>
            <li>I thought it was fine.</li>
            <li>We also like using the light part as a sort of night light.</li>
            <li>Think of it as a &amp;#34;fill&amp;#34; light.  </li>
            <li>Amazon has the greatest return policy, so no prob there.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be well made, not cheap stuff.</li>
            <li>But I think the light does help.</li>
            <li>Mounted easily off my limited counter space and tucks away nicely.</li>
            <li>I feel the design probably won&#x27;t allow a much brighter mirror light.</li>
            <li>The light itself adds a little more illumination.  </li>
            <li>light is dim and doesnt do much for using the mirror</li>
            <li>If you need readers it may not be strong enough.</li>
            <li>I think spending a little more would be worth it.</li>
            <li>Comes with extra light bulb.  </li>
            <li>so you additional light is necessary.</li>
            <li>A very think mirror.</li>
            <li>It is not a strong light, and is meant to enhance the light already in the room.  </li>
            <li>If you have limited counter space this a huge space saver and works very well.</li>
            <li>I installed two of these in the master bath of our new home just over a year ago.</li>
            <li>The first mirror was in brushed nickel which I bought a couple years ago.  </li>
            <li>It is not only very useful on a daily basis but the oil rubbed bronze finish is a classy finish.</li>
            <li>Does not press completely against wall.</li>
            <li>The mirror is bulky and the light is not very bright.  </li>
            <li>The light is not bright at all.</li>

            <li> Great mirror. We also like using the light part as a sort of night light.</li>
            <li> Love this mirror. Mounted easily off my limited counter space and tucks away nicely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything the disciption said it was.</li>
            <li> Beautiful mirror. It is wide. But looks the best with bronze fixtures.  Better looking than the hotel silver.  Comes with extra light bulb.  Does not press completely against wall. The magnify qualities does seem a little weaker. If you need readers it may not be strong enough.</li>
            <li> Well made. Excellent.</li>
            <li> The light is not bright at all. Otherwise it performs as one would expect from an inexpensive mirror. I think spending a little more would be worth it.</li>
            <li> use this everyday!  I love it and it makes me feel like I am in a 5 star hotel!</li>
            <li> This is the second one I purchased.  The first mirror was in brushed nickel which I bought a couple years ago.  Well built, quality construction.  Mirror has excellent clarity.  The light itself adds a little more illumination.  It is not a strong light, and is meant to enhance the light already in the room.  Think of it as a &amp;#34;fill&amp;#34; light.  If you have poor lighting in your room, the magnification will help but the mirror light may not be able to compensate for very poor ambient lighting.  I feel the design probably won&#x27;t allow a much brighter mirror light. It would probably add too much harsh glare and constrict your pupils to the point it did more harm than good.

            <li> She said it didn&#x27;t magnify enough, even tho I thought it was fine. Amazon has the greatest return policy, so no prob there.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be well made, not cheap stuff.</li>
            <li> I put this in my bathroom on the wall and it matches perfectly to the other oil bronze fixtures I have in the bathroom. Great quality piece of product.</li>

            <li> The mirror is bulky and the light is not very bright.  Plus it is way over priced.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fianc&amp;eacute; and she loves it. If you have limited counter space this a huge space saver and works very well.</li>
            <li> Awesome and I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> Beautiful product easy to install. I actually took the base plate and drilled another hole 180degrees from the top hole so I could put two screws I to the stud. My wife loved it. And so did the lady the bought our house HA! We left it and let her have it.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to keep from having to wear glasses to put on eye makeup. Yes, the light isn&#x27;t that bright so you additional light is necessary. But I think the light does help. Glad I got the 8x.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully, so needed for eye makeup.</li>

            <li> A very think mirror. Well made. Perfect match to bronze fixtures.  Made bathroom look more elegant. Would have given it a 5 but it is about 5&amp;#34; think was dated looking</li>
            <li> easy to install works great</li>
            <li> The wife loved it, thanks. Easy to install</li>
