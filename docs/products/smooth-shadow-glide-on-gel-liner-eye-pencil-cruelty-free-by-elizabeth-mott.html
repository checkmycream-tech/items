            <li>Great eyeliner pencil!</li>
            <li>It stays on beautifully and does not smudge.  </li>
            <li>Extremely happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>The most amazing part is that by day end, I had not reapplied and it was still there looking shimmery and beautiful!  </li>
            <li>I have fairly oily skin, so even with an eyeshadow primer, my eyeliner would run or smudge off by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I love the sparkles that it leaves!</li>
            <li>I hope they begin to offer more than three colors soon!  </li>
            <li>:) Simplify your life and buy some!</li>
            <li>this one is MUCH better at not running and at a fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li>LOVE this eyeliner!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many eye liners and this one is a keeper!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m speechless; ts amazing.</li>
            <li>The color (Raven) is nice with the ever-so-faintest sparkle.</li>
            <li>I like s thinner line - but looks nice, lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Easy to sharpen if you have a good sharpener</li>
            <li>Very happy with this eyeliner so far!</li>
            <li>Very smooth application.</li>
            <li>I really do love this.  </li>
            <li>I love that.</li>
            <li>So glad I found it :-)</li>
            <li>and I received many compliments.</li>
            <li>LOVE the color and love the hint of sparkle in it which isn&#x27;t over the top</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smooth and doesn&#x27;t smudge (unless you want it to!)</li>
            <li>It goes on very smooth and easily, and I love the touch of sparkle.</li>
            <li>I can smudge it out to get the great cat-eye look that I love, or I can just apply it as normal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very smooth, goes on fairly easy and no tugging on my eyelids.</li>
            <li>I really loved this Elizabeth Mott eye liner pencil when I first started using it.</li>
            <li>Customer service was prompt and courteous, and my items shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>As the name suggests, Elizabeth Mott&#x27;s Smooth Shadow Eye Pencil glides on REALLY smoothly!</li>
            <li>easy to put on, but the twist-up- pencil mechanism does not work well</li>
            <li>and is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect smoky black and I absolutely love that it&#x27;s cruelty free.</li>
            <li>Smears easily.  </li>
            <li>Easy to put on and props to being cruelty free.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn eyeliner since I was a teenager and have always been looking for &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34; - the miracle liner that is smooth, easy to all apply, stays on all day, doesn&#x27;t smear or smudge, is waterproof</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly, stays on well.</li>
            <li>So I rarely write reviews, however after receiving this product and using it, I thought I should spread the word so others could enjoy!</li>
            <li>This eyeliner pencil goes on so smoothly.</li>
            <li>so I can smooth the tip a bit before using it again</li>
            <li>Not 100% smudge free.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so light</li>
            <li>The color RAVEN is beautiful, not too dark.</li>
            <li>The color is nice but the pencil is just too soft and creamy for me.</li>
            <li>So even though this is the best liner I&#x27;ve ever had, unfortunately I am still looking, and will only consider twist ups (which I&#x27;m sure will have their own set of problems.)</li>
            <li>Glide on is exactly what this liner does!</li>
            <li>this is wonderful-been looking for an eyeliner that would last all day, easy to use and LOVE THIS-only one I use now and will continue to use-BUY IT</li>
            <li>It went on so smooth and made my eyes look very defined.</li>
            <li>Goes on very smooth and stays on much better than your average eyeliner pencil.</li>
            <li>The only way I&#x27;m able to remove it is with make-up remover.  </li>
            <li>so that it is actually really pretty and makes your eyes pop.  </li>
            <li>Am still figuring out how they managed to get so much color and moisture into a smudge-free, waterproof formula - GENIUS!</li>
            <li>No smudging or running through the day sweating under hot lights and taking tons of pictures.  </li>
            <li>Love the quality, but I don&#x27;t think I cared for mine properly because I would bring it with me and it would melt and change the consistency of the liner.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner hits just about every point - it stays put until I remove it (usually 16 hour days), removes easily, doesn&#x27;t smear even with the occasional popping in and out of my contacts, has a good look with a little sparkle, and the price is good for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several eyeliners, expensive and cheap, but this is the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>My friends noticed that my eyes really &amp;#34;popped&amp;#34; the first time I wore it with the</li>
            <li>As someone who has A LOT of trouble with eyeliner pencil not smudging under my eyes as the day goes on, I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this one.</li>
            <li>Superior to any other pencil I used so far.</li>
            <li>It never smudges but still removes easily with coconut oil and my regular cleanser.</li>
            <li>It seems that with every new product they put out, quality is always high and my lazy self can put it on in a jiffy and look great all day.</li>
            <li>Sharpening it is a real chore.</li>
            <li>I really wish it was a twist up.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t blend very well.</li>
            <li>So far I have yet to find an actual liner that doesn&#x27;t smudge so this is my favorite one, for now.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s important to note that the formula comes off easily at the end of the day without excessive rubbing.</li>
            <li>Once applied, this eye liner actually stays on all day, which no other product has been able to do.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I also purchased the nude pencil - looks natural; the mascara - does everything it claims; and the lip stain - I&#x27;m not a good judge on this as stains never stay all day on me, but nice color on, not as gaudy as I was worried it&#x27;d look...  </li>
            <li>Also, it would be nice if it came in black but the raven color is pretty similar to black.</li>
            <li>It goes on very dark and smooth.</li>
            <li>It really stays on for several hours.</li>
            <li>It seems to have a touch of gray in it, giving it a soft look.  </li>
            <li>I find it somewhat messy if I try to put it on quickly.</li>
            <li>A little pricey but well worth it.</li>

            <li> A little pricey but well worth it.</li>
            <li> I have the Raven so far but will probably purchase the other colors.</li>
            <li> Too dark (it&#x27;s basically black) and waaaay too much glitter -</li>
            <li> I had mushy goo stuck all over my eye pencil sharpener and still not able to sharpen and use my new Elizabeth Mott eye pencil!</li>
            <li> Only problem I had was when I sharpened it, about a quarter of the stick was empty.</li>
            <li> My only wish is it would come in a dark brown color.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely my go-to from now on; I&#x27;m hoping they come out with some other colors, too!</li>
            <li> The black isn&#x27;t just straight black, it has a little shimmer..</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> If you have ever experienced hard nasty pencils that poke your eye out, or color that bleeds everywhere and by the end of the day you look like a panda in the office, then you should DEFINITELY get this pencil!</li>
            <li> I usually use Urban Decay 24/7 but bought this on a whim to try.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to giving it another try and other products by this brand as well.</li>
            <li> I will definitely continue using the eye products, not sure about the stain...</li>
            <li> I need to be very careful and take my time when applying this.  </li>
            <li> but just adds a little \\&quot;extra\\&quot; to my every day eye look.</li>
            <li> (I wear contacts), looks sorta natural, AND is not too expensive...  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I almost have to sharpen it with every application, or it tends to go on too thick for daytime wear.</li>
            <li> One star off because it&#x27;s a pencil that needs to be sharpened, adding a pause to my morning routine and making me work to get a thinner line on my lower lid - although I find that this lets me control how thick or sharp I want my eyeliner to look for the day.  </li>
            <li> When I need to sharpen it, I put it in the freezer for at least 1/2 hour or longer.</li>
            <li> Not happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> The color makes a statement without being too dramatic.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after I sharpened it, the pencil inside was mushy and gooey and there was no way it would sharpen.</li>
            <li> Eyeliner goes on very poorly.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, this is just too gaudy - AND PAINFUL! -</li>
            <li> This bad boy stays put all day.</li>
            <li> Burned my eyes like crazy!</li>
            <li> I have a very expensive liner that is horrible....</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> Very happy with this eyeliner so far! I usually use Urban Decay 24/7 but bought this on a whim to try. Goes on smoothly, stays on well. The color (Raven) is nice with the ever-so-faintest sparkle.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best eyeliner pencils I have ever used. I have fairly oily skin, so even with an eyeshadow primer, my eyeliner would run or smudge off by the end of the day. I don&#x27;t have that with this. This bad boy stays put all day. ALL. DAY. I can smudge it out to get the great cat-eye look that I love, or I can just apply it as normal. It&#x27;s very smooth, goes on fairly easy and no tugging on my eyelids. I just...I&#x27;m speechless; ts amazing.</li>
            <li> easy to put on, but the twist-up- pencil mechanism does not work well</li>

            <li> This is the best pencil liner that I have ever tried! I had ten or so different products and just threw them all away since buying this product. Once applied, this eye liner actually stays on all day, which no other product has been able to do.</li>
            <li> The color makes a statement without being too dramatic. I love the sparkles that it leaves! I rub my eyes a lot throughout the day and it has yet to smudge on my face. Easy to put on and props to being cruelty free. I will definitely buy this again!</li>

            <li> It goes on very dark and smooth. You can also create a smokey eye effect. It doesn&#x27;t smear, even after dancing all night. I&#x27;ve tried several eyeliners, expensive and cheap, but this is the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I really do love this.  My only wish is it would come in a dark brown color.  It stays on beautifully and does not smudge.  The only way I&#x27;m able to remove it is with make-up remover.  Easy to sharpen if you have a good sharpener and is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful product.  It does not run and I do not look like I have raccoon eyes by the end of the day.  I hope they begin to offer more than three colors soon!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I bought this liner in Raven.  Too dark (it&#x27;s basically black) and waaaay too much glitter - a piece actually fell into my eye as I was applying.  Needless to say, this is just too gaudy - AND PAINFUL! - for my taste.</li>
            <li> Very smooth application.</li>
            <li> So I rarely write reviews, however after receiving this product and using it, I thought I should spread the word so others could enjoy! If you have ever experienced hard nasty pencils that poke your eye out, or color that bleeds everywhere and by the end of the day you look like a panda in the office, then you should DEFINITELY get this pencil! It went on so smooth and made my eyes look very defined. The most amazing part is that by day end, I had not reapplied and it was still there looking shimmery and beautiful!  The black isn&#x27;t just straight black, it has a little shimmer..NOT GLITTER...so that it is actually really pretty and makes your eyes pop.  I&#x27;m asian, so anything to make my eyes look bigger, i&#x27;m ALL IN. I hope you get to try this product...Elizabeth Mott mascara is great too! Like the wand and color on that too! It seems that with every new product they put out, quality is always high and my lazy self can put it on in a jiffy and look great all day. I love that. :) Simplify your life and buy some!</li>
            <li> As the name suggests, Elizabeth Mott&#x27;s Smooth Shadow Eye Pencil glides on REALLY smoothly! Am still figuring out how they managed to get so much color and moisture into a smudge-free, waterproof formula - GENIUS! I think it&#x27;s important to note that the formula comes off easily at the end of the day without excessive rubbing. It&#x27;s the perfect eye pencil - THANK YOU EM!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a Harley Quinn cosplay and I needed something to stay on ALL DAY while attending a convention.  This product performed like a champ and I still use it with my every day makeup.  No smudging or running through the day sweating under hot lights and taking tons of pictures.  I will definitely put this in my Keepers box!</li>
            <li> I have a very expensive liner that is horrible....this one is MUCH better at not running and at a fraction of the cost! So glad I found it :-)</li>
            <li> This eyeliner pencil goes on so smoothly. The color RAVEN is beautiful, not too dark. It seems to have a touch of gray in it, giving it a soft look.  My friends noticed that my eyes really &amp;#34;popped&amp;#34; the first time I wore it with the It&#x27;s So BIG Mascara and I received many compliments. Thank you Elizabeth Mott for another great product!</li>
            <li> Burned my eyes like crazy! Could not keep my eyes open. I thought it was just me possibly being allergic to something in it. I have the liner to my niece who also tried it and had the same problem. I had to toss this out!</li>
            <li> Glides on beautifully, stays on all day, doesn&#x27;t smudge or budge! LOVE the color and love the hint of sparkle in it which isn&#x27;t over the top but just adds a little \\&quot;extra\\&quot; to my every day eye look. Beautiful! I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this eyeliner. It glides on and stays all day. So why 3 stars? Sharpening it is a real chore. I really wish it was a twist up. When I need to sharpen it, I put it in the freezer for at least 1/2 hour or longer. Then I use the best sharpener I can find. Then  I refrigerate it so I can smooth the tip a bit before using it again otherwise it tends to crumble on the tip after sharpening. So even though this is the best liner I&#x27;ve ever had, unfortunately I am still looking, and will only consider twist ups (which I&#x27;m sure will have their own set of problems.)</li>
            <li> LOVE this eyeliner! It goes on so smooth and doesn&#x27;t smudge (unless you want it to!) by the end of the day. It&#x27;s the perfect smoky black and I absolutely love that it&#x27;s cruelty free. Found my holy grail eyeliner! (Finally!)</li>
            <li> I really loved this Elizabeth Mott eye liner pencil when I first started using it. Unfortunately, after I sharpened it, the pencil inside was mushy and gooey and there was no way it would sharpen. I had mushy goo stuck all over my eye pencil sharpener and still not able to sharpen and use my new Elizabeth Mott eye pencil! Had to return it!</li>
            <li> Awesome liner for dancers who work around lighting. Not 100% smudge free. I find that they start to smudge after 4 hours at best. Also, it would be nice if it came in black but the raven color is pretty similar to black. So far I have yet to find an actual liner that doesn&#x27;t smudge so this is my favorite one, for now.</li>
            <li> greattt liner! Love the quality, but I don&#x27;t think I cared for mine properly because I would bring it with me and it would melt and change the consistency of the liner. Would def recommend and would def give it another try. The brand.. has great mascara too! Looking forward to giving it another try and other products by this brand as well.</li>
            <li> The color is nice but the pencil is just too soft and creamy for me. It also doesn&#x27;t blend very well. Not happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> As someone who has A LOT of trouble with eyeliner pencil not smudging under my eyes as the day goes on, I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this one. Goes on very smooth and stays on much better than your average eyeliner pencil.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  Eyeliner goes on very poorly.  Smears easily.  Cannot twist up the liner.  Would not order again and would not recommend.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn eyeliner since I was a teenager and have always been looking for &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34; - the miracle liner that is smooth, easy to all apply, stays on all day, doesn&#x27;t smear or smudge, is waterproof (I wear contacts), looks sorta natural, AND is not too expensive...  This eyeliner hits just about every point - it stays put until I remove it (usually 16 hour days), removes easily, doesn&#x27;t smear even with the occasional popping in and out of my contacts, has a good look with a little sparkle, and the price is good for me.  One star off because it&#x27;s a pencil that needs to be sharpened, adding a pause to my morning routine and making me work to get a thinner line on my lower lid - although I find that this lets me control how thick or sharp I want my eyeliner to look for the day.  I also purchased the nude pencil - looks natural; the mascara - does everything it claims; and the lip stain - I&#x27;m not a good judge on this as stains never stay all day on me, but nice color on, not as gaudy as I was worried it&#x27;d look...  Customer service was prompt and courteous, and my items shipped quickly.  I will definitely continue using the eye products, not sure about the stain...</li>
            <li> what a great product! Glide on is exactly what this liner does! No pulling on the eyelid at all and it&#x27;s so light you forget you have it on and believe me I&#x27;ve tried many eye liners and this one is a keeper! I would definitely recommend this liner!</li>
            <li> The best eyeliner ever. Does not smear or smudge. Stays in place. I have tried them all and none can compare to this. A little pricey but well worth it. No smearing or smudging all day and even outside sweating and mowing still in place. The best eyeliner ever.</li>
            <li> Good product. Stays on well. Only problem I had was when I sharpened it, about a quarter of the stick was empty.</li>
            <li> Great eyeliner pencil! It goes on very smooth and easily, and I love the touch of sparkle. I have the Raven so far but will probably purchase the other colors. My only complaint is that I almost have to sharpen it with every application, or it tends to go on too thick for daytime wear. It never smudges but still removes easily with coconut oil and my regular cleanser. This is definitely my go-to from now on; I&#x27;m hoping they come out with some other colors, too!</li>
