            <li>Coverage is great, however, the dimethicone/silicon ingredients in this foundation does not bode well with already oily skin.</li>

            <li>OK this coverage is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This stuff goes on smooth, is sheen but has good coverage</li>
            <li>Light non greasy good coverage.  </li>
            <li>I use &amp;#34;pale beige&amp;#34; which, despite the name, is good for medium toned, cool undertone skin.</li>
            <li>This foundation gives you the best of both worlds, nice liquid application and dry to touch mineral powder.  </li>
            <li>and now i just ordered 3 more.</li>
            <li>this is so much better.</li>
            <li>Love, Love, LOVE.</li>
            <li>I appreciate being able to buy it online.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I also love that it has spf.  </li>
            <li>Adding a spf to my skin just made it more greasier.  </li>
            <li>Love .my  foundation.  </li>
            <li>but it is great for a foundation feels nice and soft on face and covers well too.  </li>
            <li>I was using another foundation, but I didn&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li>Got the tender beige and it matched my light skin perfectly, im not pale but fair skinned with some color.</li>
            <li>it covered so well and smoothly.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s so light.  </li>
            <li>and it is light but provides some coverage</li>
            <li>Light and clean.</li>
            <li>Very little is needed and the color is perfect.</li>
            <li>Feels cool going on,</li>
            <li>Great coverage without being pasty or heavy.  </li>
            <li>My skin is extremely sensitive, though, and most products blister me.</li>
            <li>Because it is such a light foundation it needs a gentle brush to apply it smoothly.</li>
            <li>This color is lovely, although a tad bit dark for my light olive skin.</li>
            <li>My first time using this product.</li>
            <li>Most were cakey but left my skin greasy, and powder is too drying.  </li>
            <li>It does not magically turn to powder once on - in fact, I have to use a light powder foundation and finishing powder on top of it to not look oily.</li>
            <li>I did get the concealer as well and only needed a light touch on one area and under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>A pea size will cover your whole face.</li>
            <li>&amp; you really can feel the smoothness on your fingers even.</li>
            <li>Really combo skin.  </li>
            <li>The mineral foundation goes on silky smooth and the coverage is outstanding without looking thick or cakey.  </li>
            <li>decent coverage</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>thin liquid, good coverage.  </li>
            <li>I have found a new brand of makeup.</li>
            <li>I have rosacea and have been able to wear liquid mineral makeup in the past, but my old brand was discontinued.  </li>
            <li>Last year, my daughter got married and we each had our hair and makeup done professionally that day.  </li>
            <li>makes my skin look soft and clear!</li>
            <li>It has a little shimmer in it, but just enough to give me a glow that I love.</li>
            <li>I switched from Bare Minerals...</li>

            <li> Looks the same late in the day as when I first put it on in the morning whereas MAC looked cakey by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> Strange it does not have a brand, and I hope I can find if Amazon doesnt sell in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Only need a small amount so the bottle lasts a long time.  </li>

            <li> Unlike other liquids this stays put and doesn&#x27;t rub off on everything I touch.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it did not live up to my hopes of a natural looking, liquid to powder foundation.</li>
            <li> Now I just need a little powder for my tzone, leaving everything else alone.  </li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> The Bare Minerals would actually cake up on my face, which I have NEVER experienced in a make-up, and looked disgusting &amp; scabby.</li>
            <li> It has also made my acne considerably worse as well.</li>

            <li> OK this coverage is amazing.  I used a kabuki brush to apply after using the face primer.  I have redness and acne scars. it covered so well and smoothly.  I did get the concealer as well and only needed a light touch on one area and under my eyes.  My friend was amazed,  because she sees me without makeup and she said you would never know i had skin issues. And it&#x27;s so light.  Feels like I&#x27;m not wearing anything!  I&#x27;m definitely going to stock up on the primer and foundationn&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;This foundation is still the best. I can wear it swimming and it stays on! I ran out for about 2 months and now i just ordered 3 more. Which one tube lasts me about 5-6 months. A pea size will cover your whole face. I do suggest getting a kabuki brush to apply it. Because it is such a light foundation it needs a gentle brush to apply it smoothly. It does dry and it stays on ALL DAY</li>
            <li> This is probably a good product.  It&#x27;s just very different than what I am used to using.  I won&#x27;t reorder.</li>
            <li> This color is lovely, although a tad bit dark for my light olive skin. Coverage is great, however, the dimethicone/silicon ingredients in this foundation does not bode well with already oily skin. It does not magically turn to powder once on - in fact, I have to use a light powder foundation and finishing powder on top of it to not look oily.

Unfortunately it did not live up to my hopes of a natural looking, liquid to powder foundation.</li>
            <li> I have found a new brand of makeup. Seriously. I switched from Bare Minerals...the liquid kind with the brush &amp; OMG...this is so much better. The Bare Minerals would actually cake up on my face, which I have NEVER experienced in a make-up, and looked disgusting &amp; scabby. This stuff goes on smooth, is sheen but has good coverage &amp; you really can feel the smoothness on your fingers even. Love, Love, LOVE.</li>
            <li> Got the tender beige and it matched my light skin perfectly, im not pale but fair skinned with some color. Great product and works great, should reapply once really. makes my skin look soft and clear!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Use this every day! Excellent product, goes on smooth, good coverage, good color options. I appreciate being able to buy it online.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite foundation!  The mineral foundation goes on silky smooth and the coverage is outstanding without looking thick or cakey.  This is the only foundation I want to use.</li>
            <li> nice foundation, and it is light but provides some coverage</li>
            <li> Replaced my MAC Mineral Pressed Powder with this and I love it.  Looks the same late in the day as when I first put it on in the morning whereas MAC looked cakey by the end of the day.  So glad this was recommended to me by a friend!!</li>
            <li> My first time using this product. Very pleased and will continue ordering. Great price and great service from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great coverage without being pasty or heavy.  I was delighted to find it on Amazon.  I used to buy this foundation at a local Beauty Supply store but have since moved.</li>
            <li> Wonderful and price was right!!!</li>
            <li> decent coverage but does not cover everything.. blends well</li>

Feels cool going on, thin liquid, good coverage.  My skin is oily but dry and flaky... Really combo skin.  Was using other brands (mac, beauticontrol, loreal, makeup forever, and some others.  Most were cakey but left my skin greasy, and powder is too drying.  Tried finishing powder, but would still have to use powder.  Now I just need a little powder for my tzone, leaving everything else alone.  I also love that it has spf.  Adding a spf to my skin just made it more greasier.  Very happy with this and the price is good.</li>

            <li> Love .my  foundation.  Light and clean.</li>
            <li> I do like this product. I use it a lot and like the finish it gives.</li>
            <li> It was orange. Who has orange skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for  short time but it is great for a foundation feels nice and soft on face and covers well too.  Great buy.</li>
            <li> I was using another foundation, but I didn&#x27;t love it.  Last year, my daughter got married and we each had our hair and makeup done professionally that day.  The girl who did my makeup used this on me and I ended up purchasing it from her.  Now I buy it off of amazon.  I have the red nose and chin, but you wouldn&#x27;t know it if I had this foundation on.</li>
