            <li>I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;d be okay for those who have.</li>
            <li>I used eye pencils way more than liquid liner.  </li>
            <li>I really love this stick primer because it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li>You just apply some onto your lids and then use a brush (or your finger) to smooth and blend out.</li>

            <li>I got it quick and was excited to try it out.  </li>
            <li>Overall a good value for the price.</li>
            <li>Full blown creases after 5.</li>
            <li>I love how the primer is so smooth and soft</li>
            <li>Its light and creamie and dont crease  or look wet on your lids this ia a good primer.</li>
            <li>LA Girl&#x27;s formula is slightly creamy, so it goes on very smoothly...a very good thing.</li>
            <li>b/c I&#x27;m busy, and don&#x27;t have time to keep refreshing a primer for eye shadow to look well.</li>
            <li>This is a good primer, but it is a little light, even for me, and I am a very light red head.</li>
            <li>The texture of this primer causes eye pencils to not go on as smooth as it normally would.  </li>
            <li>This is the first primer I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, eye shadow glides over primer leaving a professional look.</li>
            <li>I was worried about this product at first because of some of the reviews that say that it still causes your eye shadow to wrinkle</li>
            <li>I love this primer my make up last all day,  </li>
            <li>This was the first one I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>The color is fine too, just light enough to open up the eye, but not so light you look bug-eyed.</li>
            <li>I have very oily eyelid.</li>
            <li>It really brings out the color of my eye shadows, and I do find that when I use this primer the color lasts longer.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>it is the weakest on the hand and, supposedly, doesn&#x27;t pull or stretch the skin as much).  </li>
            <li>Also I don&#x27;t believe it helped too much with the crease I always end up with in my eyeshadow...</li>
            <li>I could tell that I shouldn&#x27;t use much because of the creaminess.  </li>
            <li>I have really, really oily skin which causes a lot of my crease problems.</li>
            <li>i love this product the only one ive used so far.</li>
            <li>slides around and thick but good coverage under eyes and evening your lids</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and allows pigments to show true color (I am a medium skinned African American woman - caramel-peanut butter complexion).</li>
            <li>LA Girl primer does not dry as quickly as the Chanel product</li>
            <li>i really liked how this product looked but after a couple days of wearing it my eyes started to burn and some skin came off :/</li>
            <li>Recently went to Bahamas on a Cruise for my Birthday, and took this primer b/c of its slenderness, and quick use.</li>
            <li>Professionals, models, new beginners just learning how to apply eye shadow.....</li>
            <li>The primer made your makeup look very professional.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine if I want to go out at night for a few hours.  </li>
            <li>it seems like you don&#x27;t see as much of the actual eyeshadow color after this is applied though.</li>
            <li>Used twice so far and shadows have not creased or faded whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I bought some glittery eye shadow that is so pretty, but doesn&#x27;t stay on very long.  </li>
            <li>it just kind of weird</li>
            <li>I had to wipe a few times to get it off which is not bad for daily wear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this product to people with dry or normal skin.</li>
            <li>I gave it three stars because it could work with those who have normal or dry skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure where the 5 star reviews come from, the product doesn&#x27;t quiet work as a true eye shadow PRIMER, maybe just as a shadow..</li>
            <li>so I was surprised that the primer didn&#x27;t help the eye liner stay in place as long as it did the eye shadow.  </li>

            <li> I love this eyeshadow base, it&#x27;s making my eyeshadow last longer and look fresh even after being on for several hours.</li>
            <li> wear dark brown shadow near my lash line and a somewhat lighter brown at the crease.</li>
            <li> I recommend this primer for anyone who wants to look on point all the time w/o looking like their trying to hard.</li>
            <li> It creates a crease and doesn&#x27;t make the eye shadow last all day long (like my other $7 primer does)</li>
            <li> The creaminess disappears after a bit as the product dries, but it doesn&#x27;t dry out to the point where it looks powdery and flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The color matches as expected.  </li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times, but it does help with the dark coloration around my eyes and increases the amount of time my eye shadow stays on.  </li>
            <li> It just takes a couple of tries to see what works with your face!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what paupieres translates to in English, but with a $38 price tag, it could be &#x27;pauper.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m tired of cosmetics that don&#x27;t live up to their promises or use prestige pricing that covers the cost of the fancy packaging, not quality ingredients.</li>
            <li> It is dark and shows through my white/creamish eye shadow....</li>
            <li> The last think you want to do is to rub that delicate skin on your eyelid trying to put on an even coat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The LA Girl shadow base is, simply, better.</li>
            <li> Chanel&#x27;s base was the only one I found that really did keep it intact all day long...</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like that it&#x27;s a little oily feeling.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it would have been a two stars for keeping the crease away for a little while.</li>
            <li> so well it takes me a few wipes to wipe</li>
            <li> My makeup still fades after a few hours.</li>
            <li> Instead of Chanel&#x27;s annoying brush, you smooth it on with a finger (and you know,</li>
            <li> Eye shadow will stay in place for a few hours.  </li>
            <li> There was a slight crease that was hardly noticeable after 1 hours.</li>
            <li> I think it is sort of thick, and I would prefer something creamer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a stick and has a creamy feel to it, which I don&#x27;t mind; however, it fails after a few hours of having it on ..</li>
            <li> I have very oily eyelids - this worked wonders as a primer and base for my shadow!</li>
            <li> however it does make a weird cease line after it drys out on my eye lid.</li>
            <li> I prefer a primer that isn&#x27;t so creamy as I use a pencil eye liner that is difficult to put on over the creamy primer.</li>
            <li> My &#x27;go to&#x27; brand was Chanel Base Ombre a Paupieres.</li>
            <li> I hate it when my eye shadow creases and runs; this seems to help with this.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect primer for your lid. It&#x27;s easy to sweep on and makes my make up more bright and lasts all day!</li>
            <li> This is the first primer I have ever tried. It is just ok. I think it is sort of thick, and I would prefer something creamer. It is dark and shows through my white/creamish eye shadow....I will continue using for now because it is better than no primer at all. I have very oily eyelid.</li>
            <li> It is pretty okay however it does make a weird cease line after it drys out on my eye lid. I don&#x27;t know, it just kind of weird</li>
            <li> I really love this stick primer because it&#x27;s easy to apply. You just apply some onto your lids and then use a brush (or your finger) to smooth and blend out. It really brings out the color of my eye shadows, and I do find that when I use this primer the color lasts longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure where the 5 star reviews come from, the product doesn&#x27;t quiet work as a true eye shadow PRIMER, maybe just as a shadow.. It&#x27;s a stick and has a creamy feel to it, which I don&#x27;t mind; however, it fails after a few hours of having it on .. It creates a crease and doesn&#x27;t make the eye shadow last all day long (like my other $7 primer does) the reason I decided to give this a try is because of the 5 star reviews. I won&#x27;t buy this product again, and will instead stick to my current eye shadow primer (it&#x27;s by by ruby kisses and also sold on amazon)</li>
            <li> Recently went to Bahamas on a Cruise for my Birthday, and took this primer b/c of its slenderness, and quick use. It goes on smoothly, eye shadow glides over primer leaving a professional look. Primer stay put so well it takes me a few wipes to wipe off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, that&#x27;s why I bought it b/c I&#x27;m busy, and don&#x27;t have time to keep refreshing a primer for eye shadow to look well. So, it worked for me. I recommend this primer for anyone who wants to look on point all the time w/o looking like their trying to hard. Professionals, models, new beginners just learning how to apply eye shadow.....you&#x27;ll luv this primer. I rated it 4 stars only b/c I had to wipe a few times to get it off which is not bad for daily wear.</li>
            <li> I bought some glittery eye shadow that is so pretty, but doesn&#x27;t stay on very long.  I did a search for eye shadow primer and just bought the cheapest one.  I got it quick and was excited to try it out.  It&#x27;s like a crayon, so you put it on your lid and I kinda dabbed it with my finger tip.  When I applied my eye shadow it went on smooth and darker than without the primer.  My eye shadow stayed on all day!  I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I was worried about this product at first because of some of the reviews that say that it still causes your eye shadow to wrinkle but I learned that there are a couple of tricks you can do to keep it from doing that. This made me really enjoy it! If you start off with a fresh clean face it works way better. Also if you do not cake it on! Use just the right amount and it will be flawless :) It just takes a couple of tries to see what works with your face! I like it!</li>
            <li> THis also works great as a concealer on blotchy areas of your face!  Goes on really nice and keeps my eyeshadow on most of the day.  Good product!  I would order more.</li>
            <li> I love this primer my make up last all day,  but I don&#x27;t like that it&#x27;s a little oily feeling.</li>
            <li> This works great, is easy to apply and lasts a very long time.  The shade is perfect as well.</li>
            <li> Great primer, so glad I found it! Just repurchased it and will continue to. I love makeup and will be attending cosmetology school and I&#x27;ve even got friends swearing by it. Inexpensive, great quality and speedy shipping, it&#x27;s a win win !</li>
            <li> Great for eyeshadow! It stays all dayy</li>
            <li> I prefer a primer that isn&#x27;t so creamy as I use a pencil eye liner that is difficult to put on over the creamy primer. I don&#x27;t find that it keeps the shadow on longer. My makeup still fades after a few hours.</li>
            <li> great primer my eye shadow stay on all day I never go anywhere without using it</li>
            <li> The primer made your makeup look very professional. No smudge it was very easy to apply I love it. thanks</li>
            <li> slides around and thick but good coverage under eyes and evening your lids</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what I ordered!!</li>
            <li> For the price, this could be the best eyeshadow primer I&#x27;ve ever used.  My &#x27;go to&#x27; brand was Chanel Base Ombre a Paupieres. I&#x27;m not sure what paupieres translates to in English, but with a $38 price tag, it could be &#x27;pauper.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LA Girl shadow base is, simply, better. Instead of Chanel&#x27;s annoying brush, you smooth it on with a finger (and you know, I hope, to only use the ring finger for this operation...it is the weakest on the hand and, supposedly, doesn&#x27;t pull or stretch the skin as much).  LA Girl primer does not dry as quickly as the Chanel product so you don&#x27;t have to race to get your make up on.  The color is fine too, just light enough to open up the eye, but not so light you look bug-eyed. LA Girl&#x27;s formula is slightly creamy, so it goes on very smoothly...a very good thing. The last think you want to do is to rub that delicate skin on your eyelid trying to put on an even coat. The creaminess disappears after a bit as the product dries, but it doesn&#x27;t dry out to the point where it looks powdery and flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear dark brown shadow near my lash line and a somewhat lighter brown at the crease. That&#x27;s the one that&#x27;s tricky and always wears away in a couple of hours. Chanel&#x27;s base was the only one I found that really did keep it intact all day long...LA Girl is just as effective, lasts just as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m tired of cosmetics that don&#x27;t live up to their promises or use prestige pricing that covers the cost of the fancy packaging, not quality ingredients. LA Girl is better than products costing many times more. Five stars gladly given for an affordable product that does exactly what it says it will.</li>
            <li> i love this product the only one ive used so far. the price is affordable and super easy to use.</li>
            <li> Just received this item yesterday. It took about 4 days to get to me. packaging was nice. I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> i love this so much because it highlights and applys so easily and makes all of my colors on my eyes and face pop out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok price is good</li>
            <li> i really liked how this product looked but after a couple days of wearing it my eyes started to burn and some skin came off :/</li>
            <li> I think it did do what it was supposed to do...it seems like you don&#x27;t see as much of the actual eyeshadow color after this is applied though. Also I don&#x27;t believe it helped too much with the crease I always end up with in my eyeshadow...keep in mind I have never used this type of makeup product in any brand. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;d be okay for those who have. The stick form is very convenient to use and the color matched my skin great!</li>
            <li> The product was delivered  in two days.  The color matches as expected.  I have only used it a few times, but it does help with the dark coloration around my eyes and increases the amount of time my eye shadow stays on.  It does not increase lines, and make-up goes on smoothly over it.  Overall a good value for the price.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeshadow base, it&#x27;s making my eyeshadow last longer and look fresh even after being on for several hours. It&#x27;s a must have...</li>
            <li> I have very oily eyelids - this worked wonders as a primer and base for my shadow! Goes on smooth and allows pigments to show true color (I am a medium skinned African American woman - caramel-peanut butter complexion). Used twice so far and shadows have not creased or faded whatsoever. Timely shipping - Great deal!</li>
            <li> Perfect eye shadow primer! My eyeshadow stays in place all day! I love how the primer is so smooth and soft and I don&#x27;t have to use my fingers to rub it all around my eye lid.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing price is good it&#x27;s like a roller pen wish it was in a lil pot like Mac paint pot  ! 😍😍😍</li>
            <li> have been using this primer for a week now, havent noticed any problems. Does make eye shadow wipe away very easy.</li>
            <li> Awesome product... So in love with it!!</li>
            <li> I have such a problem with creasing that I had to try using a primer. This was the first one I&#x27;ve ever used. It was really creamy which is something I liked immediately. I could tell that I shouldn&#x27;t use much because of the creaminess.  I used eye pencils way more than liquid liner.  The texture of this primer causes eye pencils to not go on as smooth as it normally would.  Also, it only seemed to hold the crease away for about 5 hours.  There was a slight crease that was hardly noticeable after 1 hours. Full blown creases after 5. It definitely won&#x27;t last all day.  I chop this up to not being a universal primer. As in all skin types cannot wear this. I have really, really oily skin which causes a lot of my crease problems. I thought the primer would help with that but it did not.  It&#x27;s fine if I want to go out at night for a few hours.  Eye shadow will stay in place for a few hours.  I don&#x27;t get incredibly oily under my eye (thank goodness!) so I was surprised that the primer didn&#x27;t help the eye liner stay in place as long as it did the eye shadow.  I had raccoon eyes in an hour. I&#x27;d recommend this product to people with dry or normal skin. Combination or oily skin might have to try a primer specific for oily skin.  I gave it three stars because it could work with those who have normal or dry skin. Otherwise, it would have been a two stars for keeping the crease away for a little while.</li>
            <li> This is a good primer, but it is a little light, even for me, and I am a very light red head. I hate it when my eye shadow creases and runs; this seems to help with this. For the price, it is definitely a keeper in my makeup routine.</li>
            <li> I did alot of looking around  for a good eye primer and that wasnt going to make me broke desided to give this a try cuz of some reviews and you tube videos and let me tell you its great!!!! No creaseing at all!!!! Its light and creamie and dont crease  or look wet on your lids this ia a good primer.</li>
