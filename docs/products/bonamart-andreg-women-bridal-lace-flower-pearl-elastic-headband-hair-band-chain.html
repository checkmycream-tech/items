            <li>This headband was just ok.</li>
            <li>Better on amazon tha this thing.</li>
            <li>Cute.</li>
            <li>I love this head band</li>
            <li>The Comb Headband gives your hair better support than if you were to wear this headband alone.</li>
            <li>It goes with so many things and dosent slip right off your head</li>
            <li>I love very much .</li>
            <li>Oh well you win some you loose some.</li>
            <li>It looks nice and classy.</li>
            <li>But the pearls wore off from the band very soon as they are not stitched , so I couldn&#x27;t wear it for more than 4 times.</li>
            <li>Very pretty headband.</li>
            <li>Pulled all the pearls off, and hot glue.</li>
            <li>it fit my adult head</li>
            <li>It broke the first time I tried to put it on my head.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have time to hot glue</li>
            <li>We put on the flexible comb Headband first, then we lay this flower headband over it.  </li>
            <li>This headband is good quality and came earlier than expected</li>
            <li>and I think it is decent for it&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li>I thought it was going to be a little better for the price.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money one this cheap thing ðŸ‘Ž</li>
            <li>My 6 yr old has one</li>
            <li>OK for a child maybe, but too small for an adult, even with my small head.</li>
            <li>but I had put I tiny little rubber in the back to stay I and even than I still didn&#x27;t like it that much.</li>
