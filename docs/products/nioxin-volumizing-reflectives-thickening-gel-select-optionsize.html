            <li>I have used the gel with BioAmp for many years and it was absolutely the best gel I have ever used.</li>
            <li>this is my favorite hair item; easy to use, doesn&#x27;t leave your hair looking &#x27;helmety&#x27; and a great product love it</li>
            <li>This gel thickens my hair, but the best part is how it makes my hair silky soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Amazing to me, because I thought I was losing my hair 15 years ago, and I&#x27;m still going strong.</li>

            <li>Love this thickening gel.  </li>
            <li>i love to purchase this product through Amazon and save money.  </li>
            <li>Hair is much more thicker.</li>
            <li>I probably lost more hair trying to comb through it</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for it but mostly because I don&#x27;t style my hair with a hairdryer.</li>
            <li>THis should not be sold without the appropriate disclaimer.</li>
            <li>, I just can&#x27;t afford to lose any more hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product - I love everything Nioxin.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many thickening gels for my thinning, fine hair, and this product ranks as one of the better ones for me.  </li>
            <li>I really like the scent - it is pleasant and not overpowering like some hair products can be.</li>
            <li>If you have fine hair this will work for you.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair</li>
            <li>Leaves a huge chemical feeling in my scalp.</li>
            <li>Nothing is really that effective on thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>It feels light yet keeps hair in place.</li>
            <li>I have my hair short and with Nioxin Thickening Gel, my hair looks great.</li>
            <li>is like buy 2 get one free.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this gel seems to add more texture, even when I&#x27;m not using this with hot air styling.</li>
            <li>the gel still leaves your hair feeling clean too!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Instead of the full look</li>
            <li>It is not the same gel those of us who have used and loved the product for years are accustomed to.</li>
            <li>Yes, it thickens hair without making it oily but full and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, and Nioxin products are the only line I&#x27;ve found that is dedicated to fine or thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>A great item for texture, and a little thickening as well.</li>
            <li>I wash my hair, apply, and let my hair dry on its own.  </li>
            <li>I very much like this product.</li>
            <li>Really like this product!</li>
            <li>it really works and makes your hair feel thicker!    </li>
            <li>The Nioxin thickening gel really works!  </li>
            <li>Love the entire Nioxin system.  </li>
            <li>This was my first experience with the gel and it met my needs.</li>
            <li>Thanks Nioxin!</li>
            <li>It is kind of hard to find but worth the wait!    </li>
            <li>This works pretty much as a mousse would.  </li>
            <li>Nioxin evidently is no longer making their awesome product volumizing reflectives gel with bio amp which truly gave body to my fine thin texture hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you blow dry your hair, which I do not, you may get more lift.</li>
            <li>WOULD CERTAINLY RECOMMEND IT TO MY&lt;br</li>
            <li>This will make your hair look much thicker, and also counteract humidity.  </li>
            <li>Really helps your hair &amp;#34;stand</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>-fast shipping</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Item arrived in mail in a very timely manner.  </li>
            <li>The Thickening Gel really adds volume and body to my hair.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much, so the tube lasts awhile.  </li>
            <li>Thought it would thicken my hair more, not what I expected</li>
            <li>Please, Nioxin, stop with the INTENSE perfume on this product.</li>
            <li>very god to make hair fuller</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t put it on your face, it will absolutely grow hair there.</li>
            <li>I may have used too much for my&lt;br /&gt;short hair.  </li>
            <li>thought the final look was more professional than before.</li>
            <li>My hair has added fullness and still remains flexible and relatively soft....;-)</li>
            <li>Most stuff tends to weigh it down, but this doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>My natural hair looks much thicker.</li>
            <li>I really dislike it and want the original product as listed above back.  </li>
            <li>This really thickened up my super fine thin hair without leaving a buildup.  </li>
            <li>I looked on the Nioxin website and it appears that the gel was just replaced with this new one.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>How could I ever live without it.</li>
            <li>It is light enough to not weigh down my hair yet strong enough to provide the hold.  </li>
            <li>-thanks -this product is quick, easy to use,and you only need a little to make a big difference -</li>
            <li>- my hair took the styling better than it has in the past, and&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I found the Aveda gels too heavy for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have tried other products, but this one really works for me!</li>
            <li>The Nioxin gel combines prevention of hair loss while giving me the correct amount of apparent fullness and styling control.</li>
            <li>up&amp;#34; and keep it&#x27;s style much longer than other gels I have tried.  </li>
            <li>It took me a while to get used to using this on my fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li>I can not be without this product, and it is the only thickening product that helps my fine, thin, hair.</li>

            <li> I can not be without this product, and it is the only thickening product that helps my fine, thin, hair.</li>
            <li> The new one has a stronger fragrance and weighs down my hair.</li>
            <li> , I have flat hair no matter how it is styled.</li>
            <li> Just a tiny smooch of this goes all over my hair - then I let it dry and push my hair around with my fingers to mold.  </li>
            <li> Works pretty well, but is the only Nioxin product I&#x27;ve used that stinks to high heaven of perfume.</li>
            <li> I apply it to damp hair and let my hair air dry, then brush.</li>
            <li> Was just what I expected.</li>
            <li> I have lost some hair due to a drug I was using and this product helps a lot.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> I have had to find other products that work for me.  </li>
            <li> I guess I just prefer my other brand.</li>
            <li> I use this product while my hair is wet, and style as usual.</li>
            <li> A little stiff for me</li>
            <li> a bit too stiff, once dried.  </li>
            <li> I usually order it with the Nioxin shampoo &amp; conditioner</li>
            <li> I noticed that some people complained that it made their hair heavy and sticky.  </li>
            <li> quarter-sized amount may be excessive for some of us.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair has become very thin in the past years, so I have to be careful what I put on my hair.  </li>
            <li> and it is so hard to do anything with it.</li>
            <li> I should have believed the one review that said this product was sticky and hard to comb through.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The thickening gel with pro- thick is USELESS, as it gives no body and actually ways down the hair to flatten any style!!!!!  </li>
            <li> But I have found it less expensively on another beauty website.</li>
            <li> Seriously, the tubes came sealed with plastic tape, in ziplock plastic bags, in a box.</li>
            <li> It does not flake nor does it leave my hair stiff and difficult to comb</li>
            <li> Will order this product again; it help keep thin hair in place and adds shine.</li>
            <li> It thickens thin hair</li>
            <li> and this dries my hair out badly.</li>

            <li> Great product. Good price.</li>
            <li> This will make your hair look much thicker, and also counteract humidity.  I use it every day.</li>
            <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;I have been a long-time user of Nioxin Volumizing Reflectives Thickening Gel. I can not be without this product, and it is the only thickening product that helps my fine, thin, hair. I gladly rate this product five stars! I have tried other products, but this one really works for me! I use this product while my hair is wet, and style as usual. This gel gives my hair more volume and makes my hair look thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carolyn</li>
            <li> It gives my hair more body.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this gel. Everything else from Nioxin we can find in the stores but when it comes to this gel we always order it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is NOT the Nioxin Volumizing Reflectives gel with BioAmp, even though the packaging looks very similar. I have used the gel with BioAmp for many years and it was absolutely the best gel I have ever used. Nioxin seems to have changed the gel and this dries my hair out badly.</li>
            <li> They changed this formula a year or so ago and it seems to have a stronger aroma.  I&#x27;ve gotten use to it now.  This product and their shampoo products are excellent. Beautogen has a nice price and shipping was prompt.</li>
            <li> Really like this product! Have ordered it several times and will order it again. It is very good to help control your hair plus make it appear thicker!</li>
            <li> Great for very fine hair.  Holds the curl.I apply it to damp hair and let my hair air dry, then brush.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite hair item; easy to use, doesn&#x27;t leave your hair looking &#x27;helmety&#x27; and a great product love it</li>
            <li> Love this thickening gel.  Makes my hair feel thicker.</li>
            <li> It only takes a snall amount b/c it&#x27;s like glue b ut it really works and makes your hair feel thicker!    I only use this product from Nioxin until I was introduced to the Hinoki hair system and it blows Nioxin system 2 away. It is kind of hard to find but worth the wait!    Later</li>
            <li> Nothing is really that effective on thinning hair.  I have tried almost everything out there. This works pretty much as a mousse would.  If you have substantial hair loss or thinning this product does nothing to hide or diminish this. If you blow dry your hair, which I do not, you may get more lift.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time, good price and quality.</li>
            <li> A great item for texture, and a little thickening as well. If you have fine hair this will work for you.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this gel.  It feels light yet keeps hair in place.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for fine hair.........the gel still leaves your hair feeling clean too!&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again!</li>
            <li> This helps keep my hair looking thicker as my hair is thinning</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years, and it works.  I use the shampoo too, and it works too.  Amazing to me, because I thought I was losing my hair 15 years ago, and I&#x27;m still going strong.</li>
            <li> The gel is the perfect consistency.  It is light enough to not weigh down my hair yet strong enough to provide the hold.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> The Nioxin thickening gel really works!  Will order this product again; it help keep thin hair in place and adds shine.</li>
            <li> Really helps your hair &amp;#34;stand up&amp;#34; and keep it&#x27;s style much longer than other gels I have tried.  I have lost some hair due to a drug I was using and this product helps a lot.</li>
            <li> This product is labeled Nioxin Volumizing Reflectives Thickening Gel on the Amazon site. However, I ordered this product, which I have used for years, and was sent Nioxin Thickening Gel labeled as PRO-Thick. It is not at all the same product. The new one has a stronger fragrance and weighs down my hair. Instead of the full look I had with the Voluminizing Reflectives Gel, I have flat hair no matter how it is styled. I looked on the Nioxin website and it appears that the gel was just replaced with this new one. Too bad.</li>
            <li> Sold at a great price. Quick delivery</li>
            <li> Vey good product. Once I put it into my hair I notice the difference immediately . And yes I will be re-ordering before this runs out. My natural hair looks much thicker.</li>
            <li> Nioxin is a great brand</li>
            <li> Not the product I though it would be</li>
            <li> This product is mis-labeled. It is not gel--it is cream. It is not the same gel those of us who have used and loved the product for years are accustomed to.</li>
            <li> Yes, it thickens hair without making it oily but full and shiny.  I have very very fine hair and not an abundant amount, it helps my hair look fuller. I very much like this product.</li>
            <li> i love to purchase this product through Amazon and save money.  I usually order it with the Nioxin shampoo &amp; conditioner</li>
            <li> Great for fine hair. Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I have tried many thickening gels for my thinning, fine hair, and this product ranks as one of the better ones for me.  It does not flake nor does it leave my hair stiff and difficult to comb/brush through.  My hair has added fullness and still remains flexible and relatively soft....;-)</li>
            <li> Was just what I expected. Thanks</li>
            <li> Works really good.  Hair is much more thicker.</li>
            <li> Love the entire Nioxin system.  My hair has become very thin in the past years, so I have to be careful what I put on my hair.  Most stuff tends to weigh it down, but this doesn&#x27;t.  I noticed that some people complained that it made their hair heavy and sticky.  You only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product, quick delivery!</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair and it is so hard to do anything with it. I have my hair short and with Nioxin Thickening Gel, my hair looks great. How could I ever live without it. I have stopped searching as I have found the very best!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this gel seems to add more texture, even when I&#x27;m not using this with hot air styling. Generally good hold as well.</li>
            <li> I used the Nioxin Shampoo and Conditioner and I am very happy with them.  I have thinning hair and tried this for thickness. I was very disappointed. I did not see any difference...there was no thickness, body , or volumn.  I have had to find other products that work for me.  I would not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to tell if this product is actually thickening my hair, but I guess that it is because there seems to be more volume.</li>
            <li> great product -fast shipping -thanks -this product is quick, easy to use,and you only need a little to make a big difference -</li>
            <li> I should have believed the one review that said this product was sticky and hard to comb through. It is definitely that. I probably lost more hair trying to comb through it so will have to throw it away.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I have used Nioxin products for 15+ years and wouldn&#x27;t change.  This was my first experience with the gel and it met my needs.</li>
            <li> This really thickened up my super fine thin hair without leaving a buildup.  Very happy with this product.  It also helped my curls look better too!  I hairdry immediately after use &amp; this was perfect.  Thanks Nioxin!</li>
            <li> The best product for men with thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a couple years and it works well without drying my scalp out plus ordering online is like buy 2 get one free.</li>
            <li> This gel thickens my hair, but the best part is how it makes my hair silky soft and shiny.  Great Product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for it but mostly because I don&#x27;t style my hair with a hairdryer.</li>
            <li> Item arrived in mail in a very timely manner.  No complaints all around.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product!  It thickens thin hair like there&#x27;s no tomorrow!  I wash my hair, apply, and let my hair dry on its own.  In the morning, I apply styling products, comb out, and go.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Nioxin evidently is no longer making their awesome product volumizing reflectives gel with bio amp which truly gave body to my fine thin texture hair.&lt;br /&gt;The thickening gel with pro- thick is USELESS, as it gives no body and actually ways down the hair to flatten any style!!!!!  I really dislike it and want the original product as listed above back.  My hairdresser is looking for a different product for me - unless nioxin can reinstate the product with bio amp as listed above.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, and Nioxin products are the only line I&#x27;ve found that is dedicated to fine or thinning hair.  The Thickening Gel really adds volume and body to my hair.  It doesn&#x27;t take much, so the tube lasts awhile.  I really like the scent - it is pleasant and not overpowering like some hair products can be.</li>
            <li> I use the Aveda line Invati products for thinning hair, but Invati does not include a styling gel and I found the Aveda gels too heavy for my fine hair. The Nioxin gel combines prevention of hair loss while giving me the correct amount of apparent fullness and styling control. But I have found it less expensively on another beauty website.</li>
            <li> Thought it would thicken my hair more, not what I expected</li>
            <li> This product is from Mexico! The actual Nioxin is from the USA. THis should not be sold without the appropriate disclaimer.</li>
            <li> Dries out my hair. If you have oily hair this will be perfect for you. It works great, I just can&#x27;t afford to lose any more hair.</li>
            <li> IVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR SEVERAL YEARSOW, MAKES MY HAIR EASIER TO STYLE AND HOLD THE STYLE FOR TWO TO THREE DAYS.</li>
            <li> Wanted to try this product as I am using another Nioxin product for encouraging growth and fullness.  This product does add additional volume as I had hoped and I&#x27;m very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS GOOD.  TRIED IT AND IT IS UP TO STANDARD.  WOULD CERTAINLY RECOMMEND IT TO MY&lt;br /&gt;FRIENDS.  LB</li>
            <li> Works pretty well, but is the only Nioxin product I&#x27;ve used that stinks to high heaven of perfume. Seriously, the tubes came sealed with plastic tape, in ziplock plastic bags, in a box. Put the box on the couch for a day. Next day the couch stank of perfume. Please, Nioxin, stop with the INTENSE perfume on this product. The Volumizing Reflectives gel, which you&#x27;ve stopped making, was stronger and didn&#x27;t stink. How about bringing that back?</li>
            <li> very god to make hair fuller</li>
            <li> Holds up all day without looking greasy.  Does seem to add volume to my thinning hair.  I have been using it for a couple of years and have not found anything comparable.</li>
            <li> Very nice - great smell and superior hold!  It took me a while to get used to using this on my fine, thin hair.  Just a tiny smooch of this goes all over my hair - then I let it dry and push my hair around with my fingers to mold.  It&#x27;s that good.  I love this product - I love everything Nioxin.  Don&#x27;t put it on your face, it will absolutely grow hair there.</li>
            <li> I was out of another brand of gel I preferred, so since I use the Nioxin mousse foam  I thought I would try this gel.  A little stiff for me but it works. I guess I just prefer my other brand.</li>
            <li> Leaves a huge chemical feeling in my scalp. If I don&#x27;t wash it off in 12 hours I get itchy and red scalp.</li>
            <li> a bit too stiff, once dried.  I may have used too much for my&lt;br /&gt;short hair.  Will experiment with lesser amounts in the future.&lt;br /&gt;A quarter-sized amount may be excessive for some of us.&lt;br /&gt;But - my hair took the styling better than it has in the past, and&lt;br /&gt;I thought the final look was more professional than before.</li>
            <li> The best on the market. I have tried everything else on the counter, and honestly this is the best. H</li>
