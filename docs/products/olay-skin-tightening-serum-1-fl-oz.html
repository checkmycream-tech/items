            <li>Since using this product I have seen fewer wrinkles and have the comments made that my skin looks great.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say I find any great tightening tho, however, did not have any great expectations in that area</li>
            <li>In just a week, the difference in my skin is amazing!</li>
            <li>it feels good on my skin.</li>

            <li>I also use it on my neck and chest, and there are visible good results.  </li>
            <li>Good product, I can see a difference in my lines on my face.  </li>
            <li>nice product, feels great on skin.</li>
            <li>Just started using this product, and I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Very glad I purchased it,</li>
            <li>It seems very innocent when using it.</li>
            <li>Was very pleased with everything about it.  </li>
            <li>and I just love it!  </li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>This was even better than the Mary Kay product I have been using!  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say I see any amazing results.</li>
            <li>It is amazing.</li>
            <li>I also use it along with a cream so don&#x27;t expect this product to work on its own.  </li>
            <li>WELL THAT IS MY OPINION &#x27;TO EACH HER OWN .</li>
            <li>I&#x27; am very pleased with Pro X and have used many of their items for years.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recall whether it&#x27;s posted here or elsewhere, but someone kindly advised that the Roc CompleteLift Serum is more effective for skin tightening than Olay&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>This one is ok but not as nice as some of the others.</li>
            <li>Much more effective than anything else I&#x27;ve tried in this price range, and some products that cost a lot more.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t write enough superlatives about how wonderful Olay products are for my wife.</li>
            <li>I love Olay Pro X</li>
            <li>Nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>was not as pleased with Pro X.</li>
            <li>I have not been pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>The Olay was much, much better than the ROC.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I use mostly Pro X product now.  </li>
            <li>I have found Olay to have the best  quality products that actually do what they say!!</li>
            <li>and I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>For the price I guess I was expecting more.</li>
            <li>I checked out this product on the skindeep  website and found that it contains many hazard/toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li>FYI &amp;#34;Skin Tightening Serum&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t take the place of a moisturizer or sun screen, so it&#x27;s one more step.</li>
            <li>This product has done more for my maturing skin than any product I have used.  </li>
            <li>;PRO X IS BETTER FOR ME ]</li>
            <li>I started by sneaking some of hers. :-)  </li>
            <li>My skin has more of a glow and is not so \\&quot;flat\\&quot; looking.  </li>
            <li>I have tried MANY products, but most have caused unbearable itching and burning, or have done nothing</li>
            <li>I love the Olay Pro X line, but this product is one I can do without.  </li>
            <li>Will continue to use and hope to see better and better results.</li>
            <li>In fact, it works better than they promote it to do.</li>
            <li>and the area around my eyes looks more youthful</li>
            <li>I love Olay.  </li>
            <li>Love this product...</li>
            <li>but here on Amazon is was much better than the store price.</li>
            <li>maybe better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and appears to be looking better.</li>
            <li>I have all of the items on subscribe and save which makes it really easy - never have to think about reordering.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this helps, but I strongly feel it halts the aging process of my skin.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see a huge tightening effect.</li>
            <li>The Oil of Olay Pro-X products are great, not only for the price, but for the effect on my skin.  </li>
            <li>The seller sent the item immediately, and it was wrapped securely.  </li>
            <li>It is light weight</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light and not greasy.  </li>
            <li>I need gluten free products and Pro X meets that requirement.</li>
            <li>For the price point I recommend it highly!!!!</li>
            <li>is super easy to use and doesn&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product in the past with excellent results, then switched to ROC at someone else&#x27;s suggestion.  </li>
            <li>At night I use the hydra firming cream which I absolutely love makes my skin feel really nice when I go to bed and wake up the next morning.  </li>
            <li>One of the best products on the market (the only reason I don&#x27;t give this a 5 is because I&#x27;m waiting for something that will make wrinkles go away completely; hopefully, in my lifetime).</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin very soft and nice.  </li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t suggest paying full price.</li>
            <li>There are plenty of cosmetics as much more reasonable prices that will do just as well....</li>
            <li>This proved true in my experience, too.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly into the skin and does not have any perfume smell.  </li>
            <li>The item arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>most of olay products are decent.</li>
            <li>Primers such as Roc Brilliance will fill in the wrinkles to create a smooth surface, but the Olay Skin Tightening Serum will also &amp;#34;tighten&amp;#34; the face in addition to filling in the fine lines, given a more youthful look than just a primer.</li>
            <li>Did not give it 5 stars because I think I need to try it longer to make an accurate evaluation of the of exact results.</li>
            <li>This product tightens skin and may have some more long lasting effects, though it does not give you a face lift lol</li>
            <li>My 13 year old daughter and I were watching a reality show in which the many of the housewives had plastic surgery, and they stated their ages.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s on sale, it&#x27;s worth a try</li>
            <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s GREAT yet</li>
            <li>It makes your face feel good, but I can do that for a lot less money.   </li>
            <li>I like this product very much.  </li>
            <li>A little help tightening the poors is always good.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for only a week and my skin feels more hydrated.  </li>
            <li>Compliments from children are rare so products like this one really work.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I have used the Pro-X line of Olay</li>
            <li>Though I don&#x27;t use the serum daily (mostly in the winter and spring), it has lasted notably longer than my regular moisturizers.</li>
            <li>This product really works!  </li>
            <li>First time use of product.</li>
            <li>Depending on what other products you use, adding this may make for one more than you want to be bothered with, unless you see tremendous results.</li>
            <li>This item worked fine for general moisturizing and temporary wrinkle reduction.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed a very positive difference in my face&#x27;s skin tone, elasticity, wrinkles, and fine lines (although it is not a remarkable difference), and I am extremely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>The purpose of a serum is to remove fine lines and expression lines just for a short period of time.</li>
            <li>Thanks again</li>
            <li>I have been using this serum for about 4 months and really like it.  </li>
            <li>It hydrates reasonably well, but I use it for firming &amp; lifting of my sagging neck.  </li>
            <li>After using a product like this, foundation can be applied and will give the skin a smoother look, in the same way a &amp;#34;primer&amp;#34; does (like before you start to paint a wall and want to create a smooth surface).</li>
            <li>and I do really like it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure whether one, two, or all three of these Olay ProX products is the reason for these results, but I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really expect results, but I&#x27;ll be darned if it doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product, but really couldn&#x27;t imagine that it would work *</li>
            <li>Because the improvement seems temporary and it isn&#x27;t really *</li>
            <li>While it is too soon to tell, I think this product works just as well as Mary Kay product and much, much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other serums, but this one really works.</li>
            <li>much better than other products, I felt the product deserves three stars.</li>
            <li>I have not used the product long enough for it to do its magic, but I have high hopes!!  </li>
            <li>I have used quite a few products since the skin revolution started few years ago, and I find these to be the best so far.</li>
            <li>My skin is less crepey and more supple.  </li>
            <li>I mainly focus on my jowl area</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to do any more that regular hand or facial lotion.</li>
            <li>Overall been very pleased and have not wanted to look at other skin care lines which, before finding this, I used to jump around and try new stuff every time I ran out of something.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>highly recommend,</li>
            <li>well worth the price as I notice a big difference after applying -</li>
            <li>No real dramatic change.</li>
            <li>This is a product that a person could live without.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone who would like to diminish the naturally occurring signs of age.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and, despite the fact that I am a 53-year-old woman, I was still getting blemishes and pimples.</li>
            <li>As a plus for both companies, these lotions and potions don&#x27;t cause my (very sensitive) skin to break out.  </li>
            <li>Similarly, I&#x27;m finding Roc&#x27;s deep wrinkle serum better than the one in the ProX kit -- though by a lesser margin than between the tightening products.</li>
            <li>Many other brands do and earlier Olay products did, which caused me not to try them again for years.</li>
            <li>i have only use the serum for less than a month so have not seen too many results.</li>
            <li>I would certainly buy from this seller again in the future!  </li>
            <li>Fine lines and wrinkles are disappearing and my skin is soft and firm.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your time.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>I may be too far gone, i like oil of olay products</li>
            <li>I guess I have to use it a little while longer to see some significant change.</li>
            <li>I really like this product but haven&#x27;t used it long enough to really see a difference.  </li>
            <li>many words to tell you it&#x27;s no good?</li>
            <li>I keep trying different skin care products in the hope that one will actually live up to the benefits described.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say tighter, but definitely a general \\&quot;better\\&quot; appearance.</li>
            <li>The first few times I used it, I felt like there was a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>After about a month, my neck looked much less crepey and was much firmer.  </li>
            <li>If someone you live with everyday, compliments you like that when you&#x27;re 43 years old</li>

            <li> Leaves my skin very soft and nice.  </li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t suggest paying full price.</li>
            <li> There are plenty of cosmetics as much more reasonable prices that will do just as well....</li>
            <li> This proved true in my experience, too.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly into the skin and does not have any perfume smell.  </li>
            <li> The item arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> most of olay products are decent.</li>
            <li> Primers such as Roc Brilliance will fill in the wrinkles to create a smooth surface, but the Olay Skin Tightening Serum will also &amp;#34;tighten&amp;#34; the face in addition to filling in the fine lines, given a more youthful look than just a primer.</li>
            <li> Did not give it 5 stars because I think I need to try it longer to make an accurate evaluation of the of exact results.</li>
            <li> This product tightens skin and may have some more long lasting effects, though it does not give you a face lift lol</li>
            <li> My 13 year old daughter and I were watching a reality show in which the many of the housewives had plastic surgery, and they stated their ages.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s on sale, it&#x27;s worth a try</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s GREAT yet</li>
            <li> It makes your face feel good, but I can do that for a lot less money.   </li>
            <li> I like this product very much.  </li>
            <li> A little help tightening the poors is always good.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for only a week and my skin feels more hydrated.  </li>
            <li> Compliments from children are rare so products like this one really work.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I have used the Pro-X line of Olay</li>
            <li> Though I don&#x27;t use the serum daily (mostly in the winter and spring), it has lasted notably longer than my regular moisturizers.</li>
            <li> This product really works!  </li>
            <li> First time use of product.</li>
            <li> Depending on what other products you use, adding this may make for one more than you want to be bothered with, unless you see tremendous results.</li>
            <li> This item worked fine for general moisturizing and temporary wrinkle reduction.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a very positive difference in my face&#x27;s skin tone, elasticity, wrinkles, and fine lines (although it is not a remarkable difference), and I am extremely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> The purpose of a serum is to remove fine lines and expression lines just for a short period of time.</li>
            <li> Thanks again</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for about 4 months and really like it.  </li>
            <li> It hydrates reasonably well, but I use it for firming &amp; lifting of my sagging neck.  </li>
            <li> After using a product like this, foundation can be applied and will give the skin a smoother look, in the same way a &amp;#34;primer&amp;#34; does (like before you start to paint a wall and want to create a smooth surface).</li>
            <li> and I do really like it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether one, two, or all three of these Olay ProX products is the reason for these results, but I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really expect results, but I&#x27;ll be darned if it doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product, but really couldn&#x27;t imagine that it would work *</li>
            <li> Because the improvement seems temporary and it isn&#x27;t really *</li>
            <li> While it is too soon to tell, I think this product works just as well as Mary Kay product and much, much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other serums, but this one really works.</li>
            <li> much better than other products, I felt the product deserves three stars.</li>
            <li> I have not used the product long enough for it to do its magic, but I have high hopes!!  </li>
            <li> I have used quite a few products since the skin revolution started few years ago, and I find these to be the best so far.</li>
            <li> My skin is less crepey and more supple.  </li>
            <li> I mainly focus on my jowl area</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do any more that regular hand or facial lotion.</li>
            <li> Overall been very pleased and have not wanted to look at other skin care lines which, before finding this, I used to jump around and try new stuff every time I ran out of something.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> highly recommend,</li>
            <li> well worth the price as I notice a big difference after applying -</li>
            <li> No real dramatic change.</li>
            <li> This is a product that a person could live without.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to anyone who would like to diminish the naturally occurring signs of age.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and, despite the fact that I am a 53-year-old woman, I was still getting blemishes and pimples.</li>
            <li> As a plus for both companies, these lotions and potions don&#x27;t cause my (very sensitive) skin to break out.  </li>
            <li> Similarly, I&#x27;m finding Roc&#x27;s deep wrinkle serum better than the one in the ProX kit -- though by a lesser margin than between the tightening products.</li>
            <li> Many other brands do and earlier Olay products did, which caused me not to try them again for years.</li>
            <li> i have only use the serum for less than a month so have not seen too many results.</li>
            <li> I would certainly buy from this seller again in the future!  </li>
            <li> Fine lines and wrinkles are disappearing and my skin is soft and firm.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your time.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> I may be too far gone, i like oil of olay products</li>
            <li> I guess I have to use it a little while longer to see some significant change.</li>
            <li> I really like this product but haven&#x27;t used it long enough to really see a difference.  </li>
            <li> many words to tell you it&#x27;s no good?</li>
            <li> I keep trying different skin care products in the hope that one will actually live up to the benefits described.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say tighter, but definitely a general \\&quot;better\\&quot; appearance.</li>
            <li> The first few times I used it, I felt like there was a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> After about a month, my neck looked much less crepey and was much firmer.  </li>
            <li> If someone you live with everyday, compliments you like that when you&#x27;re 43 years old</li>
            <li> Olay ProX products may be a little, tiny bit on the pricey side, but they cost much less here on Amazon.com (which offers a 15% subscription discount to make the prices even less) than many other stores.</li>
            <li> I waited this long to write reviews to allow enough time for these ProX products to do what they claim.</li>
            <li> After cleaning and exfoliating serums are usually the next thin you put on, and it&#x27;s a simple serum to apply, but I&#x27;m not seeing many results.</li>
            <li> I am 56 with typical Scottish girl skin…fair and sensitive, with sun damage.  </li>
            <li> who doesn&#x27;t want young looking, firm skin, and it has been well reviewed in various publications.</li>
            <li> I consider it somewhat of a luxury, so I don&#x27;t want to go overboard and pay a high price for it.</li>
            <li> I love Olay and some of the Pro-X line are cutting edge...</li>
            <li> Again, long time customer.</li>
            <li> I definitely noticed a difference in the tone &amp; quality of my skin since I started using the line of Olay PROx products (been about a year now) - less wrinkles, skin looks younger &amp; softer.  </li>
            <li> I am on day 29 using the entire ProX line and the only difference is that now I have breakouts and black heads.</li>
            <li> I wait until it&#x27;s dry before adding the moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I usually get a sarcastic remark, and I said yes.  </li>
            <li> and I have learned that no high price cream beats the Olay products.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought products that are so much more expensive (Algenist, Clarins), but no more.</li>
            <li> I have very dry \\&quot;mature\\&quot; skin.  </li>
            <li> This product is very dry on the skin.  </li>
            <li> I can say I do feel it softens the appearance of some of my lines, but I am older and decided to lose a lot of weight which was not a good idea wrinkle-wise.  </li>
            <li> This skin tightening serum lasts me about 2 months as you really do not use alot.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m looking forward to some results by the time it&#x27;s empty.</li>
            <li> When I stopped using Orlane creams due to price, I thought I would never find products which worked as well.  </li>
            <li> this is the one I would choose over any other.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it for me, but of course, your results may vary.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is discontinued AND is REALLY pricey.</li>
            <li> I am very used to it and feel uncomfortable without it  </li>
            <li> (CVS pharmacy also makes a knockoff that works just as well in my experience, for less money).  </li>
            <li> but i am unable to see any improvement in the decrease in wrinkles, although i dont notice any new ones so thats a plus.</li>
            <li> They are almost imperceptible.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday under my makeup</li>
            <li> And usually, if you see it in the store it is part of some package deal.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this Olay ProX Skin Tightening Serum, as well as the Olay ProX Age Repair Lotion and Olay ProX Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser, for the past 2-1/2 months.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t stop the aging process but can at least slow it a little!</li>
            <li> My jaw line and eyelids gave in to gravity this past year, making me look mean and tired.</li>
            <li> The lines on my forehead have greatly decreased.</li>
            <li> But, for the price, I think you cannot expect dramatic overnight results.</li>
            <li> But, I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> This stuff flies off the shelf where I shop, so I guess others are in on the secret!</li>
            <li> It works just as well as some of the exceedingly expensive $100+ products.</li>
            <li> She used it but did not want to reorder as it is exaggerated as to what the advertisement states it will do for the skin.</li>
            <li> It is dangerous for my health.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be afraid to quit using it.</li>
            <li> very disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I can&#x27;t write enough superlatives about how wonderful Olay products are for my wife. Pro X Skin Tightening Serum included. Highly Recommended. very good service from seller.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of Olay products and this one is great.  I have been using this product for only a week and my skin feels more hydrated.  I also use it along with a cream so don&#x27;t expect this product to work on its own.  The pro wrinkle cream works great alongside this one.  Thanks again Olay!</li>
            <li> I definitely noticed a difference in the tone &amp; quality of my skin since I started using the line of Olay PROx products (been about a year now) - less wrinkles, skin looks younger &amp; softer.  I use this in the morning along with the lotion - age repair SPF30 and the eye restoration cream.  At night I use the hydra firming cream which I absolutely love makes my skin feel really nice when I go to bed and wake up the next morning.  I have all of the items on subscribe and save which makes it really easy - never have to think about reordering.  This skin tightening serum lasts me about 2 months as you really do not use alot.  Overall been very pleased and have not wanted to look at other skin care lines which, before finding this, I used to jump around and try new stuff every time I ran out of something.</li>
            <li> I love Olay Pro X it feels good on my skin. Nice and smooth. People always say how good my skin looks.</li>
            <li> I keep trying different skin care products in the hope that one will actually live up to the benefits described.  I used the product day and night for several weeks but did not notice any difference in my skin at all.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try Pro X by Olay. I was using Olay regenerist 7 serum.&lt;br /&gt;I was not as pleased with Pro X. When I would put it on at night, it would harden.&lt;br /&gt;The Regenerist serum does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m switching back.</li>
            <li> I really like this product but haven&#x27;t used it long enough to really see a difference.  Leaves my skin very soft and nice.  Absorbs quickly into the skin and does not have any perfume smell.  I have sensitive skin.  Would recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Just started using this product, and I am very pleased with the results. I have tried many other serums, but this one really works. Fine lines and wrinkles are disappearing and my skin is soft and firm. I would highly recommend this product. My 13 year old daughter and I were watching a reality show in which the many of the housewives had plastic surgery, and they stated their ages. My daughter turned to me and said they are all younger than you? I usually get a sarcastic remark, and I said yes.  She said that you look younger than them. Compliments from children are rare so products like this one really work.</li>
            <li> When I stopped using Orlane creams due to price, I thought I would never find products which worked as well.  But, I was wrong.  The Oil of Olay Pro-X products are great, not only for the price, but for the effect on my skin.  Highly, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have not used the product long enough for it to do its magic, but I have high hopes!!  The seller sent the item immediately, and it was wrapped securely.  I would certainly buy from this seller again in the future!  gayle bouffard</li>
            <li> I have not been pleased with this product.  I do not feel that it has helped me  at all.  It makes your face feel good, but I can do that for a lot less money.   I use  Olay Products, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for about 4 months and really like it.  It goes on smoothly and leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> highly recommend, well worth the price as I notice a big difference after applying - it does lift. I mainly focus on my jowl area</li>
            <li> I will not use this stuff again. Saw no changes. Do not waste your time. Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I have used the Pro-X line of Olay and I just love it!  There has been a visible difference in the tightness of my skin and smoother jawline.  Very glad I purchased it, and it does what it says!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past with excellent results, then switched to ROC at someone else&#x27;s suggestion.  The Olay was much, much better than the ROC.  I had results in two weeks, with lessening of deep wrinkles in my forehead.  I also use it on my neck and chest, and there are visible good results.  My skin is less crepey and more supple.  I will never stray again!</li>
            <li> This item worked fine for general moisturizing and temporary wrinkle reduction.  However, any moisturizer will temporarily reduce wrinkles. If it is skin tightening you are after, try ROC Firming Lift Serum (CVS pharmacy also makes a knockoff that works just as well in my experience, for less money).  This stuff flies off the shelf where I shop, so I guess others are in on the secret! It hydrates reasonably well, but I use it for firming &amp; lifting of my sagging neck.  After about a month, my neck looked much less crepey and was much firmer.  This had the effect of even softening some of the deep lines that were the result of sagging.  As an additional boost, do some facial or neck tightening exercises whenever you are applying it.  You will see a difference!</li>
            <li> i have only use the serum for less than a month so have not seen too many results.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is light weight and I use it morning and evening.  I will be reordering this  product.  It seems to do the job and I am 50+!!!!  I use mostly Pro X product now.  I use several Olay Regenerist also.  I have found Olay to have the best  quality products that actually do what they say!!</li>
            <li> This makes my second purchase for the Pro-X skin Tightening Serum and I love this product.  My skin feels very great after using it and I would recommend it to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> It may only be my imagination but I feel this has helped tighten my neck and my facial skin.  It&#x27;s definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  The product works as described and the ordering process was flawless.  The item arrived quickly.  I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Okay. Can&#x27;t say I see any amazing results. For the price I guess I was expecting more.</li>
            <li> I checked out this product on the skindeep  website and found that it contains many hazard/toxic ingredients. It is dangerous for my health. It seems very innocent when using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this one &#x27;cause who doesn&#x27;t want young looking, firm skin, and it has been well reviewed in various publications. Depending on what other products you use, adding this may make for one more than you want to be bothered with, unless you see tremendous results. After cleaning and exfoliating serums are usually the next thin you put on, and it&#x27;s a simple serum to apply, but I&#x27;m not seeing many results. FYI &amp;#34;Skin Tightening Serum&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t take the place of a moisturizer or sun screen, so it&#x27;s one more step. Not worth it for me, but of course, your results may vary. lol</li>
            <li> I like this product very much.  Since using this product I have seen fewer wrinkles and have the comments made that my skin looks great.</li>
            <li> This product tightens skin and may have some more long lasting effects, though it does not give you a face lift lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no product out there that will do that! The purpose of a serum is to remove fine lines and expression lines just for a short period of time. After using a product like this, foundation can be applied and will give the skin a smoother look, in the same way a &amp;#34;primer&amp;#34; does (like before you start to paint a wall and want to create a smooth surface). Primers such as Roc Brilliance will fill in the wrinkles to create a smooth surface, but the Olay Skin Tightening Serum will also &amp;#34;tighten&amp;#34; the face in addition to filling in the fine lines, given a more youthful look than just a primer. That has been my experience with this product. But it won&#x27;t give a permanent facelift. You&#x27;ll have to see a Plastic Surgeon for that one.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for two months and I do really like it.  Did not give it 5 stars because I think I need to try it longer to make an accurate evaluation of the of exact results. But, for the price, I think you cannot expect dramatic overnight results.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It is amazing. I actually can feel my skin tightening when I use it. Unfortunately it is discontinued AND is REALLY pricey.</li>
            <li> This product has done more for my maturing skin than any product I have used.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who would like to diminish the naturally occurring signs of age.</li>
            <li> I PREFER THE JAR THEN THIS OLAY ONE ;PRO X IS BETTER FOR ME ]WELL THAT IS MY OPINION &#x27;TO EACH HER OWN .</li>
            <li> I may be too far gone, i like oil of olay products but i am unable to see any improvement in the decrease in wrinkles, although i dont notice any new ones so thats a plus.</li>
            <li> I am a Olay girl. I go all the way back to when my mother used it. I started by sneaking some of hers. :-)  Mom had jowls and I started to notice my skin sagging so I got this. Not sure if it&#x27;s GREAT yet but I&#x27;m looking forward to some results by the time it&#x27;s empty.</li>
            <li> One of the best products on the market (the only reason I don&#x27;t give this a 5 is because I&#x27;m waiting for something that will make wrinkles go away completely; hopefully, in my lifetime).</li>
            <li> I am on day 29 using the entire ProX line and the only difference is that now I have breakouts and black heads.</li>
            <li> Great product. I see a difference already.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this helps, but I strongly feel it halts the aging process of my skin.  I can say I do feel it softens the appearance of some of my lines, but I am older and decided to lose a lot of weight which was not a good idea wrinkle-wise.  I am very used to it and feel uncomfortable without it  This is the place to get the best price in all the world.  And usually, if you see it in the store it is part of some package deal.  This is a product that a person could live without.  I consider it somewhat of a luxury, so I don&#x27;t want to go overboard and pay a high price for it.</li>
            <li> This was even better than the Mary Kay product I have been using!  Was very pleased with everything about it.  I&#x27;m hooked!  Will continue to use it from now on.  Can&#x27;t stop the aging process but can at least slow it a little!</li>
            <li> I have been using this Olay ProX Skin Tightening Serum, as well as the Olay ProX Age Repair Lotion and Olay ProX Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser, for the past 2-1/2 months. I waited this long to write reviews to allow enough time for these ProX products to do what they claim. I have noticed a very positive difference in my face&#x27;s skin tone, elasticity, wrinkles, and fine lines (although it is not a remarkable difference), and I am extremely pleased with the results. I have very sensitive skin and, despite the fact that I am a 53-year-old woman, I was still getting blemishes and pimples. Once I started using these products, I no longer got any blemishes or pimples, and none of these ProX products have caused any skin reactions, blotches, irritation, etc. I have used quite a few products since the skin revolution started few years ago, and I find these to be the best so far. Olay ProX products may be a little, tiny bit on the pricey side, but they cost much less here on Amazon.com (which offers a 15% subscription discount to make the prices even less) than many other stores. I&#x27;m not sure whether one, two, or all three of these Olay ProX products is the reason for these results, but I&#x27;m very pleased and I will continue to use these items.</li>
            <li> I have very dry \\&quot;mature\\&quot; skin.  This serum makes my skin feel silky and, I think, it decreases the look of wrinkles.  My skin has more of a glow and is not so \\&quot;flat\\&quot; looking.  It is pricey and I wish they would drop the price!!!!</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a couple of years and very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I am 56 with typical Scottish girl skin…fair and sensitive, with sun damage.  My jaw line and eyelids gave in to gravity this past year, making me look mean and tired. I have tried MANY products, but most have caused unbearable itching and burning, or have done nothing whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;This is super easy to use and doesn&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;I am amazed that it actually works.  I use it morning and night between cleansing and moisturizing.  I wait until it&#x27;s dry before adding the moisturizer.  I didn&#x27;t really expect results, but I&#x27;ll be darned if it doesn&#x27;t work.  I don&#x27;t run from the mirror anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Loyal customer.</li>
            <li> Olay Skin Tightening Serum - This product is very dry on the skin.  It was recommended by a friend but I prefer a product with moisturizers.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great!!!! I&#x27;m 51, and I&#x27;ve only used this product for a week. The lines on my forehead have greatly decreased. They are almost imperceptible. For the price point I recommend it highly!!!! It works just as well as some of the exceedingly expensive $100+ products.</li>
            <li> I love the Olay Pro X line, but this product is one I can do without.  No noticeable results.  Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> No real dramatic change. I guess I have to use it a little while longer to see some significant change.</li>
            <li> If I had only one face moisturizer product this is the one I would choose over any other.  I use it everyday under my makeup</li>
            <li> Am such an Olay lover, still using this and it seems to be doing the job.  Will continue to use and hope to see better and better results.</li>
            <li> I bought this product, but really couldn&#x27;t imagine that it would work *that* well. It does. In fact, it works better than they promote it to do. In just a week, the difference in my skin is amazing! I look well-rested (I&#x27;m not - trust me!) and the area around my eyes looks more youthful than it has in years! I just can&#x27;t get over it! I&#x27;ve bought products that are so much more expensive (Algenist, Clarins), but no more. All I can say is this is the one to buy.</li>
            <li> I bought the Olay skin tightening serum after going through Olay&#x27;s web product recommender. The first few times I used it, I felt like there was a noticeable difference. My skin looked healthier and felt smoother. I wouldn&#x27;t say tighter, but definitely a general \\&quot;better\\&quot; appearance. Because the improvement seems temporary and it isn&#x27;t really *that* much better than other products, I felt the product deserves three stars. Though I don&#x27;t use the serum daily (mostly in the winter and spring), it has lasted notably longer than my regular moisturizers. If it&#x27;s on sale, it&#x27;s worth a try but I wouldn&#x27;t suggest paying full price.</li>
            <li> but I do like it. I use only Olay products and also give them as gifts to family and friends. This one is ok but not as nice as some of the others. It did arrive quickly in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> Excellent skin tightening product at a really great price. This product really works!  Why can&#x27;t I find this in stores anymore?</li>
            <li> I love Olay.  Nothing yet comes close.  I would order it by the tub if I knew it wouldn&#x27;t go sky rocketing!!</li>
            <li> Love this product...it&#x27;s light and not greasy.  It is a serum as opposed to a lotion, which can sometimes be greasy.  It you tend to have oily skin, this is a great product!</li>
            <li> Still trying it, but doesn&#x27;t not seem to &amp;#34;tighten&amp;#34; the skin around the eye area as hoped.</li>
            <li> Pricy but here on Amazon is was much better than the store price. Doesn&#x27;t seem to do any more that regular hand or facial lotion. This was a gift for my wife. She used it but did not want to reorder as it is exaggerated as to what the advertisement states it will do for the skin. There are plenty of cosmetics as much more reasonable prices that will do just as well....maybe better.</li>
            <li> Good product, I can see a difference in my lines on my face.  I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> The title of my review says it all. If someone you live with everyday, compliments you like that when you&#x27;re 43 years old and she&#x27;s 25... something is working!</li>
            <li> I love Olay and some of the Pro-X line are cutting edge...but I find myself going back to the Regenerist line over and over...stopped using this one.</li>
            <li> While it is too soon to tell, I think this product works just as well as Mary Kay product and much, much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Again, long time customer. Seems to help tighten the aging neck skin. I&#x27;m satisfied with it. I&#x27;d be afraid to quit using it.</li>
            <li> I noticed an improvement in the appearance of my aging skin.  I plan to continue using it.  Much more effective than anything else I&#x27;ve tried in this price range, and some products that cost a lot more.</li>
            <li> I have been a skin product junkie since my 20&#x27;s and I have learned that no high price cream beats the Olay products.  I have recommended all the PROX items to all my friends.</li>
            <li> nice product, feels great on skin. Can&#x27;t say I find any great tightening tho, however, did not have any great expectations in that area</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recall whether it&#x27;s posted here or elsewhere, but someone kindly advised that the Roc CompleteLift Serum is more effective for skin tightening than Olay&#x27;s.  This proved true in my experience, too.  Similarly, I&#x27;m finding Roc&#x27;s deep wrinkle serum better than the one in the ProX kit -- though by a lesser margin than between the tightening products. As a plus for both companies, these lotions and potions don&#x27;t cause my (very sensitive) skin to break out.  Many other brands do and earlier Olay products did, which caused me not to try them again for years.</li>
            <li> I need gluten free products and Pro X meets that requirement. I&#x27; am very pleased with Pro X and have used many of their items for years.</li>
            <li> did not work. threw away. very disappointed. most of olay products are decent. would not recommend to friends.&lt;br /&gt;how many words to tell you it&#x27;s no good?</li>
            <li> First time use of product. My skin feels smooth and appears to be looking better. I will continue using it for now.</li>
            <li> It was just...ok. I didn&#x27;t see a huge tightening effect. A little help tightening the poors is always good. But I wasn&#x27;t blown away.</li>
