            <li>Very good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Good price, however if you are looking for a sunless tanner, this is not the best product on the market.  </li>
            <li>Lol (yes I used it even though it was expired).</li>
            <li>Great color for the day, and it seems to build.</li>
            <li>but most of the time it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Smells about as nice as you could ask given the combination of products</li>
            <li>and this gives me a nice glow with no oranginess</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked this product.</li>
            <li>Not orange, just gives you a nice glow.</li>
            <li>I would buy and use this again for sure.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff; it&#x27;s a great combo product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will buy more when it runs out.</li>
            <li>Otherwise I love the performance of this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I have had pretty good results and it doesn&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li>The product worked just fine</li>
            <li>I really liked the Equate which had a much better and more even tint and left a glowy skin.</li>
            <li>Super important for this sort of item since if you can&#x27;t go close to your eyes</li>
            <li>Builds nice gradual, natural looking color over time.</li>
            <li>Yes, Jergens has another smart and easy to use skin product.</li>
            <li>Would recommend and you can get it for much cheaper on Amazon!</li>
            <li>The color seems about as natural as you can ask for, and goes on pretty smoothly.</li>
            <li>Wish his had a higher spf, but really like it otherwise.  </li>
            <li>I got the light -&gt; Med, and it is SCANTLY on the yellow side (but not so much</li>
            <li>I used up the whole bottle in 2 - 3 weeks, I&#x27;d buy it again, but with the darker version.</li>
            <li>and I enjoy the extra benefit of the built-in tanner.</li>
            <li>it is going to end up looking very strange.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I love the Jergens natural glow products but the product that you actually receive is the scented version, which is NOT WHAT&#x27;S SHOWN IN THE PICTURE!</li>
            <li>Because you&#x27;re building in a natural looking tan while you moisturize and add protection against a sunburn.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it will not color completely</li>
            <li>Mine arrived early....</li>
            <li>I read that this was a problem, but I was hoping it was fixed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Super slight staining of a callus or two on my hands.</li>
            <li>I really like this for daily use, especially since it has the SPF</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very, very pale, and I did see some blotches, but I&#x27;m really trying to use this like a daily lotion and not worry too much, so I was probably applying recklessly.</li>
            <li>I bought both this specific type of Jergens Natural Glow self tanner (there are several types) as well as the&amp;#34;comparable&amp;#34; Equate tube of self tanner at Walmart and have used them both these last 6 weeks or so.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s one step less....getting moisturized after a shower.  Because you&#x27;re building in a natural looking tan while you moisturize and add protection against a sunburn. I use it every day and it has helped me to only look about 68.  (Just turned 78.) And what a bonus to know that I may indeed be preventing skin cancer.  Yes, Jergens has another smart and easy to use skin product.</li>
            <li> Exfoliate well, and apply evenly &amp; WASH YOUR HANDS after!  I got the light -&gt; Med, and it is SCANTLY on the yellow side (but not so much so it is bad), so I got the Med -&gt; Tan and it isn&#x27;t so yellow.  Go figure.  I used up the whole bottle in 2 - 3 weeks, I&#x27;d buy it again, but with the darker version.</li>
            <li> Use it as a sun screen and I enjoy the extra benefit of the built-in tanner.</li>
            <li> Product works although we had a problem with the seller. Would recommend and you can get it for much cheaper on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I also like that it has an SPF. Sometimes it will not color completely but most of the time it&#x27;s great. It&#x27;s probably due to my application. I&#x27;ve tried other brands in the past and they have had bad smells or tended to really streak. I have had pretty good results and it doesn&#x27;t smell. I would give it 5 stars but because sometimes I have minor issues, I&#x27;m giving it a 4. But&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the only one I buy now.</li>
            <li> Wish his had a higher spf, but really like it otherwise.  Colors my pale skin.</li>
            <li> Mine arrived early.... But the product was expired! The lotion made me look dirty... Lol (yes I used it even though it was expired). I dunno, maybe self tanners aren&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> Great color for the day, and it seems to build. However, as can be expected, when I shave my legs I definitely notice the color coming off  so take that into account. I&#x27;m very, very pale, and I did see some blotches, but I&#x27;m really trying to use this like a daily lotion and not worry too much, so I was probably applying recklessly. The blotches aren&#x27;t terrible anyway. I would buy and use this again for sure.</li>
            <li> I bought both this specific type of Jergens Natural Glow self tanner (there are several types) as well as the&amp;#34;comparable&amp;#34; Equate tube of self tanner at Walmart and have used them both these last 6 weeks or so. I do not like the Jergens: the color is yellow, very flat (no glow at all) and looks very fake on me. I really liked the Equate which had a much better and more even tint and left a glowy skin.</li>
            <li> I read that this was a problem, but I was hoping it was fixed. I got the scented version before and I didn&#x27;t hate the scent, but I also don&#x27;t like it. I&#x27;m disappointed about this.</li>
            <li> Good price, however if you are looking for a sunless tanner, this is not the best product on the market.  I will be taking it to Florida soon, so hopefully after being in the sun it will &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; while providing UV protection.</li>
            <li> This lotion does exactly as it advertises to do:  moisturizes with gradual coloring to the skin; I have not experienced any streaking but I stay with the lighter shades to prevent that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a blonde, this gives my legs and arms some color and protects as well.</li>
            <li> I love the Jergens natural glow products but the product that you actually receive is the scented version, which is NOT WHAT&#x27;S SHOWN IN THE PICTURE! The bottle doesn&#x27;t even look the same. I had to return it twice because they kept sending me the wrong thing!</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff; it&#x27;s a great combo product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- The color seems about as natural as you can ask for, and goes on pretty smoothly. It did slightly darken a callus on my hand, but that was the only issue.&lt;br /&gt;- No issues with stinging in the eyes. Super important for this sort of item since if you can&#x27;t go close to your eyes it is going to end up looking very strange.&lt;br /&gt;- The SPF seems to work as promised. I haven&#x27;t seen any burning&lt;br /&gt;- Smells about as nice as you could ask given the combination of products here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Super slight staining of a callus or two on my hands. Not noticeable, but it&#x27;s there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do worry about what this will end up doing to my undershirts over time. If it starts to stain them at all, I will update my review.</li>
            <li> Builds nice gradual, natural looking color over time. Also has SPF to protect your skin. I&#x27;m very fair skinned and this gives me a nice glow with no oranginess</li>
            <li> The product worked just fine but I wasn&#x27;t sent the unscented product that they were advertising so it had a somewhat unpleasant oder for a few hours after application. I would definitely suggest putting it on at night so you don&#x27;t have to worry about going out smelling weird.</li>
            <li> Very good moisturizer. I will buy more when it runs out.</li>
            <li> Like a customer before me, I was sent the version that is not unscented.  Otherwise I love the performance of this product.  My 1 star rating is because of Amazon&#x27;s error...maybe the next customer will get what they truly ordered...?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked this product. For those unfamiliar, however WASH YOUR HANDS after applying to body. Otherwise they will stain, and it will look weird.</li>
            <li> I really like this for daily use, especially since it has the SPF</li>
            <li> I love this product. I like the fact that it has an SPF and that it doesn&#x27;t smell. The color is perfect, too. Not orange, just gives you a nice glow.</li>
