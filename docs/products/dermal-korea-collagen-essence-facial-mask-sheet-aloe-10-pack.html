            <li> My skin is soft and hydrated after use.  </li>
            <li> Consumers, don&#x27;t buy, go try some natural products, this is an utter waste, it did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> Within two days, the raw skin was back to normal, and the severe redness in my cheeks had toned down.</li>
            <li> This was not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> They are not as moisturizing as some other brands I have used.</li>
            <li> I have an oily face and after applying the mask my skin felt a little sticky.</li>
            <li> This one has aloe in it so it helps during harsh winters.</li>
            <li> This mask comes on a mask you put on your face and after about 20 minutes you take it off and dab the rest of the solution that is on your skin in slowly with the tips of your fingers.</li>
            <li> I decided it couldn&#x27;t get much worse, and tried one of these.</li>
            <li> My face had gotten very raw and sore over the cold months, and needed lots of lotion.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong for the price.  </li>

            <li> Absolutley love this stuff.  I saw something similar on Dr. Oz, while I don&#x27;t normally buy the things he recommends, this looked interesting.  You can&#x27;t go wrong for the price.  It feels wonderful -- really refreshes your skin.  The sheets are cool and very moist.  Easy to apply.  My skin is soft and hydrated after use.  The additional leftover serum (it&#x27;s not a cream, or an oil, more like a serum) I then pat into my skin and toss the sheet away.  I use them twice a week.  My skin finally feels hydrated...like it does after a pricey facial.  Try it and you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> This is a great mask &amp; I&#x27;ve tried a LOT! This mask has no parabens. I highly recommend it.  It makes my skin look more refined and I use it right before an audition or a shoot. It&#x27;s a great product that I have NO qualms about recommending!</li>
            <li> I have been using them once a week for a couple of months and every time I do my skin feels like new. It gets rid of dry/ red spots, I think it helps pimples heal faster and it is just an amazing moisturizing mask.</li>
            <li> My friends recommended me to buy this item. I like it. I will try to use it as soon as possible</li>
            <li> Consumers, don&#x27;t buy, go try some natural products, this is an utter waste, it did nothing for me. don&#x27;t try</li>
            <li> Seemed like a good brand for the price ,it is around $1 a piece, who can beat this price for any one who needs</li>
            <li> the mask is very nutritional, but kind of hard to absorb, so I would rather buy some liquid mask to get a better absorption.</li>
            <li> I use this in the evening, and is like the way my face looks in the morning!</li>
            <li> This was not what I expected.  They are not as moisturizing as some other brands I have used.</li>
            <li> Pricing is excellent. Just got it, so can&#x27;t see results yet!</li>
            <li> It is not a paste you put on your face and that is what I love about it. This mask comes on a mask you put on your face and after about 20 minutes you take it off and dab the rest of the solution that is on your skin in slowly with the tips of your fingers. It leaves me feeling refreshed and has a nice clean feel to it. When you put it on it is nice and cool also a nice plus.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this mask to any of my friends and family. You do not wash the face right after you do the mask of course so make sure you are not in a hurry :)</li>
            <li> It moisturizes my face and it is perfect! I use it everyday :) This one has aloe in it so it helps during harsh winters.</li>
            <li> We discovered this facial mask while on vacation in Korea. My girls love it and it has done an excellent job of clearing acne and balance skin tone.</li>
            <li> I am still satisfied of my choice&lt;br /&gt;This has full moisture and nutrients I needed.&lt;br /&gt;I am positive next shopping again</li>
            <li> I have an oily face and after applying the mask my skin felt a little sticky. But it refreshes and cools the skin and i think that is all what is needed from a face mask. It will work great for the dry skin folks</li>
            <li> Love! Love! Love this product!!</li>
            <li> My friend bought me a couple of these for Christmas. My skin is VERY sensitive and I was scared to try them all the way until now. My face had gotten very raw and sore over the cold months, and needed lots of lotion. I decided it couldn&#x27;t get much worse, and tried one of these. Within two days, the raw skin was back to normal, and the severe redness in my cheeks had toned down. I am SUPER excited that I was able to find these so easily online! I can&#x27;t wait to use them again.</li>
