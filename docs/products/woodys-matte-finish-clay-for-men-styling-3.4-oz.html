            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>This is a great hair product that I like because it doesn&#x27;t easily wash out of your hair.  </li>
            <li>I run my hands through my hair many times a day and it still keeps a good hold.</li>
            <li>(if you&#x27;re into that kind of thing).</li>
            <li>I had tried this product at a friend&#x27;s house and I liked it before buying from amazon.  </li>
            <li>Love the matte finish and the hold is good.</li>

            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite hair products to use.  </li>
            <li>Love love love this product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t contain water so it doesn&#x27;t make my wavy hair any more wavy.</li>
            <li>No residue so always a favorite</li>
            <li>Apply when your hair is dry and give it the perfect messed up look.  </li>
            <li>why they color this such a brilliant teal is beyond me.</li>
            <li>Or you may be able to use a product like Groom N Clean to pre-wash it to make it easier to get out.  </li>
            <li>WASHES OUT EASILY WITH SHAMPOO.</li>
            <li>Received the product very quickly</li>
            <li>-- I&#x27;ve had this for over 3 months now and am still going strong.</li>
            <li>And the smell is pretty nice too.</li>
            <li>Hands down this is the best hair product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I have fine med/long hair and this product did not work for me.</li>
            <li>I do not use it that often but it works fine.</li>
            <li>Some people may not like that, but I have extremely fine hair that needs some substance in order to do what I want it to do.  </li>
            <li>It washes out just fine with any shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Washed out of hair with shampoo fine.</li>
            <li>and all it&#x27;s a great product for medium to short hair.</li>
            <li>Smells like cheap cologne and powder.</li>
            <li>you use a SMALL amount it is perfect.</li>
            <li>Some products start out great but by hour two or three you look like a wet dog; not with Woody&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a wonderful product for thick hair, it&#x27;s adds the volume I need and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>but it gives you tremendous control and hold.</li>
            <li>put it in the palm of your hands and quickly rub them togeather to melt the product.</li>
            <li>Good, I like the matte finish, but it&#x27;s a little gummy and doesn&#x27;t come off the hands easily.</li>
            <li>Great product, very sticky on hands but works in for a dry hold that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>but when its soft it works like magic.</li>
            <li>Great product, takes a little getting used to at first</li>
            <li>strong hold but still leaves hair soft.</li>
            <li>Got it when I expected and works really nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first clay I&#x27;ve used, but it lasts even overnight</li>
            <li>It keep shape pretty well.  </li>
            <li>the matte finish leave my hair natural and almost product free looking if applied</li>
            <li>This is the only hair product that I have used that is as good the second day as it is the 1st.</li>
            <li>This is his favorite product for styling&lt;br /&gt;his hair and it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>great for short hair, keeping it spikey and messy all day.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use it much though</li>
            <li>I use to always use the Woody&#x27;s Web but when my hair starts to get on the longer end a couple months after a cut it doesn&#x27;t hold as much as I would like.</li>
            <li>I HAVE VERY WAVEY HAIR AND STYLE MY HAIR</li>
            <li>it WILL color your hair if you accidentally get too much in one spot.  </li>
            <li>very matte.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This really holds up.</li>
            <li>and I can really tell the difference.</li>
            <li>Lastly, I really like the matte finish.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Price was reasonable and shipping fast.</li>
            <li>Using too much is the biggest issue because it will leave your hair sticky.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and Woody&#x27;s takes care of it and holds it in place ALL DAY LONG.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s works just fine but after a while it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t stay for that long</li>
            <li>You have to be careful to rub it thoroughly to make sure no blue is showing, but it&#x27;s easy to wash off your hands afterward and can keep even relatively short hair</li>
            <li>I can wake up the next day and with a few moments of running my hands through it my hair looks just as good as when I fixed it the day before.</li>
            <li>A small amount in dried hair (pea size is more then enough) works perfectly to even calm down frizzy long</li>
            <li>if you end up getting too much on your hair, just get the blow dryer out and focus on that spot with heat (not cool) and it will soften and absorb right into your hair, problem solved!</li>
            <li>What can I say, it&#x27;s my old stand by!  </li>
            <li>Outstanding hold, only have to use a little.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems like 3.4 ounces is capable of lasting a while too.</li>
            <li>I think they sold me an old inventory.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to get the look you are going for, and it&#x27;s not crazy expensive.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s one of the reasons I like it; I use scented lotion and cologne so the last thing I need is a strong smelling hair product to mess up my \\&quot;essence\\&quot;!</li>
            <li>Similar to car wax, When you wash your hands with soap and water after using this product, you have to really scrub multiple times to get it off.</li>
            <li>If your hands break out from oranges or other citruses, you may want to be aware of that.</li>
            <li>It was hard to get off my hands but did come off with hot water and intense scrubbing.</li>
            <li>Just what I was looking for and exactly what I get from the salon at half the cost!</li>
            <li>The hold is great, but I find that it has a hard waxy consistency that is difficult to get off your hands.</li>

            <li> The hold is great, but I find that it has a hard waxy consistency that is difficult to get off your hands.</li>
            <li> TO HAVE A STRAIGHT SLICK BACK</li>
            <li> A small amount is really all that is needed.  </li>
            <li> : doesn&#x27;t last as long as Boogies.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it from when i had short to long hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super tough to get off your hands afterwards as well.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really sticky and hard to get off your hands</li>
            <li> The only problem is that my hair is a little stubborn and curls in various places and this product cannot hold them on the opposite way.</li>
            <li> I have used this to style my hair (thick and wavy) in a comb over and it works very well.</li>
            <li> It seems all hair products that gives a strong hold will leave a heavy film behind.</li>
            <li> If you have medium to long length hair try this!</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t dry my hair all the way.  </li>
            <li> Leaves you hard where you want it as well as keeping it soft.</li>
            <li> Great product but horrible color choice --</li>
            <li> A little tough to get off your hands if you don&#x27;t wet them first.  </li>
            <li> other thing to mention is that I have to shampoo twice to get this to wash out.  </li>
            <li> BUT it has lasted me way longer than any other product due to the fact that you need such a small amount</li>
            <li> Difficult to work with the product, and also its blue, which means if you wipe your hands on white towels, they will be blue.</li>
            <li> Tried what I feel like is every other product.</li>
            <li> Very little of this product goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> It seems to hold well and never weighs my hair down.  </li>
            <li> The clay was much harder than my past purchases from other vendors &amp; doesn&#x27;t hold to its consistency.</li>
            <li> Also gives hair a slightly greasy feel after use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to wash out, but this is a minor issue considering it&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li> LOOK THIS PRODUCT CREATES THAT LOOK EFFORTLESSLY AND WITH A LITTLE HAIRSPARY TO FINISH WITH HOLDS ALL DAY.</li>
            <li> But a little too shinny for me.</li>
            <li> Holds hair VERY well but the residue it leaves behind is very hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> I have short but very thick hair and it holds like a charm.  </li>
            <li> The hold is firm but doesn&#x27;t make your hair crunchy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now</li>
            <li> There are no strong senses.</li>
            <li> Very thick, sticky, waxy gunk - can hardly wash it off your hands - big mistake buying this stuff - think I&#x27;ll use it as putty to fill some wood cracks.  </li>
            <li> Use very little of this product on your hair as mentioned before.  </li>
            <li> Product styles hair very well but has a bad fragrance.</li>
            <li> The puck is small</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never enjoyed the greasy/product look, so</li>
            <li> This stuff is very stiff and a little hard to apply evenly through your hair.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint that I have is that it is really difficult to wash off of your hands.</li>
            <li> It holds well, but it is also does not make hair rock hard, or hard at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The clay is about as hard as a bar of soap.  </li>
            <li> Too thick for me</li>
            <li> It does straighten my thick and wavy hair, though.  </li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like about this is that when the clay dries up in a few hours, it leaves very thin flakes that look like dandruff.</li>
            <li> VERY hard to get off hands after applying.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Only downside is it is very hard to get off your hands.  </li>
            <li> Was very thick inside the jar.</li>
            <li> This hair product is very thick and will control your hair no matter what hair style of hair you have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted and tell you to stay away from it if you don&#x27;t want to become addicted.</li>
            <li> The clay is blue and stains my hands every time I use it, it&#x27;s terrible</li>
            <li> Expensive and not as matte as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> Weird.</li>
            <li> but this is like a clump of waxy glue - just plain horrible!</li>
            <li> but I was very skeptical.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed people saying bad comments about the smell...</li>
            <li> Worst thing ever.</li>
            <li> And worst to get it off the hair wash my hair like 10 times and still.</li>

            <li> great product...strong hold but still leaves hair soft.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about you guys. But this woody&#x27;s clay gives me wood.</li>
            <li> Good product! Don&#x27;t use it much though</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of different hair products. I use to always use the Woody&#x27;s Web but when my hair starts to get on the longer end a couple months after a cut it doesn&#x27;t hold as much as I would like. The Clay does just the trick. Hands down this is the best hair product I have ever used. The hold is firm but doesn&#x27;t make your hair crunchy. I run my hands through my hair many times a day and it still keeps a good hold. I can wake up the next day and with a few moments of running my hands through it my hair looks just as good as when I fixed it the day before. This is the only hair product that I have used that is as good the second day as it is the 1st. If you have medium to long length hair try this!</li>
            <li> Great product, takes a little getting used to at first but when its soft it works like magic. Leaves you hard where you want it as well as keeping it soft. Love the matte finish it gives.</li>
            <li> I have fine med/long hair and this product did not work for me. It&#x27;s super tough to get off your hands afterwards as well.</li>
            <li> This gives a very good hold &amp; you can style your hair however you like. What I don&#x27;t like about this is that when the clay dries up in a few hours, it leaves very thin flakes that look like dandruff.</li>
            <li> This stuff is very stiff and a little hard to apply evenly through your hair.  But once it is styled it stays that way.  I think I could walk through a hurricane and look the same afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;One other thing to mention is that I have to shampoo twice to get this to wash out.  Or you may be able to use a product like Groom N Clean to pre-wash it to make it easier to get out.  The scent is not offensive at all to me.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  great for short hair, keeping it spikey and messy all day.  very similar to the clay by American Crew.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Really good product with a strong hold and matte finish. The only complaint that I have is that it is really difficult to wash off of your hands. I have used this to style my hair (thick and wavy) in a comb over and it works very well. The puck is small BUT it has lasted me way longer than any other product due to the fact that you need such a small amount -- I&#x27;ve had this for over 3 months now and am still going strong.</li>
            <li> The clay is blue and stains my hands every time I use it, it&#x27;s terrible</li>
            <li> It is too sticky, I have another product by Woody&#x27;s, Woody&#x27;s cream styling, and it was wonderful.  I should have ordered the cream instead.</li>
            <li> Worst thing ever. I used it once and I couldn&#x27;t get it off my hands. And worst to get it off the hair wash my hair like 10 times and still. Never using this garbage again.</li>
            <li> Expensive and not as matte as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Too thick for me but I&#x27;m an ol&#x27; lady.</li>
            <li> Works great for spikey hair...men or ladies!</li>
            <li> Was very thick inside the jar. Also gives hair a slightly greasy feel after use.</li>
            <li> Difficult to work with the product, and also its blue, which means if you wipe your hands on white towels, they will be blue.</li>
            <li> I HAVE VERY WAVEY HAIR AND STYLE MY HAIR TO HAVE A STRAIGHT SLICK BACK LOOK THIS PRODUCT CREATES THAT LOOK EFFORTLESSLY AND WITH A LITTLE HAIRSPARY TO FINISH WITH HOLDS ALL DAY. WASHES OUT EASILY WITH SHAMPOO.</li>
            <li> This hair product is very thick and will control your hair no matter what hair style of hair you have. Very easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> Holds hair VERY well but the residue it leaves behind is very hard to wash off. It seems all hair products that gives a strong hold will leave a heavy film behind.</li>
            <li> Got it when I expected and works really nice. Very little of this product goes a very long way. And the smell is pretty nice too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted and tell you to stay away from it if you don&#x27;t want to become addicted. I have fine hair and Woody&#x27;s takes care of it and holds it in place ALL DAY LONG. It&#x27;s hard to wash out, but this is a minor issue considering it&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li> The clay keeps your style in place without being stuff or greasy. I have used this product for 2 years and like it the best. Received the product very quickly</li>
            <li> it works great, but BEWARE that neon teal color.  it WILL color your hair if you accidentally get too much in one spot.  Use very little of this product on your hair as mentioned before.  Great product but horrible color choice -- why they color this such a brilliant teal is beyond me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works just fine but after a while it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t stay for that long but I do reccomend!</li>
            <li> Woods clay can stane your hands blue. I do not use it that often but it works fine.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Very strong hold</li>
            <li> Works great. Good hold</li>
            <li> Tried what I feel like is every other product. Especially the ones hair dressers told me was best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for 3 years, and I always get compliments on my hair.</li>
            <li> A small amount is really all that is needed.  It holds well, but it is also does not make hair rock hard, or hard at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems like 3.4 ounces is capable of lasting a while too.</li>
            <li> Bought this because I ran out of Boogies hair clay and it wouldn&#x27;t come in time (only comes through Dollar Shave Club subscription). You also can&#x27;t buy Boogies outside of DSC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO: hold is good. very matte.&lt;br /&gt;CON: doesn&#x27;t last as long as Boogies.VERY hard to get off hands after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get Boogies from DSC instead.</li>
            <li> This really holds up. It&#x27;s the first clay I&#x27;ve used, but it lasts even overnight (if you&#x27;re into that kind of thing). You have to be careful to rub it thoroughly to make sure no blue is showing, but it&#x27;s easy to wash off your hands afterward and can keep even relatively short hair however you want it to look.</li>
            <li> The clay was much harder than my past purchases from other vendors &amp; doesn&#x27;t hold to its consistency. I think they sold me an old inventory. This is my staple hair product &amp; have never had this issue.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for and exactly what I get from the salon at half the cost! Great deal.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff, used for a couple of days now &amp; can already feel the difference from all the others ive tried.</li>
            <li> Great product! My hair stylist recommended it to me and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Only used gel before this and I can really tell the difference.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a softer consistency with this product.  The clay is about as hard as a bar of soap.  I was looking for something easier to dispense.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It came quickly and works great without looking overdone. I would dediebtly recommend this product and will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> Good, I like the matte finish, but it&#x27;s a little gummy and doesn&#x27;t come off the hands easily.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair product that I like because it doesn&#x27;t easily wash out of your hair.  Some people may not like that, but I have extremely fine hair that needs some substance in order to do what I want it to do.  My only qualm with this product is that it causes my hands to break out after using it.  I&#x27;m assuming there&#x27;s some sort of citrus substance in it.  If your hands break out from oranges or other citruses, you may want to be aware of that.</li>
            <li> I had tried this product at a friend&#x27;s house and I liked it before buying from amazon.  I bounce from varies products depending on my hair&#x27;s length, so Woody&#x27;s isn&#x27;t always my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34;, but it&#x27;s great when I &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Woody&#x27;s is a really good balance of strength, flexibility, and finish.  It seems to hold well and never weighs my hair down.  Some products start out great but by hour two or three you look like a wet dog; not with Woody&#x27;s.  It keep shape pretty well.  I also like the flexibility it has as you style.  Some product make you commit to what you are doing as soon as it touches your head; not Woody&#x27;s.  I feel that with finger tips amounts I can apply as needed before having to commit.  Lastly, I really like the matte finish.  I&#x27;ve never enjoyed the greasy/product look, so the matte finish leave my hair natural and almost product free looking if applied correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All and all it&#x27;s a great product for medium to short hair.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite hair products to use.  It holds great, it&#x27;s easy to get the look you are going for, and it&#x27;s not crazy expensive.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the name of this product fool you.  It&#x27;s for women as well.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now and I love the way it holds my hair!  Apply when your hair is dry and give it the perfect messed up look.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This stuff is really sticky and hard to get off your hands but it gives you tremendous control and hold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Woody&#x27;s Clay (blue) for almost 2 years and I love it! I have short but very thick hair and it holds like a charm.  I&#x27;ve come to notice that if my hair is even a bit damp it still works w/o clumping--I normally don&#x27;t dry my hair all the way.  I&#x27;ve noticed people saying bad comments about the smell...they must have a keen sense of smell because in my opinion it has no smell at all.  That&#x27;s one of the reasons I like it; I use scented lotion and cologne so the last thing I need is a strong smelling hair product to mess up my \\&quot;essence\\&quot;! It does stay on your hands so I just wash my hands after using and if there&#x27;s anything left on my hands I just rub it in like lotion--it will, amazingly, moisturize the skin! It washes out just fine with any shampoo.  I think it&#x27;s a wonderful product for thick hair, it&#x27;s adds the volume I need and lasts all day.  What can I say, it&#x27;s my old stand by!  Oh! I almost forgot--if you end up getting too much on your hair, just get the blow dryer out and focus on that spot with heat (not cool) and it will soften and absorb right into your hair, problem solved!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews about this being a very good product but I was very skeptical. Boy was I wrong. Its like it even prevents hair from getting greasy because I never have that problem anymore ever since I started using this. The only problem is that my hair is a little stubborn and curls in various places and this product cannot hold them on the opposite way. But great product nonetheless</li>
            <li> This is not clay.  This is Vasoline with color.  This product does not have a &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; finish, rather a shimmer; almost like glitter.  Weird. It does straighten my thick and wavy hair, though.  Hence the two stars.</li>
            <li> Product styles hair very well but has a bad fragrance. Smells like cheap cologne and powder. It was hard to get off my hands but did come off with hot water and intense scrubbing. Washed out of hair with shampoo fine. The fragrance is just a deal breaker for me.</li>
            <li> The hold is great, but I find that it has a hard waxy consistency that is difficult to get off your hands. Similar to car wax, When you wash your hands with soap and water after using this product, you have to really scrub multiple times to get it off. If you don&#x27;t want to deal with that, try the Woody&#x27;s Pomade which is easier to handle.</li>
            <li> good product. But a little too shinny for me. I have no idea what others are saying about the smell. There are no strong senses.</li>
            <li> Very thick, sticky, waxy gunk - can hardly wash it off your hands - big mistake buying this stuff - think I&#x27;ll use it as putty to fill some wood cracks.  Was trying to find an alternative to Aveda Grooming Clay - but this is like a clump of waxy glue - just plain horrible!</li>
            <li> Great product. Not shiny. Love the matte finish and the hold is good.</li>
            <li> Product just as described, excellent!</li>
            <li> bought for my boys they love the product doesnt leave hair feeling sticky good stuff nice price</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my teenage son.  Can&#x27;t get it in Canada anymore.  This is his favorite product for styling&lt;br /&gt;his hair and it lasts a long time.  Price was reasonable and shipping fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the hardest holding clays I&#x27;ve ever used. It lives up to its neon blue color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use a SMALL amount it is perfect. Using too much is the biggest issue because it will leave your hair sticky. A small amount in dried hair (pea size is more then enough) works perfectly to even calm down frizzy long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it from when i had short to long hair. to give shape on short hair and controle on long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best product for hair i&#x27;ve ever found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is it is very hard to get off your hands.  When you apply it. put it in the palm of your hands and quickly rub them togeather to melt the product. Lots of soap to get it off your hands and hair.</li>
            <li> Great product, very sticky on hands but works in for a dry hold that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Great hair product. I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product. I know that is meant for men but it works awesome on my hair. It doesn&#x27;t contain water so it doesn&#x27;t make my wavy hair any more wavy. Great investment and great price.</li>
            <li> No residue so always a favorite</li>
            <li> Outstanding hold, only have to use a little.  A little tough to get off your hands if you don&#x27;t wet them first.  Matte finish looks great!</li>
