            <li>My friend from San Francisco told me about DermaSet, the new anti-aging cream that she purchased on line and is very happy with.  </li>
            <li>For radiance, smoothness, and moisture, this cream is by far the best.</li>
            <li>This is helping me to keep myself positive and confident that I will win both battles.</li>
            <li>I have tried MANY beauty products and serums but haven’t seen the results that I did with this one.  </li>
            <li>Love love love this product.</li>
            <li>My neck, my jowls, the lines around my mouth were more pronounced.</li>
            <li>I love Dermaset because it is all in one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love their customer service team.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS MOISTURIZER</li>
            <li>I have tried MANY beauty products and serums but haven’t seen the results that I did with this one.  </li>
            <li>Love love love this product.</li>
            <li>However, I like the TSN product better</li>
            <li>I have diabetes and many complications which effects my skin.  </li>
            <li>and she absolutely in love with it.  </li>
            <li>She said the cream is the best present</li>
            <li>I have used many skin care products to battle the onslaught of aging.  </li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>and I felt I need to let everybody know how wonderful the cream is, and how it helped me look younger than I am.  </li>
            <li>I love the customer service at their company and how cooperative they always are.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I am so glad that they did.  </li>
            <li>You will be so pleased that you did.</li>
            <li>You might have a better results.  </li>
            <li>She is using it with the drop of Argan Oil to get more moisture.  </li>
            <li>Actually, I love how my face feels</li>
            <li>The service was outstanding as always on amazon.</li>
            <li>I AM SO GLAD</li>
            <li>BUT I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I am happy to report that after 3 weeks I noticed my brown spots are much lighter.</li>
            <li>There’s so many products out there</li>
            <li>I’ve tried so many different creams (brand names, drug store, custom made) and none of them really impressed me.</li>
            <li>After one week of use, I noticed my lines were more prominent</li>
            <li>THE PRODUCT IS OK, BUT WHO CAN AFFORD $179 FOR A TUBE OF FACE CREAM?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>just submitted a claim against Dermaset to the Better Business Bureau.  </li>
            <li>You can find something better.</li>
            <li>Amazon was most helpful.</li>
            <li>I do apply the Clinique night moisturizer on top of it and it feels nourishing.  </li>
            <li>I will keep on trying this cream to see if there is any more improvement.  </li>
            <li>I will review again after a couple of more months.</li>
            <li>It is a worthwhile splurge if you have it in your budget.</li>
            <li>I can top it with make up that contains sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Definitely better than Meaningful Beauty.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it a star is because of Amazon&#x27;s excellent shipping practices.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and will convey this message to everyone</li>
            <li>This is the best present that I can get for her!</li>
            <li>After about 2 weeks I found my skin tone to be more even, crow feet not as pronounced, and the puffiness under my eyes subsided.  </li>
            <li>I am not looking for anything better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not often that a product does what it advertises, but Dermaset does even more than it advertises.</li>
            <li>i feel and look better.  </li>
            <li>On me this product never sunk into my skin but sat on top and pilled.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully others will have better luck.</li>
            <li>MORE EVENLY TONED.</li>
            <li>I COULD NOT BEEN MORE PLEASED TO REGAINE</li>
            <li>Love the way it smoothes my skin tone.</li>
            <li>dryer and somewinkles looked more pronounced</li>
            <li>I love to rub the product into my hands and work it into my face.</li>
            <li>LOVE how smooth it goes on and how it is to use</li>
            <li>I have fairly good skin and wanted to use a product that promised so much.  </li>
            <li>My face looks better than ever and for what you get, the price is so worth it!</li>
            <li>Just a pea size amount provides does the trick and absorbs easily into the skin.  </li>
            <li>Oh, and the best part about using this cream is that i have been receiving compliments left and right.</li>
            <li>The cream has a very pleasant smell and it comes in a sleek and sexy grey box and definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the splurge, and on special occasions I&#x27;ll use it twice a day, morning and night, and I feel amazing.  </li>
            <li>I am 55 and all my  Fine lines,wrinkles,crows feet</li>
            <li>As i was expecting to continue to use Dermaset, so i called to customer service to get more information on when my second tube will be shipped, their response was prompt and my interaction with customer service was as pleasant as their cream.</li>
            <li>The scent is very light and fresh.</li>
            <li>and it is making a huge difference in how I feel about myself.  </li>
            <li>They are always available for me.</li>
            <li>They advertised as a free trial and sent it to me for $4.95 shipping.</li>
            <li>I enjoy DermaSet cream for two years</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it would be worth it for those who will invest....</li>
            <li>HOW THE FREE TRIAL WORKS,</li>
            <li>After purchasing Dermaset cream from their website, I was informed how the free trial works.</li>
            <li>DON&#x27;T ACCEPT THE FREE TRIAL OFFER ON THE DERMASET SITE.  </li>
            <li>(I get free samples of detergent, cereal, BOGOF&#x27;s in the mail from time to time).  </li>
            <li>This cream is absolutely fabulous, I never take times to review products, but this one deserves it.</li>
            <li>They are effective, and very inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li>I already ordered several tomes and love how good it works.</li>
            <li>but so far, so good.</li>
            <li>The seller was good to deal with and was surprised to hear my compliant as she hadn&#x27;t heard my problem from anyone else that used the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>It feels clean, absorbs quickly and the effects are immediate!</li>
            <li>, THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE APPEREANCE OF MY SKIN.</li>
            <li>It gives a nice taut feeling to my skin as well as soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I am of the more experienced generation so my wrinkles are a little more stubborn and took a little longer to react to this remarkable cream</li>
            <li>EVERYTHING THAT THE LABEL SAID IT WOULD DO IS TRUE FOR ME:</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so many products that have promised so much</li>
            <li>/&gt;a full tube to use.</li>
            <li>This cream turned to be liquid after a few days and doesn&#x27;t look good!</li>
            <li>I have been using DermaSet cream for roughly a week, and so far I am impressed.  </li>
            <li>My face is now moist and smooth and my dark circles under my eyes have faded 80%, a remarkable improvement.</li>
            <li>noticeable results quickly</li>
            <li>Have used many anti-age/wrinkle creams, all where highly rated.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>You may think it is strange to be doing this at this time, however I find it is good to fight against wrinkles.</li>
            <li>This is the only cream my mother will use from now on because, according to her, it makes her young and beautiful.</li>
            <li>My face feels much softer and I&#x27;ve noticed HUGE improvements in evening out my wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It is worth the investment.</li>
            <li>A bit pricey, but worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Of course I&#x27;d like to finish the first tube to see what the true verdict is...</li>
            <li>It is worth every dime.  </li>
            <li>The product is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>What i am most excited about is that now i can actually walk out of the house without makeup on.</li>
            <li>but right now I can afford it.</li>
            <li>I can say i found the right product for me.</li>
            <li>It not only makes them look much better after I apply it, but they absolutely look 100 times better even after getting out of the shower, which means it&#x27;s made a real difference, not just on the surface.</li>
            <li>I have some very fine lines, but this made them look very deep.  </li>
            <li>I use DermaSet Cream daily under my make up as it works as a great \\&quot;primer\\&quot; that is doubles as a corrective cream for age related issues.</li>
            <li>Definitely pretty fishy.</li>
            <li>After the first week, I noticed that my age spots along my jaw were fading and the sagging under my chin was tightening.  </li>
            <li>I have to admit I was skeptical; but, I am very glad that I tried this product!!!!!  </li>
            <li>I got interested and I ordered it.</li>
            <li>I finished the first tube</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a smoker of 50 years and this product worked great for firming and reducing the wrinkles around the corners of my nose and lips and sagging jaw line, which are related to being long time smoker.</li>
            <li>My skin became firmer and brighter within the first three days.  </li>
            <li>Still think it is too costly-so only able to use once a day</li>
            <li>First of all, I don&#x27;t write reviews.</li>
            <li>I noticed results almost immediately and the longer I use it, the more the hands of time seem to be turning back.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t see many men reviewing this product, so if your a guy, this product works equally well for both&lt;br /&gt;sexes.&lt;br /&gt;Give</li>
            <li>It is very soothing and goes right in to the skin.</li>
            <li>I knew it was not going to make my skin look brand new but from other reviews I thought it would be pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I am 44 years old and have very oily skin with some light sun damage discoloration.  </li>
            <li>I am 49 1/2 years old; but, most people think I am in my early 30&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>so that pretty much expresses how I felt.</li>
            <li>The research was pretty promising, but when I placed my order I kept my fingers crossed.</li>
            <li>After about a week, I started noticing my pores looking smaller and the fine lines vanishing.  </li>
            <li>After about a week, I started noticing my pores looking smaller and the fine lines vanishing.  </li>
            <li>My daily needs are to ease sensitivity, fine wrinkles and anti-aging.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only recently started using this product and love it!  </li>
            <li>I am in my fifties and not only are the fine lines around my eyes and mouth disappearing</li>
            <li>I really wish I had taken before and after pictures of my skin.</li>
            <li>YOU REALLY</li>
            <li>The service was fast.</li>
            <li>I really hit the jackpot when I decided to try Dermaset cream.  </li>
            <li>When I tried it I was really taking by surprise.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>but i really did feel any changes by them using them.  </li>
            <li>THE DERMASET STUFF WERE VERY PROFECCIONAL AND EXPLANED</li>
            <li>SO MUCH</li>
            <li>I am very picky on what I use.  </li>
            <li>I have not noticed too much change in my wrinkles</li>
            <li>I would have saved so much time and money of</li>
            <li>my suspicions were confirmed when a friend who I hadnt seen in several months asked me if I had face lift surgery...</li>
            <li>I do not feel that it is anywhere near worth the price.</li>
            <li>DermaSet works very well for my skin without any irritation.  </li>
            <li>Not so much.  </li>
            <li>Really did not notice to much of an improvement.  </li>
            <li>I can really tell a difference in my moms skin.</li>
            <li>and I really like the product.</li>
            <li>It also lasts and you don&#x27;t have to use that much.</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really get to see any effects from the product as I couldn&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li>had been (and will continue) using Clinique for men, which is much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to be able to try this product out due to the claims it made.  </li>
            <li>If you read the enclosed brochure, older skin will take longer to revive.  </li>
            <li>immediately filed a claim with the Better Business Bureau against Dermaset only to find that others have had the same experience with them .  </li>
            <li>Unexpectedly,   the results came out positive almost immediately.   </li>
            <li>It came highly recommended for doing just that, but two weeks into using the product I am not seeing any difference in my skin at all.</li>
            <li>highly recommend DermaSet cream.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Cynthia</li>
            <li>Although not easy on the wallet, this cream was by the far the best I&#x27;ve tried because it tightens, smooths, and moisturizes the skin and not many deliver that.</li>
            <li>If I tried to rub it in more, it just rolled up in little balls and came off.  </li>
            <li>LITTLE MORE THAN A MONTH I HAVE BEEN USING DERMASET</li>
            <li>i ordered the cream directly  from the company and their customer service was unbelievably fast and efficient.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take much, and it completely disappears into the skin without any sort of oily or greasy</li>
            <li>I have two children and work full time and do not have time for long regimen.  </li>
            <li>I see and feel more of an impact over a few week trial.</li>
            <li>(I have normal skin texture.)  </li>
            <li>However, I cannot see that it is any better or any worse than any other popular products on the market.  </li>
            <li>Not only did I get this product sooner than expected, but knowing that I have the full support and help of the customer service team behind it makes this product even more worthwhile and quality.</li>
            <li>I always search for the new ingredients in the skin care products.</li>
            <li>I did not expect to have a new face or anything like that from DermaSet.  </li>
            <li>I live in California and the rest of my friends have suggested Botox as they have all used it.</li>
            <li>This was new for me.</li>
            <li>This cream has lightened my dark spots, smoothed over my skin and reduced appearance of fine lines that come with aging.</li>
            <li>have very sensitive skin and</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and was worried about how it would effect it.</li>
            <li>I received the cream few days earlier than expected which was great.</li>
            <li>I bought the DermaSet cream for my mom who is 73 years old and does not like to try anything new because she is an old school.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>DermaSet has tightened up my neck area and made my skin really smooth and tight.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels smooth, I add a little touch of La Mer moisturizer to it</li>
            <li>Been using it twice a day for about 2 weeks, and can clearly see&lt;br</li>
            <li>please do not waste your money ...</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and eyes.  </li>
            <li>If you look at any place online, they always say for sensitive, don&#x27;t use anything with perfume in it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Did not make my skin feel as soft as I thought it should for the price.  </li>
            <li>I was waiting for the results for a whole month and it finally came.  </li>
            <li>I quit using it about a third of the way through too much money</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin that flares up and becomes blotchy, but not with Dermaset.</li>
            <li>So far, I really like it, especially because I have tried a lot of creams and serums and this is one of the only ones I’ve really seen a difference with.  </li>
            <li>I am a 60 year old guy.</li>
            <li>The product is quite good, but way way too expensive.</li>
            <li>This is an expensive product, I would expect a good quality.</li>
            <li>I thought perhaps some dietary changes were responsible but when I switched back to the high end department store brand because  I wanted to experiment, the compliments ceased, red face returned.</li>
            <li>Age 45 with dry skin and fine lines around eyes and above upper lip.  </li>
            <li>I was reading these reviews on here and found the same exact review under two different names and review titles!</li>
            <li>This cream is a miracle product, i saw the results in the first week of my trial and now I am only on my second tube.  </li>
            <li>DermaSet cream out performs it enough to justify the high price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is quite concentrated and smooth, so very little is needed.</li>
            <li>and I look young and fresh and wrinkle less.  </li>
            <li>Took a while to get back to normal.</li>
            <li>-so am experiencing a slight improvement; but results are better than any other to product I&#x27;ve tried...</li>
            <li>I look younger and I feel brand new.  </li>
            <li>My overall complexion was visibly improved and my skin really did look younger!  </li>
            <li>My overall complexion was visibly improved and my skin really did look younger!  </li>
            <li>Finding a product that truey works is probably one of the most difficult tasks, but this one works very well and does everything that it says it will do.</li>
            <li>but when my skin started to get the idea the results have been an improvement like no other cream or treatment has even come close to.  </li>
            <li>This product goes on smoothly and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I am 64 years old and suddenly everything on my face looked saggy.</li>
            <li>I can definitely tell a difference in my 51-year old skin.</li>
            <li>I am a 75 year old woman who is healing from her 2nd cancer surgery.</li>
            <li>Have been using this product daily for nearly two months and see no change in the condition of my skin.  </li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t have this kind of money to buy this expensive product...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 35 yr old male and my age was starting to show.</li>
            <li>However, my skin does seem to be much brighter and some of the dark spots on my face have lighten.  </li>
            <li>It is much more expensive than average, and I simply don&#x27;t think it is worth the extra expense.</li>
            <li>this cream, which i alternate with other facial creams, makes my skin so tight and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I have tried it for a few days and in the small amount of time saw quite a difference in my neck,  in a more youthful glow in my face and around my lines around my mouth.</li>
            <li>After using dermaset for only a week I noticed my face was not dry.</li>
            <li>with that said, it&#x27;s wise to do your homework and try less expensive creams first.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li>I have used DermaSet for approximately one month and noticed the removal of fine lines around my eye and forehead region.  </li>
            <li>Your skin may feel tight when first applied and it may also feel dry.</li>

            <li> My friend from San Francisco told me about DermaSet, the new anti-aging cream that she purchased on line and is very happy with.  </li>
            <li> For radiance, smoothness, and moisture, this cream is by far the best.</li>
            <li> This is helping me to keep myself positive and confident that I will win both battles.</li>
            <li> I have tried MANY beauty products and serums but haven’t seen the results that I did with this one.  </li>
            <li> Love love love this product.</li>
            <li> My neck, my jowls, the lines around my mouth were more pronounced.</li>
            <li> I love Dermaset because it is all in one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love their customer service team.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS MOISTURIZER</li>
            <li> I have tried MANY beauty products and serums but haven’t seen the results that I did with this one.  </li>
            <li> Love love love this product.</li>
            <li> However, I like the TSN product better</li>
            <li> I have diabetes and many complications which effects my skin.  </li>
            <li> and she absolutely in love with it.  </li>
            <li> She said the cream is the best present</li>
            <li> I have used many skin care products to battle the onslaught of aging.  </li>
            <li> Love it...</li>
            <li> and I felt I need to let everybody know how wonderful the cream is, and how it helped me look younger than I am.  </li>
            <li> I love the customer service at their company and how cooperative they always are.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> and I am so glad that they did.  </li>
            <li> You will be so pleased that you did.</li>
            <li> You might have a better results.  </li>
            <li> She is using it with the drop of Argan Oil to get more moisture.  </li>
            <li> Actually, I love how my face feels</li>
            <li> The service was outstanding as always on amazon.</li>
            <li> I AM SO GLAD</li>
            <li> BUT I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I am happy to report that after 3 weeks I noticed my brown spots are much lighter.</li>
            <li> There’s so many products out there</li>
            <li> I’ve tried so many different creams (brand names, drug store, custom made) and none of them really impressed me.</li>
            <li> After one week of use, I noticed my lines were more prominent</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT IS OK, BUT WHO CAN AFFORD $179 FOR A TUBE OF FACE CREAM?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> just submitted a claim against Dermaset to the Better Business Bureau.  </li>
            <li> You can find something better.</li>
            <li> Amazon was most helpful.</li>
            <li> I do apply the Clinique night moisturizer on top of it and it feels nourishing.  </li>
            <li> I will keep on trying this cream to see if there is any more improvement.  </li>
            <li> I will review again after a couple of more months.</li>
            <li> It is a worthwhile splurge if you have it in your budget.</li>
            <li> I can top it with make up that contains sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Definitely better than Meaningful Beauty.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it a star is because of Amazon&#x27;s excellent shipping practices.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and will convey this message to everyone</li>
            <li> This is the best present that I can get for her!</li>
            <li> After about 2 weeks I found my skin tone to be more even, crow feet not as pronounced, and the puffiness under my eyes subsided.  </li>
            <li> I am not looking for anything better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not often that a product does what it advertises, but Dermaset does even more than it advertises.</li>
            <li> i feel and look better.  </li>
            <li> On me this product never sunk into my skin but sat on top and pilled.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully others will have better luck.</li>
            <li> MORE EVENLY TONED.</li>
            <li> I COULD NOT BEEN MORE PLEASED TO REGAINE</li>
            <li> Love the way it smoothes my skin tone.</li>
            <li> dryer and somewinkles looked more pronounced</li>
            <li> I love to rub the product into my hands and work it into my face.</li>
            <li> LOVE how smooth it goes on and how it is to use</li>
            <li> I have fairly good skin and wanted to use a product that promised so much.  </li>
            <li> My face looks better than ever and for what you get, the price is so worth it!</li>
            <li> Just a pea size amount provides does the trick and absorbs easily into the skin.  </li>
            <li> Oh, and the best part about using this cream is that i have been receiving compliments left and right.</li>
            <li> The cream has a very pleasant smell and it comes in a sleek and sexy grey box and definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the splurge, and on special occasions I&#x27;ll use it twice a day, morning and night, and I feel amazing.  </li>
            <li> I am 55 and all my  Fine lines,wrinkles,crows feet</li>
            <li> As i was expecting to continue to use Dermaset, so i called to customer service to get more information on when my second tube will be shipped, their response was prompt and my interaction with customer service was as pleasant as their cream.</li>
            <li> The scent is very light and fresh.</li>
            <li> and it is making a huge difference in how I feel about myself.  </li>
            <li> They are always available for me.</li>
            <li> They advertised as a free trial and sent it to me for $4.95 shipping.</li>
            <li> I enjoy DermaSet cream for two years</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure it would be worth it for those who will invest....</li>
            <li> HOW THE FREE TRIAL WORKS,</li>
            <li> After purchasing Dermaset cream from their website, I was informed how the free trial works.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T ACCEPT THE FREE TRIAL OFFER ON THE DERMASET SITE.  </li>
            <li> (I get free samples of detergent, cereal, BOGOF&#x27;s in the mail from time to time).  </li>
            <li> This cream is absolutely fabulous, I never take times to review products, but this one deserves it.</li>
            <li> They are effective, and very inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> I already ordered several tomes and love how good it works.</li>
            <li> but so far, so good.</li>
            <li> The seller was good to deal with and was surprised to hear my compliant as she hadn&#x27;t heard my problem from anyone else that used the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> It feels clean, absorbs quickly and the effects are immediate!</li>
            <li> , THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE APPEREANCE OF MY SKIN.</li>
            <li> It gives a nice taut feeling to my skin as well as soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I am of the more experienced generation so my wrinkles are a little more stubborn and took a little longer to react to this remarkable cream</li>
            <li> EVERYTHING THAT THE LABEL SAID IT WOULD DO IS TRUE FOR ME:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many products that have promised so much</li>
            <li> /&gt;a full tube to use.</li>
            <li> This cream turned to be liquid after a few days and doesn&#x27;t look good!</li>
            <li> I have been using DermaSet cream for roughly a week, and so far I am impressed.  </li>
            <li> My face is now moist and smooth and my dark circles under my eyes have faded 80%, a remarkable improvement.</li>
            <li> noticeable results quickly</li>
            <li> Have used many anti-age/wrinkle creams, all where highly rated.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> You may think it is strange to be doing this at this time, however I find it is good to fight against wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This is the only cream my mother will use from now on because, according to her, it makes her young and beautiful.</li>
            <li> My face feels much softer and I&#x27;ve noticed HUGE improvements in evening out my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It is worth the investment.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey, but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Of course I&#x27;d like to finish the first tube to see what the true verdict is...</li>
            <li> It is worth every dime.  </li>
            <li> The product is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> What i am most excited about is that now i can actually walk out of the house without makeup on.</li>
            <li> but right now I can afford it.</li>
            <li> I can say i found the right product for me.</li>
            <li> It not only makes them look much better after I apply it, but they absolutely look 100 times better even after getting out of the shower, which means it&#x27;s made a real difference, not just on the surface.</li>
            <li> I have some very fine lines, but this made them look very deep.  </li>
            <li> I use DermaSet Cream daily under my make up as it works as a great \\&quot;primer\\&quot; that is doubles as a corrective cream for age related issues.</li>
            <li> Definitely pretty fishy.</li>
            <li> After the first week, I noticed that my age spots along my jaw were fading and the sagging under my chin was tightening.  </li>
            <li> I have to admit I was skeptical; but, I am very glad that I tried this product!!!!!  </li>
            <li> I got interested and I ordered it.</li>
            <li> I finished the first tube</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a smoker of 50 years and this product worked great for firming and reducing the wrinkles around the corners of my nose and lips and sagging jaw line, which are related to being long time smoker.</li>
            <li> My skin became firmer and brighter within the first three days.  </li>
            <li> Still think it is too costly-so only able to use once a day</li>
            <li> First of all, I don&#x27;t write reviews.</li>
            <li> I noticed results almost immediately and the longer I use it, the more the hands of time seem to be turning back.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t see many men reviewing this product, so if your a guy, this product works equally well for both&lt;br /&gt;sexes.&lt;br /&gt;Give</li>
            <li> It is very soothing and goes right in to the skin.</li>
            <li> I knew it was not going to make my skin look brand new but from other reviews I thought it would be pretty good.  </li>
            <li> I am 44 years old and have very oily skin with some light sun damage discoloration.  </li>
            <li> I am 49 1/2 years old; but, most people think I am in my early 30&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> so that pretty much expresses how I felt.</li>
            <li> The research was pretty promising, but when I placed my order I kept my fingers crossed.</li>
            <li> After about a week, I started noticing my pores looking smaller and the fine lines vanishing.  </li>
            <li> After about a week, I started noticing my pores looking smaller and the fine lines vanishing.  </li>
            <li> My daily needs are to ease sensitivity, fine wrinkles and anti-aging.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only recently started using this product and love it!  </li>
            <li> I am in my fifties and not only are the fine lines around my eyes and mouth disappearing</li>
            <li> I really wish I had taken before and after pictures of my skin.</li>
            <li> YOU REALLY</li>
            <li> The service was fast.</li>
            <li> I really hit the jackpot when I decided to try Dermaset cream.  </li>
            <li> When I tried it I was really taking by surprise.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> but i really did feel any changes by them using them.  </li>
            <li> THE DERMASET STUFF WERE VERY PROFECCIONAL AND EXPLANED</li>
            <li> SO MUCH</li>
            <li> I am very picky on what I use.  </li>
            <li> I have not noticed too much change in my wrinkles</li>
            <li> I would have saved so much time and money of</li>
            <li> my suspicions were confirmed when a friend who I hadnt seen in several months asked me if I had face lift surgery...</li>
            <li> I do not feel that it is anywhere near worth the price.</li>
            <li> DermaSet works very well for my skin without any irritation.  </li>
            <li> Not so much.  </li>
            <li> Really did not notice to much of an improvement.  </li>
            <li> I can really tell a difference in my moms skin.</li>
            <li> and I really like the product.</li>
            <li> It also lasts and you don&#x27;t have to use that much.</li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really get to see any effects from the product as I couldn&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li> had been (and will continue) using Clinique for men, which is much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to be able to try this product out due to the claims it made.  </li>
            <li> If you read the enclosed brochure, older skin will take longer to revive.  </li>
            <li> immediately filed a claim with the Better Business Bureau against Dermaset only to find that others have had the same experience with them .  </li>
            <li> Unexpectedly,   the results came out positive almost immediately.   </li>
            <li> It came highly recommended for doing just that, but two weeks into using the product I am not seeing any difference in my skin at all.</li>
            <li> highly recommend DermaSet cream.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Cynthia</li>
            <li> Although not easy on the wallet, this cream was by the far the best I&#x27;ve tried because it tightens, smooths, and moisturizes the skin and not many deliver that.</li>
            <li> If I tried to rub it in more, it just rolled up in little balls and came off.  </li>
            <li> LITTLE MORE THAN A MONTH I HAVE BEEN USING DERMASET</li>
            <li> i ordered the cream directly  from the company and their customer service was unbelievably fast and efficient.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take much, and it completely disappears into the skin without any sort of oily or greasy</li>
            <li> I have two children and work full time and do not have time for long regimen.  </li>
            <li> I see and feel more of an impact over a few week trial.</li>
            <li> (I have normal skin texture.)  </li>
            <li> However, I cannot see that it is any better or any worse than any other popular products on the market.  </li>
            <li> Not only did I get this product sooner than expected, but knowing that I have the full support and help of the customer service team behind it makes this product even more worthwhile and quality.</li>
            <li> I always search for the new ingredients in the skin care products.</li>
            <li> I did not expect to have a new face or anything like that from DermaSet.  </li>
            <li> I live in California and the rest of my friends have suggested Botox as they have all used it.</li>
            <li> This was new for me.</li>
            <li> This cream has lightened my dark spots, smoothed over my skin and reduced appearance of fine lines that come with aging.</li>
            <li> have very sensitive skin and</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and was worried about how it would effect it.</li>
            <li> I received the cream few days earlier than expected which was great.</li>
            <li> I bought the DermaSet cream for my mom who is 73 years old and does not like to try anything new because she is an old school.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> DermaSet has tightened up my neck area and made my skin really smooth and tight.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels smooth, I add a little touch of La Mer moisturizer to it</li>
            <li> Been using it twice a day for about 2 weeks, and can clearly see&lt;br</li>
            <li> please do not waste your money ...</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and eyes.  </li>
            <li> If you look at any place online, they always say for sensitive, don&#x27;t use anything with perfume in it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Did not make my skin feel as soft as I thought it should for the price.  </li>
            <li> I was waiting for the results for a whole month and it finally came.  </li>
            <li> I quit using it about a third of the way through too much money</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin that flares up and becomes blotchy, but not with Dermaset.</li>
            <li> So far, I really like it, especially because I have tried a lot of creams and serums and this is one of the only ones I’ve really seen a difference with.  </li>
            <li> I am a 60 year old guy.</li>
            <li> The product is quite good, but way way too expensive.</li>
            <li> This is an expensive product, I would expect a good quality.</li>
            <li> I thought perhaps some dietary changes were responsible but when I switched back to the high end department store brand because  I wanted to experiment, the compliments ceased, red face returned.</li>
            <li> Age 45 with dry skin and fine lines around eyes and above upper lip.  </li>
            <li> I was reading these reviews on here and found the same exact review under two different names and review titles!</li>
            <li> This cream is a miracle product, i saw the results in the first week of my trial and now I am only on my second tube.  </li>
            <li> DermaSet cream out performs it enough to justify the high price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is quite concentrated and smooth, so very little is needed.</li>
            <li> and I look young and fresh and wrinkle less.  </li>
            <li> Took a while to get back to normal.</li>
            <li> -so am experiencing a slight improvement; but results are better than any other to product I&#x27;ve tried...</li>
            <li> I look younger and I feel brand new.  </li>
            <li> My overall complexion was visibly improved and my skin really did look younger!  </li>
            <li> My overall complexion was visibly improved and my skin really did look younger!  </li>
            <li> Finding a product that truey works is probably one of the most difficult tasks, but this one works very well and does everything that it says it will do.</li>
            <li> but when my skin started to get the idea the results have been an improvement like no other cream or treatment has even come close to.  </li>
            <li> This product goes on smoothly and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I am 64 years old and suddenly everything on my face looked saggy.</li>
            <li> I can definitely tell a difference in my 51-year old skin.</li>
            <li> I am a 75 year old woman who is healing from her 2nd cancer surgery.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product daily for nearly two months and see no change in the condition of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t have this kind of money to buy this expensive product...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 35 yr old male and my age was starting to show.</li>
            <li> However, my skin does seem to be much brighter and some of the dark spots on my face have lighten.  </li>
            <li> It is much more expensive than average, and I simply don&#x27;t think it is worth the extra expense.</li>
            <li> this cream, which i alternate with other facial creams, makes my skin so tight and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I have tried it for a few days and in the small amount of time saw quite a difference in my neck,  in a more youthful glow in my face and around my lines around my mouth.</li>
            <li> After using dermaset for only a week I noticed my face was not dry.</li>
            <li> with that said, it&#x27;s wise to do your homework and try less expensive creams first.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> I have used DermaSet for approximately one month and noticed the removal of fine lines around my eye and forehead region.  </li>
            <li> Your skin may feel tight when first applied and it may also feel dry.</li>
            <li> It actually works quite well and a tube last a very long time.</li>
            <li> and I would sometimes I would get a small rash if I used too much accidentally.  </li>
            <li> but I noticed it didn’t last long</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it that long, but way too big of price for what you get.</li>
            <li> do not have to spent a lot of time applying million different products, but I get the same result.  </li>
            <li> and, I&#x27;ve long forgotten the others that I have tried that didn&#x27;t deliver what I was led to believe.  </li>
            <li> Do not mind paying as long as product delivers and</li>
            <li> The other products made my eyes red and watery.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s skin is a little different, and a man&#x27;s skin a different from a women, but</li>
            <li> I did not like this product, my skin felt dry &amp; course after applying it</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t stand the dry feeling and had to wash it off immediately.</li>
            <li> I like that it is heavy enough to cover retinol related flaking, yet does not make me look shiny/oily.</li>
            <li> DermaSet 3D did not live up to my expectations for the money.  </li>
            <li> I am a former smoker and have been quite surprised how the lines above my lip have decreased, Also, I have extremely dry skin and have found that this keeps my face feeling moisturized and have not needed to use any additional moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it time to work because I felt that it was very expensive for not showing more of a result in a two week period.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, my skin exhibited a youthful radiant glow with no signs of dry skin!</li>
            <li> Other products such as Cindy Crawford&#x27;s; Derm something or other; Estee Lauder; Clinique; over-the-counter;</li>
            <li> I did not take a picture of my face before the first month, but I did for this next tube, as this is rather expensive.  </li>
            <li> However, I do feel my skin has definitely firmed and wrinkles are less pronounced.  </li>
            <li> You need to use multiple to achieve just a small difference and each of them does a different thing.</li>
            <li> When I used the DermaSet, my face got very dry and tight and caused my skin to look pulled, which made me look like I had really deep lines rather than smoothing my skin out.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a single breakout in all this time and my skin literally glows!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical of trying any new anti-aging cream, as I cross my fingers that the cream will finally be &#x27;THE ONE&#x27;.</li>
            <li> this cream has a great deal of perfume in it and smells awful.</li>
            <li> I really do not see a difference with my skin.  </li>
            <li> choice for a few years, while still experimenting with different brands.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> absolutely no difference after 30 days and skin felt</li>
            <li> As a 50 year old woman, I had problems with my appearance in the past few years.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and my skin looks brighter and firmer already.</li>
            <li> Be careful!</li>
            <li> The other products made my skin feel &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Not sure I see any difference in all the lines on my face, but I like that this actually fades those damn spots!</li>
            <li> I would not use any other cream now.</li>
            <li> My skin became a little Rashi and actually dry.</li>
            <li> I have a dry skin and do not like creams with heavy fragrant.  </li>
            <li> I had a very  dry face and very dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> but I now have to search for the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m not very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> and I see my dark spots diminished and the wrinkles around my mouth are less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> and i have been noticing less wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> it has a slight &amp;#34;coconut&amp;#34; odor, which makes me think it might have a touch of virgin coconut oil.</li>
            <li> However I do find that if wet my fingers and my face is moist after washing it goes on well and very little is needed.  </li>
            <li> The cream is hard to apply if your face is dry.  </li>
            <li> When I would put the foundation on over the product it would roll off like little eraser balls.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everyday use keeps it that way.</li>
            <li> Once dried it does have a tightening effect on your skin.  </li>
            <li> It dried my skin out</li>
            <li> My skin looks younger, radiant and does look tired anymore.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s NOT a free sample, they send you&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some just disappeared in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> have all become less noticeable!</li>
            <li> Very odd</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t rate products, but I had to on this one.  </li>
            <li> and I am not sure when it happened</li>
            <li> The product does not absorb well and few minutes after application, it rolls off!  </li>
            <li> HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR THE PAST THREE WEEKS</li>
            <li> I used the product for the past 3 months</li>
            <li> I am just truthful so think twice before paying this outrageous amount.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the very few products of the hundreds I&#x27;ve tried that lives up to its claims.</li>
            <li> My skin and face always had that tired look because of deep wrinkles, but after using Dermaset cream, I found a dramatic look change and feel to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am going to stick with this product since I see a dramatic difference as some other people had said in their reviews.</li>
            <li> and it’s hard to choose just one.</li>
            <li> I was a little annoyed with my husband for purchasing Dermaset cream for $179.00 on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I have tried to go without it and there is a noticeable negative difference when I do not use it.</li>
            <li> I tried calling at least twice before I concluded they are not a legit business, so I processed a charge-back on my credit</li>
            <li> I am not trying to be negative.</li>
            <li> I was excited, however, I was very disappointed with the outcome.</li>
            <li> The rep told me that failure to pay would hurt my credit score.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Unlike the other raving reviews, I&#x27;ve been disappointed and haven&#x27;t found the &amp;#34;spectacular&amp;#34; results I expected with a product this pricey.</li>
            <li> It is a little expensive</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical</li>
            <li> I had really bad dark spots and my skin tone was uneven.</li>
            <li> I paid the outrageous price for this product after reading all do the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I have been using Dermaset for approximately 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Sorry I bought this.</li>
            <li> Does not burn or feel uncomfortable on skin....</li>
            <li> but unfortunately this isn&#x27;t so.</li>
            <li> but it is very expensive ($615.00 per oz).  </li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t so bad using it at night</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed</li>
            <li> It feels like it shields my face from brutal winds that we always have.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible ..</li>
            <li> an awful come on and don&#x27;t bother with it.</li>
            <li> This was the worst product I have ever used!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Be careful! I was reading these reviews on here and found the same exact review under two different names and review titles! U will catch it. Definitely pretty fishy. im nt sayn dermaset does not work. It may! This is about the reviews on here though. Very odd</li>
            <li> This product is terrible ..it is scam scam scam and moral hazard....please do not waste your money ...please do not buy it ...it is cheating cheating and scam....... ...</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t absorb well and leaves a residue that looks like crumbs.  Sorry I bought this.</li>
            <li> I thought I was never going to get great skin. I had really bad dark spots and my skin tone was uneven. After using this product for one month my skin looks so much better!!! I really wish I had taken before and after pictures of my skin. This product goes on smoothly and a little goes a long way. I will definitely buy this product again!</li>
            <li> I am a beauty product addict and received the trial of this product.  After about a week, I started noticing my pores looking smaller and the fine lines vanishing.  My overall complexion was visibly improved and my skin really did look younger!  I have tried MANY beauty products and serums but haven’t seen the results that I did with this one.  Love love love this product.</li>
            <li> OVE this product! It is worth the investment. It plumps, hydrates, dismisses lines, and gives my skin a beautiful glow. I use it every night and wake up looking 10 years younger. It is definitely worth the splurge, and on special occasions I&#x27;ll use it twice a day, morning and night, and I feel amazing.  Just buy it!!!! It&#x27;s one of the very few products of the hundreds I&#x27;ve tried that lives up to its claims. I&#x27;m incredibly happy!</li>
            <li> This is from Diane - friend of Steve. I am 64 years old and suddenly everything on my face looked saggy. My neck, my jowls, the lines around my mouth were more pronounced. I started using Strivectin and Dr Perricone and did find some difference. I wanted to get a face lift but between the time out of work and the enormous amount of money I was hesitant. Then I got a e-mail regarding DermaSet. I have tried it for a few days and in the small amount of time saw quite a difference in my neck,  in a more youthful glow in my face and around my lines around my mouth. I am going to stick with this product since I see a dramatic difference as some other people had said in their reviews.</li>
            <li> I have two children and work full time and do not have time for long regimen.  I love Dermaset because it is all in one.&lt;br /&gt;I do not have to spent a lot of time applying million different products, but I get the same result.  Dermaset works beautifully alone.  I apply it in morning and evening and I look young and fresh and wrinkle less.  I love their customer service team.  They are always available for me.</li>
            <li> I love this cream! I have been using it for almost a week with no breakouts...the cream feels as if it is tightening the moment I put it on.  I do mix it with my face oil and i have been noticing less wrinkles.  I usually don&#x27;t rate products, but I had to on this one.  A bit pricey, but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS MOISTURIZER, I DID A LOT OF RESEARCH BEFORE BUYING  DERMASET CREAM. EVERYTHING THAT THE LABEL SAID IT WOULD DO IS TRUE FOR ME: MY PORES SHRANK AND MY SKIN SOFTENED.  MY SKIN TONE EVENED OUT, ALSO. . ALL YOU REALLY NEED(IN THE MOISTURIZER CATEGORY) IS THIS MOISTURIZER WHICH CAN BE WORN DAY AND NIGHT.  IF USING THIS CREAM ALLOWS ME TO LOOK LIKE THIS FOREVER, I WILL KEEP INVESTING IN IT.  I HAD BOUGHT IT FOR MYSELF AS A BIRTHDAY PRESENT, AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, THERE&#x27;S ALWAYS A HOLIDAY TO CELEBRATE EVERY MONTH.</li>

My overall complexion was visibly improved and my skin really did look younger!  I have tried MANY beauty products and serums but haven’t seen the results that I did with this one.  Love love love this product.</li>
            <li> Tried the product of a month and did like it...However, I like the TSN product better that I get  from my surgeons office.  I may try the product again in the future. I like the packaging of this product..</li>
            <li> this product does not work for me .</li>
            <li> I have been using Dermaset for approximately 2 weeks.  FINALLY!!!  I have found ONE product to use daily that will do what it claims.  I have diabetes and many complications which effects my skin.  Other products such as Cindy Crawford&#x27;s; Derm something or other; Estee Lauder; Clinique; over-the-counter; and, I&#x27;ve long forgotten the others that I have tried that didn&#x27;t deliver what I was led to believe.  I do not have the time nor patience to plaster on layer after layer of product nor do I want to have all the weight on my face.  Dermaset rapidly began tightening my pores.  After the first week, I noticed that my age spots along my jaw were fading and the sagging under my chin was tightening.  I have extremely sensitive skin and eyes.  The other products made my eyes red and watery.  NOT DERMASET!!!  The other products made my skin feel &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;.  NOT DERMASET!!!  I have to admit I was skeptical; but, I am very glad that I tried this product!!!!!  I will ALWAYS have a tube on my make-up table.  I am 49 1/2 years old; but, most people think I am in my early 30&#x27;s.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what else Dermaset will improve!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with purchase.  I already ordered several tomes and love how good it works.</li>
            <li> I bought the product because I thought it would help renew my skin which is wrinkled and losing tightness.  It came highly recommended for doing just that, but two weeks into using the product I am not seeing any difference in my skin at all.</li>
            <li> They advertised as a free trial and sent it to me for $4.95 shipping. What they didn&#x27;t say was that were going to charge me $179.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin and this cream has a great deal of perfume in it and smells awful. If you look at any place online, they always say for sensitive, don&#x27;t use anything with perfume in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its an awful come on and don&#x27;t bother with it.</li>
            <li> Work on me very good m so happy with it, and I told my friends about how&#x27;s work good ... Awesome</li>
            <li> I bought DermaSet now for my mother-in-law and she absolutely in love with it.  She said the cream is the best present I could of given her.</li>
            <li> I have been using DermaSet cream for roughly a week, and so far I am impressed.  My daily needs are to ease sensitivity, fine wrinkles and anti-aging.  This cream has addressed my concerns almost immediately when using twice a day.  Of course I&#x27;d like to finish the first tube to see what the true verdict is... but so far, so good. The cream has a very pleasant smell and it comes in a sleek and sexy grey box and definitely worth every penny. Amazon&#x27;s customer service was excellent ...I received the cream few days earlier than expected which was great.</li>
            <li> I always search for the new ingredients in the skin care products. I came across DermaSet cream on Amazon and I started reading the reviews about the product. I got interested and I ordered it. I have been using it for 2 weeks morning and evening. I can definitely tell a difference in my 51-year old skin. I haven&#x27;t had a single breakout in all this time and my skin literally glows! The scent is very light and fresh. The service was fast. Happy to find good seller at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!! works miracle in just 2 weeks great results!!! I have used many skin care products to battle the onslaught of aging.  I really hit the jackpot when I decided to try Dermaset cream.  The product is luxurious, it works and it works wonders, without exaggeration. It is quite concentrated and smooth, so very little is needed. Love it... highly recommend DermaSet cream.</li>
            <li> I enjoy DermaSet cream for two years and I felt I need to let everybody know how wonderful the cream is, and how it helped me look younger than I am.  I love the customer service at their company and how cooperative they always are.</li>
            <li> Did not make my skin feel as soft as I thought it should for the price.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll try it again.</li>
            <li> I had a very  dry face and very dark circles under my eyes.  I tried everything with no results. After using dermaset for only a week I noticed my face was not dry. I finished the first tube and I am not sure when it happened but I now have to search for the dark circles under my eyes. My face is now moist and smooth and my dark circles under my eyes have faded 80%, a remarkable improvement. I love this product.  It is a little expensive but right now I can afford it.</li>
            <li> I did not expect to have a new face or anything like that from DermaSet.  However, I cannot see that it is any better or any worse than any other popular products on the market.  It is much more expensive than average, and I simply don&#x27;t think it is worth the extra expense.</li>
            <li> I am a convert.  I resisted this product to the point that I got an extension when I had not seen great results within 3 weeks.  They extended me another 2 weeks and I am so glad that they did.  I am of the more experienced generation so my wrinkles are a little more stubborn and took a little longer to react to this remarkable cream but when my skin started to get the idea the results have been an improvement like no other cream or treatment has even come close to.  I am so grateful to this company, I want to put this all over my body.  At this point I am using it on my face, neck and under my arms and it is making a huge difference in how I feel about myself.  It is worth every dime.  I can&#x27;t wait for my next shipment.  My advise is to give it a real honest try.  Use is faithfully morning and night.  You will be so pleased that you did.</li>
            <li> this cream, which i alternate with other facial creams, makes my skin so tight and smooth.  it has a slight &amp;#34;coconut&amp;#34; odor, which makes me think it might have a touch of virgin coconut oil.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!!!! LOVE how smooth it goes on and how it is to use, don&#x27;t like multi steps systems.&lt;br /&gt;Very impressed with the results of both after two and four weeks!!!&lt;br /&gt;After two weeks, I could see the difference on my face and after four on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely will be sticking to DermaSet!!!!</li>
            <li> After using this creme for a week, I noticed clarity in my complexion. Everyday use keeps it that way. Very good buy.</li>
            <li> I was a little annoyed with my husband for purchasing Dermaset cream for $179.00 on Amazon.  He always plays with different websites and finds the different staff.  He said that the Dermaset cream has really good reviews.  When I tried it I was really taking by surprise.  The vanity paid off the cream worked for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only recently started using this product and love it!  It gives a nice taut feeling to my skin as well as soft and smooth.  Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have fairly good skin and wanted to use a product that promised so much.  After two months of using it I really do not see a difference with my skin.  Will not invest on this product again.</li>
            <li> I have a dry skin and do not like creams with heavy fragrant.  After reading the reviews, I was looking forward to try this product.  Extremely disappointed.  The product does not absorb well and few minutes after application, it rolls off!  It has a powdery fragrant that lingers.  If you can, try it prior to purchase.  I am going back to glo-therapeutics and Dr. Houscha.  Both very effective.  Do not mind paying as long as product delivers and DermoSet did not for me.  Age 45 with dry skin and fine lines around eyes and above upper lip.  After two weeks, I have not seen any improvement!!  You might have a better results.  However try it prior to purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought the DermaSet cream for my mom who is 73 years old and does not like to try anything new because she is an old school.&lt;br /&gt;I practically had to fight with her to try this product and now she can&#x27;t stop raving about it.  She is using it with the drop of Argan Oil to get more moisture.  She tells me her skin looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell, pleasant feel on skin.  Does not burn or feel uncomfortable on skin....I didn&#x27;t give it time to work because I felt that it was very expensive for not showing more of a result in a two week period.  There aren&#x27;t any guarantees for working in a 2 week period....but I just had second thoughts.  I just don&#x27;t have this kind of money to buy this expensive product...but I&#x27;m sure it would be worth it for those who will invest....I like skin care by Peter Thomas Roth....I see and feel more of an impact over a few week trial.</li>
            <li> Unlike the other raving reviews, I&#x27;ve been disappointed and haven&#x27;t found the &amp;#34;spectacular&amp;#34; results I expected with a product this pricey.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a smoker of 50 years and this product worked great for firming and reducing the wrinkles around the corners of my nose and lips and sagging jaw line, which are related to being long time smoker.</li>
            <li> I was waiting for the results for a whole month and it finally came.  I was using Dermaset as instructed by the company and I see my dark spots diminished and the wrinkles around my mouth are less noticeable.  I will use it for another month and will report what happens.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many products that have promised so much but i really did feel any changes by them using them.  I can say i found the right product for me.</li>
            <li> I am on my second month of using this.  I regret I did not take a picture of my face before the first month, but I did for this next tube, as this is rather expensive.  I will update when I see what if any difference.  However, I do feel my skin has definitely firmed and wrinkles are less pronounced.  I am a former smoker and have been quite surprised how the lines above my lip have decreased, Also, I have extremely dry skin and have found that this keeps my face feeling moisturized and have not needed to use any additional moisturizer. Actually, I love how my face feels and I spend a lot of time in the sun.  If you read the enclosed brochure, older skin will take longer to revive.  I use the Boots 07 toner  after cleansing my face and then apply the DermaSet.  The Boots 07 toner is the nicest I have ever used, by the way.</li>
            <li> As a 50 year old woman, I had problems with my appearance in the past few years. I live in California and the rest of my friends have suggested Botox as they have all used it. I was a little skeptical so I did some research about anti-aging face creams. I tried La Praire Anti-aging Cream Platinum it gave me some results, it does work but it is very expensive ($615.00 per oz).  My friend from San Francisco told me about DermaSet, the new anti-aging cream that she purchased on line and is very happy with.  I did order it to try.  Now, I am already on my 2nd week using the cream.  My skin became firmer and brighter within the first three days.  I am very pleased with the results and happy to share my find with everyone.  The product is worth every penny. The service was outstanding as always on amazon.</li>
            <li> I AM SO GLAD I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE IT HAS TRANSFORM MY SKIN!&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR THE PAST THREE WEEKS AND IT WORKS WONDERS ON MY SKIN.&lt;br /&gt;IT HAS A GREAT SCENT AND ADDS THE PERFECT AMOUNT OF MOISTURE WHILE TIGHTENING AND TONING AT THE SAME TIME. DERMASET CREAM DOES EVERYTHING IN ONE PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;I ORDERED THE PRODUCT OVER THE PHONE. THE DERMASET STUFF WERE VERY PROFECCIONAL AND EXPLANED TO ME IN DETAIL HOW THE FREE TRIAL WORKS, BUT I LOVE IT SO MUCH I WON&#x27;T BE RETURNING IT.</li>
            <li> I love it. After purchasing Dermaset cream from their website, I was informed how the free trial works. I used the product for the past 3 months and I was amazed at the difference it made. This cream is a miracle product, i saw the results in the first week of my trial and now I am only on my second tube.  I apply the cream to my face 2 times daily, morning and evening and I have a radiant look in the morning.  This cream has lightened my dark spots, smoothed over my skin and reduced appearance of fine lines that come with aging. As i was expecting to continue to use Dermaset, so i called to customer service to get more information on when my second tube will be shipped, their response was prompt and my interaction with customer service was as pleasant as their cream.</li>
            <li> I am happy to report that after 3 weeks I noticed my brown spots are much lighter. Not sure I see any difference in all the lines on my face, but I like that this actually fades those damn spots!</li>
            <li> I did not like this product, my skin felt dry &amp; course after applying it, I would not recommend it I threw the sample away. so that pretty much expresses how I felt.</li>
            <li> There’s so many products out there and it’s hard to choose just one. I I’ve tried so many different creams (brand names, drug store, custom made) and none of them really impressed me. You need to use multiple to achieve just a small difference and each of them does a different thing. Then I tried Dermaset and I really liked it. The tube was big but I noticed it didn’t last long and I wondered why... turns out my roommate was starting to use some each day. She now has one too, glad we solved that problem!!</li>
            <li> We have all used moisterizers, c reams, and face serum that make promises they never keep. But I am thrilled to have found Dermaset! My face feels much softer and I&#x27;ve noticed HUGE improvements in evening out my wrinkles. My face looks better than ever and for what you get, the price is so worth it! You just have to try this product to believe how well it works. Go ahead, splurge on yourself, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product. After one week of use, I noticed my lines were more prominent and I actually believe there were more!&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend this product for anyone with aging skin.</li>
            <li> My husband and I share an amazon account and after reading great reviews on DermaSet I decided to give it a go. Let me tell you... it&#x27;s been only a week and after every time I use it I feel like I am getting a mini facelift!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope the cream never stops working. I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Cynthia</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T ACCEPT THE FREE TRIAL OFFER ON THE DERMASET SITE.  IT IS DEFINITELY A SCAM.  I WAS CHARGED $179 ON MY&lt;br /&gt;CREDIT CARD, AND THEN THE NEXT MONTH (STILL WITH NO AUTHORIZATION FROM ME) I RECEIVED AN EMAIL TELLING ME I WAS BEING SENT A SECOND TUBE.  I HAD TO HAVE MY CREDIT CARD CANCELLED IN ORDER TO CANCEL THE SECOND SHIPMENT AND CHARGE.  THE PRODUCT IS OK, BUT WHO CAN AFFORD $179 FOR A TUBE OF FACE CREAM?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS A FINE-PRINT FISH &amp; CUT BAIT SCAM.  DON&#x27;T BITE.</li>
            <li> Have seen no difference in skin while using this product.</li>
            <li> I utterly adore this product! DermaSet has tightened up my neck area and made my skin really smooth and tight. I have tried all of the brand names skin care products and this is truly the best. It feels clean, absorbs quickly and the effects are immediate! My skin is becoming flawless and glowing because of this cream. I have tried to go without it and there is a noticeable negative difference when I do not use it. For radiance, smoothness, and moisture, this cream is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I am very picky on what I use.  My friend&#x27;s come to me for advice and joke I should be a beauty blogger.  I &#x27;ve tried my fair share of serums, creams, and moisturizes.  Although not easy on the wallet, this cream was by the far the best I&#x27;ve tried because it tightens, smooths, and moisturizes the skin and not many deliver that.</li>
            <li> Hey people:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just submitted a claim against Dermaset to the Better Business Bureau.  I responded to their unsolicited &amp;#34;pop up&amp;#34; add for a &amp;#34;free trial.&amp;#34;  I was directed to their website and agreed to receive the &amp;#34;free trial&amp;#34; wherein I paid S/H of $4.95.&lt;br /&gt;A month later, I get a charge on my credit card for $179.00!!  Immediately I stopped using the product (it did nothing but moisturize my face somewhat) and attempted to contact Dermaset, but they did not pick up the phone.  I tried calling at least twice before I concluded they are not a legit business, so I processed a charge-back on my credit card.&lt;br /&gt; Four months later I get a letter from a collection agency.  The collection agency rep told me that &amp;#34;nothing is free&amp;#34; and I disputed her.  (I get free samples of detergent, cereal, BOGOF&#x27;s in the mail from time to time).  I offered to return the unused portion but that&#x27;s about it.  The rep told me that failure to pay would hurt my credit score.&lt;br /&gt;I immediately filed a claim with the Better Business Bureau against Dermaset only to find that others have had the same experience with them .  Stay away from this company and the product.  You can find something better.</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I researched quite a bit before I ordered DermaSet Cream.  The research was pretty promising, but when I placed my order I kept my fingers crossed. Unexpectedly,   the results came out positive almost immediately.   I am SO HAPPY with it!  The cream smooths on nicely, and my skin texture gets amazing.   It fills in lines and wrinkles. I am thrilled with it and will continue to use it!!   Amazon was most helpful.</li>
            <li> When I used the DermaSet, my face got very dry and tight and caused my skin to look pulled, which made me look like I had really deep lines rather than smoothing my skin out.  I have some very fine lines, but this made them look very deep.  I couldn&#x27;t stand the dry feeling and had to wash it off immediately.</li>
            <li> I have been using dermaset for the last month now.  I am 44 years old and have very oily skin with some light sun damage discoloration.  The cream is hard to apply if your face is dry.  However I do find that if wet my fingers and my face is moist after washing it goes on well and very little is needed.  Once dried it does have a tightening effect on your skin.  However,  I find it not to be too moisturizing for me.  I do apply the Clinique night moisturizer on top of it and it feels nourishing.  I have not noticed too much change in my wrinkles but I only have been on the side of my eyes.  However, my skin does seem to be much brighter and some of the dark spots on my face have lighten.  I will keep on trying this cream to see if there is any more improvement.  I will review again after a couple of more months.</li>
            <li> Still think it is too costly-so only able to use once a day-so am experiencing a slight improvement; but results are better than any other to product I&#x27;ve tried...</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m not very happy with the product. My skin became a little Rashi and actually dry. I quit using it about a third of the way through too much money</li>
            <li> This cream is absolutely fabulous, I never take times to review products, but this one deserves it. I have extremely sensitive skin that flares up and becomes blotchy, but not with Dermaset. My skin feels revived and rejuvinated with each use. Finding a product that truey works is probably one of the most difficult tasks, but this one works very well and does everything that it says it will do. I would have saved so much time and money of I found this cream earlier. Not only did I get this product sooner than expected, but knowing that I have the full support and help of the customer service team behind it makes this product even more worthwhile and quality.</li>
            <li> noticeable results quickly</li>
            <li> It is a worthwhile splurge if you have it in your budget. I use DermaSet Cream daily under my make up as it works as a great \\&quot;primer\\&quot; that is doubles as a corrective cream for age related issues. I like that it is heavy enough to cover retinol related flaking, yet does not make me look shiny/oily. I like to use it in the morning. It feels like it shields my face from brutal winds that we always have. I can top it with make up that contains sunscreen. I like the Amazon it is so efficient.</li>
            <li> After using this cream for 2 weeks, I have noticed a big difference in the smoothness on my face and neck. And while I thought it was helping to lift my face- my suspicions were confirmed when a friend who I hadnt seen in several months asked me if I had face lift surgery... I will FOREVER use this product!  Sherry G.</li>
            <li> After about  2 weeks of using  Dermaset cream I began to get compliments on my skin. This was new for me. Relatives commented &amp;#34;what are you doing to your skin this is the best it has ever looked&amp;#34;. Not just one but several. And my previously red, irritated skin wasn&#x27;t angry red any more, it felt like velvet. I thought perhaps some dietary changes were responsible but when I switched back to the high end department store brand because  I wanted to experiment, the compliments ceased, red face returned. I would not use any other cream now.</li>
            <li> The product is quite good, but way way too expensive.</li>
            <li> Definitely better than Meaningful Beauty.</li>
            <li> I am a 75 year old woman who is healing from her 2nd cancer surgery. You may think it is strange to be doing this at this time, however I find it is good to fight against wrinkles. This is helping me to keep myself positive and confident that I will win both battles. I plan to stay on this program if  the product works and my oncologist approves.</li>
            <li> This was the worst product I have ever used!  My face became red and puffy and it had a bumpy, cottage cheese feel to it.  Took a while to get back to normal. I would not recommend at all.  The only reason I gave it a star is because of Amazon&#x27;s excellent shipping practices.  Caution anyone who is thinking of purchasing this product!</li>
            <li> I paid the outrageous price for this product after reading all do the positive reviews. I was excited, however, I was very disappointed with the outcome. I use the entire tube giving it a chance to work as promised. I was not expecting a miracle makeover, just improvement. This product did not work for me at all! I do not feel that it is anywhere near worth the price. It was not even a good moisturizer. It dried my skin out and I would sometimes I would get a small rash if I used too much accidentally.  I am not trying to be negative. I am just truthful so think twice before paying this outrageous amount.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 35 yr old male and my age was starting to show. I saw an add for this and figured I&#x27;d give it a shot. To my surprise within a week I noticed tightening of my skin and lines were starting to disappear after 5 weeks I looked 5 yrs younger. I&#x27;ve never rated or written a review for a product before but this one deserved it. Thank you dermaset for giving me my youth back in my face.</li>
            <li> Just a pea size amount mixed with a drop of argan oil will give a treatment to the entire face. I love it !!</li>
            <li> I like it short and to the point. This is the only cream my mother will use from now on because, according to her, it makes her young and beautiful. When she applies it, she says she immediately feels the sensation of skin tightening and lifting. I can see that in 2 weeks she looks fresher. It was a great birthday gift!&lt;br /&gt;Mr. S. Sandler</li>
            <li> I have not seen any difference in my skin since I started using this product. I will not order it again.</li>
            <li> DermaSet works very well for my skin without any irritation.  Just a pea size amount provides does the trick and absorbs easily into the skin.  My skin was bright, even toned and in the best condition it has ever been in after using this product.  So far, I really like it, especially because I have tried a lot of creams and serums and this is one of the only ones I’ve really seen a difference with.  A little goes a long way and my skin looks brighter and firmer already.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it that long, but way too big of price for what you get. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> My skin and face always had that tired look because of deep wrinkles, but after using Dermaset cream, I found a dramatic look change and feel to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin was instantly rejuvenated by the cream.  I use the product now twice a day, in the morning and at bedtime. I look younger and I feel brand new.  My friends noticed that and made complements to me.  I love this product and will convey this message to everyone</li>
            <li> Have been using this product daily for nearly two months and see no change in the condition of my skin.  Your skin may feel tight when first applied and it may also feel dry. (I have normal skin texture.)  I now mix this with argan oil before sleeping and this combination results in a dewy complexion in the morning.  I was hoping the DermaSet would be the only product I&#x27;d need except for a sunscreen but unfortunately this isn&#x27;t so.</li>
            <li> I knew it was not going to make my skin look brand new but from other reviews I thought it would be pretty good.  Not so much.  Really did not notice to much of an improvement.  Disappointed</li>
            <li> First of all, I don&#x27;t write reviews. But in this case, I must. I had been pining for a product that I could use on my neck and decolte because they were getting crepey. Then I  searched the internet and found Dermaset cream on Amazon and gave it a try. Well!! It not only makes them look much better after I apply it, but they absolutely look 100 times better even after getting out of the shower, which means it&#x27;s made a real difference, not just on the surface. I&#x27;m over the moon!</li>
            <li> Excellent  product! I have used DermaSet for approximately one month and noticed the removal of fine lines around my eye and forehead region.  Additionally, my skin exhibited a youthful radiant glow with no signs of dry skin!</li>
            <li> I bought DermaSet for my mother for Mothers Day. The cream helps restore skin resiliency and elasticity. I can really tell a difference in my moms skin. This is the best present that I can get for her!</li>
            <li> Incredible softness and radiance but too costly😔</li>
            <li> This cream turned to be liquid after a few days and doesn&#x27;t look good! This is an expensive product, I would expect a good quality. How come it transferred from cream to be waterish stuff?! I would like to return this product if I could.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical of trying any new anti-aging cream, as I cross my fingers that the cream will finally be &#x27;THE ONE&#x27;. Well, I think i have finally found &#x27;the one&#x27; in Dermaset. I have never been so pleased with any cream!  After about 2 weeks I found my skin tone to be more even, crow feet not as pronounced, and the puffiness under my eyes subsided.  I have officially found my face cream soul mate!  Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;Miss I Gershfield.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad I tried DermaSet. I have very sensitive skin and was worried about how it would effect it. My skin looks and feels smooth, I add a little touch of La Mer moisturizer to it and I really like the product. I&#x27;ll be buying another tube soon. It also lasts and you don&#x27;t have to use that much.</li>
            <li> This one is a keeper and worth every penny!!! I am not looking for anything better. It stops here for me. My face has not looked this good since I was in my thirties! I am in my fifties and not only are the fine lines around my eyes and mouth disappearing but also I have the wonderful youthful glow! It&#x27;s not often that a product does what it advertises, but Dermaset does even more than it advertises. I noticed results almost immediately and the longer I use it, the more the hands of time seem to be turning back.</li>
            <li> immediate and noticeable results. what can i say, i&#x27;m hooked.  i ordered the cream directly  from the company and their customer service was unbelievably fast and efficient. My skin feels refreshed and revived every time i apply it.i have been applying DermaSet at night before bed and I wake up with evenly toned and plumped skin!! What i am most excited about is that now i can actually walk out of the house without makeup on. Oh, and the best part about using this cream is that i have been receiving compliments left and right.</li>
            <li> After my 50th bdy..i&#x27;ve been waiting for a miracle...MY MIRACLE IS DERMASET!  This product changed my life...i feel and look better.  My skin looks younger, radiant and does look tired anymore.  People have noticed it and ask me what have i done to my face..and i tell them the truth...DERMASET..I really like it.  Before DERMASET  i was planning on facelift...but for now i dont need it...so i will keep on saving my money for later...I am very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to be able to try this product out due to the claims it made.  However, I ended up returning it for a refund.  On me this product never sunk into my skin but sat on top and pilled.  If I tried to rub it in more, it just rolled up in little balls and came off.  This wasn&#x27;t so bad using it at night but I couldn&#x27;t use it under foundation.  When I would put the foundation on over the product it would roll off like little eraser balls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up returning it for a refund.  The seller was good to deal with and was surprised to hear my compliant as she hadn&#x27;t heard my problem from anyone else that used the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I didn&#x27;t really get to see any effects from the product as I couldn&#x27;t use it.  Hopefully others will have better luck.</li>
            <li> I am a 60 year old guy. Have used many anti-age/wrinkle creams, all where highly rated.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best I have used. Been using it twice a day for about 2 weeks, and can clearly see&lt;br /&gt;a difference in the appearance of my face.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s skin is a little different, and a man&#x27;s skin a different from a women, but this cream&lt;br /&gt;works well for me.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take much, and it completely disappears into the skin without any sort of oily or greasy&lt;br /&gt;residue.&lt;br /&gt;I had been (and will continue) using Clinique for men, which is much cheaper. It has been my product&lt;br /&gt;of choice for a few years, while still experimenting with different brands.&lt;br /&gt;The DermaSet cream out performs it enough to justify the high price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see many men reviewing this product, so if your a guy, this product works equally well for both&lt;br /&gt;sexes.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try, if you do not see results in 2 weeks, simply return it. It&#x27;s NOT a free sample, they send you&lt;br /&gt;a full tube to use. If you don&#x27;t return it, they charge you.&lt;br /&gt;But with that said, it&#x27;s wise to do your homework and try less expensive creams first.&lt;br /&gt;Some guys get great results from CeraVe moisturizers. They are effective, and very inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;Other excellent creams to experiment with are; Clinique, Peter Thomas Roth, Anavita, Menscience, and Lab Series.</li>
            <li> I N A LITTLE MORE THAN A MONTH I HAVE BEEN USING DERMASET, THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE APPEREANCE OF MY SKIN. BESIDES SEEING THE RESULTS MYSELF, FRIENDS HAVE COMMENTED THAT MY FACE LOOKS BRIGHTER AND MORE EVENLY TONED. I COULD NOT BEEN MORE PLEASED TO REGAINE A YOUGHFUL APPEARENCE!</li>
            <li> So far so good. Real light to your skin.</li>
            <li> DermaSet 3D did not live up to my expectations for the money.  I didn&#x27;t see the results promised in the adds.  Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!!! Works amazing. Better than lancome!</li>
            <li> Great results. Love the way it smoothes my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Amazing cream . I am 55 and all my  Fine lines,wrinkles,crows feet have all become less noticeable! Some just disappeared in a few weeks.All your creams in 1 tube is priceless too. Love this product!</li>
            <li> Best wrinkle cream yet.  It actually works quite well and a tube last a very long time.</li>
            <li> absolutely no difference after 30 days and skin felt dryer and somewinkles looked more pronounced</li>
            <li> I heard from my church ladies about this cream and  I finally received it last week and have been using it every night. It is very soothing and goes right in to the skin. I love to rub the product into my hands and work it into my face. I love DermaSet!</li>
