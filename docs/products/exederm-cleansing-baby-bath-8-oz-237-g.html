    <ol>
            <li>Mustella seemed to be working the best, but then eventually irritated his eczema.</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t made to be the perfect intensive hydrating formula.</li>
            <li>Go to their websites and determine what best fits your baby&#x27;s needs (or yours).</li>
            <li>This soap is awesome.  </li>
            <li>and we still continue to buy it even now that he is 5 because it is the best stuff</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>Best product for kids with eczema.</li>
            <li>Smells good though!</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s great, but this product wasn&#x27;t made to be the #1 moisturizer</li>
            <li>Great for my daughter&#x27;s ecxema.  </li>
            <li>This baby bath is great.</li>
            <li>It was easy on my skin, During a time when I had a severe rash the baby bath did not cause any pain, itching or flare ups which was awesome.</li>
            <li>reviewers and people will say this product doesn&#x27;t moisturize, it doesn&#x27;t feel good</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>This soap was recommended by her allergist, and is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>to read what they are all about and then make your own judgmental decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very mild good soap.</li>
            <li>IT IS WONDERFUL ON THE HAIR, AND COMPLETELY SATISFIES ME AS A SHAMPOO...</li>
            <li>I have used this product for two of my babies so far and it has been great!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>It was better than nothing.</li>
            <li>I like this product better because it lathers.</li>
            <li>This product also seems to moisturize better than the CeraVe alone.</li>
            <li>However, for this product I will make an exception since I am overwhelmingly satisfied with the outcome and company.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The squirt spout makes life alot easier too :)</li>
            <li>I really love this and all their products</li>
            <li>Okay.. Plan on returning it.</li>
            <li>this product has been great for my son with eczema, it really is gentle and does not flare up his skin issues.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be purchasing more when I run out of this one.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>and we fell in love.</li>
            <li>I have been using Exederm as a hand soap at home for a while now and am pleased with the result.</li>
            <li>Very nice, gentle baby bath.</li>
            <li>Nice lather and good price for high quality product.</li>
            <li>This is easy and not 100 products and works.</li>
            <li>It rinses easily which I love and is very gentle!</li>
            <li>After investing all my free time into finding the cause I was eventually came across Exederm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff is thicker and develops a rich lather.  </li>
            <li>I need to see suds to believe she is clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even started using the Exederm soap because I have been so dry this winter, and it has worked great for me.     </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been struggling for four months now and finally found a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&gt; (I specifically asked my pediatrician if it was ok to use on my 3 month old</li>
            <li>My almost three year old daughter has severe eczema and is allergic to many things.</li>
            <li>I generally don&#x27;t take the time to write a review for any products, even products that I genuinely love.</li>
            <li>Super gentle.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, I have tried many different products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I then researched the National Eczema Associations website and began to find better products which were Aveno extensive care, Cetaphyl, and Mustella.  </li>
            <li>literally could see an immediate difference within the first two days.</li>
            <li>I use California baby super sensitive sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a mental thing :-).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Its gentle and does not irritate his skin</li>
            <li>We first assumed it was an obvious food allergy that was causing his skin to break out, but after several stressful-waited formula trials; we were able to find a miracle in a can, Neocate, this hypo-allergenic milk that worked.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Do your own research, simply look at the ingredients and you&#x27;ll see what all these other products contain.</li>
            <li>I really do wish I could say this product worked for my 3 month old son but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Not having my skin bubble, crack, and split after a day of handwashing is well worth the extra money!</li>
            <li>My babies have pretty sensitive skin early on and this wash stopped the break outs and redness.  </li>
            <li>It is mild and didn&#x27;t dry his skin.  </li>
            <li>it was very drying to his skin, which is also a reason why I purchased it, was to help with his very dry skin &amp; hopefully find something that would not strip the moisture right out.</li>
            <li>He have had so many problems with other brands that we have tried and we always come back to Exederm.  </li>
            <li>It smells so much better than other soaps for babies with eczema and his eczema is totally under control.</li>
            <li>My 2 year old daughter has eczema.</li>
            <li>But this one is gentle but still cleanses thoroughly and actually lathers well</li>
            <li>I find that if I depress it very gently, the dripping is reduced.</li>
            <li>This product was made specifically and only to cater to those who suffer from Eczema, allergies,  dermatitis, sensitive skin, or those who simply don&#x27;t want to apply a whole pile of C*ap on their skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only thing I can wash my hands with that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eczema - which developed after I obsessively washed my hands in conventional handsoap while pregnant.</li>
            <li>Neocate is literally one of the most broken down baby formulas you can buy and not to mention very pricey.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Neocate is literally one of the most broken down baby formulas you can buy and not to mention very pricey.</li>
            <li> My son had eczema from his food allergies, and though he didn&#x27;t have sensitive skin, using this soap helped us rule out other causes.  </li>
            <li> Her irritation has decreased significantly by using this product plus the Intensive Baby Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My son has very sensitive skin, so I thought that with all the reviews &amp; some online research of safe products to use this would not be harsh on his skin, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for us.&lt;br /&gt;Other than the rash</li>
            <li> his skin is less sensitive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it is any different than the adult version of the body wash.</li>
            <li> me start off by saying my son is currently five months old and for the past three months he&#x27;s had severe eczema.</li>
            <li> It seems expensive for such a small bottle, but you really don&#x27;t need to use much, just one squirt for hair, face, hands, and bum!  </li>
            <li> Made my son&#x27;s skin extremely dry.</li>
            <li> It did have no fragrance or chemicals, but it&#x27;s too dry.....</li>
            <li> My daughter (2 years old) has had excema on her legs for at least a year, and we had tried all kinds of &amp;#34;soothing&amp;#34; washes and treatments, including products with shea &amp; coco butter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve told all my friends with children about it and a few have come back thanking me.     </li>
            <li> My only (very minor) complaint is that the dispenser does tend to drip.</li>
            <li> I read the ingredients and saw that it contained Almond oil along with some other oils in there that can irritate eczema.</li>
            <li> Also, just as a tip, be very careful about applying sunscreen to kids with eczema.</li>
            <li> (it isn&#x27;t watered down or greasy).</li>
            <li> I feel I have to use a lot less of it.</li>
            <li> Everything was making my little one&#x27;s eczema flare up</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few months</li>
            <li> Regular soap gives her hives and makes her eczema worse.</li>
            <li> I think two bottles lasted us a year and a half!  </li>
            <li> The very first bath with this product broke him out in such a horrible rash that I couldn&#x27;t use it again.</li>
            <li> This is all I use for my two year old who suffers from baby eczema.</li>
            <li> It has been hard for us to find solutions for her that are not prescriptions.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find this item at CVS</li>
            <li> His skin stopped inflating and slowly began to get lighter and lighter.</li>
            <li> At this point I had enough and immediately began to research eczema like a mad man.</li>
            <li> I have serious eczema on my hands which is aggravated by common soaps and cleaning products.</li>
            <li> , it goes on weird, it has a weird consistency, and all of the above.</li>
            <li> But a little bit expensive((</li>
            <li> He was miserable and constantly itching and crying.</li>
            <li> All these products contained some sort of oil, fragrance, or chemical that was harmful to my poor son&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been disappointed by Johnson&#x27;s, Aveno, Aquaphor, and every other company out there.</li>
            <li> The Cere Ve is very hard to get to lather and feels very thin.  </li>
            <li> For example neutrogena baby sensitive got a horrible rating and caused a breakout.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The dreadful and much hated eczema randomly began to populate the back of his thighs, both arms, cheeks, and the back of his ears.</li>
            <li> She seems to be so uncomfortable at times.</li>
            <li> It keeps my baby&#x27;s skin from drying out and it doesn&#x27;t have a weird smell to it.</li>
            <li> Our baby suffers from eczema and our pediatrician recommended we use the exederm oil in his bath which worked wonders</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s okay. It was better than nothing. I&#x27;m not sure it is any different than the adult version of the body wash. It was easy on my skin, During a time when I had a severe rash the baby bath did not cause any pain, itching or flare ups which was awesome. Now that the rash is gone I&#x27;ve switched back to Johnson&#x27;s Baby Head to Toe Wash.</li>
            <li> I tried a lot of different products on my son when I started bathing him, including aveeno eczema and mustela, and they all caused him to break out except this one. Now that he&#x27;s two his skin is less sensitive but I still use it. Great product. Also, just as a tip, be very careful about applying sunscreen to kids with eczema. For example neutrogena baby sensitive got a horrible rating and caused a breakout. I use California baby super sensitive sunscreen.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old daughter has eczema. It has been hard for us to find solutions for her that are not prescriptions. She seems to be so uncomfortable at times. Therefore, I have tried many different products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I saw this on the shelf at CVS and decided to give it a try. It WORKED. I wanted to throw a party.&lt;br /&gt;- This product and [[ASIN:B000YJ2SKM CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser, 12 Ounce]] are the only two washes I have found that work for her. I use the CeraVe baby wash &amp; shampoo or the regular one with no issues.&lt;br /&gt;- I like this product better because it lathers. CerVae does not lather. I need to see suds to believe she is clean. It&#x27;s a mental thing :-). This product also seems to moisturize better than the CeraVe alone. CeraVe does have a lotion.&lt;br /&gt;- Both the baby CeraVe and Exederm cost about the same. CeraVe baby wash at Wal-Mart is around $8 or $9 and Exederm at CVS is around $8 or $9. CeraVe often has coupons in my pediatrician&#x27;s office or the Sunday paper. It is hard to find this item at CVS so I would pay the $12 for it if I had to because it works.&lt;br /&gt;- I plan to try to shampoo next.</li>
            <li> I use this as a routine handwash. It&#x27;s the only thing I can wash my hands with that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eczema - which developed after I obsessively washed my hands in conventional handsoap while pregnant. Not having my skin bubble, crack, and split after a day of handwashing is well worth the extra money! I also wash my kid&#x27;s hands with this, too. My only (very minor) complaint is that the dispenser does tend to drip. I find that if I depress it very gently, the dripping is reduced.</li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t take the time to write a review for any products, even products that I genuinely love. However, for this product I will make an exception since I am overwhelmingly satisfied with the outcome and company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start off by saying my son is currently five months old and for the past three months he&#x27;s had severe eczema. We first assumed it was an obvious food allergy that was causing his skin to break out, but after several stressful-waited formula trials; we were able to find a miracle in a can, Neocate, this hypo-allergenic milk that worked. Neocate is literally one of the most broken down baby formulas you can buy and not to mention very pricey. So you could imagine my stress once my son&#x27;s eczema began to resurface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dreadful and much hated eczema randomly began to populate the back of his thighs, both arms, cheeks, and the back of his ears. He was miserable and constantly itching and crying. At this point I had enough and immediately began to research eczema like a mad man. After investing all my free time into finding the cause I was eventually came across Exederm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;ve tried every moisturizer, cream, oil, soap, shampoo, intensive moisturizer, and even ointment&#x27;s just to be upset over and over again. I&#x27;ve been disappointed by Johnson&#x27;s, Aveno, Aquaphor, and every other company out there. All these products contained some sort of oil, fragrance, or chemical that was harmful to my poor son&#x27;s skin. I then researched the National Eczema Associations website and began to find better products which were Aveno extensive care, Cetaphyl, and Mustella.  They all contained some sort of potentially harmful ingredient or irritant. Mustella seemed to be working the best, but then eventually irritated his eczema. I read the ingredients and saw that it contained Almond oil along with some other oils in there that can irritate eczema. I immediately stopped using Mustella (Which scored a 5/5 on the NEA website) and decidedto try the last product from the national Eczema association to score a 5/5, Exederm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I literally could see an immediate difference within the first two days. His skin stopped inflating and slowly began to get lighter and lighter. I&#x27;ve been applying the cream, using the soap, and using the bath oil. Within two weeks his eczema was almost non-existent. I&#x27;ve been struggling for four months now and finally found a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers and people will say this product doesn&#x27;t moisturize, it doesn&#x27;t feel good, it goes on weird, it has a weird consistency, and all of the above. That&#x27;s great, but this product wasn&#x27;t made to be the #1 moisturizer and it wasn&#x27;t made to be the perfect intensive hydrating formula. This product was made specifically and only to cater to those who suffer from Eczema, allergies,  dermatitis, sensitive skin, or those who simply don&#x27;t want to apply a whole pile of C*ap on their skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I can&#x27;t speak for everyone, but I can say for us this company has been a miracle. Do your own research, simply look at the ingredients and you&#x27;ll see what all these other products contain. Go to their websites and determine what best fits your baby&#x27;s needs (or yours). Visit, Exederm. com or the National Eczema Association to read what they are all about and then make your own judgmental decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have read this and you are a parent going through the same heart ache that I endured; TRY THIS PRODUCT OUT NOW! I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Everything was making my little one&#x27;s eczema flare up and she was scratching all the time. I discovered Exederm and it stopped. I&#x27;ve told all my friends with children about it and a few have come back thanking me.     I&#x27;ve even started using the Exederm soap because I have been so dry this winter, and it has worked great for me.     I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My son had eczema from his food allergies, and though he didn&#x27;t have sensitive skin, using this soap helped us rule out other causes.  It is mild and didn&#x27;t dry his skin.  It seems expensive for such a small bottle, but you really don&#x27;t need to use much, just one squirt for hair, face, hands, and bum!  I think two bottles lasted us a year and a half!  The squirt spout makes life alot easier too :)</li>
            <li> This soap is awesome.  We had to use it on my son when he was a baby and we still continue to buy it even now that he is 5 because it is the best stuff and it does not irritate his skin.  He have had so many problems with other brands that we have tried and we always come back to Exederm.  I really love this and all their products</li>
            <li> This is all I use for my two year old who suffers from baby eczema.I highly recommend this product. Its gentle and does not irritate his skin</li>
            <li> Made my son&#x27;s skin extremely dry. Used with exederm lotion</li>
            <li> I USE THIS BABY BATH FORMULA WHICH IS NON ALLERGENIC FOR A SHAMPOO, FINDING IT DOES NOT BOTHER MY SKIN ALLERGIES...IT IS WONDERFUL ON THE HAIR, AND COMPLETELY SATISFIES ME AS A SHAMPOO...I AM AN ELDERLY MAN.</li>
            <li> Okay.. Plan on returning it. It doesn&#x27;t work as well as described and feels a bit greasy.... Smells good though!</li>
            <li> this product has been great for my son with eczema, it really is gentle and does not flare up his skin issues.</li>
            <li> Very nice, gentle baby bath. I&#x27;m not a baby but have a present skin condition and it cleans without aggravating the condition.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few months and I love it. It keeps my baby&#x27;s skin from drying out and it doesn&#x27;t have a weird smell to it. I&#x27;ll be purchasing more when I run out of this one.&lt;br /&gt; (I specifically asked my pediatrician if it was ok to use on my 3 month old and she recommended it)</li>
            <li> I really do wish I could say this product worked for my 3 month old son but it didn&#x27;t. The very first bath with this product broke him out in such a horrible rash that I couldn&#x27;t use it again. My son has very sensitive skin, so I thought that with all the reviews &amp; some online research of safe products to use this would not be harsh on his skin, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for us.&lt;br /&gt;Other than the rash it was very drying to his skin, which is also a reason why I purchased it, was to help with his very dry skin &amp; hopefully find something that would not strip the moisture right out.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. Our baby suffers from eczema and our pediatrician recommended we use the exederm oil in his bath which worked wonders so we decided to try the soap and we fell in love. It smells so much better than other soaps for babies with eczema and his eczema is totally under control.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work to relieve my 13 month olds itchy skin. I used this in conjunction with the shampoo and lotion and I didn&#x27;t see a difference. Wish there was a 30 day money back guarantee.</li>
            <li> Great for my daughter&#x27;s ecxema.  Super gentle.  Wish it were cheaper.</li>
            <li> I use this soap for every day baby morning hygiene and after stool too. Very mild good soap. But a little bit expensive((</li>
            <li> Amazing. My sons eczema cleared in 2 days with this and the cream! We tried everything before and nothing helped. This is easy and not 100 products and works. Love it!</li>
            <li> I had been using Cere Ve Baby, but picked this up.  This does not say it is a shampoo, and says to keep out of the eyes, two limitations that Cere Ve Baby doesn&#x27;t have.  On the plus, this eczema soap actually feels like soap.  The Cere Ve is very hard to get to lather and feels very thin.  This stuff is thicker and develops a rich lather.  I feel I have to use a lot less of it.</li>
            <li> This product is kinda OK,not as well as I think actually. It did have no fragrance or chemicals, but it&#x27;s too dry..... His hair feels so unsmooth after shower......</li>
            <li> This baby bath is great. My daughter (2 years old) has had excema on her legs for at least a year, and we had tried all kinds of &amp;#34;soothing&amp;#34; washes and treatments, including products with shea &amp; coco butter. But this one is gentle but still cleanses thoroughly and actually lathers well (it isn&#x27;t watered down or greasy). Her irritation has decreased significantly by using this product plus the Intensive Baby Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have been using Exederm as a hand soap at home for a while now and am pleased with the result. I have serious eczema on my hands which is aggravated by common soaps and cleaning products. When I use Exederm, in combination with always using gloves to wash dishes/clean, drinking lots of water and avoiding prolonged contact with water, my hand are eczema-free.</li>
            <li> My almost three year old daughter has severe eczema and is allergic to many things. Regular soap gives her hives and makes her eczema worse. This soap was recommended by her allergist, and is AMAZING. It doesn&#x27;t irritate her skin. YEA! It also doesn&#x27;t sting the open wounds from scratching.</li>
            <li> Best product for kids with eczema. Nice lather and good price for high quality product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for two of my babies so far and it has been great!  My babies have pretty sensitive skin early on and this wash stopped the break outs and redness.  It rinses easily which I love and is very gentle!</li>
