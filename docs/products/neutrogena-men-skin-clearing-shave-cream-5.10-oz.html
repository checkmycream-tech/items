            <li>Been using this for years, excellent product for</li>
            <li>This is a great shave cream.</li>

            <li>price was good but the shipping Great.</li>
            <li>everytime I shave to make sure i&#x27;m getting the best result.</li>
            <li>I switched to gel using Bald Guyz which I thought was good, but when I tried Neutrogena, I was blown away.      </li>
            <li>After shaving and rinsing, your skin feels good, there is no razor burn or irritation.  </li>
            <li>The scent is fresh and best of all my face feels well moisterized and not oily afterward.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did!     </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>It seems to form a nice barrier between the razor and skin, but in actuality it does not.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice, but is not helping at all with bumps and ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>I was using this product a lot, i&#x27;m 17 if that gives you an idea of what kind of acne and hair</li>
            <li>My husband happens to have sensitive yet oily skin, so this was perfect.</li>
            <li>So far this has been the best product I have used period!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving my head and beard for over 5 years and have tried just about everything under the sun to improve and better my shaving experience.  </li>

            <li>This is my favorite shave cream out there.</li>

            <li>to use more than the recommended amount</li>
            <li>Like most men, I&#x27;ve tried dozens of products like this one.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>Is it better than Edge?</li>
            <li>and I am 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li>Edge gel is better and cheaper.  </li>
            <li>It works well also, but can be a bit more time consuming.</li>
            <li>This product did what it&#x27;s suppose to and more.</li>
            <li>Because I don&#x27;t let it grow out for more then 4 days</li>
            <li>It has been the best of the many, many, gel and skin lotion types that I have tried over the years, and I wish I had known about it long before I read this recommendation.  </li>
            <li>and it seemed to have a nice clean scent.  </li>
            <li>Great product, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>it did a pretty good job protecting my face while shaving.  </li>

            <li>It goes on smooth, but does not feel greasy or oily.  </li>
            <li>After trying it for a month of Sundays now I can say this stuff is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Using this product requires a different approach, but produces as good or better results.</li>
            <li>and I have a clean smooth have.</li>
            <li>We both use the Neutrogena rainbath and love it, so I know their products are gentle and yet clean.</li>
            <li>I was really hopeful this product would help me more, but after 3 tubes I can say I won&#x27;t be buying anymore.</li>

            <li>I gave this a good, thourough test by using 3 tubes over several months and trying it with different brands of razors.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used three different types, and Neutrogena Men&#x27;s Skin Clearing Shave Cream is my favorite by far!     </li>

            <li> This is the first that soothes when it goes on, causes absolutely no irritation, and yet doesn&#x27;t leave an oil slick on my face later.</li>

            <li> No wonder his skin was so dry.</li>
            <li> His skin doesn&#x27;t look dry anymore either.</li>
            <li> Also, as one reviewer already wrote, this cream does clog the razor very much and that is frustrating.    </li>
            <li> This stuff is expensive and won&#x27;t last very long because of how much you have to use per shave.</li>
            <li> This shaving cream choice came from a recommendation from a reviewer of shaving creams for wet type electric shavers.  </li>
            <li> I bought a tube of this at Walmart for $3.50, but did not really understand how to use it.  </li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical becase it didn&#x27;t lather</li>
            <li> Badger brush is a big part of the shaving experience for me, and maybe a waste a little with each use, but whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick enough as it stands, but you can also spread it by rubbing it into your face with splash of water.</li>
            <li> After some research I determined it was a brushless cream, and a little bit does the job.  </li>
            <li> You also should add a little water to your hands when applying this, since it helps with the slipperiness.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick facial hair</li>
            <li> A friend that has been using a DE razor plus shaving soap/brush for decades leaves his soap/brush at home when on trips, since he feels it&#x27;s too messy while traveling.</li>
            <li> Whatever the science of it, I always end up with about 5 nicks and a raw face.  </li>
            <li> Several reviewers and those on other sites think this product is bad because it does not create a thick lather.  </li>
            <li> Maybe if you are using one of those dumb quadruple blade cartilage razors, it would get clogged up.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for products that will make shaving easier and less painful, and this shave cream is now at the bottom of the stack under my sink.  </li>
            <li> It was painful and unattractive nonetheless.</li>
            <li> I was appalled.</li>

            <li> I bought this for my husband after actually watching him use bacterial HAND SOAP for shaving one day?! I was appalled. No wonder his skin was so dry. UGH! Anyways, I promptly went out and found this stuff. We both use the Neutrogena rainbath and love it, so I know their products are gentle and yet clean. My husband happens to have sensitive yet oily skin, so this was perfect. He really likes it and is actually using it and not our hand soap anymore. Plus it has a nice subtle scent without being too perfumey or manly. Just smells clean! His skin doesn&#x27;t look dry anymore either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my head and beard for over 5 years and have tried just about everything under the sun to improve and better my shaving experience.  I&#x27;ve went from using foam to soap to gel using a countless number of razor brands.  I switched to gel using Bald Guyz which I thought was good, but when I tried Neutrogena, I was blown away.      At first I was skeptical becase it didn&#x27;t lather and it kinda seemed like nothing was on my face, but I gave it a try and now I&#x27;m hooked!  For so long, I have been used to having to see some sort of foam or gel on my face.  So far this has been the best product I have used period! I&#x27;m am an african-american who shaves every morning who use to dread shaving, but now, I look forward to it!  It leaves my skin clean and soft which my wife digs.  So for now, I use Neutrogena shave cream (which you can buy from target or wal-mart for about 3 bucks now) and Shick \\&quot;QUATRO\\&quot; Razor.     The only thing that irks me is the fact that it clogs my razor more than any other gel I tried, but you get use to it...</li>
            <li> If you have ingrown beard hair(Pseudofolliculitis)this shaving cream really works. You do not have to use a lot on your face. A thin film over your beard creates a smooth barrier between your skin and the razor. I use a Bump Fighter razor [[ASIN:B0002MSGWU Bump Fighter Razor And Refill Cartidges - 1 Ea]] and this shaving cream. This razor and shaving cream has worked for me.</li>
            <li> For most of my life I have been using an electric razor, and I only stopped because I can&#x27;t afford the replacement blades.  So I went out and bought a cheap old style (single double-edged blade) gillette safety razor from a antique shop, some new Astra blades, and grabbed some of this shaving cream because I&#x27;ve had good experience with that brand.  Even though I have not bought anything else that I can use to compare this too, I think I can safely say I have no reason to switch. In response to another reviewer... Maybe if you are using one of those dumb quadruple blade cartilage razors, it would get clogged up.  But since I don&#x27;t use one with this product, it works fine for me.  I love how it makes my skin feel afterword.    Try a oldschool razor sometime.  [[ASIN:B000850C32 Merkur Classic Hefty Safety Razor, Open]]</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shave cream out there. I don&#x27;t get much acne so I can&#x27;t testify to the skin clearing part but after shaving it makes my skin feel awesome. This is the only product I use and the only one I&#x27;ll keep using if they keep making it, which I hope they do. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I recently switched from using an electric razor to a \\&quot;straight-up one\\&quot; as I like to call them, and because of that, I had to use shaving cream of course. I&#x27;ve used three different types, and Neutrogena Men&#x27;s Skin Clearing Shave Cream is my favorite by far!     Before I purchased this product, I wanted to know how well it works on sensative skin, and when I saw the reviews for it that mensioned it works well, I decided to give it a shot. I&#x27;m so glad I did!     As an African American, I think my skin has a tendency to be more sensative, and this shaving cream works vary well with it! In fact, I don&#x27;t remember getting any kind of irritation after using it!     The only downside is the amount in the tube. 5.1 ounces gets used up real quick. LOL!     Still, it&#x27;s deffinetly worth it, especially if you have sensative skin!</li>
            <li> This is the best shaving cream I have ever used.  It goes on smooth, but does not feel greasy or oily.  It feels as if it forms a barrier between your skin and the razor, but lets the razor give you a close shave.  After shaving and rinsing, your skin feels good, there is no razor burn or irritation.  I don&#x27;t get any acne, ingrown hairs, or shaving bumps after sing this product.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;-Provides a very slick surface when applied and makes shaving much easier&lt;br /&gt;-Does not irritate the face after use&lt;br /&gt;-Leaves skin very smooth and does not dry it out&lt;br /&gt;-Excellent if you are prone to rashes or sensitive to harsher shaving creams&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;-At first feels like there is nothing on your skin (does not create noticeable lather)&lt;br /&gt;-Need to use more than the recommended amount</li>
            <li> Like most men, I&#x27;ve tried dozens of products like this one. This is the first that soothes when it goes on, causes absolutely no irritation, and yet doesn&#x27;t leave an oil slick on my face later. I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.  I wear a shaved head style.  I would not use anything else but Neutrogent Skin Clearing Shave Cream.  I plan on purchasing the Neutrogena Skin Clearing After Shave Lotion.</li>
            <li> Although it says \\&quot;Low Foam Formula\\&quot; on the product description, I didn&#x27;t imagine that it would barely lather up. Basically, the way it applied to my skin is exactly like a lotion. I had to use tons to get full facial coverage. This stuff is expensive and won&#x27;t last very long because of how much you have to use per shave. Is it better than Edge? Yes, but it is not cost efficient.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the claim that it helps to prevent bumps, irritation, and ingrown hairs.  I&#x27;ve suffered with all of those throughout my adult life.  This product goes on nice and smooth and it isn&#x27;t foamy or thick, which is fine with me.  It seems to form a nice barrier between the razor and skin, but in actuality it does not.  I still end up with several cuts and many ingrown hairs.  I gave this a good, thourough test by using 3 tubes over several months and trying it with different brands of razors.  I saw zero improvement in my complexion.  Also, as one reviewer already wrote, this cream does clog the razor very much and that is frustrating.    I was really hopeful this product would help me more, but after 3 tubes I can say I won&#x27;t be buying anymore.</li>
            <li> It may work to clear up bumps, but it&#x27;s is a bit irritating and doesn&#x27;t really get my face slippery enough for a good close shave.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, but is not helping at all with bumps and ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> This product seems to be helping my skin, minimizing acne and irritation from shaving. I use this with a DE razor and a badger brush, even though the instructions say to apply it straight to your face. Badger brush is a big part of the shaving experience for me, and maybe a waste a little with each use, but whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish they offered this in a lather. It&#x27;s tough to know my face is sufficiently covered, and for that reason I tend to use more than recommended.</li>
            <li> I only use a razor and cream once a week (Sundays) to deal with my weekend beard.  During the work week I use an electric shaver.  I used to use Gillette Edge because they have (or had?) an unscented version.  Strange as it seems almost all shaving creams have a scent that makes me nauesous.  The unscented Edge was the only shave gel/cream I could  tolerate and it did a pretty good job protecting my face while shaving.  Suddenly I can&#x27;t find the unscented Edge on my store self anymore, so I start looking around the shelf for an alternative.  This Neutrogena shaving cream caught my eye.  A quick whif and it seemed to have a nice clean scent.  After trying it for a month of Sundays now I can say this stuff is fantastic.  A small amount coats my face evenly with a lubricating layer that completely protects skin and allows shaving in any direction for several passes without reapplication. No silly foam and the results are a nice close shave.  The scent is fresh and best of all my face feels well moisterized and not oily afterward.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for more really.  Great product, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Was using a much more expensive after-shave skin cream and found this product to work just as well at 1/4 of the price.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 3 months now.  I noticed my skin has less irritation and feels comfortable.  It also minimizes acne pores.</li>
            <li> This cream doesnt lather up. They have the gel version for that. I used to use Gillette, Edge even Aveeno shave gels before this. My issue was that I always developed ingrown hairs around the neck area below my chin, sometimes so bad that I developed huge pimples. It was painful and unattractive nonetheless. I bought this at walmart on an impulsive buy. I read the label that said minimizes ingrown hairs and decided to give it a shot. Well I have been using it for 2 weeks now and I am 100% satisfied. I no longer get ingrown hairs along my neck area and I have a clean smooth have. It definitely works, more than I expected it to and very fast. I am speaking of the shave cream version. Its about 5 bucks at Walmart. Give it a shot next time you buy some shave cream and compare. You have nothing to lose. My bet is that it will work for you too.</li>
            <li> This is a great shave cream. I&#x27;ve been using women&#x27;s shave gel for years since I had to use it once on leave (for lack of options) and found out how much richer it is. I&#x27;m black, so a thicker shave gel is worth the looks I get for using what is obviously a woman&#x27;s product. Until this. It&#x27;s thick enough as it stands, but you can also spread it by rubbing it into your face with splash of water. A perk of creams that gels don&#x27;t do nearly as well. I use this with Gillette Fusion cooling lotion and my face thanks me  :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t agree with all the hype.  I&#x27;m always looking for products that will make shaving easier and less painful, and this shave cream is now at the bottom of the stack under my sink.  Is it just my skin?  I don&#x27;t think so.  The cream doesn&#x27;t go on easily--not smooth and rich--it&#x27;s kind of like cold cream and it never warms up, AND it clogs up the razor something fierce.  Whatever the science of it, I always end up with about 5 nicks and a raw face.  Edge gel is better and cheaper.  Zirh shave cream is better and more expensive.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this anywhere and is a must for my skin type.&lt;br /&gt;The price was good but the shipping Great.</li>
            <li> This shaving cream choice came from a recommendation from a reviewer of shaving creams for wet type electric shavers.  It has been the best of the many, many, gel and skin lotion types that I have tried over the years, and I wish I had known about it long before I read this recommendation.  I bought this from Amazon, but I have since noted that it is also available at my local CVS pharmacy store along with a different Neutrogena Men Skin Clearing Shave Cream that is featured for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I bought a tube of this at Walmart for $3.50, but did not really understand how to use it.  After some research I determined it was a brushless cream, and a little bit does the job.  They recommend a quarter size amount, but I used a quarter plus a nickel size (for my second pass).  It should last a while at that rate.  Several reviewers and those on other sites think this product is bad because it does not create a thick lather.  Using this product requires a different approach, but produces as good or better results. You also should add a little water to your hands when applying this, since it helps with the slipperiness.  I recently returned to using a double edge razor after about 25 years away from it.  I also having been learning to use shaving soap and a brush. It works well also, but can be a bit more time consuming. I will now be using this brushless cream and the soap/brush methods off and on for a while to continue comparing, but may take the brushless cream with me when we are traveling for the convenience. A friend that has been using a DE razor plus shaving soap/brush for decades leaves his soap/brush at home when on trips, since he feels it&#x27;s too messy while traveling.</li>
            <li> This product did what it&#x27;s suppose to and more. It not only cleared up and shrunk the pimples, but it also stopped ingrown hair from occurring. Also, just a heads up this is a gel, it does not turn into a foam(attests for me) I have very thick facial hair and I use a razor. But I switch my ravor everytime I shave to make sure i&#x27;m getting the best result. Because I don&#x27;t let it grow out for more then 4 days I was using this product a lot, i&#x27;m 17 if that gives you an idea of what kind of acne and hair I have. Hope it works great for you!</li>
            <li> Been using this for years, excellent product for when I razor shave. No irritation or bumps. Would recomment to anyone sensitive to razor shaving.</li>
