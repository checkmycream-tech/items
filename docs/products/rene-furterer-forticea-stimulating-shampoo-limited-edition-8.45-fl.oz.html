            <li>Best shampoo ever.</li>
            <li>Great!</li>
            <li>A great cleansing shampoo, but I didn&#x27;t find it \\&quot;stimulating\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I did not notice stimulation, however I do use Rene stimulating oil which is a great product.</li>
            <li>If it is working, great...</li>
            <li>Perfect for a healthy hair.</li>
            <li>Good for both male/female adults.</li>
            <li>You do need to have a good conditioner</li>
            <li>The shampoo is excellent and makes my hair shiny and full of volume and body.  </li>
            <li>Smells wonderful and leaves your hair quite full</li>
            <li>it does not create lots of bubbles, but that is a good thing!  very gentle on hair, smells great and nourishes your hair.</li>
            <li>Clean in a good way too!</li>
            <li>Best brand used so far!!!</li>
            <li>I have very fine, slippery hair.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo as it helps me with my scalp psoriasis.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>The shampoo was refreshing but after using it for about 2 months I started to develop dandruff.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, like orange.</li>
            <li>Each morning even before I do anything to my hair, I see my bathroom tiles with a lot more lose hair than before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a believer in any &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; that will somehow magically dissolve all these problems.</li>
            <li>But I still love this shampoo:</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite line of hair care products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made my hair more dense and scalp healthier.</li>
            <li>I love Rene Furterer and will continue using the line of products.</li>
            <li>Good product and decent price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to do an update on how this shampoo will help me in the coming weeks, but now I am considering the huge bottle to purchase when this baby runs out.</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t buy conditioners to add body any more, as this adds just the right amount.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s good for an occasional cleansing shampoo.  </li>
            <li>but if they do not work as good as this,&lt;br /&gt;I am going back to this.</li>
            <li>It is effective especially on conjunction with Rene Furterer Complexe 5 Regenerating Extract.</li>
            <li>Not extremely dry to the point of flakes, but it really feels that good just after my first use (about 30 minutes ago).</li>
            <li>With long, fine, old hair, anything that adds body is good.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much either, definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>The tubes on this special sale edition are not as nice as the usual packaging.</li>
            <li>(I have slightly oily hair) and smells amazing.  </li>
            <li>I used to have a LOT of fine hair, but it started thinning when my thyroid began acting up.</li>
            <li>Feels like it&#x27;s really stimulating  my scalp .</li>
            <li>To stimulate and remove impurities in your scalp which can be responsible for hair loss.  </li>
            <li>After one wash, my hair had twice as much volume and something else new to me: texture!</li>
            <li>Made my hair grow very long and my hair feels way clean with</li>
            <li>It makes my hair really soft but didn&#x27;t really do what I thought was supposed to.</li>
            <li>After a few days I noticed I had more hair</li>
            <li>and I honestly recommend this product even though it is bit expensive but is it worth it.</li>
            <li>It leaves the hair looking clear and shiny without any residual color tint.</li>
            <li>Wow, I haven&#x27;t used this line in years and after being reintroduced I wish I never stopped.  </li>
            <li>Not sure which is doing most of the work, but my hair is actually getting thicker.</li>
            <li>My hairs got thin and used this for better comforts.</li>

            <li> Not sure if  it works to prevent it, but never got thinner since...</li>
            <li> I always had healthy hair so all this change was devastating.</li>

            <li> The caps are very difficult to open.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> It makes my hair really soft but didn&#x27;t really do what I thought was supposed to.</li>
            <li> Product was everything I was looking for!!! very happy!!</li>
            <li> The shampoo is excellent and makes my hair shiny and full of volume and body.  The tubes on this special sale edition are not as nice as the usual packaging. The caps are very difficult to open.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, slippery hair. I used to have a LOT of fine hair, but it started thinning when my thyroid began acting up. After one wash, my hair had twice as much volume and something else new to me: texture! I follow the directions on the bottle and have received the same results every wash. It doesn&#x27;t take much either, definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Good for both male/female adults. My hairs got thin and used this for better comforts. Not sure if  it works to prevent it, but never got thinner since...</li>
            <li> I have purchased this shampoo several times for myself and family members as well. Bottom line for me, it works, you just have to follow the instructions and use it as instructed. After a few days I noticed I had more hair and it was not as thin as before. It also stop falling. I have kept the results in my hair and I have not it used it in months. I did combine the shampoo with complex 5 oil and my hair grew faster and thicker. I always get compliments from people saying I have a lot of hair and I honestly recommend this product even though it is bit expensive but is it worth it.</li>
            <li> Wow, I haven&#x27;t used this line in years and after being reintroduced I wish I never stopped.  It cleans your hair thoroughly (I have slightly oily hair) and smells amazing.  Not sure what the little beads are supposed to do, but I don&#x27;t mind them.  Does this help thinning hair?  In my case I can say yes it does (along with the occasional use of Complex 5).  Not sure which is doing most of the work, but my hair is actually getting thicker.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo ever. Smells wonderful and leaves your hair quite full</li>
            <li> A great cleansing shampoo, but I didn&#x27;t find it \\&quot;stimulating\\&quot;.  It is promoted as a shampoo for thinning hair.  Unless your thinning hair is due to clogged pores on your scalp, or lots of dandruff, I don&#x27;t think this will work.  But it&#x27;s good for an occasional cleansing shampoo.  I won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.  Feels like it&#x27;s really stimulating  my scalp . Has little  beads in it. Hope it helps my thinning  hair..</li>
            <li> it does not create lots of bubbles, but that is a good thing!  very gentle on hair, smells great and nourishes your hair.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo as it helps me with my scalp psoriasis. It is effective especially on conjunction with Rene Furterer Complexe 5 Regenerating Extract.</li>
            <li> I love it and I buy it second time now</li>
            <li> With long, fine, old hair, anything that adds body is good. But this does it in a way that does not weigh the hair down. Now I don&#x27;t buy conditioners to add body any more, as this adds just the right amount. It leaves the hair looking clear and shiny without any residual color tint.</li>
            <li> Good product and decent price.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.  It does not strip the color if you have color treated hair.  You do need to have a good conditioner and I use WEN 619.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo does give your hair body.  I did not notice stimulation, however I do use Rene stimulating oil which is a great product.</li>
            <li> Made my hair grow very long and my hair feels way clean with it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m currently trying cheaper alternatives but if they do not work as good as this,&lt;br /&gt;I am going back to this.</li>
            <li> I think this works, yet I&#x27;m afraid to stop using it. If it is working, great...if it&#x27;s not....s***!</li>
            <li> Use this shampoo after treating your scalp with Rene Furtere Complex 5 Regenerating Extract.  To stimulate and remove impurities in your scalp which can be responsible for hair loss.  Then after you towel dry hair treat scalp with RF80.</li>
            <li> The shampoo was refreshing but after using it for about 2 months I started to develop dandruff. Once I stopped using the Shampoo and conditioner the dandruff stopped. While I was using it I did feel my hair getting a bit healthier and strengthening. It might work for some people and not others.</li>
            <li> Great! I love the smell, like orange. And for stimulating, it seems to begin its fuction.&lt;br /&gt;And this edition is cost-effective.</li>
            <li> Perfect for a healthy hair. Best brand used so far!!!</li>
            <li> Its never easy to shop for shampoo when your scalp is oily and your hair is dry. Since I turned 30 (currently +3), my hair&#x27;s never the same: my scalp feels greasier and warmer as days go by, not to mention the thinning hair that gets tangled up at ends. I always had healthy hair so all this change was devastating. And yes, I am losing hair like there&#x27;s no tomorrow. Each morning even before I do anything to my hair, I see my bathroom tiles with a lot more lose hair than before. I read a lot of reviews before purchasing this shampoo. I&#x27;m not a believer in any &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; that will somehow magically dissolve all these problems. But I still love this shampoo: why? My scalp never felt cleaner! Clean in a good way too! Not extremely dry to the point of flakes, but it really feels that good just after my first use (about 30 minutes ago). I&#x27;m going to do an update on how this shampoo will help me in the coming weeks, but now I am considering the huge bottle to purchase when this baby runs out.</li>
            <li> I have been using Rene Furterer on and off for years. It&#x27;s my favorite line of hair care products. They do what they say, all without using harmful ingredients. Fortecia has done just that for me! It&#x27;s made my hair more dense and scalp healthier. I love Rene Furterer and will continue using the line of products.</li>
            <li> Received promptly and item was as described.</li>
    </ol>
