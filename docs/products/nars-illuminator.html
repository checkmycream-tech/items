            <li>I am absolutely in love with this!</li>
            <li>Great product....creates a super look!</li>
            <li>Amazing glow and edge</li>
            <li>This product seemed like it&#x27;d be nice</li>
            <li>I use it on my cheek bones and it gives a nice glow</li>
            <li>This product was her \\&quot;secret\\&quot; and I purchased my own.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice scent to it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have any kind of color to it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really great color, not too dark or bright, and it has the perfect amount of shimmer.</li>
            <li>The color is very becoming on everyone.  </li>
            <li>This is a really great and quick step in my make up process.  </li>
            <li>I love to wear it over my foundation, which creates a nice dewy look.</li>
            <li>honestly I wasn&#x27;t exactly sure what this product was or what it did :-)</li>
            <li>I will say that the product looks great on my 13 year old, fair skinned daughter.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very, very light when I put it on.  </li>
            <li>The best part about this, is its multiple uses.</li>
            <li>It gives you that dewey, healthy glow.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Also never put this on top of powders.</li>
            <li>I know the instructions say it can be worn on top of makeup but not powder makeup like blush.</li>
            <li>Give it a shot, it really is lovely</li>
            <li>Nars Orgasm powder blush is my all time favorite blush.</li>
            <li>This product is so watery, the powder blush I have shows up so much better,  </li>
            <li>This stuff is ok.</li>
            <li>After you top it with foundation, it does fade and leave a dewey look and feel.</li>
            <li>must have/best thing on earth product as so many reviewers have said.</li>
            <li>I think this is a much better highlighter than Albatross (which is a staple still)</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love this product the color will work well on any skin tone.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is not a highlighter for me because I was looking for something more noticeable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the powder orgasm blush for awhile now and love it.  </li>
            <li>I love to wear this illuminator in the sumer with my tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I love this face cream.</li>
            <li>I usually love all Nars products, but this was just watery and didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; anything.  </li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my skin glow.</li>
            <li>I will be getting more and using this product always.</li>
            <li>The gel blush looks great on her, very natural!  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll enjoy it more once I&#x27;m more tan</li>
            <li>I was SOOOO surprised when I received this product after all the GREAT reviews I had read....</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great in place of complete foundation if you&#x27;re in a hurry or just dashing out of this house.</li>
            <li>I use it at the top of my cheeks and inside the corner of my eye to add a bit of light.</li>
            <li>and I blush easily,</li>
            <li>This will be a staple of mine for years to come - strongly recommend.</li>
            <li>I liked this product alot when i first tried it in sephora</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just a very light golden shimmer to wherever you apply it.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy and instantly creates a nice, warm glow.</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
            <li>A silky smooth all in one product.</li>
            <li>Feels light on my face and gives me the glow that I am after.</li>
            <li>I use a cream foundation with a light bronzer</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit more pink than shown in the picture, but that&#x27;s fine with me because I use this on my cheekbones and it gives you that perfect \\&quot;dewy\\&quot; natural glow.</li>
            <li>I was really excited about this illuminator because of all the rave reviews I saw.</li>
            <li>Looks good on everyone which is why they are constantly sold out at Sephora!</li>
            <li>Looks good if you are just running out of the house with no makeup on if you don&#x27;t mind breaking out a day later.</li>
            <li>I live in Guayaquil-Ecuador, where we have a very hot and humid weather, so my skin tends to get greasy easily, so maybe that&#x27;s why I haven&#x27;t been able to use this product.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and  would order this product again.</li>
            <li>Its okay, the color is pretty but it makes me look shiny sometimes, its also pretty pricy</li>
            <li>My new favorite makeup.</li>
            <li>I think it only looked really good when I first applied it because I was standing under the bathroom light.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>This make up goes on smooth and blends in very well.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It is lighter than expected but that is a good thing.</li>
            <li>I love to use it just to get a natural look on my face like going to the beach for a fresh look.</li>
            <li>just right.    </li>
            <li>Goes over my sunscreen and gives you the dewy look that is in right now.     </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect to use on its own as a sheer illuminating blush especially during the day, but for a more dramatic look in the evening I sweep just a touch of bronzer/blush over it</li>
            <li>but you&#x27;ll quickly get the hang of how much to use).  </li>
            <li>Wow, with all of the rage surrounding this product I really thought I was going to LOVE it.</li>
            <li>You get a slight dewy look when you apply it, which I really liked, but throughout the rest of the day I noticed that unless you are standing under a light at just the right angle, it isn&#x27;t really noticeable.</li>
            <li>As I have light skin I can just wear this without blush and it gives me a natural pearly flush.</li>
            <li>Brightens skin, no need to follow with makeup, product works exactly as stated.  </li>
            <li>this is my first time using an illuminator, and the orgasm shade seems to do the trick well.</li>
            <li>This is the first product that ever burned my skin.  </li>
            <li>.......I like how subtle it is and it looks great over my makeup</li>
            <li>It adds a light shimmer and a little flush to your color (especially if you are fair skinned like me).</li>
            <li>Youll never look like a clown, or overdone in any way only fresh ,innocent dewey and natural.</li>
            <li>Not really what I expected after all the great reviews.  </li>
            <li>It is the high lighter that I have wanted for FOREVER!     </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like powder highlighters</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>This really does illuminate your skin.</li>
            <li>I initially saw this product and felt it would be too light and ashy for my skin tone</li>
            <li>but it really does make my darker skin glow.</li>
            <li>but as a highlight or layered over blush really makes everything pop.</li>
            <li>I really like this illuminator.</li>
            <li>There was so much hype about the colour Orgasm</li>
            <li>so I bought one to try, Don&#x27;t really like the consistency, a bit too watery for my liking.</li>
            <li>I do love high beam, but this contains nearly twice as much for similar price.     </li>
            <li>so I really don&#x27;t want a product that would make my face even more pink!</li>
            <li>but when I received it and tried it, it is nothing better than your average highlighter.</li>
            <li>But when I recently visited a cousin, she had such a lovely glow to her face</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a liquid high lighter that is not sticky or over powering but</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>If your makeup is looking flat, dull &amp; dry, this is the perfect product to brighten your face without overdoing it!</li>
            <li>I live in warmer weather</li>
            <li>I guess I will have to make it work until it&#x27;s done, or try to find new ways to use it.</li>
            <li>It only takes a little bit, to make a nice glow and enhance your natural looks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a tad dark for my skin tone, as I&#x27;m very fair, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>When you first put it on it will make your face red.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get this and couldn&#x27;t wait to try other out</li>
            <li>Use a tiny dab and mix it with your foundation (you may use too much or not enough at first</li>
            <li>was so excited to finally order and receive a product i had heard about for so long....</li>
            <li>Probably this will work better on cold weathers where it&#x27;s a must to have a product to bring light and moisture to the skin.</li>
            <li>For natural glowing skin try this product from NARS.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face with a supple, natural glow.</li>
            <li>Not heavy.</li>
            <li>Not opaque enough to really make a difference</li>
            <li>Also, I have a naturally pinkish skin</li>
            <li>Adds a soft, natural glow.</li>
            <li>Young, old, brunette, blond and redheads</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t wear this product now because I&#x27;m really pale and it shows up more red.</li>
            <li>The container given is a huge amount compared to what you need, but thats the beauty of NARS, a little bit goes a long way and you really won&#x27;t ever run out.</li>
            <li>I love the subtle look this provides.</li>
            <li>Love the subtle glow it gives</li>
            <li>(Though not enough to write off the high price tag).</li>
            <li>and I wanted something that would be light enough to accentuate without feeling heavy in the heat.</li>
            <li>- it is a very flattering glow rather than adding pink to your skin.</li>
            <li>I like the way it looks (pretty sheer) when I have just applied it, but doesn&#x27;t last long on my skin.</li>
            <li>It leaves a slight ring of color that you really have to spend time smoothing out and evening into your skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too much nor too little.</li>
            <li>Ordering make up online is always a risk because if you&#x27;re not familiar with the product than you don&#x27;t really know what you&#x27;re getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Feels light on my face and gives me the glow that I am after.</li>
            <li> I use a cream foundation with a light bronzer</li>

            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It is lighter than expected but that is a good thing.</li>
            <li> I love to use it just to get a natural look on my face like going to the beach for a fresh look.</li>
            <li> just right.    </li>
            <li> Goes over my sunscreen and gives you the dewy look that is in right now.     </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect to use on its own as a sheer illuminating blush especially during the day, but for a more dramatic look in the evening I sweep just a touch of bronzer/blush over it</li>
            <li> but you&#x27;ll quickly get the hang of how much to use).  </li>
            <li> Wow, with all of the rage surrounding this product I really thought I was going to LOVE it.</li>
            <li> You get a slight dewy look when you apply it, which I really liked, but throughout the rest of the day I noticed that unless you are standing under a light at just the right angle, it isn&#x27;t really noticeable.</li>
            <li> As I have light skin I can just wear this without blush and it gives me a natural pearly flush.</li>
            <li> Brightens skin, no need to follow with makeup, product works exactly as stated.  </li>
            <li> this is my first time using an illuminator, and the orgasm shade seems to do the trick well.</li>
            <li> This is the first product that ever burned my skin.  </li>
            <li> .......I like how subtle it is and it looks great over my makeup</li>
            <li> It adds a light shimmer and a little flush to your color (especially if you are fair skinned like me).</li>
            <li> Youll never look like a clown, or overdone in any way only fresh ,innocent dewey and natural.</li>
            <li> Not really what I expected after all the great reviews.  </li>
            <li> It is the high lighter that I have wanted for FOREVER!     </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like powder highlighters</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> This really does illuminate your skin.</li>
            <li> I initially saw this product and felt it would be too light and ashy for my skin tone</li>
            <li> but it really does make my darker skin glow.</li>
            <li> but as a highlight or layered over blush really makes everything pop.</li>
            <li> I really like this illuminator.</li>
            <li> There was so much hype about the colour Orgasm</li>
            <li> so I bought one to try, Don&#x27;t really like the consistency, a bit too watery for my liking.</li>
            <li> I do love high beam, but this contains nearly twice as much for similar price.     </li>
            <li> so I really don&#x27;t want a product that would make my face even more pink!</li>
            <li> but when I received it and tried it, it is nothing better than your average highlighter.</li>
            <li> But when I recently visited a cousin, she had such a lovely glow to her face</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a liquid high lighter that is not sticky or over powering but</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> If your makeup is looking flat, dull &amp; dry, this is the perfect product to brighten your face without overdoing it!</li>
            <li> I live in warmer weather</li>
            <li> I guess I will have to make it work until it&#x27;s done, or try to find new ways to use it.</li>
            <li> It only takes a little bit, to make a nice glow and enhance your natural looks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tad dark for my skin tone, as I&#x27;m very fair, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> When you first put it on it will make your face red.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this and couldn&#x27;t wait to try other out</li>
            <li> Use a tiny dab and mix it with your foundation (you may use too much or not enough at first</li>
            <li> was so excited to finally order and receive a product i had heard about for so long....</li>
            <li> Probably this will work better on cold weathers where it&#x27;s a must to have a product to bring light and moisture to the skin.</li>
            <li> For natural glowing skin try this product from NARS.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face with a supple, natural glow.</li>
            <li> Not heavy.</li>
            <li> Not opaque enough to really make a difference</li>
            <li> Also, I have a naturally pinkish skin</li>
            <li> Adds a soft, natural glow.</li>
            <li> Young, old, brunette, blond and redheads</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t wear this product now because I&#x27;m really pale and it shows up more red.</li>
            <li> The container given is a huge amount compared to what you need, but thats the beauty of NARS, a little bit goes a long way and you really won&#x27;t ever run out.</li>
            <li> I love the subtle look this provides.</li>
            <li> Love the subtle glow it gives</li>
            <li> (Though not enough to write off the high price tag).</li>
            <li> and I wanted something that would be light enough to accentuate without feeling heavy in the heat.</li>
            <li> - it is a very flattering glow rather than adding pink to your skin.</li>
            <li> I like the way it looks (pretty sheer) when I have just applied it, but doesn&#x27;t last long on my skin.</li>
            <li> It leaves a slight ring of color that you really have to spend time smoothing out and evening into your skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too much nor too little.</li>
            <li> Ordering make up online is always a risk because if you&#x27;re not familiar with the product than you don&#x27;t really know what you&#x27;re getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You could spend less on a normal highlighter and get the same results.</li>
            <li> I find this makeup very glittery and can only use a small amount, but the tube is made so that quite a bit extra comes out each time you squeeze it.  </li>
            <li> Will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> One tube will last a very, very long time.  </li>
            <li> !!!!!I even tried layering several apps and letting them dry.....</li>
            <li> so if you do like this stuff, then it will last you a long, long time.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> When I am going out and doing a complete look this product adds an extra touch and shine if you apply small amounts *over*</li>
            <li> for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Sooo sheer, not what I expected.</li>
            <li> The tube was a lot bigger than I expected....</li>
            <li> Although she is very pale and young enough that she doesn&#x27;t need any “foundation assistance” like her mother.  </li>
            <li> You really only use a little of it, so it will last a really long time.</li>
            <li> and i have barely used any because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I received a long, skinny tube about half as big as what&#x27;s described.  </li>
            <li> I normally do not wear make up.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey but just a tiny dab goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> This illuminator is very subtle and pretty.</li>
            <li> Its not to glittery or shiny and you only need a little.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe this product would last a little longer than the powder</li>
            <li> I only and a little blush with it, and eye liner</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s certainly no miracle/</li>
            <li> A little dab goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little does go a long way and it goes well with my medium-beige skin tone.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that this NARS ORGASM ILLUMINATOR would be too pink or too dark.  </li>
            <li> Use it to accent your cheek bones and highlight other areas on your face .</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for people with very pale or white skin.</li>
            <li> I like to apply it to the tops of my cheekbones and up slightly to the temple, the cupid bow of my lip and down the bridge of my nose.</li>
            <li> and so i ordered it online as it was about half the price here</li>
            <li> and somehow I feel that the product I got from here gives me a bit subtle glow than what I saw in sephora but its very possible that its their lighting thats making all the difference...</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey</li>
            <li> but if you have a few freckles or imperfections it darkens them.  </li>
            <li> so it appears cakey and uneven.</li>
            <li> $30 for a small tube, so not worth it.</li>
            <li> it is what I was missing all along</li>
            <li> Not sure why there are rave reviews for this.</li>
            <li> Not absolutely sure if I am using it correctly.</li>
            <li> I have very pale skin and even after applying a few thick layers i still see no difference.</li>
            <li> sorry i spent the money and will def</li>
            <li> my one complaint is that if i don&#x27;t wash my hands after throwing this on, i leave sparkles on everything i touch.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> I ordered the illuminator THEN started searching for reviews online, and everything that I had read and watched....was not good.    </li>
            <li> When I say subtle, I mean VERY VERY VERY VERY SUBTLE -- almost like the sheen you get from wiping water on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it is too thin and watery.</li>
            <li> This illuminator adds a very subtle pinkish sparkly sheen.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this product AT all... will keep trying to find something that works !!!!!</li>
            <li> maybe it&#x27;s fake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard of fake copy cosmetics and this may be a fake one.</li>
            <li> Regretfully it merely blends into my skin and fails to \\&quot;illuminate\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid of the pinkness of this product in the tube</li>
            <li> For the price, this was disappointing.  </li>
            <li> so you could guess my disappointment when I put it on and saw it didn&#x27;t even show up on my face.  </li>
            <li> too bad i can&#x27;t use it..</li>
            <li> But I ended up disappointed for a couple reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> Highly disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> was so excited to finally order and receive a product i had heard about for so long....what a crock!......disappears on my face......!!!!!I even tried layering several apps and letting them dry.....nothing.....sorry i spent the money and will def n ot be buying Nars anytime soon</li>
            <li> Not really what I expected after all the great reviews.  It does add a glow but if you have a few freckles or imperfections it darkens them.  I wanted something that brightened and glows.</li>
            <li> The best part about this, is its multiple uses. I use it on my cheeks ,lips, and even my eyes as a shadow or brow or highlighter. Its sheer and blends evenly . Youll never look like a clown, or overdone in any way only fresh ,innocent dewey and natural. Yor beauty will shine thru, and it isnt just the nars, its in combo with you. Wish I had every color!</li>
            <li> This product seemed like it&#x27;d be nice but when I received it and tried it, it is nothing better than your average highlighter. I use it on my cheek bones and it gives a nice glow and i have barely used any because a little goes a long way. You could spend less on a normal highlighter and get the same results.</li>
            <li> I liked this product alot when i first tried it in sephora and so i ordered it online as it was about half the price here and somehow I feel that the product I got from here gives me a bit subtle glow than what I saw in sephora but its very possible that its their lighting thats making all the difference...anyway all and all a good product.</li>
            <li> Amazing glow and edge</li>
            <li> I was SOOOO surprised when I received this product after all the GREAT reviews I had read.... Not impressed with this product AT all... will keep trying to find something that works !!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard about this product (and the attention-grabbing color name!) for a long time.  But when I recently visited a cousin, she had such a lovely glow to her face so I asked her about her make-up.  This product was her \\&quot;secret\\&quot; and I purchased my own.  Use a tiny dab and mix it with your foundation (you may use too much or not enough at first but you&#x27;ll quickly get the hang of how much to use).  Don&#x27;t be afraid of the pinkness of this product in the tube - it is a very flattering glow rather than adding pink to your skin. This color is supposed to be universally flattering and I believe it.  One tube will last a very, very long time.  Don&#x27;t think twice about purchase - it&#x27;s fantastic.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Good size. It&#x27;s a tad dark for my skin tone, as I&#x27;m very fair, a little goes a long way! And it stays on! It gives you that dewey, healthy glow.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that this NARS ORGASM ILLUMINATOR would be too pink or too dark.  It is absolutely perfect and I love it.  You don&#x27;t need very much, so it is a really good buy.  Will last a long time.  I would definitely buy it again.  You can use it over makeup or without.  It makes you look refreshed.</li>
            <li> honestly I wasn&#x27;t exactly sure what this product was or what it did :-) but some friends and a lot of blogs were raving about it so I ordered.    I am finding this is like having 3 or 4 products in 1 - it&#x27;s great in place of complete foundation if you&#x27;re in a hurry or just dashing out of this house. I also use it as a blush sometimes. When I am going out and doing a complete look this product adds an extra touch and shine if you apply small amounts *over* your finished face too.    This will be a staple of mine for years to come - strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great! It gives a dewy pinkish glow. I live in warmer weather so i don&#x27;t use it often as it can make you look oily. I recommend this being the only glowy/dewy thing you use with everything else matte so it doesn&#x27;t look oily. Oohhh! Also never put this on top of powders. I know the instructions say it can be worn on top of makeup but not powder makeup like blush. I don&#x27;t know why but it moves the powder and mixes with it so it appears cakey and uneven. As I have light skin I can just wear this without blush and it gives me a natural pearly flush.</li>
            <li> This is a really great and quick step in my make up process.  It&#x27;s a really great color, not too dark or bright, and it has the perfect amount of shimmer.</li>
            <li> I ordered the illuminator THEN started searching for reviews online, and everything that I had read and watched....was not good.    But I seriously love this!!    It is the high lighter that I have wanted for FOREVER!     I don&#x27;t really like powder highlighters, they don&#x27;t show up on my skin well.     I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a liquid high lighter that is not sticky or over powering but just right.    I do love high beam, but this contains nearly twice as much for similar price.     Give it a shot, it really is lovely</li>
            <li> This illuminator is very subtle and pretty. I use it to help create a dewy look when applying my makeup.  The shimmer is perfect,its just enough to brighten your look without looking overdone. A little dab goes a long way.  I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> For natural glowing skin try this product from NARS. The name says it all!  A silky smooth all in one product. Use El-naturelle or with your favourite foundation to colour eyes, lips, cheeks. I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Sooo sheer, not what I expected. Nars Orgasm powder blush is my all time favorite blush. This product is so watery, the powder blush I have shows up so much better,  maybe it&#x27;s fake. I&#x27;ve heard of fake copy cosmetics and this may be a fake one. Not sure why there are rave reviews for this. Next time I&#x27;m at the Nars cosmetics counter I will see if there is a difference. I was hoping it was thicker and was going to use it to highlight my cheekbones but it is too thin and watery.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this illuminator because of all the rave reviews I saw. But I ended up disappointed for a couple reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1) It doesn&#x27;t do much. You get a slight dewy look when you apply it, which I really liked, but throughout the rest of the day I noticed that unless you are standing under a light at just the right angle, it isn&#x27;t really noticeable. I think it only looked really good when I first applied it because I was standing under the bathroom light.&lt;br /&gt;2) It leaves a slight ring of color that you really have to spend time smoothing out and evening into your skin. Otherwise it just looks like you smeared blush on your face and ran out the door.&lt;br /&gt;Reasons I did like it:&lt;br /&gt;1) The tube was a lot bigger than I expected....so if you do like this stuff, then it will last you a long, long time.&lt;br /&gt;3) It has a nice scent to it. (Though not enough to write off the high price tag).</li>
            <li> I live in Guayaquil-Ecuador, where we have a very hot and humid weather, so my skin tends to get greasy easily, so maybe that&#x27;s why I haven&#x27;t been able to use this product. I like the way it looks (pretty sheer) when I have just applied it, but doesn&#x27;t last long on my skin. Probably this will work better on cold weathers where it&#x27;s a must to have a product to bring light and moisture to the skin.</li>
            <li> Brightens skin, no need to follow with makeup, product works exactly as stated.  Arrived quickly and  would order this product again.</li>
            <li> I have heard great things about this product and decided to give it a try. This will now be a permanent addition to my makeup kit. I love the highlight/illuminating effects it has on my skin, it blends well if I add it along with darker makeup/bronzer but looks great when I go for a lighter look-It&#x27;s also something I put on when I go outdoors recreationally. Feels light on my face and gives me the glow that I am after.</li>
            <li> I love the subtle look this provides.</li>
            <li> I have been using the NARS illuminator for years...It leaves my face with a supple, natural glow. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love the subtle glow it gives</li>
            <li> Its okay, the color is pretty but it makes me look shiny sometimes, its also pretty pricy but the bottle is bigger than the one here in the picture.</li>
            <li> This really does illuminate your skin. A little pricey but just a tiny dab goes a long way.  I will order again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is ok. When you first put it on it will make your face red. After you top it with foundation, it does fade and leave a dewey look and feel. But it&#x27;s certainly no miracle/must have/best thing on earth product as so many reviewers have said. I will use it until it&#x27;s gone and then probably never buy it again.</li>
            <li> Looks good on everyone which is why they are constantly sold out at Sephora! Would definitely recommend- even if just to tell people what you are wearing- orgasm</li>
            <li> Perfect product. Not heavy. Goes over my sunscreen and gives you the dewy look that is in right now.     My new favorite makeup.</li>
            <li> I initially saw this product and felt it would be too light and ashy for my skin tone but it really does make my darker skin glow. I think this is a much better highlighter than Albatross (which is a staple still) simply because it feels gives drier skin an all day glow. It doesn&#x27;t have any kind of color to it, it&#x27;s just a very light golden shimmer to wherever you apply it. I like to apply it to the tops of my cheekbones and up slightly to the temple, the cupid bow of my lip and down the bridge of my nose. You only need just a very tiny amount, maybe just bigger than a push pin head for each area. The container given is a huge amount compared to what you need, but thats the beauty of NARS, a little bit goes a long way and you really won&#x27;t ever run out.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Its not too over powering. It is lighter than expected but that is a good thing. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I received a long, skinny tube about half as big as what&#x27;s described.  For the price, this was disappointing.  I find this makeup very glittery and can only use a small amount, but the tube is made so that quite a bit extra comes out each time you squeeze it.  Not something I&#x27;d purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love this product the color will work well on any skin tone. I use it at the top of my cheeks and inside the corner of my eye to add a bit of light. Its not to glittery or shiny and you only need a little.</li>
            <li> This is basically an IRL instagram filter for your blush. Not opaque enough to really make a difference but as a highlight or layered over blush really makes everything pop. Feels like nothing when it&#x27;s on which is great.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with this! It&#x27;s a bit more pink than shown in the picture, but that&#x27;s fine with me because I use this on my cheekbones and it gives you that perfect \\&quot;dewy\\&quot; natural glow. It&#x27;s perfect to use on its own as a sheer illuminating blush especially during the day, but for a more dramatic look in the evening I sweep just a touch of bronzer/blush over it and it looks great that way too. If your makeup is looking flat, dull &amp; dry, this is the perfect product to brighten your face without overdoing it! Seriously. You need this.</li>
            <li> Perfect skin brightener</li>
            <li> this is my first time using an illuminator, and the orgasm shade seems to do the trick well. i am olive/tan skinned and it still showed up on my skin with a tinted shimmer. my one complaint is that if i don&#x27;t wash my hands after throwing this on, i leave sparkles on everything i touch. otherwise, i use it as a blush and as a finisher</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product. You really only use a little of it, so it will last a really long time. I haven&#x27;t found anything similar in person. Great shipping, great product. Truly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This illuminator adds a very subtle pinkish sparkly sheen. When I say subtle, I mean VERY VERY VERY VERY SUBTLE -- almost like the sheen you get from wiping water on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a highlighter for me because I was looking for something more noticeable. Also, I have a naturally pinkish skin and I blush easily, so I really don&#x27;t want a product that would make my face even more pink! I recommend this product for people with very pale or white skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for myself.  I&#x27;ve been using the powder orgasm blush for awhile now and love it.  I thought maybe this product would last a little longer than the powder so I bought it.  It&#x27;s very, very light when I put it on.  I use a cream foundation with a light bronzer and you can&#x27;t tell I put any blush on.  I will say that the product looks great on my 13 year old, fair skinned daughter.  Although she is very pale and young enough that she doesn&#x27;t need any “foundation assistance” like her mother.  The gel blush looks great on her, very natural!  I gave it to her and will stick to the powdered version.</li>
            <li> This is definitely not for someone with oily skin, as it may make you appear like you are sweaty. However it works well on the cheeks when used under blush. $30 for a small tube, so not worth it. I guess I will have to make it work until it&#x27;s done, or try to find new ways to use it.</li>
            <li> Wow, with all of the rage surrounding this product I really thought I was going to LOVE it. Regretfully it merely blends into my skin and fails to \\&quot;illuminate\\&quot;. Highly disappointed. Returning.</li>
            <li> I really like this illuminator. It&#x27;s not too much nor too little. A little does go a long way and it goes well with my medium-beige skin tone.</li>
            <li> Ordering make up online is always a risk because if you&#x27;re not familiar with the product than you don&#x27;t really know what you&#x27;re getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t wear this product now because I&#x27;m really pale and it shows up more red. I think I&#x27;ll enjoy it more once I&#x27;m more tan so it&#x27;ll be a summer make up staple.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of the NARS Orgasm color. I love to wear this illuminator in the sumer with my tinted moisturizer. It adds a light shimmer and a little flush to your color (especially if you are fair skinned like me). I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and the illuminator in Orgasm doesn&#x27;t show up on my skin at all! giving this away to a tan gal pal. Save 30 bucks and don&#x27;t buy this junk!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this face cream. Summer is coming up and I wanted something that would be light enough to accentuate without feeling heavy in the heat. This highlights all the best areas and makes any color you have pop. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Great product....creates a super look!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this and couldn&#x27;t wait to try other out so you could guess my disappointment when I put it on and saw it didn&#x27;t even show up on my face.  I have very pale skin and even after applying a few thick layers i still see no difference.</li>
            <li> I usually love all Nars products, but this was just watery and didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; anything.  I actually gave it away...</li>
            <li> .......I like how subtle it is and it looks great over my makeup it is what I was missing all along</li>
            <li> It has simmer but if you don&#x27;t apply it over your foundation you won&#x27;t see it. Looks good if you are just running out of the house with no makeup on if you don&#x27;t mind breaking out a day later. For the price I was expecting something bigger than a tester sample but that&#x27;s my fault I should have looked at the oz in the description. I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Not as excellent as the reviews say--I feel like I look the same with or without.</li>
            <li> This is the first product that ever burned my skin.  When I asked for a refund Nars said they don&#x27;t return open products and the company that sold it was also uncooperative.  I ended up throwing it away for fear it would damage someone elses skin.</li>
            <li> this product was just what was required it met all my needs and i would happily recommend this item to any of my friends. Thank you for a great item</li>
            <li> Adds a soft, natural glow.</li>
            <li> The color is very becoming on everyone.  Young, old, brunette, blond and redheads it compliments all complexions.  It is a little pricey but you feel like a million when you wear it. Use it to accent your cheek bones and highlight other areas on your face .</li>
            <li> I really love this product. I love to use it just to get a natural look on my face like going to the beach for a fresh look. Is great for highlite the face. I will buy it again and again.</li>
            <li> I normally do not wear make up.  This make up goes on smooth and blends in very well.  I only and a little blush with it, and eye liner and then I am out the door.  Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> There was so much hype about the colour Orgasm so I bought one to try, Don&#x27;t really like the consistency, a bit too watery for my liking. I prefer power to liquid, don&#x27;t think I am going to repurchase.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my skin glow. Not absolutely sure if I am using it correctly. But I put it on after my foundation.</li>
            <li> Gave me rashes like ant bite on applied areas..looks good on my skin color though.. too bad i can&#x27;t use it..</li>
            <li> It only takes a little bit, to make a nice glow and enhance your natural looks. I will be getting more and using this product always.</li>
            <li> Does just what it says it does! Goes on easy and instantly creates a nice, warm glow. I love to wear it over my foundation, which creates a nice dewy look.</li>
