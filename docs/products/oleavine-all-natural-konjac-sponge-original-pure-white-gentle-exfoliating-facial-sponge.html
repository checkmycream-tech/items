            <li>I received this product from Oleavine for free to review, but the opinions and thoughts are my own.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Konjac fiber is grown on the pristine volcanic plains of Jeju Island in South Korea, free from chemicals, pollution and irritants.</li>
            <li>I loved the soft feel on my face.</li>
            <li>Being able to skip the cleanser and just use the sponge and still getting a great clean is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Another huge benefit to Oleavine&#x27;s facial sponges are that they gently prep your skin to boost the absorption of your favorite moisturizer or serum.</li>
            <li>Smooth face, quick and easy.</li>
            <li>The tear shape design I&#x27;d great to clean under my eyes, but the size of the sponge gets in the way focusing on a specific part of your face.</li>
            <li>works perfectly; clean, gentle and aerates nicely</li>
            <li>Konjacâ€™s extra fine texture makes it an ideal cleanser for every skin type, even sensitive.</li>
            <li>Great on the face, thought it would be too rough but its just right!</li>
            <li>I find that the sponge allows for good foaming of facial cleansers</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well made and natural, holds up very well after a month of uses, rinses out easily, and I&#x27;m happy to say you really don&#x27;t even have to use a cleanser or serum with this product,</li>
            <li>I like its amazing shape which can easily exfoliate around my face especially around my nose.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it every day at night before bed and wake up with still fresh and clean skin.</li>
            <li>I did receive a complimentary sponge for testing purposes although my thoughts are completely unbiased and honest.</li>
            <li>It helped my cleanser suds up a lot, and my skin felt really smooth after using it, so I believe it does provide some very gentle exfoliation.</li>
            <li>All Natural Konjac Sponge is perfect and is extremely gentle&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li>Your skin feels clean, soft &amp; smooth after using these sponges!</li>
            <li>and it is safe for even very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My new favorite facial product - more gentle for sensitive skin than brushes and is easy to pack for travel ... love it!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use any extra cleanser with my sponge and it does an amazing job at taking my makeup off, exfoliating my skin and cleansing the skin.</li>
            <li>I am extremely satisfied with this, and knowing that it&#x27;s safe for the whole family to use means I&#x27;ll definitely be a repeat</li>
            <li>customer!&lt;br /&gt;I had no idea what to expect with this product, but am loving what it&#x27;s doing for my skin and am totally hooked.</li>
            <li>.I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li>love that there are no harsh chemicals used in this sponge</li>
            <li>It looks like a little rock, when it is dry but as soon as it absorbs warm water, it become soft with a great interesting texture.</li>
            <li>and it fits right in the palm of your hand.</li>
            <li>Of course, you could always just send it to me, haha, or it would make a great gift for the teenage girl, new mom, or bestie in your life.</li>
            <li>The net like texture will make your cleanser multiply and cause many many bubbles!</li>
            <li>Really soft sponge, nothing special!</li>
            <li>I have tried a few of them and they really are a great addition to any skincare routine.  </li>
            <li>Very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not much of a product junkie or beauty buff, but I am always looking for great products that will save me time and are gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This was my first Konjac sponge</li>
            <li>At the end of a makeup day, I used the sponge with my regular cleanser and made sure to rinse it well.</li>
            <li>is most universal.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try out this 100% Plant Based Konjac Sponge in Original White from Oleavine!</li>
            <li>The OLEAVINE Beauty sponge is vegan, cruelty free, and 100% natural.</li>
            <li>The size I thought the first sponge should have been.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use facial cleansing brushes as they make my cystic acne flare up, so I am glad to have found an alternative.</li>
            <li>when you first get it it feels like a block of Styrofoam.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is also completely bio-degradable, naturally sustainable and environmentally safe.</li>
            <li>I am not required to give a positive review.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Konjac Beauty Sponge&amp;#34; is a cool product, not only because it is natural &amp; Eco-friendly, but also itâ€™s easy to use</li>
            <li>I love these sponges, but I wish they included some way to hang them to dry.</li>
            <li>Once you wet it, it turns into a super smooth and slippery sponge of awesomeness.</li>
            <li>I could really see the dirt coming</li>
            <li>After I&#x27;m done I place the sponge in the microwave for 2 minutes and it&#x27;s ready to be used that night by my mom.</li>
            <li>I also like the shape of the sponge so you can gently exfoliate around the eyes and nose.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who wants cleaner feeling skin.</li>
            <li>I have searched for a gentle make-up remover sponge and this is the one!&lt;br /&gt;The Oleavine</li>
            <li>something that is suitable for daily use as opposed to an abrasive scrub that can only be done weekly.</li>
            <li>I really like this konjac sponge and use them when I need to quickly wash my face without soap, and do not need a fully loaded facial treatment.</li>
            <li>I like its interesting texture too, besides it was soft and gentle on my skin, removed dead cells easily and left skin glowing, refreshed and radiant.</li>
            <li>Might be good for bathing a baby with it, Total waste of money.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Oleavine Konjac Sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this sponge to anyone.</li>
            <li>- just put a little more thought into the mechanics of it.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft and gentle the sponge was.</li>
            <li>Will be purchasing again when I need a new one.</li>
            <li>This one is very soft.</li>
            <li>Highly functional even for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The first Konjac sponge was smaller.</li>
            <li>Not sure how long it will last but its still in perfect condition 3 weeks later with almost daily use.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many in the past but the pure white one is the one that I find</li>
            <li>Gets your skin very clean with small amount of soap product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a high quality sponge that is meant to last but at a decent price.</li>
            <li>The sponge is just so soft when it is in water, if you don&#x27;t use it for a day or two it starts drying up</li>
            <li>So far, so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>found the exfoliation definitely on the gentle side,</li>
            <li>I am 60 years old and have tried a lot in my years</li>
            <li>My skin feels like it&#x27;s been reborn, baby soft.  </li>
            <li>wow</li>
            <li>A Sponge is a Sponge unless it&#x27;s a loofa, as far as I can see.  </li>
            <li>The Konjac is meant to naturally exfoliate, nourish, and repair damaged skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but once wet it glided right over my skin.</li>
            <li>It is a new way to keep my skin very fresh and get ride of dead cells and don&#x27;t make my skin drier than it is!</li>
            <li>that I apply it after exfoliating with my Original White Konjac Sponge, which means I can use less</li>
            <li>When dry, it is very hard.&lt;br</li>
            <li>should&#x27;ve got a more rough course sponge for harsh exfoliation...</li>
            <li>The sponge dried quickly so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about it being slimy.</li>
            <li>I rather use a regular wash cloth, it&#x27;s way to soft</li>
            <li>I like to use natural product especially for my skin.</li>
            <li>and honestly it kinda feels like that weird foam stuff from floral arrangements.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been seeing these sponges a lot lately, so I was excited to get to try one.</li>
            <li>The sponge is soft enough that it doesn&#x27;t scratch, but still leaves my knees and elbows feeling extra soft!&lt;br /&gt;http://muchmostdarling.blogspot.com/2014/12/oleavine-konjac-facial-sponge-review.html?m&#x3D;1</li>
            <li>Not rough enough for me...</li>
            <li>While the sponge may be hard at first, after you soak it, it does become really soft.</li>
            <li>Konjac is a plant-based starch and in this case it is spun into fibers creating a very soft sponge when wet.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t use any extra cleanser with my sponge and it does an amazing job at taking my makeup off, exfoliating my skin and cleansing the skin.</li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied with this, and knowing that it&#x27;s safe for the whole family to use means I&#x27;ll definitely be a repeat</li>
            <li> customer!&lt;br /&gt;I had no idea what to expect with this product, but am loving what it&#x27;s doing for my skin and am totally hooked.</li>
            <li> .I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li> love that there are no harsh chemicals used in this sponge</li>
            <li> It looks like a little rock, when it is dry but as soon as it absorbs warm water, it become soft with a great interesting texture.</li>
            <li> and it fits right in the palm of your hand.</li>

            <li> Really soft sponge, nothing special!</li>
            <li> I have tried a few of them and they really are a great addition to any skincare routine.  </li>
            <li> Very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much of a product junkie or beauty buff, but I am always looking for great products that will save me time and are gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This was my first Konjac sponge</li>
            <li> At the end of a makeup day, I used the sponge with my regular cleanser and made sure to rinse it well.</li>
            <li> is most universal.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try out this 100% Plant Based Konjac Sponge in Original White from Oleavine!</li>
            <li> The OLEAVINE Beauty sponge is vegan, cruelty free, and 100% natural.</li>
            <li> The size I thought the first sponge should have been.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use facial cleansing brushes as they make my cystic acne flare up, so I am glad to have found an alternative.</li>
            <li> when you first get it it feels like a block of Styrofoam.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is also completely bio-degradable, naturally sustainable and environmentally safe.</li>
            <li> I am not required to give a positive review.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Konjac Beauty Sponge&amp;#34; is a cool product, not only because it is natural &amp; Eco-friendly, but also itâ€™s easy to use</li>
            <li> I love these sponges, but I wish they included some way to hang them to dry.</li>
            <li> Once you wet it, it turns into a super smooth and slippery sponge of awesomeness.</li>
            <li> I could really see the dirt coming</li>
            <li> After I&#x27;m done I place the sponge in the microwave for 2 minutes and it&#x27;s ready to be used that night by my mom.</li>
            <li> I also like the shape of the sponge so you can gently exfoliate around the eyes and nose.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who wants cleaner feeling skin.</li>
            <li> I have searched for a gentle make-up remover sponge and this is the one!&lt;br /&gt;The Oleavine</li>
            <li> something that is suitable for daily use as opposed to an abrasive scrub that can only be done weekly.</li>
            <li> I really like this konjac sponge and use them when I need to quickly wash my face without soap, and do not need a fully loaded facial treatment.</li>
            <li> I like its interesting texture too, besides it was soft and gentle on my skin, removed dead cells easily and left skin glowing, refreshed and radiant.</li>
            <li> Might be good for bathing a baby with it, Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Oleavine Konjac Sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this sponge to anyone.</li>
            <li> - just put a little more thought into the mechanics of it.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft and gentle the sponge was.</li>
            <li> Will be purchasing again when I need a new one.</li>
            <li> This one is very soft.</li>
            <li> Highly functional even for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The first Konjac sponge was smaller.</li>
            <li> Not sure how long it will last but its still in perfect condition 3 weeks later with almost daily use.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many in the past but the pure white one is the one that I find</li>
            <li> Gets your skin very clean with small amount of soap product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a high quality sponge that is meant to last but at a decent price.</li>
            <li> The sponge is just so soft when it is in water, if you don&#x27;t use it for a day or two it starts drying up</li>
            <li> So far, so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> found the exfoliation definitely on the gentle side,</li>
            <li> I am 60 years old and have tried a lot in my years</li>
            <li> My skin feels like it&#x27;s been reborn, baby soft.  </li>
            <li> wow</li>
            <li> A Sponge is a Sponge unless it&#x27;s a loofa, as far as I can see.  </li>
            <li> The Konjac is meant to naturally exfoliate, nourish, and repair damaged skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but once wet it glided right over my skin.</li>
            <li> It is a new way to keep my skin very fresh and get ride of dead cells and don&#x27;t make my skin drier than it is!</li>
            <li> that I apply it after exfoliating with my Original White Konjac Sponge, which means I can use less</li>
            <li> When dry, it is very hard.&lt;br</li>
            <li> should&#x27;ve got a more rough course sponge for harsh exfoliation...</li>
            <li> The sponge dried quickly so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about it being slimy.</li>
            <li> I rather use a regular wash cloth, it&#x27;s way to soft</li>
            <li> I like to use natural product especially for my skin.</li>
            <li> and honestly it kinda feels like that weird foam stuff from floral arrangements.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been seeing these sponges a lot lately, so I was excited to get to try one.</li>
            <li> The sponge is soft enough that it doesn&#x27;t scratch, but still leaves my knees and elbows feeling extra soft!&lt;br /&gt;http://muchmostdarling.blogspot.com/2014/12/oleavine-konjac-facial-sponge-review.html?m&#x3D;1</li>
            <li> Not rough enough for me...</li>
            <li> While the sponge may be hard at first, after you soak it, it does become really soft.</li>
            <li> Konjac is a plant-based starch and in this case it is spun into fibers creating a very soft sponge when wet.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too abrasive on my skin and really cleanses my face (when I get lazy and don&#x27;t want to do an entire process).</li>
            <li> First out of the packaging the product is really hard</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s lasting longer, which also means I&#x27;m buying it less frequently and saving money -</li>
            <li> I was worried as hard as it was first out of the box that it would feel rough against my skin</li>
            <li> makes for easy handling and exfoliating, especially around my eyes and nose, which are usually difficult to reach with other contraptions.</li>
            <li> My skin is so sensitive and with the dryness that comes along with winter weather, my face wash seems to leave my skin feeling overly dry and tight.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel so soft without using harsh things on it.  </li>
            <li> It takes about 24 or just a little over to dry completely</li>
            <li> There is an attached string and you should always hang it up to dry between uses.</li>
            <li> I just hang it from a lotion bottle to dry when not using.</li>
            <li> After using it, keep it dry by hanging it in a well ventilated area.</li>
            <li> Lately, I have been using &amp; alternating between the White &amp; French Red Clay ones that Oleavine sent me to review for them for my blog,</li>
            <li> like the smaller Konjac sponge, if you want to use a cleanser or body wash, remember to use about half of what you would use before the sponge.</li>
            <li> There are absolutely no rips or tears in my sponge and it doesn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;gross&amp;#34; either.</li>
            <li> But once you get it wet its loosens up.</li>
            <li> I just simply wet the sponge thoroughly and rubbed it all over my face.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time, doesn&#x27;t smell (i air dry mine near an open window usually) and the little thread, although small, helps you keep it sanitary.</li>
            <li> and I use it in the mornings with no additional soap, gets the dead rough skin off of my face and is very gentle non irritating</li>
            <li> I bought some of these as gifts for other people and they all have said they like that they aren&#x27;t to abrasive.</li>
            <li> I have been using this sponge every other day for a couple weeks now and all I got to say is</li>
            <li> Sometimes I use it by itself and other times I use it with a cleanser.  </li>
            <li> let the sponge air dry by hanging it by the little string it has</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first cause</li>
            <li> And just like the other konjac sponge, it is biodegradable!</li>
            <li> It really exfoliated my face and got down in there to clear the dirt and crap under my skin that would cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> It works by exfoliating dead skin cells and then leaving behind a soft film to nourish and protect skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As it stands, they get a little funky on the one side if you set it on the side of your tub.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few of these konjac sponges from this company and this one is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> When the small black box embossed with silver arrived I opened to find the sponge shrink wrapped.</li>
            <li> I usually use it without any additional cleanser</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this specifically detoxifies and works for acne because I still have some, but I&#x27;ll keep using it to see if there is a difference.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, like to the point band-aids break me out, and I&#x27;ve had no irritation not once, and Yes, I&#x27;ve also had less blackheads, especially around my nose, which is always my worst spot.</li>
            <li> The sponge felt like really hard sophomore in a tear drop shape.</li>
            <li> It brings out the little bumps and the yuck that never seems to come out EVER!!</li>
            <li> I received this sponge via a review program and have been using it for approximately 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> but I have never experienced anything like this.  </li>
            <li> However, the string around the sponge seems/looks rather bad.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I rather use a regular wash cloth, it&#x27;s way to soft and it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t exfoliate any. Might be good for bathing a baby with it, Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> This was my first Konjac sponge and I immediately understood the buzz I&#x27;ve heard. Konjac is a plant-based starch and in this case it is spun into fibers creating a very soft sponge when wet. When dry, it is very hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use the Konjac sponge without a cleanser and this is a big selling point for me. At my age, I don&#x27;t need any help with dryness from even the most mild cleansers. I don&#x27;t wear makeup every day, and this sponge cleaned my skin without drying. At the end of a makeup day, I used the sponge with my regular cleanser and made sure to rinse it well. There is an attached string and you should always hang it up to dry between uses. I highly recommend the Oleavine Konjac Sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my inspection and review.</li>
            <li> The sponge is very gentle and nice. I usually use it without any additional cleanser and it does a really good job cleaning the face without drying it out. No reasons to complain.</li>
            <li> This is such a great sponge. I have tried so many in the past but the pure white one is the one that I find is most universal. It isn&#x27;t too abrasive on my skin and really cleanses my face (when I get lazy and don&#x27;t want to do an entire process). This is the easy and quick way to clean your face! The sponge is just so soft when it is in water, if you don&#x27;t use it for a day or two it starts drying up but you can easily fix it by re-wetting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this item complimentary in return for my 100% honest review, all words are mine*</li>
            <li> I love these sponges, but I wish they included some way to hang them to dry. As it stands, they get a little funky on the one side if you set it on the side of your tub. They work as described and are a great idea - just put a little more thought into the mechanics of it.</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed my sponge. When the small black box embossed with silver arrived I opened to find the sponge shrink wrapped. The sponge felt like really hard sophomore in a tear drop shape. The sponge fit in my hand perfect. After soaking my sponge for about 5 min if that in warm water I washed my face with just the sponge. I loved the soft feel on my face. Just by placing the sponge back in the sink of water and pressing out water between my palms I could really see the dirt coming off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every morning I use the sponge. I feel refreshing and look better. After I&#x27;m done I place the sponge in the microwave for 2 minutes and it&#x27;s ready to be used that night by my mom. We even gave my daughter a bath one time with it. She loved the feel of the sponge and the sponge really did get her clean with her favorite bath gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to hang with the string attached to the top of the sponge. It takes about 24 or just a little over to dry completely out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have enjoyed using the Konjac sponge to exfoliate, detoxify, clean and refresh my face. The over all best part is the sponge is not tested non animals and it&#x27;s vegan approved. I really recommend this awesome sponge to everyone. Easy to use, clean and it&#x27;s so beneficial. Nice to use one product for so much.</li>
            <li> Smooth face, quick and easy. I love this product!</li>
            <li> Great on the face, thought it would be too rough but its just right!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try out this 100% Plant Based Konjac Sponge in Original White from Oleavine! I&#x27;m not much of a product junkie or beauty buff, but I am always looking for great products that will save me time and are gentle on my sensitive skin. I am extremely satisfied with this, and knowing that it&#x27;s safe for the whole family to use means I&#x27;ll definitely be a repeat customer!&lt;br /&gt;I had no idea what to expect with this product, but am loving what it&#x27;s doing for my skin and am totally hooked. My skin has always been an issue with breakouts and unevenness, but after about a week I started noticing that my skin was softer and my breakouts were fewer and further between. The best part for me is the fact that you can use this sponge without any facial cleanser! My skin is so sensitive and with the dryness that comes along with winter weather, my face wash seems to leave my skin feeling overly dry and tight. Being able to skip the cleanser and just use the sponge and still getting a great clean is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Another huge benefit to Oleavine&#x27;s facial sponges are that they gently prep your skin to boost the absorption of your favorite moisturizer or serum. I&#x27;ve found that my moisturizer seems to be more effective now that I apply it after exfoliating with my Original White Konjac Sponge, which means I can use less and it&#x27;s lasting longer, which also means I&#x27;m buying it less frequently and saving money - yay!&lt;br /&gt;The teardrop shape and the size of the Konjac Sponge makes for easy handling and exfoliating, especially around my eyes and nose, which are usually difficult to reach with other contraptions. While it&#x27;s amazing for my face, it&#x27;s also great in the shower as an all over, gentle body exfoliator. The sponge is soft enough that it doesn&#x27;t scratch, but still leaves my knees and elbows feeling extra soft!&lt;br /&gt;http://muchmostdarling.blogspot.com/2014/12/oleavine-konjac-facial-sponge-review.html?m&#x3D;1</li>
            <li> love it, it is gentle and great. I alternate it with my clarisonic and I use it in the mornings with no additional soap, gets the dead rough skin off of my face and is very gentle non irritating and It makes my makeup look smooth and not cakey after washing my face. I just hang it from a lotion bottle to dry when not using. dries just fine.</li>
            <li> Very soft and smooth. Rinses easily</li>
            <li> I have been reading about these and decided to purchase. Gets your skin very clean with small amount of soap product. Will be purchasing again when I need a new one. So far, so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CAM</li>
            <li> These are awesome!! It brings out the little bumps and the yuck that never seems to come out EVER!! No cleanser needed!</li>
            <li> Not rough enough for me...should&#x27;ve got a more rough course sponge for harsh exfoliation...</li>
            <li> This is the second Konjac sponge I have used. The first Konjac sponge was smaller. The OLEAVINE Beauty sponge is vegan, cruelty free, and 100% natural. There are no added chemicals, colors, or preservatives. This is as clean as it gets! And just like the other konjac sponge, it is biodegradable! So go ahead and dump it in your compost after 2 to 3 months of using it.This sponge is almost the size of my hand! The size I thought the first sponge should have been. I quickly realized, the size of this sponge is best to use for your body rather than your face. I tried to use it on my face and it works just fine. The tear shape design I&#x27;d great to clean under my eyes, but the size of the sponge gets in the way focusing on a specific part of your face. So now I keep my smaller sponge by the sink, and this Konjac sponge in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like the smaller Konjac sponge, if you want to use a cleanser or body wash, remember to use about half of what you would use before the sponge. The net like texture will make your cleanser multiply and cause many many bubbles! After using it, keep it dry by hanging it in a well ventilated area. I received this product in return for an honest review. I am not required to give a positive review. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I received this product from Oleavine for free to review, but the opinions and thoughts are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been seeing these sponges a lot lately, so I was excited to get to try one. While the sponge may be hard at first, after you soak it, it does become really soft. The texture is interesting, almost rubbery and gelatinous, yet it felt great on my face! It helped my cleanser suds up a lot, and my skin felt really smooth after using it, so I believe it does provide some very gentle exfoliation. Overall, I like it. I can&#x27;t use facial cleansing brushes as they make my cystic acne flare up, so I am glad to have found an alternative. I just wished they lasted longer than 2--3 months!</li>
            <li> I received this sponge via a review program and have been using it for approximately 3 weeks.  I keep this sponge in my stand up shower and use it to wash my face, sometimes with cleanser (which I prefer) and sometimes without.  I find that the sponge allows for good foaming of facial cleansers so you don&#x27;t use as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the exfoliation definitely on the gentle side, something that is suitable for daily use as opposed to an abrasive scrub that can only be done weekly. I also like the shape of the sponge so you can gently exfoliate around the eyes and nose.I&#x27;m not sure how this specifically detoxifies and works for acne because I still have some, but I&#x27;ll keep using it to see if there is a difference. I like the idea of detoxifying. I think I&#x27;d like to try the charcoal bamboo version next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let the sponge air dry by hanging it by the little string it has so it drip dries and doesn&#x27;t get gross. Not sure how long it will last but its still in perfect condition 3 weeks later with almost daily use.  #oleavine</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Konjac Beauty Sponge&amp;#34; is a cool product, not only because it is natural &amp; Eco-friendly, but also itâ€™s easy to use and it is a very good cleanser. Konjac fiber is grown on the pristine volcanic plains of Jeju Island in South Korea, free from chemicals, pollution and irritants. I like to use natural product especially for my skin.It looks like a little rock, when it is dry but as soon as it absorbs warm water, it become soft with a great interesting texture. I like its amazing shape which can easily exfoliate around my face especially around my nose.I like its interesting texture too, besides it was soft and gentle on my skin, removed dead cells easily and left skin glowing, refreshed and radiant. Feel wonderful just like having a relaxing spa treatment! It is a new way to keep my skin very fresh and get ride of dead cells and don&#x27;t make my skin drier than it is!</li>
            <li> First out of the packaging the product is really hard and honestly it kinda feels like that weird foam stuff from floral arrangements. Once you wet it, it turns into a super smooth and slippery sponge of awesomeness. My skin felt superb after using it from the very first time.I was worried as hard as it was first out of the box that it would feel rough against my skin but once wet it glided right over my skin. I&#x27;ve used it every day at night before bed and wake up with still fresh and clean skin. I have very sensitive skin, like to the point band-aids break me out, and I&#x27;ve had no irritation not once, and Yes, I&#x27;ve also had less blackheads, especially around my nose, which is always my worst spot. The teardrop shape is ideal for your face. It get in all the spots without having to fight it. It gets in around your eyes easily and helps get rid of all that end of the day mascara &amp;#34;raccoon&amp;#34; failout. The shape also helps you hold onto it and it fits right in the palm of your hand. It&#x27;s well made and natural, holds up very well after a month of uses, rinses out easily, and I&#x27;m happy to say you really don&#x27;t even have to use a cleanser or serum with this product, but of course you can if so wish to. It has a 100% guarantee, you won&#x27;t want to let this product go, but I understand that different people like different things and if this isn&#x27;t sponge isn&#x27;t for you, send it back, you have nothing to lose by trying it. Of course, you could always just send it to me, haha, or it would make a great gift for the teenage girl, new mom, or bestie in your life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this facial sponge for about two months now and it still looks like I just started using it. It&#x27;s definitely a high quality sponge that is meant to last but at a decent price. There are absolutely no rips or tears in my sponge and it doesn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;gross&amp;#34; either. This is a very good sized sponge that fits great in the palm of my hand. It&#x27;s perfect size for use on the body as well as the face. I love the teardrop shape because it makes it super easy to get around my eyes. I don&#x27;t use any extra cleanser with my sponge and it does an amazing job at taking my makeup off, exfoliating my skin and cleansing the skin. Since using the sponge on my face my skin is a million times smoother and overall I think looks younger. I did receive a complimentary sponge for testing purposes although my thoughts are completely unbiased and honest. I would definitely buy another one of these when the one I have needs replacing.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!!!  I am 60 years old and have tried a lot in my years but I have never experienced anything like this.  My skin feels like it&#x27;s been reborn, baby soft.  My makeup looks more polished- no flaking.  I will never be without this product again.</li>
            <li> I bought some of these as gifts for other people and they all have said they like that they aren&#x27;t to abrasive. However, the string around the sponge seems/looks rather bad.</li>
            <li> I have been using this sponge every other day for a couple weeks now and all I got to say is wow this is a great sponge. I was a little skeptical at first cause when you first get it it feels like a block of Styrofoam. But once you get it wet its loosens up. It really exfoliated my face and got down in there to clear the dirt and crap under my skin that would cause breakouts. I recommend this to anyone who wants cleaner feeling skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few of these konjac sponges from this company and this one is one of my favorites. It lasts a long time, doesn&#x27;t smell (i air dry mine near an open window usually) and the little thread, although small, helps you keep it sanitary. I really like this konjac sponge and use them when I need to quickly wash my face without soap, and do not need a fully loaded facial treatment. I received this product in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I love these sponges!  I have tried a few of them and they really are a great addition to any skincare routine.  Lately, I have been using &amp; alternating between the White &amp; French Red Clay ones that Oleavine sent me to review for them for my blog, GlamRiver.&lt;br /&gt;These sponges are great at cleansing and exfoliating your skin and you can use them with or without a cleanser.  Your skin feels clean, soft &amp; smooth after using these sponges!</li>
            <li> I love this sponge!  It makes my face feel so soft without using harsh things on it.  Sometimes I use it by itself and other times I use it with a cleanser.  great results either way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this for review purposes.  The opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> It was Ok, didn&#x27;t do what I was expecting it to do but it&#x27;s Ok.</li>
            <li> works perfectly; clean, gentle and aerates nicely</li>
            <li> A Sponge is a Sponge unless it&#x27;s a loofa, as far as I can see.  This one is very soft.</li>
            <li> Received product promptly.  My new favorite facial product - more gentle for sensitive skin than brushes and is easy to pack for travel ... love it!</li>
            <li> Really soft sponge, nothing special!</li>
            <li> I have searched for a gentle make-up remover sponge and this is the one!&lt;br /&gt;The Oleavine All Natural Konjac Sponge is perfect and is extremely gentle&lt;br /&gt;on my face. I would highly recommend this sponge to anyone.</li>
            <li> This face sponge is amazing! This is a great exfoliator It is very gentle.I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft and gentle the sponge was. I just simply wet the sponge thoroughly and rubbed it all over my face.It has the sensation of exfoliating without any roughness. The sponge dried quickly so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about it being slimy. I am a huge fan of this and so glad I got the chance to review this product and I love the fact it is also safe for kids as well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; .I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;https://beautifulblessings86.wordpress.com/2014/12/13/konjac-sponge-original-pure-white-gentle-exfoliating-facial-sponge-review/</li>
            <li> I reviewed the 100% Plant Based Konjac Sponge recently. The package arrived on time and in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sponge is made from bamboo charcoal and it contains no preservatives, coloring, or additives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also completely bio-degradable, naturally sustainable and environmentally safe. The Konjac is meant to naturally exfoliate, nourish, and repair damaged skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Konjacâ€™s extra fine texture makes it an ideal cleanser for every skin type, even sensitive. It works by exfoliating dead skin cells and then leaving behind a soft film to nourish and protect skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sponge is proven to tighten and plump skin, as well as fight wrinkles by softening the keratin structure and repairing the elastin fiber needed to keep skin from sagging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this cleanser and nothing else on my face and could not believe the difference! Within days, my skin looked firmer, tighter, cleaner, even had a glow about it that was not there before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that there are no harsh chemicals used in this sponge and it is safe for even very sensitive skin. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> This was a reorder. Two daughters and I use this daily and appreciate the quality and usefulness of this sponge. Highly functional even for my sensitive skin.</li>
