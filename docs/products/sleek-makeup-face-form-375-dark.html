            <li>And although this is too dark for my skin tone, the blush and highlight is perfect.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s so pigmented, and goes on incredibly smooth.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>The shipping was actually pretty fast and above all, I&#x27;m extremely happy with this palette!</li>

            <li>You may find the medium or dark works better for contouring around the nose</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I love this in Dark!</li>
            <li>Picture colors are very true, and will work well will skin tones with deep blues and red undertones.  </li>
            <li>and I normally just go to drug stores or the mall and instead, I took a chance and bought this one.</li>
            <li>I just got it and wore it last night for the first time</li>
            <li>you are of a deeper shade, (i am golden almond in Bobbi Brown foundation shades), you will find the Dark works well.  </li>
            <li>the contour kit in dark is alot darker the powder is visible but not a dramatic enough effect for my taste.</li>

            <li> I was in need of an everyday bronzer badly and I normally just go to drug stores or the mall and instead, I took a chance and bought this one. The shipping was actually pretty fast and above all, I&#x27;m extremely happy with this palette! The colors are BEAUTIFUL! I got mine in dark, though I should have chosen the one before this one; the medium one because sometimes it&#x27;s too dark. Anyway, the colors go on smoothly and look amazing ❤️</li>
            <li> delivery estimate was the 29th - Dec 17th. i got it today!! but i can already tell i dont really like it.. the contour kit in dark is alot darker the powder is visible but not a dramatic enough effect for my taste. will be giving this away to my mother lol</li>
            <li> Being someone of a deeper completion -this pallet is amazing.  Does the job extremely well -great to travel with as well!!!!</li>
            <li> Great for first timers attempting to contour. Love it! Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! Great pigment and the shades compliment one another perfectly. Leaps &amp; bounds over other contouring products I&#x27;ve used! The shipping however? Fail. :(</li>
            <li> Love the colors.  Picture colors are very true, and will work well will skin tones with deep blues and red undertones.  You&#x27;ll have to be patience in receiving it, but it will eventually get to you.</li>
            <li> I use it as a contour kit. Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this in Dark! Worth every penny! Arrived neatly packaged. Great set of colors with a mirror on the other side. I am too happy to add this to my collection!</li>
            <li> I bought this contour kit because of the color depth. I am not disappointed, it is a wonderful contour kit.</li>
            <li> Great pigmentation. Does require some extra work with blending. Be careful when picking your shade the colors do appear darker than they actually are. Overall great product and excellent color payoff.</li>
            <li> Wish the contour was dark enough to be seen. Kind of cheap the color is really dark but doesn&#x27;t show up.</li>
            <li> This item came a little over a week! It&#x27;s very pigmented. I have med/dark skin with warm under tones and this works really well! Overall a good purchase! Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.  And although this is too dark for my skin tone, the blush and highlight is perfect.  This product is very pigmented and picks up easily on any brush. The packaging is extremely &amp;#34;sleek&amp;#34; and appropriate.</li>
            <li> Great product. Maybe would have liked the shadow colour to be just a touch darker but still does the job (I wear Mac foundation in NW 50) Would buy again.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome contour kit! It works well with my skin color! I will be ordering other shades for my kit!</li>
            <li> The colors pictured are not the colors for the face contour kit dark 375. The colors are still nice but not what was expected!</li>
            <li> The glow that this highlighter gives is to die for. I love it...I was never a big fan of contouring, however I do play around with every now &amp; then.</li>
            <li> Awesome product...great highlighter and contour. It may be a bit to dark for me. Sleek makes great products, I wanted this to have more pigment.</li>
            <li> While this product is shipped internationally, it arrived in 10 days!  Product (Sleek Face Form - dark and medium ordered) was packaged well!&lt;br /&gt;If you are of a deeper shade, (i am golden almond in Bobbi Brown foundation shades), you will find the Dark works well.  You may find the medium or dark works better for contouring around the nose area.&lt;br /&gt;All in all a great product!</li>
            <li> This is AMAZING!! I just got it and wore it last night for the first time, it&#x27;s so pigmented, and goes on incredibly smooth. The colors went perfect with my skin, and I got compliments on my glowing skin ALL NIGHT!!!! Def making it a staple in my makeup bag!!!!</li>
