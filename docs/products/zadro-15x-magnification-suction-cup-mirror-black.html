            <li>Great to carry in purse</li>
            <li>Great idea, but...</li>
            <li>Good quality and does what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li>It makes plucking hairs real easy and helps you prevent gooky eye syndrome.</li>
            <li>Its more like 10 and fuzzy at that!</li>
            <li>It is a nice size for a purse or pocket.</li>

            <li>It seems cheaply made and I returned it and purchased a better mirror.</li>
            <li>Maybe it sticks better when things are excessively clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made so you can easily stick it to a mirror and have both hands free.</li>
            <li>This seemed to fit the bill.</li>
            <li>But beware, not only do they work great</li>
            <li>This attaches to my large mirror very easily and stays put.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really good mirror, just was hoping it would&#x27;ve been bigger in diameter.</li>
            <li>Good for facial inspection.</li>
            <li>It was shipped quickly and packed well.</li>
            <li>perfect for those with poor vision.</li>
            <li>Use the suction cups to attach to a desktop mirror in order to use it hands free while sitting down bedside or at the vanity near a good source of light.</li>
            <li>20X one is too clear, but this one is more suitable for daily look.</li>
            <li>The 10X is good but sometimes not quite strong enough to see the smaller eyebrow hairs.  </li>
            <li>However, 15X magnification is far too strong.</li>
            <li>I based this purchase on what others have said, although I&#x27;m not even sure how this could possibly be used in any sense.</li>

            <li>Very distorted unless you are right up on the mirror but that may be the strength.  </li>
            <li>Nice small size fit in the palm of one hand (kind of small for wall mounting...</li>
            <li>I would recommend re-wetting the suction cups periodically to be sure that doesn&#x27;t happen as it can occur when they are dry.</li>
            <li>Since I could not find a bigger one, this one is fine.</li>
            <li>Nice little mirror.</li>
            <li>Would be great if it were just a little bigger in diameter.</li>
            <li>You have to get really too close to see in it.</li>
            <li>It was very blurry.  </li>
            <li>This works very well.</li>
            <li>TOO much magnification.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice mirror if you have trouble with your vision</li>
            <li>Better off buying some other mirror.  </li>
            <li>As I get older my vision is diminishing and these are prefect for plucking your eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>Paid a little more than normal</li>
            <li>This mirror is really nice to help see those really hard to see things on your face.</li>
            <li>To use, I need to go up real close to the mirror to see clearly.</li>
            <li>I had previously purchased a 20X mirror which was too strong to see well.  </li>
            <li>The 15x magnification is a little too strong.</li>
            <li>great - but a little too small</li>
            <li>It made everything blurry, it wasn&#x27;t clear at all, so I threw it away as it was making my eyes hurt from looking in it.</li>
            <li>I have to move around quite a bit before I can see an area clearly.  </li>
            <li>It did not provide a clear reflection.  </li>
            <li>You could not see yourself clearly using this mirror.</li>
            <li>The 10X magnifications is not enough and the 20X is too much.  </li>
            <li>Just be careful, the last one I had popped off and broke when I flipped the extension mirror around to quickly.</li>
            <li>You have to be right up on it to see anything, otherwise you&#x27;re upside down in the mirror.  </li>
            <li>I have looked high and low for a mirror that I can actually use without glasses.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because this is a concave mirror or if the magnification is just too powerful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> GREAT for all the things I need a magnifying mirror for.</li>
            <li> Like my mirror. Paid a little more than normal but I needed this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice mirror if you have trouble with your vision like I do since having eye surgery. I stuck it on my bathroom mirror to replace a 10x smaller one. I&#x27;m glad to have it. It sticks very well if you wet the suction cups a little bit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good mirror, just was hoping it would&#x27;ve been bigger in diameter.</li>
            <li> The mirror arrived on time, however the reflection is so distorted as to be unusable. I bought this for applying eye liner, but unless I am literally 4&amp;#34; away from the mirror, there is no way this is usable. And being that close makes it impossible to apply makeup with any kind of accuracy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because this is a concave mirror or if the magnification is just too powerful. I based this purchase on what others have said, although I&#x27;m not even sure how this could possibly be used in any sense. I sent it back for a refund, which Amazon promptly applied to my account.</li>
            <li> When you were a kid, remember how weird it was to have to talk to some old guy that missed a bunch of hairs on his neck  or by his ear shaving?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be that guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works great if you use in electric shaver...  makes the job faster and you can see everything.  Nice small size fit in the palm of one hand (kind of small for wall mounting...but has the suction cups for that)  Great for traveling.</li>
            <li> perfect for those with poor vision. Great for contact wearers and applying make up perfectly</li>
            <li> Focal length is quite short.  Good for facial inspection.</li>
            <li> 20X one is too clear, but this one is more suitable for daily look. It is also very cute, and easy to bring.</li>
            <li> It made everything blurry, it wasn&#x27;t clear at all, so I threw it away as it was making my eyes hurt from looking in it. I felt like I was going cross-eyed.</li>
            <li> This mirror is great but the suction cups are not! The mirror fell within 24 hours of adhering to another mirror and cracked in 3 places. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> You have to be right up on it to see anything, otherwise you&#x27;re upside down in the mirror.  You have to be centimeters from it to see anything.</li>
            <li> great - but a little too small</li>
            <li> Very distorted unless you are right up on the mirror but that may be the strength.  Would I buy it again?</li>
            <li> This is great for the bathroom since it has suction cups. I put mine on the non-magnifying side of an accordion extension mirror that I can pull away from the wall, close enough to my face to use the magnification of this spot mirror with no distortion. Just be careful, the last one I had popped off and broke when I flipped the extension mirror around to quickly. I would recommend re-wetting the suction cups periodically to be sure that doesn&#x27;t happen as it can occur when they are dry.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay put.  Keeps falling down.  Suction cups don&#x27;t work well.  Better off buying some other mirror.  Very very annoying.</li>
            <li> Nice little mirror. Would be great if it were just a little bigger in diameter. You have to get really too close to see in it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a mirror and it does what mirrors do.  I might should have gotten the 20x version.  we&#x27;ll see how unbreakable this one is.</li>
            <li> This attaches to my large mirror very easily and stays put.  The 15x magnification is a little too strong. I have to move around quite a bit before I can see an area clearly.  I am going to see if they have one closer to 10x.</li>
            <li> This is not 15X! Its more like 10 and fuzzy at that! I have another Zadro that is 15X that I had for years. This is not the same magnification. False advertising rip off!</li>
            <li> small but big enough to see your face</li>
            <li> I have looked high and low for a mirror that I can actually use without glasses. This one works, although a bigger one would have been better. Since I could not find a bigger one, this one is fine. Good quality and does what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> This mirror is really nice to help see those really hard to see things on your face. It makes plucking hairs real easy and helps you prevent gooky eye syndrome. It is a nice size for a purse or pocket. The only thing I may complain about is that at times the suction cups don&#x27;t stick for very long. Unless that is a problem with the things I stick it to. Maybe it sticks better when things are excessively clean. Would definately recommend this product, especially if you  have some trouble seeing things such as dirt or spludge on your face that need to be remove.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t get anything less than 15x magnification. My eyes aren&#x27;t what they used to be and I need the extra magnification for tweezing, etc. I love the clarity this mirror delivers, no distortion. Use the suction cups to attach to a desktop mirror in order to use it hands free while sitting down bedside or at the vanity near a good source of light. Its portable which may not work for everyone but compared to others of this size, (price and quality), I feel it deserves a 5 star.</li>
            <li> Mirror is tiny and optics seemed distorted even for a magnified mirror. It seems cheaply made and I returned it and purchased a better mirror.</li>
            <li> Works just as I hoped it would for putting on my contacts.</li>
            <li> Perfect for trimming your eyebrows! Good size to carry in your purse!</li>
            <li> Great to carry in purse</li>
            <li> Had to return this mirror. It did not provide a clear reflection.  It was very blurry.  You could not see yourself clearly using this mirror. I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased a 20X mirror which was too strong to see well.  The 10X is good but sometimes not quite strong enough to see the smaller eyebrow hairs.  This 15x mirror is perfect.  It was shipped quickly and packed well.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a hand held mirror with magnification. This seemed to fit the bill. Thank you for your prompt response and delivery.</li>
            <li> I would have given this five stars if one of the suction cups on the back of the mirror didn&#x27;t keep coming off. It&#x27;s made so you can easily stick it to a mirror and have both hands free. I have one in my dressing room, one in my purse, and one always packed for travel.</li>
            <li> Great idea, but... I like the idea of being able to attach to a surface by suction cups. This works very well. However, 15X magnification is far too strong. To use, I need to go up real close to the mirror to see clearly. In fact, in applying makeup, I have difficulty using an eye liner pencill, as the pencil can hit the mirror while I am applying...showing how close I need to get to the mirror to see!</li>
            <li> A bit small... But works mounted on my 5x mirror</li>
            <li> I love this mirror.  As I get older my vision is diminishing and these are prefect for plucking your eyebrows.  The 10X magnifications is not enough and the 20X is too much.  But beware, not only do they work great but they also show all your blemishes and wrinkles.  In fact, I ordered several extra mirrors to give away as a stocking stuffer for Christmas.</li>
            <li> never thought I would ever say ...TOO much magnification.  But ... that&#x27;s what this is.  I need to go back to the 10x</li>
            <li> I did not realize the small size it was and it is very difficult to use.  I would not have bought this product if I had realized how little it is and how hard it is to use.</li>
