            <li>really glad that I did because this tamanu oil has helped my acne tremendously.</li>
            <li>I been researching for new natural treatments and found that Tamanu Oil works on existing acne scars and is especially effective in the prevention of acne scarring.</li>
            <li>The oil is soothing on my skin and does not cause any irritation which is important.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks and not only have I seen a great reduction in my acne</li>
            <li>I decided to try this specific brand because this seller had a lot of great reviews.</li>
            <li>I plan to try to start using it on some light stretch marks soon.</li>
            <li>For a smooth skin as well as for any skin care solution, I prefer this oil to use.</li>
            <li>It felt great on my skin, like instant cooling relief</li>
            <li>began using Tamanu oil daily and over time saw a great improvement in the quality of my skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if that changes the product or not, but a friend who works with oils a lot said that it was important.</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth like me now.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is light and not overpowering and it goes on smooth without feeling overly oily.</li>
            <li>Also important is DOES IT WORK?</li>
            <li>but I will say that it was fantastic.  </li>
            <li>These also come in an Amber bottle to help protect the oils from light and faster</li>
            <li>and this would be a great addition to anyone that likes to go camping or hiking and needs instant relief from mother natures irritants.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s additive free.</li>
            <li>This stuff works better than any lotion I own; and I&#x27;ve gone from alligator skin to soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s available in stores.</li>
            <li>When I learnt about Tamanu Oil under Puressant, I immediately ordered one to try based on the good experience I had with their products so far.</li>
            <li>I really wish I had better results like many of the reviewers.</li>
            <li>Tamanu oil is apparently good for old scars, eczema and acne too.</li>
            <li>This brand also was recommended for its high quality and concentrated formula, so this is a pretty good buy in light of that.</li>
            <li>I looked into Tamanu oil and had some friends recommend it ,so I gave it try and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I apply it twice a day (once after showering, another before bed) and my skin dryness has been significantly reduced.  </li>
            <li>He used it twice a day every day for two weeks and saw a significant improvement in the redness on his face.</li>
            <li>She took the time to look through some of the other brands that sell tamanu oil, and he decided that Puressant seemed like a good company; I tend to agree with her!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m highly satisfied and would order from them again (just unfortunately not this oil since it didn&#x27;t help my skin)</li>
            <li>It is also a great product to use on minor skin irritations to disinfect the skin and promote healing.</li>
            <li>I saw immediate results when I applied it after a shower, for some reason it seems to work better after a hot shower.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m never disappointed.</li>
            <li>This is a real high quality product that I’m sure</li>
            <li>I found this product and was lucky to get it before it wasn&#x27;t available anymore.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I found Tamanu Oil, and the results have been fantastic.</li>
            <li>I prefer only natural products, and the Tamanu Oil has worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li>but it does help clean it and for the skin to be healing within a day or two.</li>
            <li>The Tamanu Oil by Puressant arrived in a quick manner securely packaged to prevent damage to the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that is 100% pure and made from Tree Nut Oil.</li>
            <li>love that this oil is all natural and completely additive free which makes me feel even more confident about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have eczema, and nothing out there really seemed to be quite what my skin needed to heal and begin looking better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried different products for this treatment, no worked as good as this.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled so far.  </li>
            <li>smell was very nutty for lack of a better word.  </li>
            <li>This tamanu oil seems to be of great quality, and it has helped to reduce the red, patchy appearance my skin has in certain areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a Puressant&#x27;s loyal soul and this one</li>
            <li>Luckily I tried it out.</li>
            <li>I did receive my bottle free  or at a promotional discount for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my personal experience and honest opinion of this oil.</li>
            <li>There is absolutely no risk in trying the product, because it works amazingly!</li>
            <li>This is a great oil to add to your other oils and read up on all its uses!</li>
            <li>Its a greenish-gold color and its great for reducing redness and inflammation, which makes the acne that is still there a lot less noticeable.</li>
            <li>I absolutely fell in love with this oil within the first week of use.</li>
            <li>It worked fast and it was easy to use.!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works wonderfully, and it soothes my delicate skin...and it works!</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s working to improve my skin, I really don&#x27;t care how it smells!!</li>
            <li>Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase!</li>
            <li>It feels so gentle and easy to be absorbed.</li>
            <li>Best part, the oil is all natural and can be used for your hair and skin as well (honestly the potential uses are endless)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tamanu oil comes highly recommended for anyone who wants to clear up dry/itchy hands or to add some silk and shine to their hair.</li>
            <li>After using Tamanu oil for a few weeks I noticed my skin rashes were diminishing which was a great feat, since I felt it was going no where.</li>
            <li>My skin doctor has a remedy for it and is able to remove most of the red patches quite reasonably.</li>
            <li>How exciting...</li>
            <li>It is quickly absorbed into skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found something all natural rather than</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>I am a smooth kind of guy with rough skin which doesn&#x27;t add up for me.</li>
            <li>I still get occasional acne and am thrilled that this works for that</li>
            <li>This is 100% natural which I love that.</li>
            <li>I especially find this handy in the summer.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve really enjoyed how this works on my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found something all natural rather than</li>
            <li>My hands and cuticles are soft and silky now and look incredibly healthy.</li>
            <li>I applied it every night for a week (that&#x27;s how much the sample lasted) and I noticed right away how smooth my elbows got.</li>
            <li>and I did the research to see that this is a very powerful skin healer that is gentle and rejuvenating.</li>
            <li>Her eczema cleared up pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>First and foremost, it is natural, which is very important to me.</li>
            <li>and once I put this on, it went right to work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This cleared it right up.  </li>
            <li>right?).</li>
            <li>This cleared it right up.</li>
            <li>It also has natural vitamin E and even if you don&#x27;t need it for any of the conditions I mentioned, it&#x27;s great for healing dry skin.</li>
            <li>I am lucky to have found this, I&#x27;ll order more once they are back in stock!</li>
            <li>I’ve always had sensitive skin and recently found out that I am allergic to sulfates – which made caring for my skin even more challenging.</li>
            <li>I heavily recommend this amazing product!</li>
            <li>I used to apply first thing in morning then right before bed.</li>
            <li>and it certainly has done wonders!</li>
            <li>Thank you very much, i used this on my mother and it works like a charm on her fungus toenails</li>
            <li>No laboratory manufactured chemicals with a huge list of side effects, just this naturally pressed wonder that didn&#x27;t bother her at all.  </li>
            <li>but when i do I know exactly how to take care of it.  </li>
            <li>None of them have helped me consistently, but after using tamanu oil I saw results after about a week--and the results lasted.</li>
            <li>However, the reason i am leaving a review here is because it is the only place where I can leave a review for it and let others know that this is a top notch product.</li>
            <li>First thing that caught my attention was the ingredient, it was Foraha Oil.</li>
            <li>Guess what, it started working in the first week</li>
            <li>but the funny thing was, I never touched the plant.</li>
            <li>My sister has also used it successfully to get rid of a small scar.</li>
            <li>The oil originates in Polynesia, where it continues to play an important cultural role.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I ever tried it.  </li>
            <li>I totally can recomment it and will get more of it in the future :)</li>
            <li>so I thought I would give this a try first this time.</li>
            <li>It actually worked better for closing and getting the skin over it to heal than for getting the infection out or bringing it to a head.</li>
            <li>I have almost used up my first bottle and will be ordering another soon.</li>
            <li>The is a 100% money back guarantee on the product, and just about everyone who&#x27;s tried it has been immensely satisfied with their results.</li>
            <li>Besides the sheer number of successes the product has rendered, the price is just phenomenal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely worth it and reasonable for what you&#x27;re getting.</li>
            <li>I think one of the reason it works with so many different skin conditions / problems is because it is anti-viral (shingles, etc.), anti-fungal (eczema, candida), and anti-bacterial all in one oil.</li>
            <li>FAST shipping!</li>
            <li>When I first opened the bottle I couldn&#x27;t seem to get any oil out onto my fingertip.  </li>
            <li>Very nice thick oil.  </li>
            <li>I have been using oils for a long time, but when my daughter found out that she had eczema, I knew I had to learn more about the different types of oils that may be able to assist with her.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re wondering what exactly it is, tamanu oil is extracted from the seeds of a large evergreen tree that is native to parts of Africa, India and Australia.  </li>
            <li>I use this natural oil mainly to help me treating my acne on the back but using it on the whole body feels soft and great from the first day.</li>
            <li>It does have a strong smell but adding this to my other oils and soaps gives green great added benefits while helping mask the smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a several weeks now and the scars are becoming lighter.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not 100% full strength on my sensitive</li>
            <li>I have always had oiler skin than most people, and even now when I am older I still get the occasional pimple.  </li>
            <li>just one application  of this amazing product daily can help clear the symptoms of various skin ailments such as acne, eczema, psoriasis, rashes wrinkles and more!</li>
            <li>It not only helps clear up break outs, but keeps my skin smooth once it is clear better than any drug store product I’ve ever used.</li>
            <li>My skin is so dry that I’m always looking for something to work better or to give me relief.</li>
            <li>I get outbreaks of eczema on my fingertips in dry winter, and summer gardening that make my skin crack, and tamanu oil helps better than anything I ever got from the dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had naturally dry skin and most lotions don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>This product is certainly nature’s way of healing and we will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>After reading a bit more about the properties of this oil, I decided to try it out on my dry skin!</li>
            <li>The Tamanu Oil, which comes from the Foraha Tree, is of a very high quality (it comes from Madagascar).</li>
            <li>My skin was smooth and the redness had gone down significantly.</li>
            <li>was disappearing fast.</li>
            <li>So you can imagine my shock that this oil is one of the only products that has made me virtually acne free</li>
            <li>Plus the price is very affordable.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended brand!</li>
            <li>, none of them really worked...</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li>This oil is very soothing to the skin</li>
            <li>I use it for my eczema and it really helps</li>
            <li>I have only been using it for a few days and my skin already feels better and is looking a lot more</li>
            <li>This  herbal oil is very helpful  on my face.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>I really like how it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>I tried to apply a lightly scented lotion shortly after applying this oil and that seemed to mask the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I really wanted to get rid of it</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>His skin looks so much</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Tamanu Oil!</li>
            <li>Thanks@</li>
            <li>and I really like the quality of their oils.</li>
            <li>like how gentle this is on my skin and that it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been very helpful in controlling break outs and stopping the itchiness.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t require much.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This oil is very soothing to the skin</li>
            <li>I use this twice a day; after washing my face in the morning before putting on my moisturizer, and when I&#x27;m getting ready for bed at night.</li>
            <li>I was very surprise.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a few weeks now and so far so good.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something all natural and pure, that is a fix for just about any beauty ailment, this is the right the product.</li>
            <li>Looking forward to my future result, hopefully it will clear it all up soon :)</li>
            <li>Tamanu oil in general has an aroma to it not bad</li>
            <li>oil supposedly has skin healing, antineuralgic, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antibiotic, and antioxidant properties, making it a very useful topical agent in the skincare area.</li>
            <li>My Tamanu oil bottle is easy to apply and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I first heard of Tamanu oil on my long and arduous search for the best skin care products for my finicky sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Unlike other products we&#x27;ve used in the past,this product works likes magic because soon after applying it on his skin,we noticed there was a change in skin color as the eczema and acne</li>
            <li>hear it has many other uses, but it&#x27;s worked well for what I&#x27;ve needed.</li>
            <li>As well as so many other things.  </li>
            <li>It’s supposed to help with scars, stretch marks, psoriasis, acne, eczema, bug bites, stings, enflamed skin, burns, infections, fungal infections, and many other skin ailments.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed it&#x27;s healing a lot quicker than normal!</li>
            <li>I have tried other tamanu oil and love this one.</li>
            <li>My skin is much clearer and smooth than it ever has been and it doesn’t dry out my face like in-store acne products.</li>
            <li>Tamanu Oil absorbs quickly, without leaving any oily residue and is fast acting.</li>
            <li>That is where this Tamanu Oil comes in, it has cleared my skin and kept it clear consistently.  </li>
            <li>that was still dark after many months.</li>
            <li>t has worked great so far in managing a few different skin issues.</li>
            <li>and it started clearing my face up even more and clears up the dark spots as well.</li>
            <li>but I distinctly remember reading some time back that the oil had healing powers not just cosmetically but also for many other ailments.</li>
            <li>I use this in my moisturizer made of both almond and jojoba oil and really think this has helped with some scars I have and preventing new breakouts.  </li>
            <li>still am able to see the marks but alot less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have it mainly on my feet.  </li>
            <li>I can feel the elasticity in my skin again in the middle of winter and the relief is more than short lived!</li>
            <li>but my main problem is chronic and persistent psoriasis.  </li>
            <li>I think this particular fragrance is an acquired smell because I’ve heard some people don’t mind it while some don’t’ particularly care for it.</li>
            <li>and you will have more than enough to last you quite a while.</li>
            <li>daily application of Tamanu Oil has kept my hands soft and smooth all winter.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>highly recommend using this oil.</li>
            <li>I will highly recommend this herbal oil.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I have highly allergic reactions to insect bites.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this oil and the Puressant line.</li>
            <li>I buy the Puressant brand because it always is high quality, delivered on time and as promised.</li>
            <li>This is a really effective essential oil for foot and nail fungus and a host of other things.</li>
            <li>I guess all natural was the way to go!!</li>
            <li>Puressant takes care to only include the best ingredients in this Tamanu Oil as it is 100% Pure Cold Pressed.  </li>
            <li>It goes on very light but makes a big difference with cracked, dry, or even blistered skin.</li>
            <li>be careful using this with light color clothing and bedding..</li>
            <li>My husband works with concrete, it dries out his hands</li>
            <li>Just be careful that you don&#x27;t wear light colored clothes over the skin where you apply the oil as it might stain.</li>
            <li>It does smell funny though, but that&#x27;s just how tamanu oil smells in general.</li>
            <li>(I still have a few spots here and there, but the difference is massive)!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be continuing my use, and hopefully I&#x27;ll continue to see fantastic results!</li>
            <li>Firstly, I have to say what really counts: that this oil actually works!</li>
            <li>The little dip stick allows for easy application on my hands without getting too much out at once.</li>
            <li>I started looking for a natural remedy and tried many different types of essential oils including Tea Tree and Lavender, which helped some, but I was still looking for something that was going to keep my skin clear.  </li>
            <li>: true to the seller&#x27;s advertised guarantee, I received a full refund for the product since it was not effective for me.</li>
            <li>They are clear and 100% natural and very affordable.</li>
            <li>Within the first month I saw vast improvement.</li>
            <li>Let me start off by first saying that I actually can&#x27;t get this product shipped from Amazon as I don&#x27;t reside in the US.</li>
            <li>And not only has it changed my life physically, I&#x27;ve also felt better emotionally as a result.</li>
            <li>A definite must have oil for a first aid kit as it has antibiotic properties to it.</li>
            <li>and within hours (hours....NOT days)....it is completely gone!  </li>
            <li>I’m so relieved to have finally found something that really works!</li>
            <li>This new oil has completely healed my my cracking peeling skin and it feels refreshes all day.  </li>
            <li>As I get older I&#x27;m dealing with consistent dry skin issue.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t like wasting a bunch of money for a large bottle that will last longer than its shelf life.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to anyone as it is made from pure natural ingredients and it does wonder to any skin problems.</li>
            <li>I did begin to see my eczema become less and less prominent within the first week,</li>
            <li>It clear up all my face.</li>
            <li>It indeed is and it helped me clear all the acne that I had on my shoulders.</li>
            <li>I could see clear results within a week</li>
            <li>I have been really into using natural oils lately such as coconut and argon oils.</li>
            <li>It has started to clear up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for months for a natural skin care product to help heal my skin from all of my acne.</li>
            <li>Tamanu oil is 100% natural and created by a trusted manufacturer.</li>
            <li>I’ve been dealing with eczema and adult acne for years.</li>
            <li>I also started using it on my face to treat adult acne</li>
            <li>Nothing we tried had worked.&lt;br /&gt;After a week or using this oil his soft are so soft.</li>
            <li>The pores of my skin  is reducing and lighten  the old scars.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for couple weeks so far.</li>
            <li>I try to use natural products; but lots of them do not work.  </li>
            <li>in fact, my psoriasis continues to worsen and flare even with frequent application.</li>
            <li>My acne almost completely disappeared because of this oil.</li>
            <li>I bought this oil to cure my acne, and it completely blew my away.</li>
            <li>This is an all natural oil that comes from the tamanu tree from the tropics of Asia.</li>
            <li>As a result of this, I have scars that are up to 10 years old.</li>
            <li>While searching  for a natural solution to cover the duality of my problem I came across a page that recommended Tamanu Oil.  </li>
            <li>You really have nothing to lose and potentially everything to gain.</li>
            <li>The oil glides on softly while the skin heals and regains its luster.</li>
            <li>I would really recommend this to someone who has moderate to severe acne and cant find anything else that works.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a product that was natural to help with this issue.</li>
            <li>I have tried steroid creams, a gel from my dermatologist and an all natural homeopathic cream.  </li>
            <li>The last few years I have noticed that my wrinkles have become more noticeable.  </li>
            <li>also suggest that you keep this bottle in a dark cool area for a longer shelf life.</li>
            <li>I also suggest that you keep this bottle in a dark cool area for a longer shelf life.</li>
            <li>I used about 6-10 drops and it covered my hands with a nice thin layer of burn easing oil.  </li>
            <li>The key is to apply the right amount regularly.  </li>
            <li>At first, it only cleared up acne, but with further use it started to clear up things like eczema and skin tags.</li>
            <li>Within a few days you could tell a difference, by a couple weeks it had significantly improved.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a potent, subtly nutty-smelling oil, and if you have an inflammatory skin comndition, it might be just want you need.</li>
            <li>We had previously tried many various treatments to help, and nothing prior to this worked.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different solutions in the past but none seem to have worked out for me.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed a significant reduction in my acne, acne scars, and other various skin problems I have to deal with.</li>
            <li>Nothing seems to work very well or for long term.</li>
            <li>I tried it twice and gave up because the texture was mind of strange and it smells way too much like maple syrup to me.</li>
            <li>Her arms are looking almost back to normal.</li>
            <li>I plan to apply this Tamanu oil everyday to see the full results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of large companies that genetically engineer so many fake products</li>
            <li>I wanted to give enough time to see if it would help my skin problem and so far it has not help clear up my skin problem.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My whole life I tried to really find a cream or an oil that can take care of this dried skin I have.</li>
            <li>I decided to use a bit to test a small part of where I have eczema, and the results aren’t as significant as I hoped.</li>
            <li>so I only use natural products in my home.</li>
            <li>This oil Makes my skin so soft and deeply moisturizes my skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what caused my skin to break out in a rash, but I tried cortisone and it barely helped.</li>
            <li>The main thing I have used it for a dry patch of skin I have had on my hand...</li>
            <li>the only- natural remedy that clears up breakouts on my elbows and scalp.</li>
            <li>Several plaques of psoriasis came off like an old scab, also smoothes the skin.</li>
            <li>I can barely stand it.</li>
            <li>All but the natural cream do work after several applications</li>
            <li>I am hopeful to have finally found a natural remedy for my psoriasis.</li>
            <li>I prefer natural remedies whenever possible and Tamanu Oil has been added to my list.  </li>
            <li>I recently suffered a major allergy attack where I broke out severely with hives and major cystic type spots all over my face and neck!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for others with dry skin.</li>
            <li>used to get horribly dry, itchy, and cracked hands in the winter that would actually bleed and really hurt</li>
            <li>My face cleared right up after using the oil a few times.</li>
            <li>My forehead and nose are extremely dry, my cheeks are oily, and everywhere else on my face is normal.</li>
            <li>I also have acne and eczema, but didn’t want to try an untested foreign product on it initially, so stretch marks/scars it is first.</li>
            <li>started using Tamanu Oil a couple weeks ago, I applied just a couple drops 2 times a day, and my skin finally is not so dry anymore!</li>
            <li>I have psoriasis and this has been the only natural remedy I have found that really clears up my sensitive skins without harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li>definitely highly recommend this for anyone suffering from dry, itchy skin!</li>
            <li>This small bottle is an absolute miracle worker, and I highly recommend it to anybody with any skin bkemishes they are struggling to remove.</li>
            <li>I noticed the difference the very next day, with my skin starting to clear up and not be so irritated.</li>
            <li>I mixed a couple drops in with my usual moisturizer to help it go on better and have it be less oily.</li>
            <li>5 whole stars because this stuff has helped my face clear up with seemingly very little effort.</li>
            <li>I have tried a few other natural options with some success, but it takes time.  </li>
            <li>He washes his hands so frequently that they will become too dry and they will crack.</li>
            <li>The winter used to do an awful number on my hands (itching, cracking, generally dry) until I found out about this wonderful, natural Tamanu Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks for giving me the opportunity to try this little miracle in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t a complete believer in this particular oil at first, because I went through a few kinds of Tamanu Oil that were not effective for me.</li>

            <li> really glad that I did because this tamanu oil has helped my acne tremendously.</li>
            <li> I been researching for new natural treatments and found that Tamanu Oil works on existing acne scars and is especially effective in the prevention of acne scarring.</li>
            <li> The oil is soothing on my skin and does not cause any irritation which is important.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks and not only have I seen a great reduction in my acne</li>
            <li> I decided to try this specific brand because this seller had a lot of great reviews.</li>
            <li> I plan to try to start using it on some light stretch marks soon.</li>
            <li> For a smooth skin as well as for any skin care solution, I prefer this oil to use.</li>
            <li> It felt great on my skin, like instant cooling relief</li>
            <li> began using Tamanu oil daily and over time saw a great improvement in the quality of my skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that changes the product or not, but a friend who works with oils a lot said that it was important.</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth like me now.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is light and not overpowering and it goes on smooth without feeling overly oily.</li>
            <li> Also important is DOES IT WORK?</li>
            <li> but I will say that it was fantastic.  </li>
            <li> These also come in an Amber bottle to help protect the oils from light and faster</li>
            <li> and this would be a great addition to anyone that likes to go camping or hiking and needs instant relief from mother natures irritants.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s additive free.</li>
            <li> This stuff works better than any lotion I own; and I&#x27;ve gone from alligator skin to soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s available in stores.</li>
            <li> When I learnt about Tamanu Oil under Puressant, I immediately ordered one to try based on the good experience I had with their products so far.</li>
            <li> I really wish I had better results like many of the reviewers.</li>
            <li> Tamanu oil is apparently good for old scars, eczema and acne too.</li>
            <li> This brand also was recommended for its high quality and concentrated formula, so this is a pretty good buy in light of that.</li>
            <li> I looked into Tamanu oil and had some friends recommend it ,so I gave it try and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I apply it twice a day (once after showering, another before bed) and my skin dryness has been significantly reduced.  </li>
            <li> He used it twice a day every day for two weeks and saw a significant improvement in the redness on his face.</li>
            <li> She took the time to look through some of the other brands that sell tamanu oil, and he decided that Puressant seemed like a good company; I tend to agree with her!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m highly satisfied and would order from them again (just unfortunately not this oil since it didn&#x27;t help my skin)</li>
            <li> It is also a great product to use on minor skin irritations to disinfect the skin and promote healing.</li>
            <li> I saw immediate results when I applied it after a shower, for some reason it seems to work better after a hot shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is a real high quality product that I’m sure</li>
            <li> I found this product and was lucky to get it before it wasn&#x27;t available anymore.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I found Tamanu Oil, and the results have been fantastic.</li>
            <li> I prefer only natural products, and the Tamanu Oil has worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li> but it does help clean it and for the skin to be healing within a day or two.</li>
            <li> The Tamanu Oil by Puressant arrived in a quick manner securely packaged to prevent damage to the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that is 100% pure and made from Tree Nut Oil.</li>
            <li> love that this oil is all natural and completely additive free which makes me feel even more confident about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have eczema, and nothing out there really seemed to be quite what my skin needed to heal and begin looking better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different products for this treatment, no worked as good as this.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled so far.  </li>
            <li> smell was very nutty for lack of a better word.  </li>
            <li> This tamanu oil seems to be of great quality, and it has helped to reduce the red, patchy appearance my skin has in certain areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Puressant&#x27;s loyal soul and this one</li>
            <li> Luckily I tried it out.</li>
            <li> I did receive my bottle free  or at a promotional discount for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my personal experience and honest opinion of this oil.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no risk in trying the product, because it works amazingly!</li>
            <li> This is a great oil to add to your other oils and read up on all its uses!</li>
            <li> Its a greenish-gold color and its great for reducing redness and inflammation, which makes the acne that is still there a lot less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I absolutely fell in love with this oil within the first week of use.</li>
            <li> It worked fast and it was easy to use.!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works wonderfully, and it soothes my delicate skin...and it works!</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s working to improve my skin, I really don&#x27;t care how it smells!!</li>
            <li> Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase!</li>
            <li> It feels so gentle and easy to be absorbed.</li>
            <li> Best part, the oil is all natural and can be used for your hair and skin as well (honestly the potential uses are endless)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tamanu oil comes highly recommended for anyone who wants to clear up dry/itchy hands or to add some silk and shine to their hair.</li>
            <li> After using Tamanu oil for a few weeks I noticed my skin rashes were diminishing which was a great feat, since I felt it was going no where.</li>
            <li> My skin doctor has a remedy for it and is able to remove most of the red patches quite reasonably.</li>
            <li> How exciting...</li>
            <li> It is quickly absorbed into skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found something all natural rather than</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am a smooth kind of guy with rough skin which doesn&#x27;t add up for me.</li>
            <li> I still get occasional acne and am thrilled that this works for that</li>
            <li> This is 100% natural which I love that.</li>
            <li> I especially find this handy in the summer.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve really enjoyed how this works on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found something all natural rather than</li>
            <li> My hands and cuticles are soft and silky now and look incredibly healthy.</li>
            <li> I applied it every night for a week (that&#x27;s how much the sample lasted) and I noticed right away how smooth my elbows got.</li>
            <li> and I did the research to see that this is a very powerful skin healer that is gentle and rejuvenating.</li>
            <li> Her eczema cleared up pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> First and foremost, it is natural, which is very important to me.</li>
            <li> and once I put this on, it went right to work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This cleared it right up.  </li>
            <li> right?).</li>
            <li> This cleared it right up.</li>
            <li> It also has natural vitamin E and even if you don&#x27;t need it for any of the conditions I mentioned, it&#x27;s great for healing dry skin.</li>
            <li> I am lucky to have found this, I&#x27;ll order more once they are back in stock!</li>
            <li> I’ve always had sensitive skin and recently found out that I am allergic to sulfates – which made caring for my skin even more challenging.</li>
            <li> I heavily recommend this amazing product!</li>
            <li> I used to apply first thing in morning then right before bed.</li>
            <li> and it certainly has done wonders!</li>
            <li> Thank you very much, i used this on my mother and it works like a charm on her fungus toenails</li>
            <li> No laboratory manufactured chemicals with a huge list of side effects, just this naturally pressed wonder that didn&#x27;t bother her at all.  </li>
            <li> but when i do I know exactly how to take care of it.  </li>
            <li> None of them have helped me consistently, but after using tamanu oil I saw results after about a week--and the results lasted.</li>
            <li> However, the reason i am leaving a review here is because it is the only place where I can leave a review for it and let others know that this is a top notch product.</li>
            <li> First thing that caught my attention was the ingredient, it was Foraha Oil.</li>
            <li> Guess what, it started working in the first week</li>
            <li> but the funny thing was, I never touched the plant.</li>
            <li> My sister has also used it successfully to get rid of a small scar.</li>
            <li> The oil originates in Polynesia, where it continues to play an important cultural role.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I ever tried it.  </li>
            <li> I totally can recomment it and will get more of it in the future :)</li>
            <li> so I thought I would give this a try first this time.</li>
            <li> It actually worked better for closing and getting the skin over it to heal than for getting the infection out or bringing it to a head.</li>
            <li> I have almost used up my first bottle and will be ordering another soon.</li>
            <li> The is a 100% money back guarantee on the product, and just about everyone who&#x27;s tried it has been immensely satisfied with their results.</li>
            <li> Besides the sheer number of successes the product has rendered, the price is just phenomenal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely worth it and reasonable for what you&#x27;re getting.</li>
            <li> I think one of the reason it works with so many different skin conditions / problems is because it is anti-viral (shingles, etc.), anti-fungal (eczema, candida), and anti-bacterial all in one oil.</li>
            <li> FAST shipping!</li>
            <li> When I first opened the bottle I couldn&#x27;t seem to get any oil out onto my fingertip.  </li>
            <li> Very nice thick oil.  </li>
            <li> I have been using oils for a long time, but when my daughter found out that she had eczema, I knew I had to learn more about the different types of oils that may be able to assist with her.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re wondering what exactly it is, tamanu oil is extracted from the seeds of a large evergreen tree that is native to parts of Africa, India and Australia.  </li>
            <li> I use this natural oil mainly to help me treating my acne on the back but using it on the whole body feels soft and great from the first day.</li>
            <li> It does have a strong smell but adding this to my other oils and soaps gives green great added benefits while helping mask the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a several weeks now and the scars are becoming lighter.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not 100% full strength on my sensitive</li>
            <li> I have always had oiler skin than most people, and even now when I am older I still get the occasional pimple.  </li>
            <li> just one application  of this amazing product daily can help clear the symptoms of various skin ailments such as acne, eczema, psoriasis, rashes wrinkles and more!</li>
            <li> It not only helps clear up break outs, but keeps my skin smooth once it is clear better than any drug store product I’ve ever used.</li>
            <li> My skin is so dry that I’m always looking for something to work better or to give me relief.</li>
            <li> I get outbreaks of eczema on my fingertips in dry winter, and summer gardening that make my skin crack, and tamanu oil helps better than anything I ever got from the dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had naturally dry skin and most lotions don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> This product is certainly nature’s way of healing and we will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> After reading a bit more about the properties of this oil, I decided to try it out on my dry skin!</li>
            <li> The Tamanu Oil, which comes from the Foraha Tree, is of a very high quality (it comes from Madagascar).</li>
            <li> My skin was smooth and the redness had gone down significantly.</li>
            <li> was disappearing fast.</li>
            <li> So you can imagine my shock that this oil is one of the only products that has made me virtually acne free</li>
            <li> Plus the price is very affordable.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended brand!</li>
            <li> , none of them really worked...</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> This oil is very soothing to the skin</li>
            <li> I use it for my eczema and it really helps</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a few days and my skin already feels better and is looking a lot more</li>
            <li> This  herbal oil is very helpful  on my face.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> I really like how it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> I tried to apply a lightly scented lotion shortly after applying this oil and that seemed to mask the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I really wanted to get rid of it</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> His skin looks so much</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Tamanu Oil!</li>
            <li> Thanks@</li>
            <li> and I really like the quality of their oils.</li>
            <li> like how gentle this is on my skin and that it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been very helpful in controlling break outs and stopping the itchiness.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t require much.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This oil is very soothing to the skin</li>
            <li> I use this twice a day; after washing my face in the morning before putting on my moisturizer, and when I&#x27;m getting ready for bed at night.</li>
            <li> I was very surprise.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks now and so far so good.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something all natural and pure, that is a fix for just about any beauty ailment, this is the right the product.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to my future result, hopefully it will clear it all up soon :)</li>
            <li> Tamanu oil in general has an aroma to it not bad</li>
            <li> oil supposedly has skin healing, antineuralgic, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antibiotic, and antioxidant properties, making it a very useful topical agent in the skincare area.</li>
            <li> My Tamanu oil bottle is easy to apply and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I first heard of Tamanu oil on my long and arduous search for the best skin care products for my finicky sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Unlike other products we&#x27;ve used in the past,this product works likes magic because soon after applying it on his skin,we noticed there was a change in skin color as the eczema and acne</li>
            <li> hear it has many other uses, but it&#x27;s worked well for what I&#x27;ve needed.</li>
            <li> As well as so many other things.  </li>
            <li> It’s supposed to help with scars, stretch marks, psoriasis, acne, eczema, bug bites, stings, enflamed skin, burns, infections, fungal infections, and many other skin ailments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed it&#x27;s healing a lot quicker than normal!</li>
            <li> I have tried other tamanu oil and love this one.</li>
            <li> My skin is much clearer and smooth than it ever has been and it doesn’t dry out my face like in-store acne products.</li>
            <li> Tamanu Oil absorbs quickly, without leaving any oily residue and is fast acting.</li>
            <li> That is where this Tamanu Oil comes in, it has cleared my skin and kept it clear consistently.  </li>
            <li> that was still dark after many months.</li>
            <li> t has worked great so far in managing a few different skin issues.</li>
            <li> and it started clearing my face up even more and clears up the dark spots as well.</li>
            <li> but I distinctly remember reading some time back that the oil had healing powers not just cosmetically but also for many other ailments.</li>
            <li> I use this in my moisturizer made of both almond and jojoba oil and really think this has helped with some scars I have and preventing new breakouts.  </li>
            <li> still am able to see the marks but alot less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have it mainly on my feet.  </li>
            <li> I can feel the elasticity in my skin again in the middle of winter and the relief is more than short lived!</li>
            <li> but my main problem is chronic and persistent psoriasis.  </li>
            <li> I think this particular fragrance is an acquired smell because I’ve heard some people don’t mind it while some don’t’ particularly care for it.</li>
            <li> and you will have more than enough to last you quite a while.</li>
            <li> daily application of Tamanu Oil has kept my hands soft and smooth all winter.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> highly recommend using this oil.</li>
            <li> I will highly recommend this herbal oil.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have highly allergic reactions to insect bites.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this oil and the Puressant line.</li>
            <li> I buy the Puressant brand because it always is high quality, delivered on time and as promised.</li>
            <li> This is a really effective essential oil for foot and nail fungus and a host of other things.</li>
            <li> I guess all natural was the way to go!!</li>
            <li> Puressant takes care to only include the best ingredients in this Tamanu Oil as it is 100% Pure Cold Pressed.  </li>
            <li> It goes on very light but makes a big difference with cracked, dry, or even blistered skin.</li>
            <li> be careful using this with light color clothing and bedding..</li>
            <li> My husband works with concrete, it dries out his hands</li>
            <li> Just be careful that you don&#x27;t wear light colored clothes over the skin where you apply the oil as it might stain.</li>
            <li> It does smell funny though, but that&#x27;s just how tamanu oil smells in general.</li>
            <li> (I still have a few spots here and there, but the difference is massive)!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be continuing my use, and hopefully I&#x27;ll continue to see fantastic results!</li>
            <li> Firstly, I have to say what really counts: that this oil actually works!</li>
            <li> The little dip stick allows for easy application on my hands without getting too much out at once.</li>
            <li> I started looking for a natural remedy and tried many different types of essential oils including Tea Tree and Lavender, which helped some, but I was still looking for something that was going to keep my skin clear.  </li>
            <li> : true to the seller&#x27;s advertised guarantee, I received a full refund for the product since it was not effective for me.</li>
            <li> They are clear and 100% natural and very affordable.</li>
            <li> Within the first month I saw vast improvement.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by first saying that I actually can&#x27;t get this product shipped from Amazon as I don&#x27;t reside in the US.</li>
            <li> And not only has it changed my life physically, I&#x27;ve also felt better emotionally as a result.</li>
            <li> A definite must have oil for a first aid kit as it has antibiotic properties to it.</li>
            <li> and within hours (hours....NOT days)....it is completely gone!  </li>
            <li> I’m so relieved to have finally found something that really works!</li>
            <li> This new oil has completely healed my my cracking peeling skin and it feels refreshes all day.  </li>
            <li> As I get older I&#x27;m dealing with consistent dry skin issue.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t like wasting a bunch of money for a large bottle that will last longer than its shelf life.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone as it is made from pure natural ingredients and it does wonder to any skin problems.</li>
            <li> I did begin to see my eczema become less and less prominent within the first week,</li>
            <li> It clear up all my face.</li>
            <li> It indeed is and it helped me clear all the acne that I had on my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I could see clear results within a week</li>
            <li> I have been really into using natural oils lately such as coconut and argon oils.</li>
            <li> It has started to clear up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for months for a natural skin care product to help heal my skin from all of my acne.</li>
            <li> Tamanu oil is 100% natural and created by a trusted manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I’ve been dealing with eczema and adult acne for years.</li>
            <li> I also started using it on my face to treat adult acne</li>
            <li> Nothing we tried had worked.&lt;br /&gt;After a week or using this oil his soft are so soft.</li>
            <li> The pores of my skin  is reducing and lighten  the old scars.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for couple weeks so far.</li>
            <li> I try to use natural products; but lots of them do not work.  </li>
            <li> in fact, my psoriasis continues to worsen and flare even with frequent application.</li>
            <li> My acne almost completely disappeared because of this oil.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil to cure my acne, and it completely blew my away.</li>
            <li> This is an all natural oil that comes from the tamanu tree from the tropics of Asia.</li>
            <li> As a result of this, I have scars that are up to 10 years old.</li>
            <li> While searching  for a natural solution to cover the duality of my problem I came across a page that recommended Tamanu Oil.  </li>
            <li> You really have nothing to lose and potentially everything to gain.</li>
            <li> The oil glides on softly while the skin heals and regains its luster.</li>
            <li> I would really recommend this to someone who has moderate to severe acne and cant find anything else that works.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that was natural to help with this issue.</li>
            <li> I have tried steroid creams, a gel from my dermatologist and an all natural homeopathic cream.  </li>
            <li> The last few years I have noticed that my wrinkles have become more noticeable.  </li>
            <li> also suggest that you keep this bottle in a dark cool area for a longer shelf life.</li>
            <li> I also suggest that you keep this bottle in a dark cool area for a longer shelf life.</li>
            <li> I used about 6-10 drops and it covered my hands with a nice thin layer of burn easing oil.  </li>
            <li> The key is to apply the right amount regularly.  </li>
            <li> At first, it only cleared up acne, but with further use it started to clear up things like eczema and skin tags.</li>
            <li> Within a few days you could tell a difference, by a couple weeks it had significantly improved.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a potent, subtly nutty-smelling oil, and if you have an inflammatory skin comndition, it might be just want you need.</li>
            <li> We had previously tried many various treatments to help, and nothing prior to this worked.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different solutions in the past but none seem to have worked out for me.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed a significant reduction in my acne, acne scars, and other various skin problems I have to deal with.</li>
            <li> Nothing seems to work very well or for long term.</li>
            <li> I tried it twice and gave up because the texture was mind of strange and it smells way too much like maple syrup to me.</li>
            <li> Her arms are looking almost back to normal.</li>
            <li> I plan to apply this Tamanu oil everyday to see the full results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of large companies that genetically engineer so many fake products</li>
            <li> I wanted to give enough time to see if it would help my skin problem and so far it has not help clear up my skin problem.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My whole life I tried to really find a cream or an oil that can take care of this dried skin I have.</li>
            <li> I decided to use a bit to test a small part of where I have eczema, and the results aren’t as significant as I hoped.</li>

            <li> Thanks for giving me the opportunity to try this little miracle in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a complete believer in this particular oil at first, because I went through a few kinds of Tamanu Oil that were not effective for me.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s all natural ingredients so that I know that I&#x27;m not putting any weird ingredients on my skin like other acne remedies.</li>
            <li> I live in a very cold weather climate hand keeping you skin soft, clear and smooth</li>
            <li> I was searching for oils for such a long time and tried a lot of different ones before I finally found Tamanu Oil.</li>
            <li> I mainly bought this because I tried a sample a few months ago.</li>
            <li> I apply a little before bed on any area that is starting to break out and by morning, my skin is clear again!</li>
            <li> Very little of it is really required for it to work.  </li>
            <li> Very little of it is really required for it to work.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like using harsh chemicals on my skin, especially since I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much in the way of results because of my past history with &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I try to only use natural ingredients in my skin care products because my skin is super sensitive and breaks out bad with regular otc formulas.</li>
            <li> I have used this for the occasional acne breakout, dry skin on my elbows</li>
            <li> I recently bought Tamanu Oil in order to deal with my dry skin problems.</li>
            <li> Every winter my shoulders and back get so dry</li>
            <li> Tamanu Oil not only stops the itching but makes the dry, scaly spots disappear in a matter of days.  </li>
            <li> Within a few weeks, I noticed a big improvement in the rash and my itching went away in the first few days.</li>
            <li> HI&lt;br /&gt;I had never heard of Tamanu Oil before put have used other essential oils including Argon Oil and other​ types of essential oils.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks my husband clearly noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li> and I the product lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> My acne was nearly cleared up in just a few days.  </li>
            <li> Help improve the looks of scarring, stretch marks, minor cuts and abrasions, rashes, sores.</li>
            <li> After some research, I discovered that Tamanu oil is a natural substance that can reduce inflammation and destroy bacteria.</li>
            <li> but I really wanted to find something less harsh and 100%</li>
            <li> I suffer from eczema whenever there is seasonal change or when the weather is too dry.</li>
            <li> and I had a friend who tried it for her daughters acne and dry skin.</li>
            <li> skin where some of it is dry and itchy, and others get oily and yuck.</li>
            <li> This oil helps with patchy dry skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin stays so dry and peels and cracks.  </li>
            <li> night, she would wash her face and then pat it dry</li>
            <li> Anyways, it helped get rid of the dry patch in 3 days of application.</li>
            <li> oil works on all skin types from dry scaly skin to oily skin.</li>
            <li> I used the sample on my elbows, where I had severaly dry skin.</li>
            <li> This itchy, dry skin, condition is something that has affected me for years</li>
            <li> I have a dry rash that appears on my hands when I am stressed.</li>
            <li> , I mean I tell you my skin is so sensitive brushing it up against a wash cloth or towel could leave it red... but</li>
            <li> My family has tried the oil out and neither of us ever got any side effects which can only mean that it is a natural product.</li>
            <li> I am so sad this item is out of stock right now!</li>
            <li> I usually use tea tree oil to clear it up, but that seems to have stopped working for me.  </li>
            <li> I spent a lot trying different acne treatments range from acne cream, acne lotion, acne gel to other acne remedies and nothing worked.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve had no success treating my problems the traditional way, with face washes and scrubs and exfoliation, etc.</li>
            <li> Definitly recommend this one if you have the same problems as me, since it&#x27;s just for such little price!</li>
            <li> I have eczema and I have tried multiple natural remedies to reduce flare up, particularly during the cold weather months.</li>
            <li> Typically a steroid cream is the only thing that works.</li>
            <li> That was enough to sell us on using this product regularly, but then her outbreak cleared up days faster than it usually does.  </li>
            <li> Besides help with acne, is said to fades stretch marks, helps improve the appearance of scars, and aids in the healing of minor cuts, burns, rashes, eczema, rosacea, wrinkles, aging and other skin conditions.</li>
            <li> I only rubbed a little bit of oil on it once a day</li>
            <li> In the thicker areas, her face did turn a little red.  </li>
            <li> Has seriously helped my adult acne and helped with my daughters teen black heads.</li>
            <li> I would recommend giving this oil a try; the company really stands behind their product.</li>
            <li> A few days later</li>
            <li> I have tried just about every lotion there is with minimal relief.</li>
            <li> I bought the 1oz bottle of the raspberry oil almost 2 months ago and have still not really made a dent in it.</li>
            <li> When I took the lid back off the center piece was firmly placed inside the lid.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive if the product is not suitable and will feel &amp;#34;spiky&amp;#34; and slight redness almost upon application.</li>
            <li> I live in a cold climate which equals major dry skin/ damage.</li>
            <li> A little of the oil goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> During the winter I have applied this oil twice a day to rough patches on my arms and hands and after a few days the dry patches are beginning to disappear.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other things on the market, but nothing worked as well as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used this oil for years when it was in other products.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> , you ship other products over to India, why not this one???</li>
            <li> Can’t wait to try all the other things as they come</li>
            <li> It cleared it up in the same amount of time as the prescriptions usually do.</li>
            <li> The small 1oz bottle lasts a long time because you only use a few drops at a time.</li>
            <li> A small dab on open cracks (after drying hands) will close within a day or so.</li>
            <li> I usually use it on nights where I feel like my skin needs extra healing like when I feel a pimple coming on.</li>
            <li> an I tried several products to clear the disturbing look on his skin as he too was always worried.</li>
            <li> For the past several months, I would get these huge painful pimples on my face.</li>
            <li> You only need a few small drops and it works miracles.</li>
            <li> When an insect bite recedes it leaves dark spot/ scars on my skin.</li>
            <li> I consider myself an essential oils fanatic.</li>
            <li> started using this product sparingly on my dark spots and acne marks, and noticed that both were fading, and my face seemed to be responding well to the oil.</li>
            <li> I had used a steroid type ointment for years on my face and it made my skin thin and sensitive to everything.  </li>
            <li> I mix it with other oils for my face and body and put a little in my shampoo as well.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve tried other oils and lotions that didn&#x27;t do what you wanted them to, do your research on tamanu oil for yourself!</li>
            <li> fragrance of the Tamanu oil is bold and earthy, which isn’t unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used creams in the past that were prescribed by my dermotologist that helped the itching but did not reduce the dry spots.  </li>
            <li> However the contents of the medication is not suitable for long term usage.</li>
            <li> I noticed the breakouts were less and over time</li>
            <li> I know it was less than a week.</li>
            <li> Less bumps, less irritation</li>
            <li> Seriously, I cannot wait until it comes back in stock.</li>
            <li> Also notice significantly less redness in my face.</li>
            <li> I seriously have been on every oral medication and applied every cream that has been on the market for the last 40 years.</li>
            <li> I used other creams, but it just made the bumps come back worse than before.</li>
            <li> This is one thing that I had heard a little bit about and had not tried up until a couple of months ago when my wife ordered it for me.</li>
            <li> I just recieved this today and dabbed a little bit on my finger to put on my scalp psoriasis, i can already tell that the scales feel softer than before.</li>
            <li> We tried everything before so this is her little miracle</li>
            <li> I brought this because I have had a toe nail fungus for a little over 6 years now and it has been quite embarrassing.</li>
            <li> Puressant uses tamanu from Madagascar and is 100% Pure and cold</li>
            <li> The fragrance took a few days of getting used to.</li>
            <li> Every time I shower, my skin gets chapped and few things seem to work in moisturizing it in my case.  </li>
            <li> but after a few days, I began to see that spot was getting lighter.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have a few areas of what’s sort of like psoriasis I guess, and it had it clearing up within a matter of days.</li>
            <li> Acne start drying and gone in few days.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended me a few things</li>
            <li> I think the smell goes away once it soaks in your skin after a few minutes</li>
            <li> For example, I burned myself a few days ago when lighting a bunsen burner for my chemistry project.</li>
            <li> It is not filed with a laundry list of harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> It has gotten rid of some acne that has been a trouble spot for years.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with natural oils especially in the cold winter if you have dry skin</li>
            <li> For a while, I have been a little skeptical of these oils; I never thought a simple oil could help something that doctors can&#x27;t even fix.</li>
            <li> so there was just a little moisture left on her face and then apply a very thin layer of the tamanu oil to her face.  </li>
            <li> and this is devastating as my appearance is a very important part of my job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My fifteen year old son had eczema and suffers acne on his skin too.</li>
            <li> i had to throw it away :/</li>
            <li> It is unbelievable</li>
            <li> not sure where it came from.</li>
            <li> I apply a few drops each day and have come to find a noticeable difference in my skin!</li>
            <li> I have suffered from psoriasis since I was a small child.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also been using Tamanu Oil on my hands and it has done wonders - no more peeling skin and cracked knuckles.  </li>
            <li> And though the bottle seems quite small, all you have to do is dilute the oil</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this works or not.</li>
            <li> I was not sure what Tamanu oil all did, When I looked it up</li>
            <li> She rubbed in a little extra on the bad areas of her face where the acne was a little thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have suffered from Psoriasis since I was really little, and usually the only way to get rid of it is a very expensive cream from my doctor.</li>
            <li> My horrible acne I&#x27;ve had for several months has almost completely healed.</li>
            <li> Over the years, it&#x27;s a constant dark spot that has been annoying me.</li>
            <li> I usually tend to use makeup to cover up blemishes (which makes the problem worse)</li>
            <li> Seriously, after two applications, it seemed to have lightened some.</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil hoping it would help with my acne breakouts (seriously, I&#x27;m almost 40, when does it stop,</li>
            <li> I decided to give this oil a try because it was 100% natural and I was sick and tired of chemically enhanced creams/lotions.</li>
            <li> She was very frustrated as none of them gave positive results.</li>
            <li> But no good result.</li>
            <li> The dermatologist told me that product containing oil are bad for me and will only make it worse.</li>
            <li> In the winter they get dry and itch badly, but this relieves that itch and also adds moisture to my skin.</li>
            <li> Smell is very bad, but after a few applications I could already see my dry skin/eczema dissipating!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m growing tired of lotions with the greasiness, clogging pores etc.</li>
            <li> and when I let him out to play he gets worse.</li>
            <li> have give a small sample to my sister in law who suffers from eczema on her arms, and I&#x27;m hoping she starts to see results as well.</li>
            <li> The oil has a weird smell like chicken base and maple syrup put together, but so far it works well.</li>
            <li> Living in a cold weather state is brutal on my skin, especially on my feet!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical as everything these days seems to help acne etc etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was skeptical before</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I suffer from eczema whenever there is seasonal change or when the weather is too dry. My skin doctor has a remedy for it and is able to remove most of the red patches quite reasonably. However the contents of the medication is not suitable for long term usage. I have been on the lookout for a suitable skin care product for my day to day application. When I learnt about Tamanu Oil under Puressant, I immediately ordered one to try based on the good experience I had with their products so far. The fragrance took a few days of getting used to. But I have been loving it since then. The oil is soothing on my skin and does not cause any irritation which is important. My skin is very sensitive if the product is not suitable and will feel &amp;#34;spiky&amp;#34; and slight redness almost upon application. Hence I am quite assured that the Tamanu Oil works quite well for me. I have been using it for a few weeks now and so far so good.</li>
            <li> My fifteen year old son had eczema and suffers acne on his skin too.My wife an I tried several products to clear the disturbing look on his skin as he too was always worried.A day came when my wife told me that a friend of hers introduced Tamanu OIl urging her to give it a trial.Unlike other products we&#x27;ve used in the past,this product works likes magic because soon after applying it on his skin,we noticed there was a change in skin color as the eczema and acne was disappearing fast.Soon after some days,all acne and eczema skin infection was gone and my son was so pleased.I am so grateful to my wife&#x27;s friend who introduced the oil and I also recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> The last few years I have noticed that my wrinkles have become more noticeable.  I decided to order and try the Tamanu Oil to see if it would make a difference.  I am happy to say that the Tamano Oil is doing a great job.  The key is to apply the right amount regularly.  After a few weeks my husband clearly noticed a difference.  How exciting...the product is the purest of its kind.  Puressant takes care to only include the best ingredients in this Tamanu Oil as it is 100% Pure Cold Pressed.  The price is one of the lowest on the market.  Give it a try you will be happy you did.</li>
            <li> It was ok..I wish it came with a dropper..be careful using this with light color clothing and bedding.. It turned my white sheets yellow..</li>
            <li> I absolutely fell in love with this oil within the first week of use. At first, it only cleared up acne, but with further use it started to clear up things like eczema and skin tags. By the end of the bottle, I felt rid of all blemishes on my body. I could run my hand up my arm without feeling obstructions from bumps or such. This small bottle is an absolute miracle worker, and I highly recommend it to anybody with any skin bkemishes they are struggling to remove.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for months for a natural skin care product to help heal my skin from all of my acne. I finally found it in Tamanu oil. I&#x27;m not a fan of large companies that genetically engineer so many fake products so I only use natural products in my home. Tamanu oil is 100% natural and created by a trusted manufacturer. I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks and not only have I seen a great reduction in my acne I&#x27;ve also seen some healing in acne scars. I&#x27;m so pleased with the results and will be stocking up on more soon!</li>
            <li> HI&lt;br /&gt;I had never heard of Tamanu Oil before put have used other essential oils including Argon Oil and other​ types of essential oils. So I thought I would give this a try based on all the great reviews and I had a friend who tried it for her daughters acne and dry skin. I live in a very cold weather climate hand keeping you skin soft, clear and smooth is a constant challenge regardless of what you use. So I tried this and thought it might be something to add to my regiment of oils. Well, let me tell you, I don&#x27;t need to add it to anything because it is the ONLY thing I need to use. It is completely amazing, smells great and is 100% natural. I love this stuff, I am putting it on everything. You only need a few small drops and it works miracles. I have used this for the occasional acne breakout, dry skin on my elbows and it is amazing on your feet. If you are looking for something all natural and pure, that is a fix for just about any beauty ailment, this is the right the product.</li>
            <li> I have to be one of the only women in her mid thirties to still get acne around my monthly cycle and this is devastating as my appearance is a very important part of my job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister said she had some luck with Tamanu Oil and she turned me on to this product.  I was skeptical as everything these days seems to help acne etc etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to say for me this worked miracles for my acne.  I noticed the breakouts were less and over time they even disappeared.  I still get the occasional blemish but when i do I know exactly how to take care of it.  I am a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I love this oil! I have really bad acne, and I&#x27;ve tried everything under the sun! I don&#x27;t like using harsh chemicals on my skin, especially since I have very sensitive skin. This tamanu oil has been a godsend! It works wonderfully, and it soothes my delicate skin...and it works! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My sister was suffering from acne and she has tried almost all the creams out there. She was very frustrated as none of them gave positive results. Then I came across this product and decided to give it to her. To my surprise, Tamanu Oil helped her to get rid of acne within just one week. She is highly impressed with the product as well and I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> This is a superb product and it did just the trick. I had some fungus developing under my toe-nails and once I put this on, it went right to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions were very simple to follow and I the product lasts a long time. I have tried other things on the market, but nothing worked as well as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would get this if you are trying to get rid of toe fungus, control psoriasis or even just fight acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a quality pick and it will solve your skin problems!</li>
            <li> Oh snap, this stuff is amazing. I have suffered from Psoriasis since I was really little, and usually the only way to get rid of it is a very expensive cream from my doctor. A friend told me this worked for her so I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested it on a patch of Psoriasis that was on my knee, and within 24 hours it was just a red patch. It was totally incredible. I would definetly recommend this to anyone suffering with skin conditions.</li>
            <li> I recently bought Tamanu Oil in order to deal with my dry skin problems. Every time I shower, my skin gets chapped and few things seem to work in moisturizing it in my case.  I looked into Tamanu oil and had some friends recommend it ,so I gave it try and was not disappointed. I apply it twice a day (once after showering, another before bed) and my skin dryness has been significantly reduced.  This brand also was recommended for its high quality and concentrated formula, so this is a pretty good buy in light of that.</li>
            <li> I’ve been dealing with eczema and adult acne for years. I finally decided to give Tamanu Oil a try and I’m so happy I did! I started using it on parts of my arms that get eczema in the cold weather and I saw a noticeable difference within days. My skin was smooth and the redness had gone down significantly. I also started using it on my face to treat adult acne and I saw my skin clearing up more and more each day. This is a real high quality product that I’m sure will help most skin problems.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I&#x27;ve had acne for years, and like most acne sufferers - I&#x27;ve tried literally everything to get rid of it, none of which worked for me. Well I decided to take a shot at using Tamanu oil, which like the others; I didn&#x27;t expect to work. So you can imagine my shock that this oil is one of the only products that has made me virtually acne free (I still have a few spots here and there, but the difference is massive)!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be continuing my use, and hopefully I&#x27;ll continue to see fantastic results!</li>
            <li> I use this on my back for my acne that I get back there once in a while. It has cleared it up perfectly! I never have any acne anymore even with the hotter weather and me working outside a lot. The summer is usually the worst for me but this has hopefully changed that starting this year. Definitely will be getting this again.</li>
            <li> I have used this oil for years when it was in other products. I love having the oil itself. I use it for all skin conditions. I began mixing up my own skin remedies with coconut oil, coca butter, and more. This is a great addition to my self made lotions as it helps with many skin conditions. I find it is best to treat my skin when it is healthy so I do not have flare ups. Awesome product and I highly recommend it for those who find problems with beauty products like I have.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. I use it to make hair conditioner.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say that I have problems with acne but I get them constantly on one spot of my face. Over the years, it&#x27;s a constant dark spot that has been annoying me. I&#x27;ve tried virtually everything but the spot just remains. My mom found this from one of her church friends and told me to try it out. I was skeptical at first but after a few days, I began to see that spot was getting lighter. I guess all natural was the way to go!!</li>
            <li> I received this oil as a gift and I am so incredibly thankful that I did! I’ve always had sensitive skin and recently found out that I am allergic to sulfates – which made caring for my skin even more challenging. I had never heard of Tamanu Oil before but tried it on some blemishes and was incredibly pleased to see the results. My face cleared right up after using the oil a few times. I usually tend to use makeup to cover up blemishes (which makes the problem worse) but now I don’t have to anymore!</li>
            <li> Waste of money. I wanted to give enough time to see if it would help my skin problem and so far it has not help clear up my skin problem.&lt;br /&gt;I will be contacting Amazon to see if I can return for refund.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. I&#x27;m a Puressant&#x27;s loyal soul and this one made it again for me. I use this natural oil mainly to help me treating my acne on the back but using it on the whole body feels soft and great from the first day. I also apply some on my hands after working out. Plus the price is very affordable. Highly recommended brand!</li>
            <li> I tried this Tamanu Oil and have to admit that I was totally amazed. I have a few areas of what’s sort of like psoriasis I guess, and it had it clearing up within a matter of days. I know it was less than a week. This is awesome since I have tried every type of creams and lotions you can buy and have had no results with any of them. I love the fact that is 100% pure and made from Tree Nut Oil. Plus it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or oily to my skin. I’m a believer!</li>
            <li> Tamanu Oil is amazing. It is a well known healer for skin ailments. I decided to try this specific brand because this seller had a lot of great reviews. I purchased this for my dad who has really bad rosacea. He used it twice a day every day for two weeks and saw a significant improvement in the redness on his face. we will update after we have used it for a month but so far, it is excellent!</li>
            <li> My friend told me about Tamanu Oil benefits that it helped her to get rid of eczema.&lt;br /&gt;I was very skeptical, I have never used oil on my skin (it gives me weird feeling) but I tried so many different products, none of them really worked...&lt;br /&gt;I started using Tamanu Oil a couple weeks ago, I applied just a couple drops 2 times a day, and my skin finally is not so dry anymore!</li>
            <li> My skin is so dry that I’m always looking for something to work better or to give me relief. I’ve tried all kinds of creams, lotions and butters and oils but  I think I’ve found the answer in Tamanu Oil. I love the way it feels and absorbs in my skin. The best part is that I’m not scaly and dry again in one hour. Most oils will provide temporary relief but this Tamanu Oil is giving me longer-lasting results and I love it. I just told my sister that this may be the answer to our prayers! Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> I like this tamanu oil. It is quickly absorbed into skin. I mix it with other oils for my face and body and put a little in my shampoo as well. Works great.  I recommend it. You can&#x27;t go wrong with natural oils especially in the cold winter if you have dry skin</li>
            <li> I was experiencing a bit of skin irritation and rash.  This cleared it right up.  I&#x27;m glad I found something all natural rather than having to use some strong prescription drug.  Very little of it is really required for it to work.  This oil is very soothing to the skin and I noticed smoothing my skin as well.</li>
            <li> I use it for my eczema and it really helps</li>
            <li> This Tamanu Oil is always going out of stock! SO GET THIS WHILE YOU CAN. 5 whole stars because this stuff has helped my face clear up with seemingly very little effort. My skin is CRAZY weird. I definitely have &amp;#34;combination&amp;#34; skin where some of it is dry and itchy, and others get oily and yuck. Nothing worked for me. No cleanser, no not even the stuff that is featured on infomercials. My mother in law actually, of all people, tipped me off to this stuff, and actually let me try some of hers. She buys it for her husband&#x27;s eczema and I thought, heck, if it works wonders for that (I&#x27;ve seen the before and after and was actually wondering what he was using) I thought why not? Within the first month I saw vast improvement. Less bumps, less irritation, I mean I tell you my skin is so sensitive brushing it up against a wash cloth or towel could leave it red... but NOT ANYMORE. Today I bid adieu to my unmanageable and often surly skin... I love the results I&#x27;ve been seeing and I can only improve from here. Seriously, I cannot wait until it comes back in stock. I need more of this in my life. I feel so peachy now. :) Yay!</li>
            <li> My husband works with concrete, it dries out his hands something terrible. Nothing we tried had worked.&lt;br /&gt;After a week or using this oil his soft are so soft. The deep cracks are gone along with the pain of closing his fists.&lt;br /&gt;We highly recommend using this oil. Its great for all kinds of skin aliments.</li>
            <li> I first heard of Tamanu oil on my long and arduous search for the best skin care products for my finicky sensitive skin. Any kind of irritation causes me to break out, so having a pure tamanu oil to help me keep my peachy complexion was a great find for my skin care arsenal. It not only helps clear up break outs, but keeps my skin smooth once it is clear better than any drug store product I’ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I received this in the mail recently. For a while, I have been a little skeptical of these oils; I never thought a simple oil could help something that doctors can&#x27;t even fix. However, this one seems to be working like a charm. I have only been using it for a few days and my skin already feels better and is looking a lot more healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using it on this scar on my leg that was still dark after many months. Seriously, after two applications, it seemed to have lightened some. The picture is one I just took, before and 3 days later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, I don&#x27;t think it smells the best; however, my boyfriend thought it smelled good. If it&#x27;s working to improve my skin, I really don&#x27;t care how it smells!! I plan to try to start using it on some light stretch marks soon. I will definitely update the outcome!!! Thanks for giving me the opportunity to try this little miracle in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This item was received free for the purpose of testing, for a honest and unbiased review*</li>
            <li> Firstly, I have to say what really counts: that this oil actually works! I&#x27;ve used all sorts of oils for my acne including tea tree oil, aloe vera gel, lemongrass etc. None of them have helped me consistently, but after using tamanu oil I saw results after about a week--and the results lasted. I have very mixed up combination skin. My forehead and nose are extremely dry, my cheeks are oily, and everywhere else on my face is normal. I needed a product that worked well for all 3, and this is the one. Now tamanu oil is my go to daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by first saying that I actually can&#x27;t get this product shipped from Amazon as I don&#x27;t reside in the US. However, the reason i am leaving a review here is because it is the only place where I can leave a review for it and let others know that this is a top notch product. My cousin when returning from the US carried this along with her and she got a couple of extra bottles along too. First thing that caught my attention was the ingredient, it was Foraha Oil. This is a peculiar type of nut not found in many parts of the world but I distinctly remember reading some time back that the oil had healing powers not just cosmetically but also for many other ailments. Anyways, I just wanted to see if it could treat body sores and acnes. Guess what, it started working in the first week itself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Superb product and I believe this is 100% organic with not additives. My family has tried the oil out and neither of us ever got any side effects which can only mean that it is a natural product. Just one request to Puressant, you ship other products over to India, why not this one??? Please start shipping internationally soon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a natural herbal oil which I found very effective. It worked for me, and I&#x27;m glad that I found it. For a smooth skin as well as for any skin care solution, I prefer this oil to use. It even helps to cure any skin problem such as Acne, Eczema etc. For curing nail fungus, it also works well. My experience of using Tamanu Oil is extremely good. I will highly recommend this herbal oil.</li>
            <li> Puressant Tamanu Oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a great experience the first time I used Tamanu oil. I have eczema, and nothing out there really seemed to be quite what my skin needed to heal and begin looking better. This is one thing that I had heard a little bit about and had not tried up until a couple of months ago when my wife ordered it for me. She took the time to look through some of the other brands that sell tamanu oil, and he decided that Puressant seemed like a good company; I tend to agree with her! They actually guarantee their product and respond to customers, which makes me feel  I don&#x27;t like to put just anything on my skin. This tamanu oil seems to be of great quality, and it has helped to reduce the red, patchy appearance my skin has in certain areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a potent, subtly nutty-smelling oil, and if you have an inflammatory skin comndition, it might be just want you need. I did begin to see my eczema become less and less prominent within the first week, which I&#x27;m thrilled about. If you&#x27;ve tried other oils and lotions that didn&#x27;t do what you wanted them to, do your research on tamanu oil for yourself! I&#x27;m a big fan.</li>
            <li> This  herbal oil is very helpful  on my face. I suffer from acne for 2 years. I used different products  as recommended by friends and family. But no good result.No improvement.But when I started using it  I was amazed how it works. It clear up all my face. Acne start drying and gone in few days.The pores of my skin  is reducing and lighten  the old scars. I love to recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I have acne and I have some scaring from having basel cell skin cancer.  My acne was nearly cleared up in just a few days.  The scaring generated from having the skin cancer removed, was definitely reduced after using this produce for several days.  I have not found anything that has diminished the scaring except this stuff!  Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I had very bad problems with acne on my shoulders. The dermatologist told me that product containing oil are bad for me and will only make it worse. I bought, against the suggestion of my dermatologist, this product because my friend told me it was great. It indeed is and it helped me clear all the acne that I had on my shoulders. I recommend this product for sure!</li>
            <li> Okay I did expect softness..but I did not expect the deep lines between my eyes to begin to diminish. I also use it on my neck and have noticed a difference there also. I love it.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this oil a try because it was 100% natural and I was sick and tired of chemically enhanced creams/lotions. I&#x27;m am so glad I went this route! I couldn&#x27;t be happier with how this oil worked out for me. I kept getting rashes on my chest and upper arms and I had no idea why! My doctor recommended me a few things but it didn&#x27;t really work. I got this oil and started applying it onto my rash. I noticed the difference the very next day, with my skin starting to clear up and not be so irritated. I love how great this product is while being totally natural. Wonderful find on my part.</li>
            <li> I think it is a great option for someone like me don’t quite like the tea tree oil scent. This one smell so great and does good work for the acne since earlier of this year. I have been using it for couple weeks so far. I really like how it feels on my skin. It feels so gentle and easy to be absorbed. I use it before putting on moisturizer before bed. I have noticed pores are finer, skin is smoother and acne is under control now. I was skeptical before but now I am sold totally. Nice product.</li>
            <li> I just recieved this today and dabbed a little bit on my finger to put on my scalp psoriasis, i can already tell that the scales feel softer than before. The oil has a weird smell like chicken base and maple syrup put together, but so far it works well. Looking forward to my future result, hopefully it will clear it all up soon :)</li>
            <li> This cleanser works great for my eczema.  I have it mainly on my feet.  I rub the Tamanu Oil on my feet twice a day and its totally cleared up.  In addition my feet feel great!  The oils have soften my feet and toes.  I try to use natural products; but lots of them do not work.  But the Tamanu Oil is an exception....smells good and works great!  Highly recommended for others with dry skin.</li>
            <li> this smelled so bad.. i had to throw it away :/</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and after years of cortisteroids and adjustments to my diet, I decided to turn to tamanu oil. unfortunately it has not improved the condition or appearance of my skin at all. in fact, my psoriasis continues to worsen and flare even with frequent application. I really wish I had better results like many of the reviewers. regarding the smell, I would describe it as brown sugar and maple syrup. it&#x27;s not an offensive odor but it definitely smells funky. I tried to apply a lightly scented lotion shortly after applying this oil and that seemed to mask the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**update: true to the seller&#x27;s advertised guarantee, I received a full refund for the product since it was not effective for me. I would recommend giving this oil a try; the company really stands behind their product. I&#x27;m highly satisfied and would order from them again (just unfortunately not this oil since it didn&#x27;t help my skin)</li>
            <li> I was having acne and I really wanted to get rid of it so I bought this. I only rubbed a little bit of oil on it once a day and it helped on a short amount of time. My acne almost completely disappeared because of this oil. Definitly recommend this one if you have the same problems as me, since it&#x27;s just for such little price!</li>
            <li> Thank you very much, i used this on my mother and it works like a charm on her fungus toenails</li>
            <li> Great product with great price. This oil Makes my skin so soft and deeply moisturizes my skin. This is a good oil to use in acne treatments.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for a few different skin conditions and it has worked very well. The smell is nice. I would highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s o k. still testing it.</li>
            <li> It unfortunately made my face break out in cystic acne.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it to a friend who did say it was effective for her child&#x27;s itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what caused my skin to break out in a rash, but I tried cortisone and it barely helped. My skin was still bothering me, mostly on my forearm. The doc said it was just a break out and said it looked like it came from some kind of plant(which I can&#x27;t remember) but the funny thing was, I never touched the plant. I found this product and was lucky to get it before it wasn&#x27;t available anymore. Within a few weeks, I noticed a big improvement in the rash and my itching went away in the first few days. It felt great on my skin, like instant cooling relief and I keep it in my cabinet for when I need it.</li>
            <li> For the past several months, I would get these huge painful pimples on my face. I used other creams, but it just made the bumps come back worse than before. Then when I purchased this Tamanu Oil a few weeks ago, I have not seen any pimples re-appear, plus my skin is much smoother. I am going to keep using this oil because it is working.</li>
            <li> As I get older I&#x27;m dealing with consistent dry skin issue. I&#x27;m growing tired of lotions with the greasiness, clogging pores etc. A friend of mine&lt;br /&gt;referred me to Tamanu Oil and it&#x27;s been working great. I used to apply first thing in morning then right before bed. Now I&#x27;ve cut back to just at night and I&#x27;m good to go all day. I recommend it you&#x27;re guy looking for an alternative to lotions and creams.</li>
            <li> This product offers remarkable results. I always had seemingly weird stuff going on with my skin, from acne to eczema to I don&#x27;t even know what. Luckily, I found Tamanu Oil, and the results have been fantastic. A few days later and I started to see amazing skin again! I am lucky to have found this, I&#x27;ll order more once they are back in stock!</li>
            <li> Awesome product!!!! I&#x27;ve tried different products for this treatment, no worked as good as this.</li>
            <li> I got this because of my acne problem. I have tried many different solutions in the past but none seem to have worked out for me. This was going to be the last thing I buy and I love the fact that it&#x27;s working out for me. I could see clear results within a week and I will be buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li> The winter used to do an awful number on my hands (itching, cracking, generally dry) until I found out about this wonderful, natural Tamanu Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began using Tamanu oil daily and over time saw a great improvement in the quality of my skin. With time my skin softened and the itches and cracks cleared up to reveal beautiful soft hands and tidy cuticles. My nailbeds are restored back to health as well. Best part, the oil is all natural and can be used for your hair and skin as well (honestly the potential uses are endless)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tamanu oil comes highly recommended for anyone who wants to clear up dry/itchy hands or to add some silk and shine to their hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I never tried this earlier.  I will never go without this again, especially not with my children in the house.  It is very effective for all those scrapes and cuts and the skin rashes they end up getting at one point or another.  You will notice when applying Tamanu Oil the cuts and scrapes will heal a lot quicker as this help the growth of healthy skin.  I recommend this - one thing a mother should not be without!</li>
            <li> It works to help eczema, but it smells awful and if you spill it on your clothes, you can never get the smell out.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my friend who has really bad eczema and we both are glad I did. It works very well. Her eczema cleared up pretty quickly. I&#x27;ve even tried it as well for my acne and my face is all cleared up. Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> A specialist recommended this for toes fungus. I have been putting a drop, 4 times a day and after a couple of weeks I can now see healthy tissue. My toe looks and feels healthy again. My sister has also used it successfully to get rid of a small scar. Just be careful that you don&#x27;t wear light colored clothes over the skin where you apply the oil as it might stain.</li>
            <li> You need to try this love it.</li>
            <li> This oil helps with patchy dry skin.  During the winter I have applied this oil twice a day to rough patches on my arms and hands and after a few days the dry patches are beginning to disappear.  I found it best to use right after a bath or shower while the skin is still moist, it really helps to absorb the oil.</li>
            <li> What is tamanu oil? What are the benefits of tamanu oil? Used topically to relieve the pain caused by conditions like sciatica, shingles, and rheumatism. The oil originates in Polynesia, where it continues to play an important cultural role.</li>
            <li> I use this in my moisturizer made of both almond and jojoba oil and really think this has helped with some scars I have and preventing new breakouts.  It does smell funny though, but that&#x27;s just how tamanu oil smells in general. I think the smell goes away once it soaks in your skin after a few minutes or I just got used to it</li>
            <li> Been using this for over 2 months now, fine line are have reduce significantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW***</li>
            <li> Very nice thick oil.  Good on my skin needs on my face.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This product has a nut-like odor, but it is not overbearing. With that being said, I would not recommend it&#x27;s use by someone with a peanut allergy. I would suggest using some lighter oils to diffuse it before use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Tamanu Oil works wells for Acne as well as Eczema, both of which I have had issues with in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hear it has many other uses, but it&#x27;s worked well for what I&#x27;ve needed.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil to cure my acne, and it completely blew my away. In addition to curing even the worst conditions of acne, it also gets rid of fungus, rashes, and wrinkles. The Tamanu Oil, which comes from the Foraha Tree, is of a very high quality (it comes from Madagascar). There is absolutely no risk in trying the product, because it works amazingly! It helps with almost all skin imperfections. For example, I burned myself a few days ago when lighting a bunsen burner for my chemistry project. The Tamanu Oil immediately alleviated the pain and soothed the burn. I heavily recommend this amazing product!</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  This is the first time I ever tried it.  But I have been using it almost a week now and I can such a difference in my skin.  I work in the sun all day.  My skin stays so dry and peels and cracks.  This new oil has completely healed my my cracking peeling skin and it feels refreshes all day.  It also has a wonderful natural smell.  I will be recommendeding this oil to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> We have been using this at home for acne mixed with coconut oil and sometimes just adding it to our moisturizer. Has seriously helped my adult acne and helped with my daughters teen black heads. Also notice significantly less redness in my face. Bought because it is cold pressed...I don&#x27;t know if that changes the product or not, but a friend who works with oils a lot said that it was important. Has a pleasant, very light aroma that is pleasing.</li>
            <li> This is a review of Tamanu Oil (Foraha oil) by Pied Leger&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had decided to try this oil because of her acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At night, she would wash her face and then pat it dry so there was just a little moisture left on her face and then apply a very thin layer of the tamanu oil to her face.  She rubbed in a little extra on the bad areas of her face where the acne was a little thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say she had a reaction.  In the thicker areas, her face did turn a little red.  But!  In the morning, when we went to look, it seemed as if the acne is drying up. So we decided to keep going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A week later, my daughter uses the oil daily and her acnes is almost totally cleared up.  We tried everything before so this is her little miracle drug.&lt;br /&gt;Since I’m just starting to learn, I went online and found that tamanu oil does so many wonderful things.  It’s reported to help with psoriasis which I have so I guess it’s my turn to try it. As well as so many other things.  Can’t wait to try all the other things as they come up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount on this product in exchanged for an unbiased and truthful review.  This is 100% my thoughts.</li>
            <li> Really liked the oil.</li>
            <li> I was selected to receive this product at a promotional price for my commitment to post an honest product review. This is another wonderful essential oil to add to my others. It is so awesome that people, including myself, are relying more on ALL natural products instead of the chemical filled items we buy that usually do more harm than good. This is an all natural oil that comes from the tamanu tree from the tropics of Asia. I researched it before ordering. I like to know background info. It is unbelievable all the uses this oil has when you start looking it up. The main thing I have used it for a dry patch of skin I have had on my hand... not sure where it came from. I think it was maybe some poison oak I got into. Anyways, it helped get rid of the dry patch in 3 days of application. This is a great oil to add to your other oils and read up on all its uses! You will be amazed.</li>
            <li> I am a smooth kind of guy with rough skin which doesn&#x27;t add up for me. My whole life I tried to really find a cream or an oil that can take care of this dried skin I have. Some products might of worked but they were animal tested and I don&#x27;t agree with that. I was recommended Tamanu Oil by a close friend of mine who is a masseuse. She said it is not animal tested, it has the best results for me. After giving it a shot, I am thankful for my friend and this product. My skin is smooth like me now. I recommend this for anyone with a skin problem such as eczema, rashes......Thanks</li>
            <li> I have tried everything to get rid of my acne and could never find something that would work until I purchased this tamanu oil. I apply a few drops each day and have come to find a noticeable difference in my skin! I love that it&#x27;s all natural ingredients so that I know that I&#x27;m not putting any weird ingredients on my skin like other acne remedies. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is a really effective essential oil for foot and nail fungus and a host of other things. Although as a topical treatment, it helps to kill off fungus on the skin and nails. It eliminates the foot fungus and keeps the nail fungus under control. This stuff also works amazing on insect bites. Just a tiny amount applied to the skin stops the itch. It is also a great product to use on minor skin irritations to disinfect the skin and promote healing. I am a big fan of essential oils and this one is a must to have in the medicine cabinet. It is 100% pure and natural, so you know you are getting the best product for your skin without any chemicals or additives that will irritate the skin. Five stars!</li>
            <li> I have highly allergic reactions to insect bites. Mosquitoes are my mortal enemies. When an insect bite recedes it leaves dark spot/ scars on my skin. I also have eczema on my arms, legs and  face. As a result of this, I have scars that are up to 10 years old. DOUBLE WHAMMY!  I&#x27;ve used cocoa butter, shea butter and olive oil products to remove or lighten these scars. While searching  for a natural solution to cover the duality of my problem I came across a page that recommended Tamanu Oil.  Tamanu oil is apparently good for old scars, eczema and acne too. I&#x27;ve been using this for a several weeks now and the scars are becoming lighter. From time to time, I&#x27;ve used this on areas that acne occurs. Amazingly, it diminishes the appearance of the pimples too.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and I have tried multiple natural remedies to reduce flare up, particularly during the cold weather months. Tamanu Oil has been an excellent- let alone the only- natural remedy that clears up breakouts on my elbows and scalp. I nonetheless continue to use a fragrance-free shampoo and body wash that I&#x27;ve used for years and it works well with the Tamanu oil. I just simply put a drop on my fingertips after I shower and rub it in. It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue or feel. This product is amazing and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from psoriasis since I was a small child. I seriously have been on every oral medication and applied every cream that has been on the market for the last 40 years. Nothing seems to work very well or for long term. I have been using this Tamanu oil for awhile and am completely shocked at the results. The fragrance is light and not overpowering and it goes on smooth without feeling overly oily. After suffering for years with no help from anything that I&#x27;ve tried, I&#x27;m over the moon with this oil. I wish I had known years ago about Tamanu oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i received this free in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> My teenage son have been suffering from severe acne. I spent a lot trying different acne treatments range from acne cream, acne lotion, acne gel to other acne remedies and nothing worked. I been researching for new natural treatments and found that Tamanu Oil works on existing acne scars and is especially effective in the prevention of acne scarring. When I got the opportunity to Received this Great product in Exchange for my Honest and Unbiased Opinion, I thought he would give this a try. He has been using it for a week and I can tell the results are incredible! This great oil has been the reason his acne and scars started clearing! Tamanu Oil absorbs quickly, without leaving any oily residue and is fast acting. His skin looks so much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil works on all skin types from dry scaly skin to oily skin. Besides help with acne, is said to fades stretch marks, helps improve the appearance of scars, and aids in the healing of minor cuts, burns, rashes, eczema, rosacea, wrinkles, aging and other skin conditions. It has so many benefits that now I&#x27;ve started using it! This product is certainly nature’s way of healing and we will continue to use it. I highly recommend Tamanu Oil!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. First and foremost, it is natural, which is very important to me. It is not filed with a laundry list of harsh chemicals. Also important is DOES IT WORK? t has worked great so far in managing a few different skin issues. I have needed to take care of two different problems (I wont share them here) but I will say that it was fantastic.  It worked fast and it was easy to use.!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be reordering! Thanks@</li>
            <li> Super Deal, the product works and really does its job great! I was searching for oils for such a long time and tried a lot of different ones before I finally found Tamanu Oil. I totally can recomment it and will get more of it in the future :)</li>
            <li> LOVE it! Makes my face nice and smooth... helps with breakouts!</li>
            <li> Did nothing for me. Product was cloudy like used/cooled cooking oil. Disappointed that I saw no skin improvements.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy I tried using Tamanu Oil on my face blemishes. I prefer only natural products, and the Tamanu Oil has worked wonderfully. I&#x27;ve noticed a reduction in my blemishes scars and even my wrinkles! Best part is that my sensitive skin doesn&#x27;t get irritated!</li>
            <li> Great oil for problem skin.</li>
            <li> I saw immediate results when I applied it after a shower, for some reason it seems to work better after a hot shower. Several plaques of psoriasis came off like an old scab, also smoothes the skin. The smell reminds me of incense, very pleasant.</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil hoping it would help with my acne breakouts (seriously, I&#x27;m almost 40, when does it stop, right?). Since I began using this product, my breakouts are handled quickly and easily! I apply a little before bed on any area that is starting to break out and by morning, my skin is clear again! After reading a bit more about the properties of this oil, I decided to try it out on my dry skin! Living in a cold weather state is brutal on my skin, especially on my feet! After just a couple weeks using this product, my feet are smooth and crack-free! Amazing!</li>
            <li> This tamanu oil is better at treating eczema than the prescriptions. I do not like the steroid creams and pills that the doctors prescribe so I thought I would give this a try first this time. It helps keep it from spreading and reduces the itching. It cleared it up in the same amount of time as the prescriptions usually do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all in on this product. I mainly bought this because I tried a sample a few months ago. I used the sample on my elbows, where I had severaly dry skin. I applied it every night for a week (that&#x27;s how much the sample lasted) and I noticed right away how smooth my elbows got. I figured, if it worked there, I wonder what else it can do. Luckily I tried it out. Now I use it for everything &amp;#34;skin related&amp;#34;, mostly for acne and rashes. I&#x27;m never disappointed. So, for now, i&#x27;m giving this baby a 5 star. If I come across any issues, I&#x27;ll make sure to and change my rating.&lt;br /&gt;Ta-ta... for now...</li>
            <li> Every winter my shoulders and back get so dry I can barely stand it. I have tried just about every lotion there is with minimal relief. I had heard about Tamanu Oil so I decided to give it a whirl. I am impressed. I can feel the elasticity in my skin again in the middle of winter and the relief is more than short lived!</li>
            <li> I have eczema on my legs. In the winter they get dry and itch badly, but this relieves that itch and also adds moisture to my skin. I recommend you give this a try.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin and I started using this to try to lighten my red marks. It didn&#x27;t help my acne unless I put it on a bandaid and then over my pimple. It made my face feel greasy but kinda helped lighten my marks. Though I feel the greasy part made me break out more</li>
            <li> This oil worked well for me when I applied it to a big cystic type acne pimple. It actually worked better for closing and getting the skin over it to heal than for getting the infection out or bringing it to a head. I still have to use something else for that but it does help clean it and for the skin to be healing within a day or two. I try to only use natural ingredients in my skin care products because my skin is super sensitive and breaks out bad with regular otc formulas. It does have a strong smell but adding this to my other oils and soaps gives green great added benefits while helping mask the smell. Plus it&#x27;s easier to use like that on a regular basis rather than separately every day. I still use it for spot treatment by itself as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use Puressant&#x27;s raspberry seed oil and I really like the quality of their oils. They are clear and 100% natural and very affordable. The small 1oz bottle lasts a long time because you only use a few drops at a time. I bought the 1oz bottle of the raspberry oil almost 2 months ago and have still not really made a dent in it. These oils do lose their effectiveness of time as some of the nutrients evaporate as oxygen and time touches them so I don&#x27;t like wasting a bunch of money for a large bottle that will last longer than its shelf life. These also come in an Amber bottle to help protect the oils from light and faster deterioration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how gentle this is on my skin and that it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. I use it daily and haven&#x27;t had any reactions in these 2 weeks that I&#x27;ve had it. Puressant does offer a 30 day money back guarantee if it doesn&#x27;t work as well for you as well as you hoped. That&#x27;s reassuring in this day. You really have nothing to lose and potentially everything to gain. I highly recommend this oil and the Puressant line. I did receive my bottle free  or at a promotional discount for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my personal experience and honest opinion of this oil. It works well for me.It works well for me.</li>
            <li> Feels great in my hair.</li>
            <li> I will use this for any cuts or bruises I or anyone in my family may get.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Puressant&#x27;s Tamanu Oil for my excema which flares up during the winter.  I&#x27;ve used creams in the past that were prescribed by my dermotologist that helped the itching but did not reduce the dry spots.  Tamanu Oil not only stops the itching but makes the dry, scaly spots disappear in a matter of days.  I&#x27;ve also been using Tamanu Oil on my hands and it has done wonders - no more peeling skin and cracked knuckles.  I have almost used up my first bottle and will be ordering another soon.</li>
            <li> I still get occasional acne and am thrilled that this works for that but my main problem is chronic and persistent psoriasis.  This itchy, dry skin, condition is something that has affected me for years and I have tried many prescription and over-the-counter medications for it, most to no avail.  One of the things that does bring me relief is Tamanu Oil.  I have no idea why this works but it does and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Also, the quality of this particular brand is the best I have found.</li>
            <li> I like it. It feels good when use it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I would get through my winters, or summers without tamanu oil.  It works magic on acne.  I get outbreaks of eczema on my fingertips in dry winter, and summer gardening that make my skin crack, and tamanu oil helps better than anything I ever got from the dermatologist.  This is an essential part of my oils arsenal.  Will totally buy this again when I use up my bottle.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband as a gift. He is a closet OCD type for washing hands... He washes his hands so frequently that they will become too dry and they will crack. Sometimes even bleed (even after using lotion). Now if or when they crack he uses this oil as damage control. A small dab on open cracks (after drying hands) will close within a day or so.</li>
            <li> I don’t think I’ve ever used Tamanu oil before so I did a bunch of research before I decided to use this one by Puressant. I received this oil for testing and review purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tamanu oil, also known as Foraha oil, is a plant/tree indigenous to Southeast Asia. Puressant uses tamanu from Madagascar and is 100% Pure and cold pressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil supposedly has skin healing, antineuralgic, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antibiotic, and antioxidant properties, making it a very useful topical agent in the skincare area. It’s supposed to help with scars, stretch marks, psoriasis, acne, eczema, bug bites, stings, enflamed skin, burns, infections, fungal infections, and many other skin ailments. (On a side note, it was also used as a biofuel in WWII to generate electricity to power radios!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to test this oil on some of the stretch marks and scars (from a car accident) I have on my thighs and hips area that has been bothering me for the longest time. I also have acne and eczema, but didn’t want to try an untested foreign product on it initially, so stretch marks/scars it is first. I’ve used this for several days now and although the smell and color takes some time to get used to, have seen some results. My stretch marks and scar lines have faded just a bit, although I would need to use this product longer to see any more significant results. I decided to use a bit to test a small part of where I have eczema, and the results aren’t as significant as I hoped. Only time can tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance of the Tamanu oil is bold and earthy, which isn’t unpleasant. I think this particular fragrance is an acquired smell because I’ve heard some people don’t mind it while some don’t’ particularly care for it. Personally I don&#x27;t mind it since it reminds me of Chinese herbal medicine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is a brown-green yellowish tint and applying it to skin that touches your clothes may stain it. I like to apply it after I shower, so I suggest rubbing it in well before you put on your pajamas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also suggest that you keep this bottle in a dark cool area for a longer shelf life. I will continue to use this oil and will update on any changes or improvements that I see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I recently burned myself and applied this Tamanu oil to my burnt areas. It gives relief and moisturizes your burnt skin. I&#x27;ve noticed it&#x27;s healing a lot quicker than normal!e you put on your pajamas.  I also suggest that you keep this bottle in a dark cool area for a longer shelf life. I will continue to use this oil and will update on any changes or improvements that I see.  UPDATE: I recently burned myself and applied this Tamanu oil to my burnt areas. It gives relief and moisturizes your burnt skin. I&#x27;ve noticed it&#x27;s healing a lot quicker than normal!</li>
            <li> I consider myself an essential oils fanatic. I&#x27;m obsessed with them and trying as many different types of oils as I can get my hands on. Unfortunately, I also have skin problems. But I&#x27;ve had no success treating my problems the traditional way, with face washes and scrubs and exfoliation, etc. Then, I heard of the amazing benefits of Tamanu Oil. I wasn&#x27;t a complete believer in this particular oil at first, because I went through a few kinds of Tamanu Oil that were not effective for me. But that all changed when I found this one by Puressant. It works wonders for me! It&#x27;s so easy to use and I&#x27;ve noticed a significant reduction in my acne, acne scars, and other various skin problems I have to deal with. And not only has it changed my life physically, I&#x27;ve also felt better emotionally as a result. I&#x27;ve been more confident in myself, so this product is great for so much more than just helping with your appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, i can&#x27;t say that this product will fix everyone&#x27;s problems. I know it&#x27;s been tremendously successful for many people, including myself, but I can&#x27;t promise the same results for everyone. But, what do you have to lose? The is a 100% money back guarantee on the product, and just about everyone who&#x27;s tried it has been immensely satisfied with their results. Besides the sheer number of successes the product has rendered, the price is just phenomenal. It&#x27;s completely worth it and reasonable for what you&#x27;re getting. And though the bottle seems quite small, all you have to do is dilute the oil and you will have more than enough to last you quite a while.</li>
            <li> This product has a nut-like odor, but it is not overbearing. With that being said, I would not recommend it&#x27;s use by someone with a peanut allergy. I would suggest using some lighter oils to diffuse it before use.&lt;br /&gt;The Tamanu Oil works well for Acne . I have always had a acne problem and I have tried many things. Some have worked and some haven&#x27;t. Then I tried this Tamanu oil. I was shocked with the results. This is 100% natural which I love that. Since I have used this I have noticed a change my skin is starting to look clearer . I received this free of charge in exchange for a honest review. But this still doesn&#x27;t change my views</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING! Im glad my friend told me about it! I have bad eczema and acne and I use it for both. I went to the dermatologist and got some product for my face, but after I finished using the product I started using the Tamanu oil and it started clearing my face up even more and clears up the dark spots as well. It helps with my eczema faster than the actual cream I was using. I even tried tea tree oil and that didn&#x27;t work. The Tamanu Oil helped with calming of itching as well as clearing the eczema up.I will be ordering some more soon before I run out.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> There is nothing like getting a product that has no safety seal.  In the trash it went..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for quite some time for my eczema on my hands. It&#x27;s been very helpful in controlling break outs and stopping the itchiness. I wanted to give you guys my input on the product because this is how I started using it as well. I would definitely recommend this to anyone as it is made from pure natural ingredients and it does wonder to any skin problems.</li>
            <li> Amazing item ,very perfect for the skin ,you dont need to apply so much quantity,just one application  of this amazing product daily can help clear the symptoms of various skin ailments such as acne, eczema, psoriasis, rashes wrinkles and more! it works so fast.i love this innovation</li>
            <li> This is great oil by puressant. My son has eczema that flares up from his environmental allergies(grass) and when I let him out to play he gets worse. I tried some tamanu oil on his itchy red patched and they were instantly soothed. This oil has many uses and I have seen creams in the store with tamanu for poison ivy and poison oak and this would be a great addition to anyone that likes to go camping or hiking and needs instant relief from mother natures irritants. A definite must have oil for a first aid kit as it has antibiotic properties to it. This is a good quality oil and I will be keeping this around for that reason alone since I have kids that are always getting cut from playing outside.</li>
            <li> I brought this because I have had a toe nail fungus for a little over 6 years now and it has been quite embarrassing. This ooil has truly helped get rid of the fungus. It does require consistency so I put it on every night before going to bed. It doesn&#x27;t require much. In about a month, I noticed a drastic change. My friend has also told me this oil works great for acne. Good product and a must time!</li>
            <li> I have been really into using natural oils lately such as coconut and argon oils. They have tons of benefits and I wanted to try more! I’m really glad that I did because this tamanu oil has helped my acne tremendously. My skin is much clearer and smooth than it ever has been and it doesn’t dry out my face like in-store acne products. Not only is it great for acne but Its great for just about anything. It can be used on scratches, stings, or as a moisturizer. I could go on and on about this stuff cause it is so great! I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I am so sad this item is out of stock right now! I use it as an anti-inflammatory, but iw works wonders with skin healing and growing healthy skin too. It goes on very light but makes a big difference with cracked, dry, or even blistered skin. I especially find this handy in the summer. My friend actually uses it for baby rashes. I can&#x27;t day enough about this oil. I buy the Puressant brand because it always is high quality, delivered on time and as promised. And it&#x27;s additive free. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I got this in an Easter basket and have been using it every since. I&#x27;ve always had naturally dry skin and most lotions don&#x27;t work for me. This stuff works better than any lotion I own; and I&#x27;ve gone from alligator skin to soft and smooth. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> THE BEST! A health-savvy friend told me about this oil and I did the research to see that this is a very powerful skin healer that is gentle and rejuvenating. I think one of the reason it works with so many different skin conditions / problems is because it is anti-viral (shingles, etc.), anti-fungal (eczema, candida), and anti-bacterial all in one oil. The oil glides on softly while the skin heals and regains its luster. 5 stars!! FAST shipping!</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and this has been the only natural remedy I have found that really clears up my sensitive skins without harsh chemicals.  I had used a steroid type ointment for years on my face and it made my skin thin and sensitive to everything.  I started looking for a natural remedy and tried many different types of essential oils including Tea Tree and Lavender, which helped some, but I was still looking for something that was going to keep my skin clear.  That is where this Tamanu Oil comes in, it has cleared my skin and kept it clear consistently.  I simply put in on after I wash my face before I use my nighttime moisturizer before bed and thats it!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of problems with my skin from skin rashes to flaky skin, etc... I heard some good things about tamanu oil from a friend so I decided to check it out myself. After using Tamanu oil for a few weeks I noticed my skin rashes were diminishing which was a great feat, since I felt it was going no where.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve really enjoyed how this works on my face. It has gotten rid of some acne that has been a trouble spot for years. Definitely going to keep going as I see nothing but improvements from now on!</li>
            <li> This product has greatly improved the quality of my skin. Within days of consistent appliance, the results are visible and I&#x27;m now feeling more confident about my skin! The product is also easy to apply which is a plus. Thank you for this amazing oil!</li>
            <li> I am thrilled to have stumbled across this Tamanu Oil!  I have always had oiler skin than most people, and even now when I am older I still get the occasional pimple.  I usually use tea tree oil to clear it up, but that seems to have stopped working for me.  I have tried a few other natural options with some success, but it takes time.  Well, when I got this Tamanu Oil in the mail last week, I dabbed it on a stubborn pimple.....and within hours (hours....NOT days)....it is completely gone!  I am shocked!  And thrilled!  This oil is now my mainstay and I will be using it on everything.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t smell too good, but it seems to work</li>
            <li> I was experiencing a bit of skin irritation and rash. This cleared it right up. I&#x27;m glad I found something all natural rather than having to use some strong prescription drug. Very little of it is really required for it to work. This oil is very soothing to the skin and I noticed smoothing my skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;I used to get horribly dry, itchy, and cracked hands in the winter that would actually bleed and really hurt but nothing really solved the problem until a friend recommended this wonderful oil!&lt;br /&gt;A daily application of Tamanu Oil has kept my hands soft and smooth all winter. I’m so relieved to have finally found something that really works! My hands and cuticles are soft and silky now and look incredibly healthy. They look much younger too!&lt;br /&gt;I love that this oil is all natural and completely additive free which makes me feel even more confident about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely highly recommend this for anyone suffering from dry, itchy skin!</li>
            <li> I have moderate acne and have tried just about every face wash that&#x27;s available in stores. I found an article that said tamanu oil helps with acne so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I use this twice a day; after washing my face in the morning before putting on my moisturizer, and when I&#x27;m getting ready for bed at night. One or two drops is all you need! Its not the nicest smelling oil but I have definitely noticed a difference in my skin. Its a greenish-gold color and its great for reducing redness and inflammation, which makes the acne that is still there a lot less noticeable. Which is also great for the eczema on my arms. I live in a cold climate which equals major dry skin/ damage. In some cases it better than lotion! I would really recommend this to someone who has moderate to severe acne and cant find anything else that works. I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Smell is very bad, but after a few applications I could already see my dry skin/eczema dissipating!  Definitely give it a try.</li>
            <li> I recently suffered a major allergy attack where I broke out severely with hives and major cystic type spots all over my face and neck! I was looking for a product that was natural to help with this issue. I stumbled on this Tamanu Oil and decided it was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;I was chosen to test and review this product, and my opinions are my own, I was not paid for this review.&lt;br /&gt;I started using this product sparingly on my dark spots and acne marks, and noticed that both were fading, and my face seemed to be responding well to the oil. I mixed a couple drops in with my usual moisturizer to help it go on better and have it be less oily. It&#x27;s called a carrier oil, and I have started doing this to dilute it so it&#x27;s not 100% full strength on my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I still am able to see the marks but alot less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;I have give a small sample to my sister in law who suffers from eczema on her arms, and I&#x27;m hoping she starts to see results as well. I have read alot of great things about this oil, and thought of her and the eczema.&lt;br /&gt;Read more of the reviews and decide for yourself, if you aren&#x27;t happy there is a 100% money back guarantee!</li>
            <li> Works well on my eczema but has a very nasty smell to it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this works or not. I tried it twice and gave up because the texture was mind of strange and it smells way too much like maple syrup to me.</li>
            <li> I have tried other tamanu oil and love this one.I use tamanu oil on my face as a night serum for my acne prone skin.I usually use it on nights where I feel like my skin needs extra healing like when I feel a pimple coming on.I put it on and the next morning my skin is flawless.Tamanu oil in general has an aroma to it not bad but it is present.I love using oils on my skin and this one is one that I will definitely keep using in my quest for awesome skin.</li>
            <li> I have a dry rash that appears on my hands when I am stressed. Typically a steroid cream is the only thing that works. This had helped a ton and it seems to be almost gone. Works slower than steroids, but so much better for you!</li>
            <li> I have moderate to severe psoriasis depending on the flare up stage.  The flare ups on my hands and feet are difficult to deal with.  I have tried steroid creams, a gel from my dermatologist and an all natural homeopathic cream.  All but the natural cream do work after several applications but I really wanted to find something less harsh and 100% natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A flare up started about 5 days before I received this awesome oil.  I didn&#x27;t expect much in the way of results because of my past history with &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; methods.  I was shocked to see that the oil IMMEDIATELY took the burning sensation away on my hands!  I am thrilled so far.  The Tamanu Oil by Puressant arrived in a quick manner securely packaged to prevent damage to the bottle.  I opened the bottle at once to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell was very nutty for lack of a better word.  Not too pungent but a definite smell.  The oil is the same greenish gold color and consistency of extra virgin olive oil.  A little of the oil goes a long way.  I used about 6-10 drops and it covered my hands with a nice thin layer of burn easing oil.  When I first opened the bottle I couldn&#x27;t seem to get any oil out onto my fingertip.  I took the white center piece out, put it back in, but not firmly and screwed the lid back on.  When I took the lid back off the center piece was firmly placed inside the lid.  (See Picture)  I was glad to figure this out.  The little dip stick allows for easy application on my hands without getting too much out at once. I wish my lavender had this apparatus!  I plan to apply this Tamanu oil everyday to see the full results.  I am hopeful to have finally found a natural remedy for my psoriasis.</li>
            <li> I have been using oils for a long time, but when my daughter found out that she had eczema, I knew I had to learn more about the different types of oils that may be able to assist with her.  That&#x27;s when I found Puressant Tamanu oil, and did research on the oil and found out that it was helping alot of people with eczema.  She has been using it faithfully and she is not having as many rashes and irritations popping up. Her arms are looking almost back to normal.</li>
            <li> I was not sure what Tamanu oil all did, When I looked it up I was very surprise.It has the ability to heal skin of many things like. Help improve the looks of scarring, stretch marks, minor cuts and abrasions, rashes, sores.I have been using it on my husband&#x27;s  acne that is on him. It has started to clear up. I should say it is almost gone. I also trying it on my sons foot issues, and it is clearing that up also. There are so many uses for this I can&#x27;t name them all. It is great stuff  to keep on hand.I DID RECEIVE THIS AT A DISCOUNT PRICE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW.</li>
            <li> I use the oil as part of my moisturizer... but only at night. It works wonders for healing and moisturizing (I have eczema).</li>
            <li> After some research, I discovered that Tamanu oil is a natural substance that can reduce inflammation and destroy bacteria. For me when applied to the skin, it dramatically clears up acne and dries up my pores, which is wonderful because I have suffered a lot of my life with oily skin. I have used it on my sons eczema as well and it certainly has done wonders! Can&#x27;t wait till they have this back in stock!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who had terrible eczema. Within a few days you could tell a difference, by a couple weeks it had significantly improved. We had previously tried many various treatments to help, and nothing prior to this worked. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My wife suffers from outbreaks of eczema and it leaves her miserable.  I bought her some of this oil and it helps immensely.  She received almost immediate relief from the pain and itching.  That was enough to sell us on using this product regularly, but then her outbreak cleared up days faster than it usually does.  We were amazed.  No laboratory manufactured chemicals with a huge list of side effects, just this naturally pressed wonder that didn&#x27;t bother her at all.  I can&#x27;t wait to get more of this!</li>
            <li> I love my Tamanu Oil. My horrible acne I&#x27;ve had for several months has almost completely healed. All it took was just one application a day. I see incredible results! My Tamanu oil bottle is easy to apply and lasts a long time. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I prefer natural remedies whenever possible and Tamanu Oil has been added to my list.  If you&#x27;re wondering what exactly it is, tamanu oil is extracted from the seeds of a large evergreen tree that is native to parts of Africa, India and Australia.  It has been used for centuries in traditional African and Asian medicine as a topical skin treatment.  It has anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial and anti-oxidant compounds.  It&#x27;s often used for conditions such as eczema and psoriasis, but it&#x27;s also been used for relieve of pain from problems like shingles and rheumatoid arthritis.  It also has natural vitamin E and even if you don&#x27;t need it for any of the conditions I mentioned, it&#x27;s great for healing dry skin.</li>
            <li> I find this to be good with exzema.</li>
