            <li>guess I will need to return it to get a better one.</li>
            <li>I love the styling pik/comb attachment.</li>
            <li>And I also broke many of the pik/comb pieces off as well.</li>
            <li>Love it:)</li>
            <li>really glad I got it</li>
            <li>This product is okay, so so, does what it&#x27;s supposed to</li>
            <li>The attachments lock into place, which allows for avoidance of that hand holding job many of these dryers require.  </li>
            <li>Great item. ... gets hot quickly.  </li>
            <li>Great size , light weight, works great, I have a lot of thick coarse hair and this blow dryer is the best one I ever had.</li>
            <li>and it was very reliable, and had she loved the styling pik.  </li>
            <li>Buttons on handle move too easily when in the process of drying hair.</li>
            <li>It is easy to handle.</li>
            <li>I look all over for the best hair dryer for black hair or hair that had a lot of curls.</li>
            <li>I am happy to have come back to the brand.</li>
            <li>This product should have indicated the warning as I&#x27;m sure many people would love to know whether their purchase could potentially kill them!</li>
            <li>the hair dryer came in its original box.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I have and love the Gold n Hot Hair Straightener.</li>
            <li>Very nice heat levels and the comb was great as I dried my natural hair.</li>
            <li>So glad I got it for a reasonable price</li>
            <li>The price was great as opposed to those at other beauty suppliers.  </li>
            <li>It dries my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>I got it quick and with no issues.</li>
            <li>It has a couple of temperature settings,  and it dries my hair relatively quickly.  </li>
            <li>Better than the older models and maybe quieter too.</li>
            <li>But definitely worth getting..</li>
            <li>so I never expect a comb attachment to run right through it.</li>
            <li>buying the exact same kind.</li>
            <li>it was time for a new one, mainly because it lasted so many years.</li>
            <li>Plus I&#x27;ve used gold n hot for yrs.</li>
            <li>However the one that I purchased for her died in the first 20 days of use.  </li>
            <li>It finally fell to the floorone tie too many</li>
            <li>One of the prongs on the pik snapped during first use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve dealt with Gold n Hot before</li>
            <li>The heat is hot, but it&#x27;s not scorching to the point that you see damage happening as your hair dries.</li>
            <li>I wanted a dryer that was quiet, light in my hands had good accessories for black hair.</li>
            <li>works great, seen where somebody from ca. was talking about it being not good for you by the state.</li>
            <li>It really gets hot and straightens the hair.  </li>
            <li>it drys my hair much faster than the one with the comb to it.</li>
            <li>It makes the before process of straightening my hair, so much easier.</li>
            <li>the shipment was fast as well</li>
            <li>My wife bought this and absolutely loves it....</li>
            <li>and it worked really well.  </li>
            <li>better than, other hair dryers that cost twice as much.</li>
            <li>Bought to replace the exact same model that finally quit working after many years of reliable service.</li>
            <li>So far, it is working well, strong enough for my hair.</li>
            <li>With this on I can get my hair in more than half the time it took me before.</li>
            <li>(older model of course).</li>
            <li>so far great product can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase.</li>
            <li>It would constantly turn off unless I held it by the hot silver tube.</li>
            <li>I bought a new one to replace my old one that lasted for 8+ years.</li>
            <li>This also drys it fast yet does not dry out my hair.</li>
            <li>Nothing special, just works like any other blow dryer...</li>
            <li>The off button is directly where your hand would grasp the handle</li>
            <li>The comb is also far too prickly.</li>
            <li>After much searching I finally made up my mind and purchase this dryer.  </li>
            <li>But after I personally section off and detangle my hair with a wide tooth comb, the comb attachment pretty much glides through to dry and straighten out my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once so far.</li>
            <li>but obviously because of the prong, didnt wow me.</li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer, i have kinky hair that ranges from a few loose curls in the back to tightly curled in the middle.</li>

            <li> I love this hair dryer, i have kinky hair that ranges from a few loose curls in the back to tightly curled in the middle.</li>
            <li> My hair is super thick (Im black by the way) and this makes it so much easier to blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> The pik (comb) attaches at such an awkward angle not to mention the fact that the comb breaks very easily.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick and long hair, so it&#x27;s hard to find a hair dryer that can get hot enough to blow dry in a reasonable amount of time.  </li>
            <li> this makes it much easier for hard to reach places</li>
            <li> , I recommend it and hope to have it for a long long time.</li>
            <li> I hope this one will last as long as my other.</li>
            <li> i would recommend it to anyone who doesn&#x27;t have the time to sit around and wait for a hairstyle to dry</li>
            <li> A little smaller than expected</li>
            <li> Takes less time to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> The power cord on this product contains lead, a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm.</li>
            <li> so I sent this sucker back.</li>
            <li> According to my wife, it is not powerful enough.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The cold setting is hot.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I received an old (2008 stamped on box) version of the dryer that is also defective.  </li>
            <li> She specifically asked for this model as she had one for a few years</li>
            <li> it arrived a few days ahead of schedule.</li>
            <li> I had it for few months now, no complaints.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product unless you like very little power.</li>
            <li> I have used mine a few times a week, for at least 8+ years....</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this Dryer, there is no power at all, the dryer leaves my hair very frizzy and takes forever to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> Easily one of the worst blow dryers I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> This is a late review</li>
            <li> Eventually the grill just fell off of the dryer and the whole thing was useless and dangerous to keep using.</li>
            <li> They should&#x27;ve had common sense when manufacturing this.</li>
            <li> I have very thick afro hair</li>
            <li> I hated the stagnation.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a late review but I love this hair dryer. I am ordering one for my sister now. I have had it for two years now and have not had any problems with it.</li>
            <li> Great size , light weight, works great, I have a lot of thick coarse hair and this blow dryer is the best one I ever had.</li>
            <li> The dryer&#x27;s power cord has lead in it! There was a note attached to my dryer that stated that \\&quot;WARNING: The power cord on this product contains lead, a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm. Wash hands after handling.\\&quot; Yikes, enough said, so I sent this sucker back. This product should have indicated the warning as I&#x27;m sure many people would love to know whether their purchase could potentially kill them!</li>
            <li> works great, seen where somebody from ca. was talking about it being not good for you by the state. if you go that you never buy anything again</li>
            <li> I look all over for the best hair dryer for black hair or hair that had a lot of curls. I wanted a dryer that was quiet, light in my hands had good accessories for black hair. This also drys it fast yet does not dry out my hair. The comb in flexible and does not tear my hair when drying with the comb. So glad I got it for a reasonable price, I recommend it and hope to have it for a long long time.</li>
            <li> The dryer is a great item. It dries my hair quickly. I purchased it from another retail vendor.  TWO STARS FOR WHAT I RECEIVED FROM MY AMAZON ORDER. I ordered a second one for travel from Amazon.  Unfortunately, I received an old (2008 stamped on box) version of the dryer that is also defective.  The cold setting is hot. Contacted Amazon - courteous service. Had to return the item for a prompt refund.</li>
            <li> Nothing special, just works like any other blow dryer...Plus I&#x27;ve used gold n hot for yrs.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer...it drys my hair much faster than the one with the comb to it.</li>
            <li> This dryer is excellent , I love the settings and it is great quality . I got it quick and with no issues.</li>
            <li> Shipment on time &amp; so far great product can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I purchased this blow dryer for me niece for Christmas and she loved it. She said that it was made by the hair GOD&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Bought to replace the exact same model that finally quit working after many years of reliable service.</li>
            <li> According to my wife, it is not powerful enough.&lt;br /&gt;I guess I will need to return it to get a better one.</li>
            <li> I got it on time. A little smaller than expected but I like it. I&#x27;ve only used it once so far.</li>
            <li> I have used mine a few times a week, for at least 8+ years....I love the styling pik/comb attachment. It makes the before process of straightening my hair, so much easier. I accidentally dropped the plug, and the prongs you plug into the wall got bent... And I also broke many of the pik/comb pieces off as well. So I decided I it was time for a new one, mainly because it lasted so many years. So here I am purchasing another one.</li>
            <li> Very nice heat levels and the comb was great as I dried my natural hair. Love it:) the shipment was fast as well</li>
            <li> My wife bought this and absolutely loves it....</li>
            <li> I love this blow dyer! My hair is super thick (Im black by the way) and this makes it so much easier to blow dry my hair. It&#x27;s amazing!  Im really glad I got it</li>
            <li> I can always depend on this blow dryer.  The styling pik (comb) helps to straigthen my hair. I&#x27;ve been purchasing this type of blow dyer for about 15 years.  Lasts along time.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my Mom.  She specifically asked for this model as she had one for a few years and it was very reliable, and had she loved the styling pik.  However the one that I purchased for her died in the first 20 days of use.  She went and picked up another one of the same model and has not had any issues with that one as of yet.</li>
            <li> I am re-purchasing this product after 7 years of using my last one.  It was excellent.  I have very thick afro hair and it worked really well.  It finally fell to the floorone tie too many and so I need to replace - am buying the exact same kind.</li>
            <li> the hair dryer came in its original box. it arrived a few days ahead of schedule. the dryer works wonders for my hair and dries in no time at all. i would recommend it to anyone who doesn&#x27;t have the time to sit around and wait for a hairstyle to dry</li>
            <li> No complaints, I am a white guy and just needed a blow dryer... my hair stylist uses the comb attachment while doing my hair after they cut it and told me to get one because it makes doing your hair easier. So I did... works great.</li>
            <li> The settings were nice and I wish I got to use them, but all the attachments broke in my hands( the concentrator) or my already detangled hair(the comb). Eventually the grill just fell off of the dryer and the whole thing was useless and dangerous to keep using.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dryer after buying one every 2 years from a different brand, hoping it will last longer. So far, it is working well, strong enough for my hair. I had it for few months now, no complaints.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dyer! I bought a new one to replace my old one that lasted for 8+ years. I hope this one will last as long as my other.</li>
            <li> The buttons are Totally in the way. The off button is directly where your hand would grasp the handle and so my entire drying experience was stop and go. I hated the stagnation. It would constantly turn off unless I held it by the hot silver tube. They should&#x27;ve had common sense when manufacturing this. The comb is also far too prickly.</li>
            <li> One of the prongs on the pik snapped during first use.  I dont think my hair is that resistant, so it&#x27;s probably the product.  This product is okay, so so, does what it&#x27;s supposed to but obviously because of the prong, didnt wow me.</li>
            <li> O.k. blow dryer. Attachment comb is too flimsy.  Buttons on handle move too easily when in the process of drying hair.</li>
            <li> After much searching I finally made up my mind and purchase this dryer.  The price was great as opposed to those at other beauty suppliers.  It really gets hot and straightens the hair.  It is easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer, i have kinky hair that ranges from a few loose curls in the back to tightly curled in the middle. This dryer packs in the power!!! Will purchase/recommend to anyone looking for a dryer. My hair can get tangled because of the curls so I never expect a comb attachment to run right through it. Just won&#x27;t happen. But after I personally section off and detangle my hair with a wide tooth comb, the comb attachment pretty much glides through to dry and straighten out my hair. I&#x27;ve dealt with Gold n Hot before but it was a while ago. I am happy to have come back to the brand. Really good buy.</li>
            <li> Great item. ... gets hot quickly.  I like the different angles you can put the attachment this makes it much easier for hard to reach places</li>
            <li> Easily one of the worst blow dryers I&#x27;ve owned. The pik (comb) attaches at such an awkward angle not to mention the fact that the comb breaks very easily.</li>
            <li> This is very good handheld hair dryer.  It has a couple of temperature settings,  and it dries my hair relatively quickly.  It&#x27;s just as good as, if not better than, other hair dryers that cost twice as much.</li>
            <li> Ive always had this blow dryer.. (older model of course). But definitely worth getting.. Better than the older models and maybe quieter too.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have and love the Gold n Hot Hair Straightener. I am very disappointed in this Dryer, there is no power at all, the dryer leaves my hair very frizzy and takes forever to dry my hair. I would not recommend this product unless you like very little power.</li>
            <li> This dryer is GREAT.  The attachments lock into place, which allows for avoidance of that hand holding job many of these dryers require.  The heat is hot, but it&#x27;s not scorching to the point that you see damage happening as your hair dries.</li>
            <li> Great, hair dryer. Takes less time to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick and long hair, so it&#x27;s hard to find a hair dryer that can get hot enough to blow dry in a reasonable amount of time.  With this on I can get my hair in more than half the time it took me before.</li>
            <li> My wife still using it and it works</li>
            <li> Great item!!! Delivered as promised.</li>
