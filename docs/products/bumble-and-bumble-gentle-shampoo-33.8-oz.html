            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Great price, great product, what more could I ask.</li>
            <li>One good thing about moving to Colorado from Pennsylvania was the lack of humidity.</li>
            <li>this stuff is magic!  </li>
            <li>and this is the best shampoo since it is gentle on color treated hair.  </li>
            <li>It is so gentle and smells great!</li>
            <li>and this is so gentle its awesome!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best shampoo  </li>
            <li>At the time I&#x27;d been using predominantly drug store and more affordable salon Brands (i.e. Biolage and Regis).  </li>
            <li>and I thought the results were better than what I&#x27;d been getting from my more affordable hair care regime.  </li>
            <li>I do think the pair leave my hair softer than many drugstore and salon brands.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s wonderful, especially because with age comes the thinning of hair.</li>
            <li>My hair has never been so healthy...</li>
            <li>but if you like clean, healthy hair give this a try!</li>
            <li>This shampoo cleanses gently and leaves my hair so clean without stripping it and smells great.</li>
            <li>I love this product and the price was good with free, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Most economical way to buy top quality shampoo.</li>
            <li>My in-going hope was that it would do a good job at removing the residue of styling products from my hair, while leaving my hair feeling soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li>It truly is a volumizing shampoo for fine hair.</li>
            <li>It was the first time I&#x27;d tried a more specialty hair care brand</li>
            <li>Because of this, I require a pretty potent conditioner to do the job.  </li>
            <li>Great for curly dry hair.</li>
            <li>(I guess I could&#x27;ve gotten off cheap :&amp;#62;) if that&#x27;s all I got for her!  </li>
            <li>But my hair doesn&#x27;t look as soft, healthy and shiny as it does with the shampoo and conditioner regimens I&#x27;ve already been using (DevaCurl No-Po and DevaCurl</li>
            <li>i can use with or without conditioner and my hair feels healthy and soft.</li>
            <li>shipped right away.</li>
            <li>If your hair is thinner and naturally less dry than mine, this may be perfect</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair soft &amp; shiny and smells so clean &amp; fresh.</li>
            <li>I have tried others but nothing makes my hair have more volume than B&amp;B gentle shampoo.so I always go back.</li>
            <li>when I wear my hair wavy/curly and Davines Oi Shampoo and Conditioner on days I wear my hair straight).  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>But it may work better for other hair types.</li>
            <li>So when I received the Bumble and Bumble Gentle Shampoo and Super Rich Conditioner as gifts, I was curious whether it would bring me back to the brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Recommend highly.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this product and many of their other products.</li>
            <li>I thought this combo was good, but not great.  </li>
            <li>However, I expected more in the way of extra softness and moisture from bot the shampoo and the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>though not this specific product) for the first time after learning about it from a college roommate.  </li>
            <li>I will admit my hair is often so naturally parched</li>
            <li>early if you are getting for a gift.</li>
            <li>Now my husband uses it and his dry flakes have completely gone away (but the bottle goes twice as fast!)</li>
            <li>I used to only find this size at my local hair salon but the price was higher.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In summary, for my thick, dry and somewhat coarse hair this regimen is good, but not the bestI&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I do think after using the Bumble and Bumble Gentle Shampoo my hair felt very clean and there were no traces of residue left behind.  </li>
            <li>But within a few weeks, my fine hair just went flat in the dry air.</li>
            <li>Bumble and Bumble gentle shampoo is the only shampoo that puts moisture back in without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>My hair is long, long, delicate and fine but a lot of it.  </li>

            <li> Been using this product for over 10 years on and off.  It is great for colored hair.  I also use the Seaweed conditioner.</li>
            <li> The best shampoo out there.</li>
            <li> I used to only find this size at my local hair salon but the price was higher. Most economical way to buy top quality shampoo. I color my hair every 5 weeks and this is the best shampoo since it is gentle on color treated hair.  Recommend highly.</li>
            <li> About 14 years ago in college I tried Bumble and Bumble (though not this specific product) for the first time after learning about it from a college roommate.  At the time I&#x27;d been using predominantly drug store and more affordable salon Brands (i.e. Biolage and Regis).  It was the first time I&#x27;d tried a more specialty hair care brand and I thought the results were better than what I&#x27;d been getting from my more affordable hair care regime.  I&#x27;m not sure why, but since then I&#x27;ve moved on to other salon brands.  So when I received the Bumble and Bumble Gentle Shampoo and Super Rich Conditioner as gifts, I was curious whether it would bring me back to the brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying it on my hair I thought this combo was good, but not great.  My in-going hope was that it would do a good job at removing the residue of styling products from my hair, while leaving my hair feeling soft and healthy.  I do think after using the Bumble and Bumble Gentle Shampoo my hair felt very clean and there were no traces of residue left behind.  However, I expected more in the way of extra softness and moisture from bot the shampoo and the conditioner.  I do think the pair leave my hair softer than many drugstore and salon brands.  But my hair doesn&#x27;t look as soft, healthy and shiny as it does with the shampoo and conditioner regimens I&#x27;ve already been using (DevaCurl No-Po and DevaCurl One Condition when I wear my hair wavy/curly and Davines Oi Shampoo and Conditioner on days I wear my hair straight).  It is worth noting though that my hair is thick, somewhat coarse, and very dry.  Because of this, I require a pretty potent conditioner to do the job.  If your hair is thinner and naturally less dry than mine, this may be perfect so you get the moisture you need without overconditioning your hair.  I will admit my hair is often so naturally parched I didn&#x27;t know such a thing was possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, for my thick, dry and somewhat coarse hair this regimen is good, but not the bestI&#x27;ve tried.  But it may work better for other hair types.</li>
            <li> Took about 6 weeks to get it but the friend I got it for loves the stuff!  Order early if you are getting for a gift.</li>
            <li> great product! i can use with or without conditioner and my hair feels healthy and soft.</li>
            <li> I love this product and the price was good with free, fast shipping. My only complaint is that the dispensing pump does not work. This makes it difficult to use considering the liter size. I have never had this problem before so I was disappointed as this is one of reasons I buy liter size of product.</li>
            <li> I discovered this product 7 years ago.  My hair is long, long, delicate and fine but a lot of it.  This shampoo cleanses gently and leaves my hair so clean without stripping it and smells great. I also use Bumble and Bumble conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;Seller shipped right away.</li>
            <li> It leaked through the packaging and I lost a lot of the shampoo!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  It is so gentle and smells great!</li>
            <li> My daughter &amp; I won&#x27;t use anything else but Bumble and Bumble! As a matter of fact, this and the B&amp;B Cream Rinse are ALL she wanted for Christmas (I guess I could&#x27;ve gotten off cheap :&amp;#62;) if that&#x27;s all I got for her!  I, personally, use the B&amp;B Thickening Shampoo &amp; Cream Rinse and it&#x27;s wonderful, especially because with age comes the thinning of hair. Can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this product and many of their other products. They&#x27;re a little on the expensive side but if you like clean, healthy hair give this a try!</li>
            <li> I had a really tough time deciding to pay so much for a bottle of shampoo... I will pay it again and again from now on!  I also use the supermoist conditioner too... My hair has never been so healthy... I over style my hair and it&#x27;s always been damaged and brittle... I&#x27;ve had a really hard time trying to get it to grow long too... not anymore.. this stuff is magic!  And smells great too!</li>
            <li> Thank you. Excellent product. Fast shipping. Excellent packaging. Will come back to shop in the future.</li>
            <li> Great price, great product, what more could I ask.</li>
            <li> I have very long colored and bleached hair and this is so gentle its awesome!</li>
            <li> This is a great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This merchant is over charging this product. This is only 36.00 in the Salon. I will report this with Corporate office of Bumble and Bumble.</li>
            <li> Yes, I have been using this shampoo for fifteen years. I have tried others but nothing makes my hair have more volume than B&amp;B gentle shampoo.so I always go back. One good thing about moving to Colorado from Pennsylvania was the lack of humidity. But within a few weeks, my fine hair just went flat in the dry air. Bumble and Bumble gentle shampoo is the only shampoo that puts moisture back in without weighing it down. It truly is a volumizing shampoo for fine hair. Now my husband uses it and his dry flakes have completely gone away (but the bottle goes twice as fast!) This shampoo leaves my hair soft and fluffy. I like to combine with B&amp;B Seaweed conditioner. If they ever stop making this stuff, I don&#x27;t know what I will do......</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shampoo  I have  ever used. Leaves your hair soft &amp; shiny and smells so clean &amp; fresh. Great for curly dry hair.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Came as described, well packaged.</li>
