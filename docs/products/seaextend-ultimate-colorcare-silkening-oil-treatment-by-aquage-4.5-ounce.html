            <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>but I am expecting good results even with more humidity.  </li>
            <li>Leaves a nice shine and softness.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>Also, the straightening gel is really nice in the hair too and not greasy either.</li>
            <li>yes it is oil, so it is oily BUT to be honest...</li>
            <li>This oil and the straightening gel used together make my hair easy to manage!</li>
            <li>I have very fine, wavy hair that I have been trying to grow out for awhile.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many products, this is the best by far!</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I needed and it works great.</li>

            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>However, if you want permanent lift you can put another styling gel or paste on top.  </li>
            <li>Rey pleased</li>

            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Love this product which I&#x27;ve been using for 3 years.</li>
            <li>It is better than Moroccan Oil, I think.  </li>
            <li>my hair smooth, silky, and manageable!    </li>
            <li>It dries without an oily appearance but my hair is softer and more natual looking than it is with styling gels.  </li>

            <li>I love this oil.  </li>
            <li>and I no longer have a problem with static electricity.  </li>
            <li>This is honestly my FAVORITE product.</li>
            <li>Works better than any of the mega-expensive stuff I buy at Beauty Brands.  </li>
            <li>fabulous product!</li>
            <li>Anyway, I really love this.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff...</li>
            <li>Awsome product perfect for heat protection and frizz leaves my hair super Shiney and soft!</li>
            <li>such great hair softness and frizziness is tamed, I&#x27;m in love with this!</li>
            <li>It seems to also do a good job of protecting my hair against hot iron damage.</li>
            <li>No frizz, soft, and it looks beautiful.</li>
            <li>My hair dries quickly on its own.  </li>
            <li>I have lots of hair with a mind of its own and this product helps me style it quickly (curly or straighter).  </li>
            <li>And oh so easy to comb out, love aquage, will continue to use this product again and again.</li>
            <li>After styling, I rub another tiny drop between my hands and smooth through my hair, for the perfect finish.  </li>
            <li>Great product for  calming naturally curly hair!</li>
            <li>worth the $ for sure!</li>
            <li>and my hair dries much more quickly after a shower with this!</li>
            <li>Every good thing that all the above posters said and more!</li>
            <li>combs easily with no tangles</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product for adding luster and body to your hair without adding oil or weighing it down.</li>
            <li>Hands down, one of the best silkening treatments out there.</li>
            <li>It lasts quite sometime too, you don&#x27;t need much half to one pump each time works great for me!</li>
            <li>So lucky!</li>
            <li>Colorcare Silkening Oil Treatment is fantastic for it.  </li>
            <li>This product works fabulous, my hairdresser turned me on to this product.</li>
            <li>It was even great the next day.</li>
            <li>and it made my hair so silky and smooth</li>
            <li>This product is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so light weight that you can over apply it</li>
            <li>but I most definitely think it&#x27;s this product that makes my hair have good hair days.</li>
            <li>This is a great product if you have dry hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li>I love, love and highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>humidity, I thought I&#x27;d never be able to have pretty hair again.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>so it is worth it!</li>
            <li>Love this product and so much cheaper than the salon price of $20 for 1.5 ounces!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not much for putting gunk in my hair, but this works beautifully.</li>
            <li>I rarely use any sort of heat on it, since it damages so easily.  </li>
            <li>Does not leave any residue on clean hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine straight hair that tangles easy</li>
            <li>Love this product so much.  </li>
            <li>My wife swears by this product and says that it really makes her hair more manageable.  </li>
            <li>More than that would be too much.    </li>
            <li>Love this brand so much.</li>
            <li>Half a pump leaves me silky smooth, shiny, and looking fresh for 2 days without washing, great stuff.</li>
            <li>It has added much needed luster to my hair and my hair looks great for several days after washing.  </li>
            <li>I did a quick shampoo and put in quite a bit of product crossing my fingers in hopes of not looking a disaster.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair super shiny.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it :)</li>
            <li>I consistently return to their product line for fabulous results.</li>
            <li>It is also a good sized bottle that lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>I have also tried Garnier Fructis Anti-Frizz Serum, which is quite good in dry winter weather, but could never prevent my hair from frizzing during humid Baltimore summers.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weight it down or make it greasy just nice, smooth and tangle free.</li>
            <li>great hair product, a little pricey</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair silky smooth and really shiny.</li>
            <li>She has color treated hair and this product really helps her hair look shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Seaextend Ultimate Colorcare Silkening Oil Treatment is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Not heavy like most of the leave-in treatments.</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair feel soft, healthy, and luxurious.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t use more than one or two pumps, and don&#x27;t get it near your scalp, or your hair will look oily.</li>
            <li>and i still absolutely love it its leaves my hair silky and soft when i straighten it.</li>
            <li>Worth every cent.</li>
            <li>and she was right.</li>
            <li>and they didn&#x27;t feel right for my hair</li>
            <li>straighten-through on my hair right after applying.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this to anyone looking for silky smooth hair.</li>
            <li>My hair came out super shiney, smooth curls with no frizz at all and so soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it works best if I put just a little bit in after a shower and then comb it deep into the roots and to the tips of the hair.</li>
            <li>I have super straight hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;Helps keep your hair strong and soft....</li>
            <li>Or else, it&#x27;s perfect right after straightening my hair (to remoisturize it), and I usually do one last</li>
            <li>I have tried many products to use prior to using my straightening iron to keep the frizziness at bay.  </li>
            <li>I bought my first bottle from her</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>So many different products all-in-one!</li>
            <li>I use several Aquage products and love them all.</li>
            <li>It protects it from hot irons as well.</li>
            <li>and my hair would be a pretty wave.</li>
            <li>This does exactly what I wanted it to do -makes</li>
            <li>this is the first prduct that smooths the hair out and leaves it silky and shiny</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it claims.</li>
            <li>My natural hair comes out feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sticking with this - makes my hair soft and silky without residue or greasiness and smells fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I was first turned onto it by my hairdresser -</li>
            <li>This combination gives me soft, full, naturally curly hair, that stays frizz free all day.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best hair product I have ever tired.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used the product I used to much which will make your hair look greasy, but you will have to trial it to see how much you need.  </li>
            <li>I use it after I dry my hair and it works like magic.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong high high humidity days the hair isn&#x27;t perfect</li>
            <li>It is hard to get off my hands, but smells good.</li>
            <li>Well, I left for an important meeting, where I was going to meet very high government officials and family membere</li>
            <li>It decreases my dry time significantly!</li>
            <li>this really works my hair doesnt get frizzy.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really in need of a leave in conditioner</li>
            <li>This really helped solve that problem.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks and feels so much smoother.</li>
            <li>I have very curly and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen in years, straight from the hair dressers, which was a five hour drive.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Like any oil, it will flatten hair if you use too much.  </li>
            <li>really helps make it silky and protects it from the humidity.  </li>
            <li>it make my hair so much softer.</li>
            <li>My hair is real curly and frizzy.</li>
            <li>My hair comes out looking shiny and non-frizzy without too much weight.</li>
            <li>no matter how much I brush it.  </li>
            <li>It does not add moisture, so deep conditioning is still important.</li>
            <li>really does do everything they say, and my hair has never looked</li>
            <li>Have thick,naturally really curly hair.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>My hair comes out silky smooth, no frizz, and it stays that way until the next shampoo.  </li>
            <li>If it makes your hair greasy, then you&#x27;re using too much.</li>
            <li>Light and yet enough to get the frizzed out.</li>
            <li>This has been a great product to tame my coarse frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>This product is strongly perfumed which I do not care for, but dissipates once hair is dry.  </li>
            <li>If I use more than one pump it leaves my hair weighed down.  </li>
            <li>This product is not in any way better than oil treatments than I have purchased in drugstore or supermarket chains for less than 1/2 the price.</li>
            <li>Used in moderation, it makes your hair smooth and blow dry shiny.</li>
            <li>It only takes a tiny drop in damp hair to work magic for my tresses.</li>
            <li>It actually feels like younger healthy hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never found anything that can tame and moisturize my hair and keep it calm and smooth.</li>
            <li>I use this on days when the humidity is high.</li>
            <li>I would    highly recommend this one.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>so when out in high humidity</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy but yet works wonders I highly recommend it and have even turned my sister into a every day user.  </li>
            <li>It adds shine, without any weight, and leaves my short, thin, curly hair looking diva good!  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel super soft, no dry ends</li>

            <li>have NEVER had soft shiny hair!  </li>
            <li>I received this item only 3/4 full because it was open and taped.</li>
            <li>Cuts down drying time on my hair and leaves it soft and frizz free.</li>
            <li>Most of the time after a couple of hours or a little humidity I am back to the frizz, did not happen with this product.  </li>
            <li>I have thick coarse frizzy hair and this oil is amazing</li>
            <li>It makes it silky and soft just like it says.  </li>
            <li>My ends and hair are now soft and not brittle or crispy/frizzy.</li>
            <li>Makes hair so soft &amp; manageable for straightening.  </li>
            <li>So I bought this product for my 12 year old daughter who has think curly hair that has a tendency to get frizzy...</li>
            <li>It really controls the frizz daily that I have.  </li>
            <li>Not heavy.</li>
            <li>My hair dries faster and is so silky and soft feeling.  </li>
            <li>Ive noticed it also makes my hair color really shine and last a lot longer</li>
            <li>My beautician uses Aquage brand and leaves hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Been using this for years&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my hair soft</li>
            <li>I lived near the Gulf and have unbearable hair</li>
            <li>this is the only product I have found that really works.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is a bit on the thin side and this product does not &#x27;weigh&#x27; my hair down, but instead gives it a great luster and a soft feel.</li>
            <li>After a fresh hair cut, it even works well to get my short hair to lay down where it wants to spike up in places.  </li>
            <li>It does wonders for my processed, curly hair, especially in the summer, since I live on the Lake!  </li>
            <li>I actually haven&#x27;t used the new bottle yet, but the old bottle is still working.  </li>
            <li>No more frizzies and my hair acts like &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; hair and feels smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for only three consecutive days and my hair feels extra soft, looks shinier, and is much easier to comb.</li>
            <li>The only suggestion that i have is that if you have thick hair like I do, separate you hair in layers to get product in the under layers not just on top and comb through all of your hair.  </li>
            <li>The silkening oil treatment not only makes my hair shiny and smooth, it tames all frizzies and makes it dry in half the time of normal.  </li>
            <li>My hair is pretty damaged due to years of color and highlights.</li>
            <li>Just like the &amp;#34;Aquage Color Protecting Shampoo&amp;#34;, my review of this product is pretty much the same - same product purchased from my salon  at half</li>
            <li>My long blond delicate hair has never been in better health.  </li>
            <li>but you have to be careful using too much.  </li>
            <li>My favorite product for my long, thick hair.  </li>
            <li>I bought a bottle back a couple years ago and am finally needing a new one.  </li>
            <li>I use one pump due to really oily hair.</li>
            <li>I have frizzy, thin hair and many products weigh down my hair too much.  </li>
            <li>I use this product daily, and mainly try to apply it to my crispy and dry ends.  </li>
            <li>I really like this for my hair, leaves it silky soft and less frizzy!</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what I purchased in the salon only it cost less.</li>
            <li>I was reluctant to try this because I thought it would wiegh down my already straight hair and make it look oily</li>
            <li>Use this with Aquage straightening Ultra Gel and your curly dry hair will feel silky soft.</li>
            <li>But I can still air dry my hair and get natural curls and waves.</li>
            <li>Really makes my hair less frizzy and I swear it dries faster.</li>
            <li>Not only do I use it on damp hair before blow drying, but I also put a bit extra on dry hair as needed to calm it down.</li>

            <li> Leaves a nice shine and softness.</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>

            <li> yes it is oil, so it is oily BUT to be honest...</li>
            <li> This oil and the straightening gel used together make my hair easy to manage!</li>
            <li> I have very fine, wavy hair that I have been trying to grow out for awhile.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many products, this is the best by far!</li>

            <li> Rey pleased</li>

            <li> Love this product which I&#x27;ve been using for 3 years.</li>
            <li> It is better than Moroccan Oil, I think.  </li>
            <li> my hair smooth, silky, and manageable!    </li>
            <li> It dries without an oily appearance but my hair is softer and more natual looking than it is with styling gels.  </li>

            <li> No frizz, soft, and it looks beautiful.</li>
            <li> My hair dries quickly on its own.  </li>
            <li> I have lots of hair with a mind of its own and this product helps me style it quickly (curly or straighter).  </li>

            <li> worth the $ for sure!</li>
            <li> and my hair dries much more quickly after a shower with this!</li>
            <li> Every good thing that all the above posters said and more!</li>
            <li> combs easily with no tangles</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product for adding luster and body to your hair without adding oil or weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Hands down, one of the best silkening treatments out there.</li>
            <li> It lasts quite sometime too, you don&#x27;t need much half to one pump each time works great for me!</li>
            <li> So lucky!</li>
            <li> Colorcare Silkening Oil Treatment is fantastic for it.  </li>
            <li> This product works fabulous, my hairdresser turned me on to this product.</li>
            <li> It was even great the next day.</li>
            <li> and it made my hair so silky and smooth</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so light weight that you can over apply it</li>
            <li> but I most definitely think it&#x27;s this product that makes my hair have good hair days.</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you have dry hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li> I love, love and highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> humidity, I thought I&#x27;d never be able to have pretty hair again.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> so it is worth it!</li>
            <li> Love this product and so much cheaper than the salon price of $20 for 1.5 ounces!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much for putting gunk in my hair, but this works beautifully.</li>
            <li> I rarely use any sort of heat on it, since it damages so easily.  </li>
            <li> Does not leave any residue on clean hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine straight hair that tangles easy</li>
            <li> Love this product so much.  </li>
            <li> My wife swears by this product and says that it really makes her hair more manageable.  </li>
            <li> More than that would be too much.    </li>
            <li> Love this brand so much.</li>
            <li> Half a pump leaves me silky smooth, shiny, and looking fresh for 2 days without washing, great stuff.</li>
            <li> It has added much needed luster to my hair and my hair looks great for several days after washing.  </li>
            <li> I did a quick shampoo and put in quite a bit of product crossing my fingers in hopes of not looking a disaster.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair super shiny.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it :)</li>
            <li> I consistently return to their product line for fabulous results.</li>
            <li> It is also a good sized bottle that lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have also tried Garnier Fructis Anti-Frizz Serum, which is quite good in dry winter weather, but could never prevent my hair from frizzing during humid Baltimore summers.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weight it down or make it greasy just nice, smooth and tangle free.</li>
            <li> great hair product, a little pricey</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair silky smooth and really shiny.</li>
            <li> She has color treated hair and this product really helps her hair look shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Seaextend Ultimate Colorcare Silkening Oil Treatment is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Not heavy like most of the leave-in treatments.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair feel soft, healthy, and luxurious.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t use more than one or two pumps, and don&#x27;t get it near your scalp, or your hair will look oily.</li>
            <li> and i still absolutely love it its leaves my hair silky and soft when i straighten it.</li>
            <li> Worth every cent.</li>
            <li> and she was right.</li>
            <li> and they didn&#x27;t feel right for my hair</li>
            <li> straighten-through on my hair right after applying.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this to anyone looking for silky smooth hair.</li>
            <li> My hair came out super shiney, smooth curls with no frizz at all and so soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it works best if I put just a little bit in after a shower and then comb it deep into the roots and to the tips of the hair.</li>
            <li> I have super straight hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;Helps keep your hair strong and soft....</li>

            <li> I bought my first bottle from her</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> So many different products all-in-one!</li>
            <li> I use several Aquage products and love them all.</li>
            <li> It protects it from hot irons as well.</li>
            <li> and my hair would be a pretty wave.</li>
            <li> This does exactly what I wanted it to do -makes</li>
            <li> this is the first prduct that smooths the hair out and leaves it silky and shiny</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it claims.</li>
            <li> My natural hair comes out feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sticking with this - makes my hair soft and silky without residue or greasiness and smells fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I was first turned onto it by my hairdresser -</li>
            <li> This combination gives me soft, full, naturally curly hair, that stays frizz free all day.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best hair product I have ever tired.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used the product I used to much which will make your hair look greasy, but you will have to trial it to see how much you need.  </li>
            <li> I use it after I dry my hair and it works like magic.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong high high humidity days the hair isn&#x27;t perfect</li>
            <li> It is hard to get off my hands, but smells good.</li>
            <li> Well, I left for an important meeting, where I was going to meet very high government officials and family membere</li>
            <li> It decreases my dry time significantly!</li>
            <li> this really works my hair doesnt get frizzy.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really in need of a leave in conditioner</li>
            <li> This really helped solve that problem.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks and feels so much smoother.</li>
            <li> I have very curly and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen in years, straight from the hair dressers, which was a five hour drive.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Like any oil, it will flatten hair if you use too much.  </li>
            <li> really helps make it silky and protects it from the humidity.  </li>

            <li> If it makes your hair greasy, then you&#x27;re using too much.</li>
            <li> Light and yet enough to get the frizzed out.</li>
            <li> This has been a great product to tame my coarse frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> This product is strongly perfumed which I do not care for, but dissipates once hair is dry.  </li>
            <li> If I use more than one pump it leaves my hair weighed down.  </li>
            <li> This product is not in any way better than oil treatments than I have purchased in drugstore or supermarket chains for less than 1/2 the price.</li>
            <li> Used in moderation, it makes your hair smooth and blow dry shiny.</li>
            <li> It only takes a tiny drop in damp hair to work magic for my tresses.</li>
            <li> It actually feels like younger healthy hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found anything that can tame and moisturize my hair and keep it calm and smooth.</li>
            <li> I use this on days when the humidity is high.</li>
            <li> I would    highly recommend this one.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> so when out in high humidity</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy but yet works wonders I highly recommend it and have even turned my sister into a every day user.  </li>
            <li> It adds shine, without any weight, and leaves my short, thin, curly hair looking diva good!  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel super soft, no dry ends</li>
            <li> I have very curly corse hair   and Old hair   </li>
            <li> I really like this product because it does make your hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair soft and pretty frizz free in this unpredictably Houston humid weather.</li>
            <li> My hair is super soft and this product really helps add shine to my already very dry and damaged ends.  </li>
            <li> I live on the water along the coast</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks and my hair is amazingly soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> I have short fine hair and it lays flat after a shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It makes you hair feel very soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Is the exact same as the salon</li>
            <li> have NEVER had soft shiny hair!  </li>
            <li> I received this item only 3/4 full because it was open and taped.</li>
            <li> Cuts down drying time on my hair and leaves it soft and frizz free.</li>
            <li> Most of the time after a couple of hours or a little humidity I am back to the frizz, did not happen with this product.  </li>
            <li> I have thick coarse frizzy hair and this oil is amazing</li>
            <li> It makes it silky and soft just like it says.  </li>
            <li> My ends and hair are now soft and not brittle or crispy/frizzy.</li>
            <li> Makes hair so soft &amp; manageable for straightening.  </li>
            <li> So I bought this product for my 12 year old daughter who has think curly hair that has a tendency to get frizzy...</li>
            <li> It really controls the frizz daily that I have.  </li>
            <li> Not heavy.</li>
            <li> My hair dries faster and is so silky and soft feeling.  </li>
            <li> Ive noticed it also makes my hair color really shine and last a lot longer</li>
            <li> My beautician uses Aquage brand and leaves hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my hair soft</li>
            <li> I lived near the Gulf and have unbearable hair</li>
            <li> this is the only product I have found that really works.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is a bit on the thin side and this product does not &#x27;weigh&#x27; my hair down, but instead gives it a great luster and a soft feel.</li>
            <li> After a fresh hair cut, it even works well to get my short hair to lay down where it wants to spike up in places.  </li>
            <li> It does wonders for my processed, curly hair, especially in the summer, since I live on the Lake!  </li>
            <li> I actually haven&#x27;t used the new bottle yet, but the old bottle is still working.  </li>
            <li> No more frizzies and my hair acts like &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; hair and feels smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for only three consecutive days and my hair feels extra soft, looks shinier, and is much easier to comb.</li>
            <li> The only suggestion that i have is that if you have thick hair like I do, separate you hair in layers to get product in the under layers not just on top and comb through all of your hair.  </li>
            <li> The silkening oil treatment not only makes my hair shiny and smooth, it tames all frizzies and makes it dry in half the time of normal.  </li>
            <li> My hair is pretty damaged due to years of color and highlights.</li>
            <li> Just like the &amp;#34;Aquage Color Protecting Shampoo&amp;#34;, my review of this product is pretty much the same - same product purchased from my salon  at half</li>
            <li> My long blond delicate hair has never been in better health.  </li>
            <li> but you have to be careful using too much.  </li>
            <li> My favorite product for my long, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought a bottle back a couple years ago and am finally needing a new one.  </li>
            <li> I use one pump due to really oily hair.</li>
            <li> I have frizzy, thin hair and many products weigh down my hair too much.  </li>
            <li> I use this product daily, and mainly try to apply it to my crispy and dry ends.  </li>
            <li> I really like this for my hair, leaves it silky soft and less frizzy!</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I purchased in the salon only it cost less.</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to try this because I thought it would wiegh down my already straight hair and make it look oily</li>
            <li> Use this with Aquage straightening Ultra Gel and your curly dry hair will feel silky soft.</li>
            <li> But I can still air dry my hair and get natural curls and waves.</li>
            <li> Really makes my hair less frizzy and I swear it dries faster.</li>
            <li> Not only do I use it on damp hair before blow drying, but I also put a bit extra on dry hair as needed to calm it down.</li>
            <li> The price looks high, but I think this bottle will last me several months, given how little I need to use.</li>
            <li> This product finally tamed my coarse, dry hair.</li>
            <li> I flat iron my hair</li>
            <li> When I use a flat iron, I have hair that shines and \\&quot;swings\\&quot;, and gets rave reviews.  </li>
            <li> I have used this for years, having had it recommended by my hairdresser to protect my hair from the blow dryer and curl iron and flat iron damage.</li>
            <li> oils such as the Moroccan and agave brand and really hit the budget hard for a college student</li>
            <li> I have natural curly again and this is my go to after trying multiple products to tame it.  </li>
            <li> The bottle will last a very long time..worth the money!</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to use too much, I have fairly thick long hair down to the middle of my back and more than a half a pump leaves it a little limp and unworkable.  </li>
            <li> I blow dry and flat iron every day and my hair is still silky and not oily.</li>
            <li> but I have a lot of hair and it tended to look dry because of the blow drying and flat ironing.  </li>
            <li> Thus it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This product weighted my hair down the next day and felt too oily that I had to wash my hair the very next day.  </li>
            <li> Just a little bit to wet hair makes it very soft and silky.</li>
            <li> My hair is short --- about two inches below the ears --- and slightly wavy, so one pea-sized drop of Seaextend, run through damp hair each morning, is enough.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair silky and soft without feeling all greasy and stiff.</li>
            <li> I only give this 4 stars, because I have to use it in combination with 2 other products.  </li>
            <li> I use it before I blow dry my hair and after the straightner or curling iron.  </li>
            <li> and I was having a problem with dry ends</li>
            <li> And Yes it does make your hair dry faster.</li>
            <li> I have put it on dry hair too.</li>
            <li> I started using it when I lived in Wyoming, I could put it in my hair after a shower let my hair air dry</li>
            <li> I just wash and towel dry my hair, apply the product and comb into place.  </li>
            <li> This silkening oil treatment has done wonders for my dry lackluster hair.  </li>
            <li> I put it on my towel dry hair and comb it out then</li>
            <li> Then I blow dry.  </li>
            <li> My processed hair is soooo dry.</li>
            <li> It will last a long time because a little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure any product would completely eliminate the frizz.  </li>
            <li> I have very long thick hair, and live in South Florida.  </li>
            <li> I have frizzy, wavy, sometimes loose spiral curly hair</li>
            <li> i use it on wet hair and blow dry and then re-apply to dry hair and curl.</li>
            <li> This hair product cuts my hair routine in half and this bottle will last me for a while</li>
            <li> let it air dry  just until it is slightly wet.  </li>
            <li> It may seem expensive but a bottle lasts a long time and is really worth the price.  </li>
            <li> The little bit of heat helps it seep in (although do not press hard on the straightener or it will steam haha).</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and one bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Nickel size amount applied to wet hair.</li>
            <li> I only have a few fly-aways now instead of all over my head.  </li>
            <li> Just a couple pumps of product worked into wet hair adds body and shine.</li>
            <li> The product was just as I expected.</li>
            <li> Even with all the $$$ I&#x27;ve spent on leave-on conditioners from Redken to Aveda to Paul Mitchell</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair this will help you get it soft and take the frizz away.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I have found that controls my thick hair in the deep south.  </li>
            <li> and my hair goes just a little past the middle of my back</li>
            <li> Before I use my flat iron, I put a few drops in my hand and rub in my hair.  </li>
            <li> As advertised, it does help dry my hair faster (in half the time).  </li>
            <li> Once I work Aquage through my hair, it is dry in half the time.</li>
            <li> Helps my hair dry in like half the time.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, and still only use a small (less than quarter sized) amount of product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair, and one pump is enough.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> If you have dry hair it will totally transform your hair from dull and frizzy to shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li> I will try some of the other Aquage products to see if they work as well as this one.</li>
            <li> Thinking about trying their other products.  </li>
            <li> I no longer needed the other products.</li>
            <li> Did not irritate my scalp like other mousse or lift products do when I tend to sweat or get</li>
            <li> (if you buy from amazon), I&#x27;ve tried other hair serums/</li>
            <li> will also say I have tried a bazillion other products and nothing has ever worked.  </li>
            <li> Use it every day and it never makes my hair oily like other products can do.  </li>
            <li> I work one pump through my hair, then work through the Aveda Phomollient styling foam, then blow dry with a round brush.  </li>
            <li> I would only recommend if you never experienced oily hair and my hair is damaged from coloring and use of the flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have to add shine products due to leave in conditioners or styling gells leaving a slight dullness.</li>
            <li> Although this product is expensive, it doesn&#x27;t take much to use on each application.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair and Aquage</li>
            <li> I usually have to use multiple products to condition, tame and shine my hair.</li>
            <li> It repairs it, strengthens it, and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> hair feels so moisturized but not weighed down</li>
            <li> Keeps the frizz down.</li>
            <li> For some reason, the Aquage cuts down on the drying time.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s dry and curly; when there&#x27;s any hint of humidity in the air, my hair usually responds.  </li>
            <li> i have very dry and frizzy hair and have a cabinet full of products that I have tried and been disappointed.   </li>
            <li> only use a very small amount or it will make your hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> I section off my hair like the previous reviewer suggested and apply to each layer.  </li>
            <li> If your hair is not so pourous like mine, you will need less product.</li>
            <li> I use the small size for travel and the larger size to fill the small one.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy hair that doubles in size in the humidity.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still not too heavy and won&#x27;t weigh your hair down.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, frizzy hair that takes forever to dry and manage.</li>
            <li> Use this all the time, just use a little bit though.</li>
            <li> Too much product will make your hair look dirty.</li>
            <li> I mix it together in my hands, and apply to towel dried hair, thoroughly distributing everywhere.  </li>
            <li> I do not know how this product does it, but when I use it my hair dries in half the time!</li>
            <li> This product helps tame the beast.</li>
            <li> Calms down the frizzies and gives shine to dull hair.  </li>
            <li> I need very little of it to work, using it either before or after using the flatiron straightener, and my hair feels silky and shiny all day-no frizz or flyaway.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I will have to buy another bottle for my daughter because I am not giving this back.  </li>
            <li> Will probably buy again in the future, its just so expensive.</li>
            <li> I did not bring my usual hair products thinking I would not need them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews</li>
            <li> I use 2 squirts of this, along with 3 squirts Aquage Curl Cream, and 6 squirts of bain de terre recovery complex anti frizz.  </li>
            <li> I am in my late 50&#x27;s and have been struggling with frizz for decades.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair</li>
            <li> I have naturally thick curly hair that frizzes at a moment&#x27;s notice.</li>
            <li> Two pea sized drops is all I need for my thick and below the shoulder length hair.    </li>
            <li> My two daughters have thick hair and this has helped them as well in combing their hair after a shower and help keep the frizz under control.</li>
            <li> I have thick, collarbone length hair.  </li>
            <li> I was getting this product from my hairdresser, but it is way less expensive here.</li>
            <li> It was a big and expensive disappointment</li>
            <li> I have been disappointed by countless hair oil products over the years, but not this one.</li>
            <li> but it is very hard to find.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair that takes forever to air-dry.</li>
            <li> I finally came to the conclusion, I just have bad hair and no product will work- wrong!  </li>
            <li> It seemed a bit expensive until I took into account</li>
            <li> Wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive</li>
            <li> It helps with dry and brittle ends, that my terrible water creates.</li>
            <li> This product trumps humidity like crazy!</li>
            <li> she sold it for an outrageous price</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this stuff.. makes my hair smooth!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product by recommendation of my hairdresser.  It is a great styling serum and keeps my hair shiny and healthy.  I am completely happy with my results.</li>
            <li> Love this product! If you have thick hair this will help you get it soft and take the frizz away. Smells good  as well.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff! Is the exact same as the salon</li>
            <li> I use this on days when the humidity is high. It keeps the frizzy&#x27;s under control. Warning...only use a very small amount or it will make your hair look greasy. The bottle will last a very long time..worth the money!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.  I have color treated hair and Seaextend Ultimate Colorcare Silkening Oil Treatment is fantastic for it.  My hair is a bit on the thin side and this product does not &#x27;weigh&#x27; my hair down, but instead gives it a great luster and a soft feel.</li>
            <li> This product finally tamed my coarse, dry hair. Not only do I use it on damp hair before blow drying, but I also put a bit extra on dry hair as needed to calm it down. It seems to also do a good job of protecting my hair against hot iron damage.</li>
            <li> I only recently tried this product and living in TX this really works my hair doesnt get frizzy.</li>
            <li> This is great for curly hair! It makes it silky and soft just like it says.  I flat iron my hair and it works wonderful.  I would    highly recommend this one.  I have used them all and finally; this one truly works!!!!</li>
            <li> I have frizzy, wavy, sometimes loose spiral curly hair and I received a sample size of this oil treatment and fell in love with it!! My ends and hair are now soft and not brittle or crispy/frizzy. I ordered this from [...] though for $[...]. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I used this at a salon and it is amazing. Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy or oily but leaves your hair silky smooth!</li>
            <li> I received this item only 3/4 full because it was open and taped. Upon trying it out, it didn&#x27;t have the same results as the same name product I purchased from the salon. It felt oiler and heavier in my hair. Can&#x27;t prove it, but I don&#x27;t believe this is the actual product. Will never use this seller again.</li>
            <li> Use this all the time, just use a little bit though.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my hairdresser &amp; it works so well on my hair!  Makes hair so soft &amp; manageable for straightening.  Will definately continue to purchase &amp; use this hair product!</li>
            <li> I have curly hair which means sometimes it can be frizzy.  THis product is great and has given me the best curls without the frizz.  I have tried many products, this is the best by far!</li>
            <li> I use this product every day. Nickel size amount applied to wet hair. Start at the ends and work your way up...comb through. It&#x27;s a very nice product that protects my hair</li>
            <li> My hair is super soft and this product really helps add shine to my already very dry and damaged ends.  I use it before I blow dry my hair and after the straightner or curling iron.  I no longer have to use hairspray.  I am one happy customer.</li>
            <li> This is a great product in has argon oil in it and I love that oil also.  Hope others find this product and try it.  Got a sample from my hair dresser and just loved the shine it gives may hair and it helps with the fuzes.  Sandroc777</li>
            <li> This oil does amazing things for my curly hair.  It adds shine, without any weight, and leaves my short, thin, curly hair looking diva good!  When I use a flat iron, I have hair that shines and \\&quot;swings\\&quot;, and gets rave reviews.  It only takes a tiny drop in damp hair to work magic for my tresses. After styling, I rub another tiny drop between my hands and smooth through my hair, for the perfect finish.  I love, love and highly recommend this product.  In fact, every Aquage product I have used has been wonderful.  Often I find you get what you pay for, and I believe this about the Aquage products (and I am a \\&quot;product junky\\&quot;, so I have probably tried it if it is out there).  I consistently return to their product line for fabulous results.</li>
            <li> I really like this for my hair, leaves it silky soft and less frizzy!</li>
            <li> This is the best oil for hair.  It repairs it, strengthens it, and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely AMAZING.  If you have dry hair it will totally transform your hair from dull and frizzy to shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product for adding luster and body to your hair without adding oil or weighing it down.</li>
            <li> i have very dry and frizzy hair and have a cabinet full of products that I have tried and been disappointed.   I have tried many products to use prior to using my straightening iron to keep the frizziness at bay.  This product actually works and works until i wash my hair.  Most of the time after a couple of hours or a little humidity I am back to the frizz, did not happen with this product.  I have been very happy with the results, it is not summer yet but I am expecting good results even with more humidity.  It smells good and I did not need a lot of product. The first time I used the product I used to much which will make your hair look greasy, but you will have to trial it to see how much you need.  The only suggestion that i have is that if you have thick hair like I do, separate you hair in layers to get product in the under layers not just on top and comb through all of your hair.  I will try some of the other Aquage products to see if they work as well as this one.</li>
            <li> My stylist introduced me to this product. It decreases my dry time significantly! It&#x27;s also great for my hair and helps with the shine!</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy hair that doubles in size in the humidity.  I live on the water along the coast and I&#x27;m not sure any product would completely eliminate the frizz.  It took me several attempts to administer the correct amount of this product.  I section off my hair like the previous reviewer suggested and apply to each layer.  While expensive, it is much more affordable than a Brazilian Blowout.  My hair dries within a couple of hours of applying instead of staying damp all day.  This product is strongly perfumed which I do not care for, but dissipates once hair is dry.  It has added much needed luster to my hair and my hair looks great for several days after washing.  I only have a few fly-aways now instead of all over my head.  Will continue to play with the amount.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It leaves my hair silky smooth and really shiny. It also protects my hair from my hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I love the seaextend oil. I have been using this product for a few weeks and my hair is amazingly soft and healthy. I blow dry and flat iron every day and my hair is still silky and not oily. I would 100% recommend this product.</li>
            <li> So I bought this product for my 12 year old daughter who has think curly hair that has a tendency to get frizzy... so I have been searching and searching for something to help her and believe me we have tried most of the drug store stuff and the best we had come up with until this was an AVEDA product. I have super straight hair and I was having a problem with dry ends I was reluctant to try this because I thought it would wiegh down my already straight hair and make it look oily but I decided to try it anyway.  I LOVE IT!.  It makes my hair feel super soft, no dry ends and it makes my hair lay perfect for my bob haircut. Needless to say I will have to buy another bottle for my daughter because I am not giving this back.  Thinking about trying their other products.  And Yes it does make your hair dry faster.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  You would think it would make your hair greasy but it doesn&#x27;t.  My hair just soaked it up.  Will probably buy again in the future, its just so expensive.</li>
            <li> I do not know how this product does it, but when I use it my hair dries in half the time! I wasn&#x27;t really in need of a leave in conditioner but I was in need of a shorter drying time in the mornings. A beautician mentioned that this would help. I bought my first bottle from her and she was right. This stuff is magical. AND it smells great to boot!</li>
            <li> Love this product so much.  I don&#x27;t have color treated hair but I have a lot of hair and it tended to look dry because of the blow drying and flat ironing.  This really helped solve that problem.  Everywhere I go I get compliments on how healthy and shiny my hair looks.  My mom is hooked on it too.  She has color treated hair and this product really helps her hair look shiny and smooth.  It will last a long time because a little does go a long way. Too much product will make your hair look dirty.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I purchased in the salon only it cost less. It smooths &amp; shines hair. I love it!</li>
            <li> This product works fabulous, my hairdresser turned me on to this product. I haven&#x27;t found another one that works nearly as good, without leaving your hair feeling oily.</li>
            <li> This hair product is amazing! Just a couple pumps of product worked into wet hair adds body and shine.</li>
            <li> This product weighted my hair down the next day and felt too oily that I had to wash my hair the very next day.  I would only recommend if you never experienced oily hair and my hair is damaged from coloring and use of the flat iron.</li>
            <li> Use it daily when drying hair. My hair looks and feels so much smoother. Helps with color too.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair. I was getting this product from my hairdresser, but it is way less expensive here. It really works!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my girlfriend and she absoultely loves it, i will have to order some more for her this year again!</li>
            <li> This product is not in any way better than oil treatments than I have purchased in drugstore or supermarket chains for less than 1/2 the price. It was a big and expensive disappointment</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I can&#x27;t believe I bought it here for under $20!&lt;br /&gt;I have used it before so there were no shocks when it came to the actual product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells amazing like a day at sea on a yacht drinking mimosas in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels so moisturized but not weighed down which is a miracle for my fine hair! Love it. Will always use.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I have found that controls my thick hair in the deep south.  A little goes a long way.  It is more expensive if I buy it local?????  so I always use Amazon to get the best price.  P.S. it smells very nice, not overpowering just nice.</li>
            <li> I have very long thick hair, and live in South Florida.  I have tried all kinds of products to keep my frizz tamed.  I only give this 4 stars, because I have to use it in combination with 2 other products.  I use 2 squirts of this, along with 3 squirts Aquage Curl Cream, and 6 squirts of bain de terre recovery complex anti frizz.  I mix it together in my hands, and apply to towel dried hair, thoroughly distributing everywhere.  My hair dries quickly on its own.  This combination gives me soft, full, naturally curly hair, that stays frizz free all day.</li>
            <li> My wife swears by this product and says that it really makes her hair more manageable.  Has been using for about a year and will not use anything else.</li>
            <li> great hair product, a little pricey</li>
            <li> Leaves a nice shine and softness.</li>
            <li> I actually haven&#x27;t used the new bottle yet, but the old bottle is still working.  It helps with dry and brittle ends, that my terrible water creates.</li>
            <li> Although this product is expensive, it doesn&#x27;t take much to use on each application.  Thus it lasts a long time.  I have short fine hair and it lays flat after a shampoo.  If not styling my hair, I put this conditioner on for moisture and it lifts and separates the strands of hair.  However, if you want permanent lift you can put another styling gel or paste on top.  It makes you hair feel very soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Not heavy like most of the leave-in treatments. So many different products all-in-one! Great for all hair types also. I have thick, curly hair but my daughter has fine hair and it works great for both of us.</li>
            <li> The product was just as I expected. Perfect !  It was exactly what I needed and it works great. I am. Rey pleased</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I have very curly and frizzy hair. Well I should say I did have fizzy hair. This product makes my hair feel soft, healthy, and luxurious. It seals the hair shaft so when out in high humidity my hair is so much more under control. I have aging colored hair so the chemicals do a number on it. My hair is softer than it has been in years. It actually feels like younger healthy hair. I love this product! The value is good considering the amount you get. Try it!</li>
            <li> I am in my late 50&#x27;s and have been struggling with frizz for decades. I usually have to use multiple products to condition, tame and shine my hair. I have to add shine products due to leave in conditioners or styling gells leaving a slight dullness. Well, I left for an important meeting, where I was going to meet very high government officials and family membere I haven&#x27;t seen in years, straight from the hair dressers, which was a five hour drive. My hair was perfect when I left. Not so when I arrived. I got in a tizzy remembering I did not bring my usual hair products thinking I would not need them. The only product I had with me was the Aquage Silkening Oil Treatment I had just purchased it at the salon before I left. So lucky! I did a quick shampoo and put in quite a bit of product crossing my fingers in hopes of not looking a disaster. My hair came out super shiney, smooth curls with no frizz at all and so soft. It lasted the entire day. It was even great the next day. That never happens. It seemed a bit expensive until I took into account I no longer needed the other products. This is everything in one bottle. I even like the smell. If your hair is not so pourous like mine, you will need less product. After decades of trying this and that, I am no longer in search of the perfect product. I&#x27;ve got it!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It really controls the frizz daily that I have.  I use several Aquage products and love them all.</li>
            <li> I have naturally thick curly hair that frizzes at a moment&#x27;s notice. Even with all the $$$ I&#x27;ve spent on leave-on conditioners from Redken to Aveda to Paul Mitchell I&#x27;ve never found anything that can tame and moisturize my hair and keep it calm and smooth. And then I tried the Aquage hair products and my hair loves them but this Silkening Oil is a miracle worker and keeps it so curly and frizz-free. I get so many compliments on my hair now, wish I had had this is highschool!! I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but Amazon customers are always helping me with their reviews and I just wanted to return the favor. If you&#x27;re looking for a miracle worker for frizzy hair this is for you!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser uses this so I bought some. Just a little bit to wet hair makes it very soft and silky. Keeps the frizz down. I have put it on dry hair too. It protects it from hot irons as well. Nice product. Not heavy.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years, having had it recommended by my hairdresser to protect my hair from the blow dryer and curl iron and flat iron damage. It works wonders. No frizz, soft, and it looks beautiful. Just don&#x27;t use more than one or two pumps, and don&#x27;t get it near your scalp, or your hair will look oily.</li>
            <li> Could not find this product in stores or beauty salons so I ordered it on amazon.  My sister uses it and she let me try it and it made my hair so silky and smooth, I loved it.  Did not irritate my scalp like other mousse or lift products do when I tend to sweat or get warm.&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived promptly when stated.</li>
            <li> Awsome product perfect for heat protection and frizz leaves my hair super Shiney and soft!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It tames the frizzy&#x27;s and silkens the hair.  It is weightless and not greasy.  It makes your hair super shiny.  I have white hair and it sparkles!  It also protects your hair from the blow dryer according to my stylist.</li>
            <li> I used this product before about a year ago and absolutely LOVED it. This time i purchased it and i still absolutely love it its leaves my hair silky and soft when i straighten it. I use it as a heat protectant</li>
            <li> Love this product which I&#x27;ve been using for 3 years. It is better than Moroccan Oil, I think.  My hair dries faster and is so silky and soft feeling.  I have lots of hair with a mind of its own and this product helps me style it quickly (curly or straighter).  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Use this with Aquage straightening Ultra Gel and your curly dry hair will feel silky soft.</li>
            <li> This serum is magic!!! Best serum I have ever used. Cuts down drying time on my hair and leaves it soft and frizz free. NOT greasy!! Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is awesome!! For any type of hair this works really good.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! such great hair softness and frizziness is tamed, I&#x27;m in love with this! Ive noticed it also makes my hair color really shine and last a lot longer and my hair dries much more quickly after a shower with this! Best of all is the price (if you buy from amazon), I&#x27;ve tried other hair serums/oils such as the Moroccan and agave brand and really hit the budget hard for a college student and they didn&#x27;t feel right for my hair and i just keep coming back to this product! It lasts quite sometime too, you don&#x27;t need much half to one pump each time works great for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 years. I started using it when I lived in Wyoming, I could put it in my hair after a shower let my hair air dry and my hair would be a pretty wave. Then I moved back to Kansas hello humidity, I thought I&#x27;d never be able to have pretty hair again. But I can still air dry my hair and get natural curls and waves. Don&#x27;t get me wrong high high humidity days the hair isn&#x27;t perfect but I most definitely think it&#x27;s this product that makes my hair have good hair days. I love it and recommend it to anyone! I use one pump due to really oily hair. Im 5&#x27;8 and my hair goes just a little past the middle of my back but you can see what works best for you!</li>
            <li> Been using this for two years.  My long blond delicate hair has never been in better health.  This bottle, when used to directions, will last you 6-12 mo.  Worth every cent.</li>
            <li> This does exactly what I wanted it to do -makes my hair smooth, silky, and manageable!    Two pea sized drops is all I need for my thick and below the shoulder length hair.    More than that would be too much.    Good price, too.</li>
            <li> I have very curly corse hair   and Old hair   this is the first prduct that smooths the hair out and leaves it silky and shiny</li>
            <li> This product puts a shine to my hair and makes it manageable with the proper amount.  Remember, IT IS AN OIL!  Like any oil, it will flatten hair if you use too much.  As advertised, it does help dry my hair faster (in half the time).  I just wash and towel dry my hair, apply the product and comb into place.  It dries without an oily appearance but my hair is softer and more natual looking than it is with styling gels.  After a fresh hair cut, it even works well to get my short hair to lay down where it wants to spike up in places.  I just briefly use a blow dryer in those places to help accomodate that.</li>
            <li> Great product for  calming naturally curly hair! I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 5 years, and love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I have thick, coarse hair and Aquage really helps make it silky and protects it from the humidity.  Wonderful fragrance too!</li>
            <li> I love this. it make my hair so much softer. but it is very hard to find.</li>
            <li> My beautician uses Aquage brand and leaves hair soft and silky. Received when promised.</li>
            <li> Gift for my daughter.  Says it it great for straightened hair.  Restores shine to the ends and makes hair look healthy.</li>
            <li> My hair is real curly and frizzy. This oil and the straightening gel used together make my hair easy to manage! No more frizzies and my hair acts like &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; hair and feels smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> Aquage silkening has been my favorite hair product for about 6 years. It keeps my hair soft and pretty frizz free in this unpredictably Houston humid weather. I have very thick hair that takes forever to air-dry. Once I work Aquage through my hair, it is dry in half the time.</li>
            <li> Someone helpful in smoothing hair.. Not the best product out there.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with the purchase.  It was delivered as promised and packaged well.</li>
            <li> I really like this product because it does make your hair soft and silky. My hair is pretty damaged due to years of color and highlights. (Blonde). My sister told me about this product. It definitely give damaged hair a healthier look. It doesn&#x27;t help with fizz or &amp;#34;puffiness&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> ya know, I don&#x27;t think it works as well as the product I bought in the beauty shop.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  I have frizzy, thin hair and many products weigh down my hair too much.  Before I use my flat iron, I put a few drops in my hand and rub in my hair.  My hair comes out looking shiny and non-frizzy without too much weight.</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous.  It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve found out there that actually keeps my hair from frizzing, even in the rain and fog!  I color my hair and it&#x27;s dry and curly; when there&#x27;s any hint of humidity in the air, my hair usually responds.  If you follow the directions for using this product, you won&#x27;t have that problem any longer.  I&#x27;ve tried all the others and this one is IT!  Great price, too, because you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of this.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This product has been a life saver for my two daughters and I.  I have fine straight hair that tangles easy no matter how much I brush it.  This product is a miracle on my hair after I shower.  I just do one pump, spread it on my hair and my hair combs easily with no tangles and I no longer have a problem with static electricity.  My two daughters have thick hair and this has helped them as well in combing their hair after a shower and help keep the frizz under control.</li>
            <li> Great product but you have to be careful using too much.  If I use more than one pump it leaves my hair weighed down.  I have thick, collarbone length hair.  It definitely helps with frizz and makes styling easier.</li>
            <li> Really makes my hair less frizzy and I swear it dries faster. Wonderful smell. It came packaged well.</li>
            <li> And oh so easy to comb out, love aquage, will continue to use this product again and again. Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, wavy hair that I have been trying to grow out for awhile.  I rarely use any sort of heat on it, since it damages so easily.  I use this product daily, and mainly try to apply it to my crispy and dry ends.  It works well, but I don&#x27;t think it is by any means life changing.  This product contains silicone, which is a plastic which basically just coats the hair.  It does not add moisture, so deep conditioning is still important.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it claims. I need very little of it to work, using it either before or after using the flatiron straightener, and my hair feels silky and shiny all day-no frizz or flyaway. It is hard to get off my hands, but smells good.</li>
            <li> This silkening oil treatment has done wonders for my dry lackluster hair.  Seller had a good price and it was delivered promptly.</li>
            <li> Every good thing that all the above posters said and more! I have been disappointed by countless hair oil products over the years, but not this one. I have finally found my Holy Grail.&lt;br /&gt;It really does do everything they say, and my hair has never looked better!&lt;br /&gt;Love, love, love it!!!</li>
            <li> AWESOME! I love this product! It does wonders for my processed, curly hair, especially in the summer, since I live on the Lake!  Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I discovered This product from my Hairdresser and loved it. It makes my hair shine and is manageable. I use the small size for travel and the larger size to fill the small one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years.  Have thick,naturally really curly hair. When I use a curling iron to straighten it some this holds through all kinds of humidity.  I use nothing but aquage products on my hair.</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to use too much, I have fairly thick long hair down to the middle of my back and more than a half a pump leaves it a little limp and unworkable.  Half a pump leaves me silky smooth, shiny, and looking fresh for 2 days without washing, great stuff.</li>
            <li> This is honestly my FAVORITE product. I have thick, frizzy hair that takes forever to dry and manage. This hair product cuts my hair routine in half and this bottle will last me for a while so it is worth it!</li>
            <li> This has been a great product to tame my coarse frizzy hair. I&#x27;ve had numerous compliments since I started using it</li>
            <li> This product trumps humidity like crazy! Used in moderation, it makes your hair smooth and blow dry shiny. Great product!</li>
            <li> Been using this for years&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my hair soft</li>
            <li> Seaextend Ultimate Colorcare Silkening Oil Treatment is amazing.  I put it on my towel dry hair and comb it out then let it air dry  just until it is slightly wet.  Then I blow dry.  My natural hair comes out feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I sought this stuff out.  I bought a bottle back a couple years ago and am finally needing a new one.  This is the real deal.  Works better than any of the mega-expensive stuff I buy at Beauty Brands.  I&#x27;m sticking with this - makes my hair soft and silky without residue or greasiness and smells fantastic.  Helps my hair dry in like half the time.</li>
            <li> Best product ever, very light on the hair unlike silicone product and makes my hair shiny . I highly recommend it :)</li>
            <li> I lived near the Gulf and have unbearable hair this is the only product I have found that really works.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic and Amazon has the best price.  Was introduced to it by my hairdresser.  I have naturally curly, frizzy hair.  After shampooing and towel drying I work one pump through my hair, then work through the Aveda Phomollient styling foam, then blow dry with a round brush.  For some reason, the Aquage cuts down on the drying time.  My hair comes out silky smooth, no frizz, and it stays that way until the next shampoo.  A little goes a long way and one bottle lasts a long time. I have long, thick hair, and one pump is enough.  If it makes your hair greasy, then you&#x27;re using too much.</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you have dry hair that tangles easily. It doesn&#x27;t weight it down or make it greasy just nice, smooth and tangle free.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST!!! I have thick coarse frizzy hair and this oil is amazing, I am 53 and up until now have NEVER had soft shiny hair!  THANK-YOU</li>
            <li> This is by far the best hair product I have ever tired.  The silkening oil treatment not only makes my hair shiny and smooth, it tames all frizzies and makes it dry in half the time of normal.  It is also a good sized bottle that lasts a long time.  I have long hair, and still only use a small (less than quarter sized) amount of product.&lt;br /&gt;I will also say I have tried a bazillion other products and nothing has ever worked.  I finally came to the conclusion, I just have bad hair and no product will work- wrong!  The silkening oil treatment makes my hair beautiful!</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this product and so much cheaper than the salon price of $20 for 1.5 ounces! Highly recommend this to anyone looking for silky smooth hair.</li>
            <li> Love it - works great in my hair.</li>
            <li> fabulous product! it&#x27;s so light weight that you can over apply it and it&#x27;s still not too heavy and won&#x27;t weigh your hair down.  i use it on wet hair and blow dry and then re-apply to dry hair and curl. worth the $ for sure!</li>
            <li> My processed hair is soooo dry. This product helps tame the beast. Light and yet enough to get the frizzed out.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li> This is the only thing after-shower product that works for my hair. It keeps my hair silky and soft without feeling all greasy and stiff. I&#x27;ve found it works best if I put just a little bit in after a shower and then comb it deep into the roots and to the tips of the hair. Or else, it&#x27;s perfect right after straightening my hair (to remoisturize it), and I usually do one last straighten-through on my hair right after applying. The little bit of heat helps it seep in (although do not press hard on the straightener or it will steam haha). Anyway, I really love this. Wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive but oh well. Also, the straightening gel is really nice in the hair too and not greasy either. Love this brand so much.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff... I was first turned onto it by my hairdresser - she sold it for an outrageous price but I needed it at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helps keep your hair strong and soft.... yes it is oil, so it is oily BUT to be honest... it does NOT feel that way when you put it on, just on your hands lol!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell is great and it brightens/shines your hair!</li>
            <li> Just like the &amp;#34;Aquage Color Protecting Shampoo&amp;#34;, my review of this product is pretty much the same - same product purchased from my salon  at half the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liz</li>
            <li> Calms down the frizzies and gives shine to dull hair.  I use it after I dry my hair and it works like magic.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. I&#x27;m not much for putting gunk in my hair, but this works beautifully. It tames the frizz without leaving my hair weighted and oily. It is now a staple in my bathroom cabinet.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair very smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> Hands down, one of the best silkening treatments out there. Does not leave any residue on clean hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for only three consecutive days and my hair feels extra soft, looks shinier, and is much easier to comb. My hair is short --- about two inches below the ears --- and slightly wavy, so one pea-sized drop of Seaextend, run through damp hair each morning, is enough. The oil never looks or feels greasy. The price looks high, but I think this bottle will last me several months, given how little I need to use. I have also tried Garnier Fructis Anti-Frizz Serum, which is quite good in dry winter weather, but could never prevent my hair from frizzing during humid Baltimore summers. Hope this review helps!</li>
            <li> I have natural curly again and this is my go to after trying multiple products to tame it.  It&#x27;s not greasy but yet works wonders I highly recommend it and have even turned my sister into a every day user.  It may seem expensive but a bottle lasts a long time and is really worth the price.  My hair also feels healthier and looks shinier.</li>
            <li> Use it every day and it never makes my hair oily like other products can do.  I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My favorite product for my long, thick hair.  It makes it silky and keeps the fizziness away.</li>
