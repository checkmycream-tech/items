            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and so overpriced at the salon.  </li>
            <li>I guess it may work better for frizziness, but that is not my issue.  </li>
            <li>My hair remained straight, smooth not to mention smells great when I shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo as it makes my hair so smooth.</li>
            <li>Nice fresh scent, not too floral or fruity.</li>
            <li>As good as any professional brand shampoo like Matrix smoothing or Biolage, etc.  </li>
            <li>It does not give ur hair a clean &amp;#34;just shampoo&#x27;d&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I loved this shampoo for its results, especially after my hair smoothening treatment.</li>
            <li>Thanks for having an alternative way to get the product I love, without spending 3x&#x27;s what it should.</li>
            <li>Its good as expected.</li>
            <li>It was worth a try, and I can see where it would work for frizzy hair maybe.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the shampoo much, as I didn&#x27;t feel it as original L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>But I eventually stopped using because of too much hair fall.</li>
            <li>Intensely hydrating/smoothing formula.  </li>
            <li>line, obviously, this is not good for my hair, but may work beautifully for others.</li>
            <li>It really smooths out my hair and makes it shiny and soft</li>
            <li>Anyone want a brand new bottle??</li>
            <li>This shampoo does not dry the hair like other shampoos and keeps hair straight and smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m nearly 63</li>
            <li>It seemed as if it has been mixed with some other shampoo as the fragrance of the original L&#x27;Oreal I have been using for years and this one differed completely..</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m going to try adding some regular shampoo to this one so as to not waste this new bottle of shampoo, not to mention that it cost double of what I usually spend on shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom</li>
            <li> Never had to use straightner as long as I used this shampoo and its corresponding mask.</li>
            <li> and my long hair has thinned</li>
            <li> My hair used to be so curly and dry, so I got it straightened at Loreal Spa.</li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> I avoid shampoos that are combined with conditioners and this shampoo leaves my hair limp, flat, and looking like it needs to be</li>
            <li> It does seem to tame down the curl a bit, but not totally.  </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s not me, because I don&#x27;t have this problem with any other brand.</li>

            <li> Unbelievable response..</li>
            <li> I am not sure what</li>
            <li> I usually wash my hair 2-3 times a week and this shampoo makes my hair feel greasy, gummy and kills the shine.  </li>
            <li> washed.&lt;br /&gt;While rinsing this shampoo out, my hair felt like I was rinsing my conditioner out with that slick</li>

            <li> The best shampoo i ever had..Unbelievable response..I have been using this shampoo since 3 years and i can say this product is a must try..U wont get disappointed..Awesome haircare product by Loreal.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife who had got her hair straightened. She had tried this product in India and wanted to continue to use it here after we were back from our vacation. This shampoo came in a pack of 2 bottles and lasted her for 8 months. This shampoo does not dry the hair like other shampoos and keeps hair straight and smooth.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. As expected. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> After washing my hair, it&#x27;s smoothy. but it&#x27;s not Anti-Dandruff.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. It really smooths out my hair and makes it shiny and soft</li>
            <li> My hair used to be so curly and dry, so I got it straightened at Loreal Spa. They recommended this shampoo, so I am using it and it works great. My hair remained straight, smooth not to mention smells great when I shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have noticed using this shampoo that I have to wash my hair every single day to avoid looking like a grease slick. I know it&#x27;s not me, because I don&#x27;t have this problem with any other brand. It looks nice in the morning after shampooing and blow drying, but by 5pm I feel greasy. Ew.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what but there is something wrong with the product I have received. The shampoo does not make any foam and not up to the quality I have used before. I would definately like my money back on this product as it does not satisfy my need. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have got my hair straightened. I love this shampoo as it makes my hair so smooth. I don&#x27;t even feel the need to comb my hair after shampoo and conditioning.</li>
            <li> I loved this shampoo for its results, especially after my hair smoothening treatment. Never had to use straightner as long as I used this shampoo and its corresponding mask. But I eventually stopped using because of too much hair fall. Now trying SebaMed for some relief.</li>
            <li> Intensely hydrating/smoothing formula.  As good as any professional brand shampoo like Matrix smoothing or Biolage, etc.  Nice fresh scent, not too floral or fruity.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and so overpriced at the salon.  Thanks for having an alternative way to get the product I love, without spending 3x&#x27;s what it should.</li>
            <li> Its good as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairdresser and I wish I could give this shampoo zero stars.  It does not give ur hair a clean &amp;#34;just shampoo&#x27;d&amp;#34; feeling. I usually wash my hair 2-3 times a week and this shampoo makes my hair feel greasy, gummy and kills the shine.  I have thick wavy hair and I have to wash my hair everyday with this shampoo. I will not be purchasing again. Anyone want a brand new bottle?? they can have mine...</li>
            <li> It does seem to tame down the curl a bit, but not totally.  I guess it may work better for frizziness, but that is not my issue.  It was worth a try, and I can see where it would work for frizzy hair maybe.</li>

I&#x27;m going to try adding some regular shampoo to this one so as to not waste this new bottle of shampoo, not to mention that it cost double of what I usually spend on shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, obviously, this is not good for my hair, but may work beautifully for others.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the shampoo much, as I didn&#x27;t feel it as original L&#x27;Oreal. It seemed as if it has been mixed with some other shampoo as the fragrance of the original L&#x27;Oreal I have been using for years and this one differed completely..</li>
            <li> Great during summer humidity.</li>
