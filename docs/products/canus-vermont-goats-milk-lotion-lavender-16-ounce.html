            <li>Very smooth and silky lotion.</li>
            <li>My favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok for summer skin, but I put it on in the bathroom immediately before bed, and by the time I get there</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t smell it at all any more.</li>
            <li>I love it, the fragrance is not overpowering but</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>Fabulous lotion!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a lavender scent person - just love it.  </li>
            <li>Helps to control itching - love the lotion</li>
            <li>This is quite possibly the best lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li>ordered this kinds of products for many times.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I love the way this lotion makes my hands feel.  </li>
            <li>Love this lotion and lavender scent also</li>
            <li>This smells good and works pretty well too.</li>
            <li>I have extremely dry skin and have found Canus lotion to be the best for it.</li>
            <li>Canus Goat Cream is fast absorbing, never greasey and just the BEST.  </li>
            <li>Makes for a smooth and satisfying lotion.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t make up my mind whether I like this scent or the original scent better.  </li>
            <li>Has a genuine lavender smell.</li>
            <li>I use it intermittently with the Canus Moisturizing Lotion Fragrance free.</li>
            <li>- it goes on smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>Love the smell, strong at first</li>
            <li>Fairly clean ingredients.</li>
            <li>more a fresh background fragrance, the skin is soft and healthy</li>
            <li>i sure i will be getting more for her next christmas.</li>
            <li>I would like to try more Goat&#x27;s Milk lotion, just more of a traditional scent.</li>
            <li>No oily residue - soaks in quickly.  </li>
            <li>Pump is easy to use &amp; reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>The lavender is a natural scent (not &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34;), however the clean smell of original is perferred.  </li>
            <li>Most definitely reorder again and again.</li>
            <li>When this lotion arrived, it&#x27;s extremly hot as comsmetic, like it had been placing in the food warmer.</li>
            <li>It is smooth, creamy, but thicker than most lotions that are so runny that you have to chase it down your arm.  </li>
            <li>The lotion actually smells like lavendar, is easy to apply, and is absorbed by the skin.</li>
            <li>The scent is ok - a little overpowering but it does blend in pretty quick</li>
            <li>What I do appreciate is that the lavender is a pure scent.  </li>
            <li>Very silky and works well in winter with roughened skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Really, it doesn&#x27;t matter.  </li>
            <li>I really like this lotion</li>
            <li>I already placed an order for a second bottle (original scent) before we run out.  </li>
            <li>Not particularly fond of the lavender strong smell (real lavender odor)</li>
            <li>Highly recommended (I&#x27;ve been recommending it to my patients as well - the eczema and psoriasis sufferers).</li>
            <li>If you think the price too high, consider that this 16oz.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive skin and this lotion does it job to moisturize and nourish it.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like wasting $16 or so, I&#x27;d recommed you to go and get this lotion in your local store during hot weather.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a lotion that is made from natural ingredients</li>
            <li>His skin has completely cleared out.  </li>
            <li>Lotion also moisturizes well and keeps the skin soft and well-hydrated.  </li>
            <li>Fragrance is fantastic and stays on the skin with a subtle allure.  </li>
            <li>Moisturizes dry skin and keeps skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>Recommend to anyone with sensitive and dry skin.  </li>

            <li> My favorite lotion. Love the smell, strong at first but you become used to it. Has a genuine lavender smell. I also use it on my face and it does not leave it oily or cause it to break out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  Not too crazy about it, but I use it for my legs when I play tennis.</li>

            <li> I got this lotion for my grandma. She prefers Goat milk lotion to other lotion because her hands do not feel greasy after using goat milk lotion. She was very happy with the product i sure i will be getting more for her next christmas.</li>

            <li> It feels watery, but it is actually moisturizing compared to other name brand lotions. And I love the lavender scent!!!</li>
            <li> I did a research before buying this product and I&#x27;m so glad I did. My children and I, all suffer from mild eczema during the cold months. Within a week, my son who has the worst flare up (whole torso and legs) benefited from this lotion so well.  His skin has completely cleared out.  Lotion also moisturizes well and keeps the skin soft and well-hydrated.  I already placed an order for a second bottle (original scent) before we run out.  Not particularly fond of the lavender strong smell (real lavender odor) but it fades away after a couple of hours. Most definitely reorder again and again. Highly recommended (I&#x27;ve been recommending it to my patients as well - the eczema and psoriasis sufferers).</li>
            <li> I like the goat&#x27;s milk lotion.  It is smooth, creamy, but thicker than most lotions that are so runny that you have to chase it down your arm.  Makes for a smooth and satisfying lotion.  Not a fan of the lavender, gave it a try, but that is my own tastes.

            <li> Fabulous lotion! I highly recommend it! I always use their soap, too great stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I&#x27;m a lavender scent person - just love it.  And Canus uses a quality lavender to make this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t make up my mind whether I like this scent or the original scent better.  Really, it doesn&#x27;t matter.  This is a wonderful moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This smells good and works pretty well too. It&#x27;s not as thick of lotion as&lt;br /&gt;I usually like but it&#x27;s a great product!</li>

            <li> Excellen product.  Recommend to anyone with sensitive and dry skin.  No oily residue - soaks in quickly.  Will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Great item and well made at a very good price. Like the ones in the good stores but a better price and delivered.</li>
            <li> Very nice light moisturizing lotion. Smell lingers for awhile. Pump is easy to use &amp; reasonably priced. Fairly clean ingredients.</li>
            <li> This is quite possibly the best lotion I have ever used. It smells great, no greasy feel. I&#x27;m totally addicted!</li>
            <li> I have used Canus for years and get everyone I know addicted to this.  The lavender is a natural scent (not &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34;), however the clean smell of original is perferred.  I gave this as agift to my Mother who loves lavender and she agrees.  Canus Goat Cream is fast absorbing, never greasey and just the BEST.  If you think the price too high, consider that this 16oz. will last you several months with daily use.  A little goes a long way when the product is quality.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion - it goes on smooth and creamy. The scent is ok - a little overpowering but it does blend in pretty quick (so the overpowering scent tends to go away).</li>
            <li> ordered this kinds of products for many times. great products. and smell great. especially use with the Canus Bar Soap together. great one. love it</li>
            <li> I love the way this lotion makes my hands feel.  I keep it at work and my coworkers come into my office to use it daily as well.</li>
            <li> I have used the other lotions by Canus...but this is by far the best.  Yes, the aroma is stronger, but it does fade some.  What I do appreciate is that the lavender is a pure scent.  Not the phony lavenders I have had in the past.  As aways the lotion is excellent.  I have extremely dry skin and have found Canus lotion to be the best for it.</li>
            <li> The lotion actually smells like lavendar, is easy to apply, and is absorbed by the skin. The delivery was prompt.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion and lavender scent also</li>
