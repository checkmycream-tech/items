    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My thumbnails and index fingernails have always peeled and split in layers and this product has helped cure this problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this item for 2 years. It&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery and excellent product. Happy on both counts.</li>
            <li> I received this product quickly.  I liked the new design.  And it does work well.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff.  I&#x27;ve used it on and off since the late 90&#x27;s.  This stuff strengthens my weak nails which allows me to grow them longer.  This polish dries very fast and stays on for a good few days.  The price is well worth it.  You won&#x27;t regret it!  You can pick it up at the drugstore too.</li>
            <li> Superfast shipping on this Nailtiques kit. It includes Formula 2 and thinner for when it thickens up, as it will. The thinner will last years and for many bottles of Formula 2. This is the only product that will extend your nail bed. I used to bite my nails, and I had short, stubby nails. Now my nails have a longer, more elegant nail bed. They also are sort of spatula shaped except when I use nailtiques--they become more slender. Use this product religiously. One coat the first day that dries in 60 seconds. The next day, add a second coat. The third day, remove polish and put on one coat again and so on.  I have used this product for at least 15 years and would not be without it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Formula 2. I thought that the Formula Fix would be more efficient, but it is still very good.</li>
            <li> The only nail product that had ended my splitting, peeling, breaking nails.  No more acrylics!  Love this product!</li>
            <li> This stuff works.  No doubt about it!  I suffered with weak nails for years and this is the only thing that worked.  I find myself staring at my nails now they are so long and pretty!</li>
            <li> Nailtiques always meets my expectations. It&#x27;s the only thing that keeps my nails in shape. And the protein thinner makes it last longer. And Amazon always delivers when they say they will, and sometimes sooner.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sally Hansen products to make my nails strongee with not too much luck. I found the review of this product on another Internet site but Amazon carried it for cheaper. Love the product. Now I can wear a nail polish again on my long nails.</li>
            <li> What can I say about this product that has not been said already? With that said all I can say from my personal experience is that nailtiques to me is by far the best nail treatment there is out there. Of course you have to follow instructions and be persistent, it&#x27;s not going to work over night, but it will work if you keep at it. I would recommend for people to buy the set that comes with the thinner since the product does thicken up a bit over time. Want beautiful, healthy, strong, long nails? Get this you will not be disappointed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about three weeks, and my nails are not only longer, but they appear to be in better condition.  Part of why I wanted to use this product was that my nails appeared to be dry and ridges.  Also, two had splits going vertically up from the nail edge up toward to cuticle.  Bare nails now appear far less ridged, they&#x27;re much smoother and seem to be more flexible.  They&#x27;re not by any means totally &#x27;fixed&#x27; but the difference is visible.  I plan to use this product on an ongoing basis, so will report again in few months.  Please note:  I am not only using this product to improve my nails.  I&#x27;m also taking 3000 mg. Biotin daily (recommended by my dermatologist.  I have been taking this for four months (I was told it takes considerable time before the benefits are visible).</li>
            <li> Yeay - I have whites on my nails again. This stuff works great!</li>
            <li> Good for strengthening nails but you have to use it as directed.  Also, it tends to get thick if you don&#x27;t use it quickly so I advise&lt;br /&gt;buying the smallest size available.</li>
            <li> This product is great and well worth the money as long as you use it correctly.  I have been using it for a couple of months and already notice an improvement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;am very pleased with the product nailtiques 2 formula.  My nails were looking ridged from false nails, now they feel and look great!!</li>
            <li> Time will tell if it works</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only about 15 days that I&#x27;ve used this product and I already see such a big improvement !! I&#x27;ve never had strong nails and that condition only worsened after I removed my acrylic nails a few years ago. Splitting , ridges, brittle ness just a few of the issues I had. Now time will tell. They are much stronger and growing faster and I&#x27;m a big fan of clear polish anyway.will definitely keep using !! Highly recomend this product and I also purchased the lines non acetate remover that is moisturizing and not drying!!!</li>
