            <li>Awesome product - very high quality</li>
            <li>This blend however, is amazing.</li>
            <li>I have used it myself while writing and it is amazing.</li>
            <li>He commented on how much he liked the smell.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, but ...</li>
            <li>Not a problem until you are taught (by someone else or through your own research)</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know--maybe, maybe not.</li>
            <li>It seems to help me focus but honestly smells like mothballs.</li>
            <li>It is effective, yes, but I would advise that the smell is very strong.</li>
            <li>Smell is so strong we couldn&#x27;t give it a fair chance on my ADD/Anxieity daughter.</li>
            <li>It has a roll-on applicator, so you can control the amount used very easily.</li>
            <li>Wow, I am impressed!</li>
            <li>This is a very fine product &amp;</li>
            <li>Love, love, love my InTune by doTERRA!  </li>
            <li>This blend is very smooth and simultaneously soothing and focusing.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love, love this roll on.</li>
            <li>My son seems to have more control over his emotions and is noticeably calmer and focused.</li>
            <li>and I did notice that I was able to get quite a bit of work done without distractions.  </li>
            <li>Thus, I tested the InTune Focus Blend on myself while taking a break from the meds -- about a two week &amp;#34;vacation&amp;#34; after having been on said meds for more than a year.</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>We are pleased with this oil and believe it to be doing well for our grandson.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll be encouraging</li>
            <li>I love this scent.  </li>
            <li>I gave the blend 2 stars because I do believe it can work as it claims-- for those that love the scent of patchouli.</li>
            <li>Smells like patuli oil, and even when i put it on the bottom of me feet, people around me can smell it at work, (where i need it the most)</li>
            <li>For the price, I can&#x27;t complain--I will add a couple of drops more of patchouli.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>This is the most godawful blend I have every tried.  </li>
            <li>I am still able to use it though.</li>
            <li>I noticed the oil works better on the bottom of the feet than on the neck and the smell isn&#x27;t as noticeable to others.</li>
            <li>Her teacher saw me thevother day and showed me a math test, and thevorganization and score were way better than anything she has done before.  </li>
            <li>Interesting smell.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>He seems alot more focused</li>
            <li>This is my favorite blend.</li>
            <li>All you have to do is to apply a drop of Doterra Lemon oil on top of InTune.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>It would work even better</li>
            <li>I am sure if it was applied twice a day.</li>
            <li>This stuff is my four year olds magic angel potion.</li>
            <li>Very good benefits from the mis of different oils.  </li>
            <li>Granted I felt great and mind was clear but never buying again.</li>
            <li>Works great in calming my 8-yr old son with his ADHD.</li>
            <li>but it still helps in a lighter more comfortable way.</li>
            <li>If you want your bottle of InTune to go even further, you can dilute it with Fractionated Coconut Oil without changing that warm, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t the kind of self-regulatory discipline that ADHD people are reputedly good at ;); I havea much easier time sticking to &amp;</li>
            <li>This product arrives very quickly from the seller (pure_doterra).</li>
            <li>Works great and is really helping me focus and stay calm during nursing school.</li>
            <li>It does smell a bit strong but works well for my boys.  </li>
            <li>It has strong tones of Patchouli and hints of the rest of the blend.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t like this strong smell either, but i wear it for the focus factor.  </li>
            <li>Is there another oil that works just as well but doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent?</li>
            <li>To me it has a strong hint of wood.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit too strong.</li>
            <li>He has told me that he does feel as if he is able to focus more but, there has been no dramatic change in his grades.</li>
            <li>We used it last week and he had a great week at school...</li>
            <li>so I can enjoy the scent while on the move.</li>
            <li>I first experienced this wonderful scent at ecstatic dance and felt a heightened sense of awareness with random encounters.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend trying this before jumping to any kind of behavioral diagnosis.</li>
            <li>This was my first Doterra product that I purchased and I have to tell you, I&#x27;m enjoying the smell this product contains.</li>
            <li>clean scent&lt;br /&gt;Must</li>
            <li>only used it on th enottom of my feet every morning after delivery my son, but loved it and noticed a huge difference if i didn&#x27;t use it</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s right, they were banned from the house!  </li>
            <li>Smell is a bit strong but very calming blend and easy application</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now in the spirit of full disclosure, I do take a prescription medication for my ADHD; but my children, also diagnosed with the disorder, appear to have side effect issues with the drugs which I do not.</li>
            <li>He is able to focus much easier when we use the oil.</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty strong.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Efficacy: mild.</li>
            <li>Organic essential oils awaken the body&#x27;s energy centers and nourish the mind, body, Spirit more than anything created in the &amp;#34;lab.&amp;#34;  Enjoy !</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and as promised</li>
            <li>This oil is good, but I distinctly remember the first oil I tried had a little more patchouli in it.</li>
            <li>Scent: warm, peppery, and comforting: sandalwood strongly represented in this blend.</li>
            <li>I have been applying it to the back of my son&#x27;s neck every morning; and while it does have a nice smell, I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my son&#x27;s ability to focus while doing homework.  </li>
            <li>Not loving the smell, BUT love love love the effect it has on my son.</li>
            <li>Smells so fresh and relaxing.  </li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t know if this is right for me.</li>
            <li>there is no smell and that calmed me right away.</li>
            <li>the oils are very pure.</li>
            <li>There is something about the extraction process that renders these oils very pure.</li>
            <li>The effects are some of the most amazing I have ever seen, changing the entire experience of essential oils for me.</li>
            <li>It is a beautiful, long lasting earthy scent that keeps you alert and focused.</li>
            <li>I can affirm that upon initial &amp;#34;dosing&amp;#34;, it does have a modest pick-me-up effect which lasts a couple of hours at best: about as long as the scent itself lingers noticeably.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t love the spicy scent (reminiscent of Calvin Klein&#x27;s Obsession) but it worked.</li>
            <li>Love it and especially the smell!  </li>
            <li>Love it when I exercise, especially for yoga.</li>
            <li>Initially the scent is a lovely blend.</li>
            <li>Many essential oils blended in one bottle with a roller-ball topper attached.</li>
            <li>I can only hope that eventually we will be able to rid the house, and my daughter of the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It might be ok for a man, definitely not a feminine smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll buy more i the future.</li>
            <li>Love the scent, seems to help my focus especially in the morning.</li>
            <li>I am glad my friend allowed me to sample it before I purchased it, because I know for certain, that this will NOT be something I purchase in the future.</li>
            <li>can report that the InTune blend has a rich and pleasing scent, although a bit masculine.</li>
            <li>I purchased doTerra Intune roll on oil after reading some positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>and my child stay positive.  </li>
            <li>He needs this for more calm &amp; focus trying to get him graduated with a GED program he&#x27;s in due to the impairments.  </li>
            <li>will stick to my old stand by of lavender, sweet orange, lemon grass, etc.</li>
            <li>I wear this essential oil every day and I love it and many of the other doTerra Blends.</li>
            <li>The scent of this is sooo strong that it outweighs any potential benefits.</li>
            <li>The only thing now is that he is discouraged in using it since the smell is strong to others and one child told him that it smelled like poison.</li>
            <li>I used to apply a little to my hands, rub them together to warm the oil and breathe in the scent.</li>
            <li>I finally asked her what her problem was, but as she came closer to me (we were in an outside setting), I could tell exactly what was going on…she stunk!!!!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, I like InTune&#x27;s aroma and it could have some benefit as a supplementation to my regular meds, perhaps for those late afternoons when my meds start to wear off and my energy level is flagging; this is also an ideal time to apply it to kids who are doing homework.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I was very hopeful of this product</li>
            <li>After breakfast, I applied the oil with the roller sparingly to the back of my neck, just at the hairline, and rubbed it in lightly.</li>
            <li>2 1/2 stars really.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed much difference.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this because it is cheaper than going straight to a consultant.</li>
            <li>Besides that, it really does work.</li>
            <li>fast shipping-</li>
            <li>really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would not just say that for no reason, we have tried many other things that did not work.</li>
            <li>Checked out the manufacturer site and then visited, read reviews, and ordered through Amazon: the price difference is significant, though the quality and packaging seem the same.  </li>
            <li>I just decided to try this out, and while it is good, it does seem a little different than the one I tried at a doTERRA party.</li>
            <li>I can tell that this product is blended of high quality oils, so the high price does seem somewhat justified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>It really can&#x27;t hurt anything since its natural.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m not quite sure if it is a manufacturer issue or if keeping the Roll on in my backpack has to do anything with it, but after a few months the roller ball somehow detached and fell out.</li>
            <li>and/or when the day is heavy with priorities--i love the natural, grounding scent.  </li>
            <li>Is this the EXACT SAME oil that you can get at a doTERRA consultant?</li>
            <li>It sounded farfetched, but as anybody knows who&#x27;s dealt with Attention Deficit Disorder, one can become very open-minded after exhausting other, more &amp;#34;mainstream&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I bought this to clear my head while finishing master&#x27;s thesis on a deadline.</li>
            <li>I was upset because this product came in a clear bottle with no labels, no text</li>
            <li>My 10 year old son struggles staying on task and focusing at school.</li>
            <li>It has been about 2 weeks so far without any improvement.  </li>
            <li>For example, we used to take him to a restaurant and he would be climbing all over the chairs, running around and completely uncontrollable within 5 minutes of being there.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my 13 yr old who has ADHD-Inattentive type.</li>
            <li>so far not doing the trick</li>
            <li>I bought this to try for my 11 year old son who has ADHD</li>
            <li>Smells remind you on a grandma no offense, I&#x27;m young and my fiancé was repelled by the smell and kept calling me grandma</li>
            <li>I got this for my 15 year old son who has ADHD trying to go natural with treatment but he refuses to use it</li>
            <li>that at the very least this bottle of mixed oils is at full strength and shouldn&#x27;t be used on certain ages of children at all or without diluting their factory-sent rollerball that is pure, before using.</li>
            <li>It smells so strongly of what I assume to be patula oil, that it is hard to focus on anything else.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t tell that it did anything other than make me smell funny.</li>
            <li>The price is competitive against other sellers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: When also put on the entire forehead in a thin amount, including across the eyebrows, this oil lingers beautifully for a fairly long time.</li>
            <li>and I could barely handle it myself.</li>
            <li>I barely put some on my hand to see how it would smell</li>
            <li>Still evaluating to see if this actually works for my 6 year old ADD child.</li>
            <li>Not only do I know that I am getting an all natural oil</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, two weeks&#x27; experimentation in this manner didn&#x27;t quite yield the kind of efficiency, focus, or productivity as the meds had.</li>
            <li>I am fairly new to essential oils outside of Lavender and Peppermint.</li>
            <li>At this time, i place it at the base of the skull, directly below hair line; initially, i liked rolling it in neck crevice (thyroid location) though it would sometimes be too much for me, as i&#x27;m highly sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li>I rub it in a little more around the eyebrow areas so the oil doesn&#x27;t seep down into the eye later as it warms from your skin.</li>
            <li>The patchouli notes are extremely long lasting, however, and when all the other top notes dissipate after a few hours the patchouli is left--for days.</li>
            <li>I still have a high opinion of this company&#x27;s oils and am open to trying some of their other essential oil remedies.</li>

            <li> Her teacher saw me thevother day and showed me a math test, and thevorganization and score were way better than anything she has done before.  </li>
            <li> Interesting smell.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> He seems alot more focused</li>
            <li> This is my favorite blend.</li>
            <li> All you have to do is to apply a drop of Doterra Lemon oil on top of InTune.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> It would work even better</li>
            <li> I am sure if it was applied twice a day.</li>
            <li> This stuff is my four year olds magic angel potion.</li>
            <li> Very good benefits from the mis of different oils.  </li>
            <li> Granted I felt great and mind was clear but never buying again.</li>
            <li> Works great in calming my 8-yr old son with his ADHD.</li>
            <li> but it still helps in a lighter more comfortable way.</li>
            <li> If you want your bottle of InTune to go even further, you can dilute it with Fractionated Coconut Oil without changing that warm, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the kind of self-regulatory discipline that ADHD people are reputedly good at ;); I havea much easier time sticking to &amp;</li>
            <li> This product arrives very quickly from the seller (pure_doterra).</li>
            <li> Works great and is really helping me focus and stay calm during nursing school.</li>
            <li> It does smell a bit strong but works well for my boys.  </li>
            <li> It has strong tones of Patchouli and hints of the rest of the blend.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t like this strong smell either, but i wear it for the focus factor.  </li>
            <li> Is there another oil that works just as well but doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent?</li>
            <li> To me it has a strong hint of wood.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit too strong.</li>
            <li> He has told me that he does feel as if he is able to focus more but, there has been no dramatic change in his grades.</li>
            <li> We used it last week and he had a great week at school...</li>
            <li> so I can enjoy the scent while on the move.</li>
            <li> I first experienced this wonderful scent at ecstatic dance and felt a heightened sense of awareness with random encounters.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend trying this before jumping to any kind of behavioral diagnosis.</li>
            <li> This was my first Doterra product that I purchased and I have to tell you, I&#x27;m enjoying the smell this product contains.</li>
            <li> clean scent&lt;br /&gt;Must</li>
            <li> only used it on th enottom of my feet every morning after delivery my son, but loved it and noticed a huge difference if i didn&#x27;t use it</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s right, they were banned from the house!  </li>
            <li> Smell is a bit strong but very calming blend and easy application</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now in the spirit of full disclosure, I do take a prescription medication for my ADHD; but my children, also diagnosed with the disorder, appear to have side effect issues with the drugs which I do not.</li>
            <li> He is able to focus much easier when we use the oil.</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty strong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Efficacy: mild.</li>
            <li> Organic essential oils awaken the body&#x27;s energy centers and nourish the mind, body, Spirit more than anything created in the &amp;#34;lab.&amp;#34;  Enjoy !</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and as promised</li>
            <li> This oil is good, but I distinctly remember the first oil I tried had a little more patchouli in it.</li>
            <li> Scent: warm, peppery, and comforting: sandalwood strongly represented in this blend.</li>
            <li> I have been applying it to the back of my son&#x27;s neck every morning; and while it does have a nice smell, I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my son&#x27;s ability to focus while doing homework.  </li>
            <li> Not loving the smell, BUT love love love the effect it has on my son.</li>
            <li> Smells so fresh and relaxing.  </li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t know if this is right for me.</li>
            <li> there is no smell and that calmed me right away.</li>
            <li> the oils are very pure.</li>
            <li> There is something about the extraction process that renders these oils very pure.</li>
            <li> The effects are some of the most amazing I have ever seen, changing the entire experience of essential oils for me.</li>
            <li> It is a beautiful, long lasting earthy scent that keeps you alert and focused.</li>
            <li> I can affirm that upon initial &amp;#34;dosing&amp;#34;, it does have a modest pick-me-up effect which lasts a couple of hours at best: about as long as the scent itself lingers noticeably.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t love the spicy scent (reminiscent of Calvin Klein&#x27;s Obsession) but it worked.</li>
            <li> Love it and especially the smell!  </li>
            <li> Love it when I exercise, especially for yoga.</li>
            <li> Initially the scent is a lovely blend.</li>
            <li> Many essential oils blended in one bottle with a roller-ball topper attached.</li>
            <li> I can only hope that eventually we will be able to rid the house, and my daughter of the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It might be ok for a man, definitely not a feminine smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy more i the future.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, seems to help my focus especially in the morning.</li>
            <li> I am glad my friend allowed me to sample it before I purchased it, because I know for certain, that this will NOT be something I purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> can report that the InTune blend has a rich and pleasing scent, although a bit masculine.</li>
            <li> I purchased doTerra Intune roll on oil after reading some positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> and my child stay positive.  </li>
            <li> He needs this for more calm &amp; focus trying to get him graduated with a GED program he&#x27;s in due to the impairments.  </li>
            <li> will stick to my old stand by of lavender, sweet orange, lemon grass, etc.</li>
            <li> I wear this essential oil every day and I love it and many of the other doTerra Blends.</li>
            <li> The scent of this is sooo strong that it outweighs any potential benefits.</li>
            <li> The only thing now is that he is discouraged in using it since the smell is strong to others and one child told him that it smelled like poison.</li>
            <li> I used to apply a little to my hands, rub them together to warm the oil and breathe in the scent.</li>
            <li> I finally asked her what her problem was, but as she came closer to me (we were in an outside setting), I could tell exactly what was going on…she stunk!!!!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, I like InTune&#x27;s aroma and it could have some benefit as a supplementation to my regular meds, perhaps for those late afternoons when my meds start to wear off and my energy level is flagging; this is also an ideal time to apply it to kids who are doing homework.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I was very hopeful of this product</li>
            <li> After breakfast, I applied the oil with the roller sparingly to the back of my neck, just at the hairline, and rubbed it in lightly.</li>
            <li> 2 1/2 stars really.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed much difference.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this because it is cheaper than going straight to a consultant.</li>
            <li> Besides that, it really does work.</li>
            <li> fast shipping-</li>
            <li> really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would not just say that for no reason, we have tried many other things that did not work.</li>
            <li> Checked out the manufacturer site and then visited, read reviews, and ordered through Amazon: the price difference is significant, though the quality and packaging seem the same.  </li>
            <li> I just decided to try this out, and while it is good, it does seem a little different than the one I tried at a doTERRA party.</li>
            <li> I can tell that this product is blended of high quality oils, so the high price does seem somewhat justified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> It really can&#x27;t hurt anything since its natural.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not quite sure if it is a manufacturer issue or if keeping the Roll on in my backpack has to do anything with it, but after a few months the roller ball somehow detached and fell out.</li>
            <li> and/or when the day is heavy with priorities--i love the natural, grounding scent.  </li>
            <li> Is this the EXACT SAME oil that you can get at a doTERRA consultant?</li>
            <li> It sounded farfetched, but as anybody knows who&#x27;s dealt with Attention Deficit Disorder, one can become very open-minded after exhausting other, more &amp;#34;mainstream&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I bought this to clear my head while finishing master&#x27;s thesis on a deadline.</li>
            <li> I was upset because this product came in a clear bottle with no labels, no text</li>
            <li> My 10 year old son struggles staying on task and focusing at school.</li>
            <li> It has been about 2 weeks so far without any improvement.  </li>
            <li> For example, we used to take him to a restaurant and he would be climbing all over the chairs, running around and completely uncontrollable within 5 minutes of being there.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 13 yr old who has ADHD-Inattentive type.</li>
            <li> so far not doing the trick</li>
            <li> I bought this to try for my 11 year old son who has ADHD</li>
            <li> Smells remind you on a grandma no offense, I&#x27;m young and my fiancé was repelled by the smell and kept calling me grandma</li>
            <li> I got this for my 15 year old son who has ADHD trying to go natural with treatment but he refuses to use it</li>
            <li> that at the very least this bottle of mixed oils is at full strength and shouldn&#x27;t be used on certain ages of children at all or without diluting their factory-sent rollerball that is pure, before using.</li>
            <li> It smells so strongly of what I assume to be patula oil, that it is hard to focus on anything else.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell that it did anything other than make me smell funny.</li>
            <li> The price is competitive against other sellers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: When also put on the entire forehead in a thin amount, including across the eyebrows, this oil lingers beautifully for a fairly long time.</li>
            <li> and I could barely handle it myself.</li>
            <li> I barely put some on my hand to see how it would smell</li>
            <li> Still evaluating to see if this actually works for my 6 year old ADD child.</li>
            <li> Not only do I know that I am getting an all natural oil</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, two weeks&#x27; experimentation in this manner didn&#x27;t quite yield the kind of efficiency, focus, or productivity as the meds had.</li>
            <li> I am fairly new to essential oils outside of Lavender and Peppermint.</li>
            <li> At this time, i place it at the base of the skull, directly below hair line; initially, i liked rolling it in neck crevice (thyroid location) though it would sometimes be too much for me, as i&#x27;m highly sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li> I rub it in a little more around the eyebrow areas so the oil doesn&#x27;t seep down into the eye later as it warms from your skin.</li>
            <li> The patchouli notes are extremely long lasting, however, and when all the other top notes dissipate after a few hours the patchouli is left--for days.</li>
            <li> I still have a high opinion of this company&#x27;s oils and am open to trying some of their other essential oil remedies.</li>
            <li> This is a very high quality product, so a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, she was up half the night complaining that the smell was making her sick…and honestly, it was having the same effect on myself.  </li>
            <li> With some changes to his diet and regular use of this oil in the morning and lavender oil at night, he sits down at the restaurant, keeps himself busy and eats all of his food.</li>
            <li> I would liken it to the effect of drinking a cup of weak tea, which has a mildly stimulating effect that lasts a couple of hours before fading and needing a refresher.</li>
            <li> Has calmed him down considerably helping him focus.</li>
            <li> Product smells so strong my son is unable to wear it.</li>
            <li> He has to be supervised 24/7 due to social skill/boundary issues.</li>
            <li> Everyday on my nine year old.</li>
            <li> Have tried other essential oils but these blends can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> I was afraid of wearing it to work because of how strong the smell is.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing to know this company does not seem to have proper safety usage for their customers not at the top of their priority.</li>
            <li> When I am feeling a little &amp;#34;scattered&amp;#34; in put this on and within 15 minutes I can tell I am beginning to get my focus back.</li>
            <li> Product was as expected.</li>
            <li> color was darker than expected, and the scent is overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;Too</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;and working harder in school.</li>
            <li> but I have found that I&#x27;d rather take this knowing that I&#x27;m taking something that is not altered or has unknown chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> But this little bottle goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but i haven&#x27;t used diffuser yet, and my child is extreme impulse autism</li>
            <li> At school other kids were commenting on the smell</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s naughty, but I tried this oil at a party</li>
            <li> I have to add fractionated coconut oil with the In Tune to damper down the aroma.</li>
            <li> I use it during the day after the noon hour when focus and concentration typically fades.</li>
            <li> A little pricey</li>
            <li> My poor little girl gagged constantly, and even threw up from the smell at one point.  </li>
            <li> much floral, and just an all around disappointment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As part of my effort to eliminate unnecessary chemicals and/or drugs from my life, I was intrigued by doTerra&#x27;s promise of an essential oil blend that would help me manage my ADHD without a prescription.</li>
            <li> And, InTune would make a fabulous cologne base for a man.</li>
            <li> I use this on myself and my autistic ADHD child.  </li>
            <li> I place InTune on his neck and feet everyday, before each session.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why he reacted to it that way but will not try it again.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I am hooked on Doterra, I also take the multivitamins pack and it definitely has increased my energy.</li>
            <li> It also gets hard to deal with the aggression that comes from his neurological disorders.</li>
            <li> reapply throughout day&lt;br /&gt;Not to oily or thick roll on&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> i wear it when feeling slow to begin morning asana practice</li>
            <li> I am a law student which requires a lot of serious discipline.  </li>
            <li> Seriously.. works wonders</li>
            <li> oils are a little expensive.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad, just different, not like perfume or cologne.</li>
            <li> The only thing I was focused on was how bad</li>
            <li> This stuff is one of my lifelines for those days that concentrating on difficult and often dry subject seems impossible.</li>
            <li> Smell is not really pleasant</li>
            <li> At first it wasn&#x27;t so bad, but as the day went on, my daughter would not stop whining!!  </li>
            <li> Bottle isn&#x27;t broken but leaking from around the lid.</li>
            <li> It is claimed to work for aiding in concentration and focus, but the only way I witnessed it working, is that it forced everyone around to focus on that horrible smell!  </li>
            <li> I also use it on my husband.&lt;br /&gt;Quite pricey but all oils are expensive.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately we did not notice a difference.</li>
            <li> he became very angry and not himself at all.</li>
            <li> Smells sooo bad...</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t too bad (per my son).</li>
            <li> Sometimes he can get restless or frustrated.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed, perhaps it does work on some individuals.</li>
            <li> My 8 y.o. has ADHD and at night when her meds are wearing off this helps her to maintain her focus and not get too crazy!</li>
            <li> I heard about this product through one of my friends because I mentioned that I have ADD but hate taking the medication because of how it makes me feel, and she told me uses this because she has ADD as well.</li>
            <li> but man I cannot get over smelling so bad!</li>
            <li> Smells horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the smell of this!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love, love this roll on. I would recommend this to anyone needing help stabilizing their emotions.</li>
            <li> Day 1 with this product today. It smells very nice. I am trying this for my autistic/cerebral impaired son &amp; I.  He needs this for more calm &amp; focus trying to get him graduated with a GED program he&#x27;s in due to the impairments.  It also gets hard to deal with the aggression that comes from his neurological disorders. He has to be supervised 24/7 due to social skill/boundary issues. I got the bottle home &amp; put some on the back of his neck immediately. I&#x27;m going to try to remember to get it on him immediately when he&#x27;s aggressive, &amp; the Serenity Calming Blend, to see if there&#x27;s a difference. He commented on how much he liked the smell. A good start. This product arrives very quickly from the seller (pure_doterra). The price is competitive against other sellers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: When also put on the entire forehead in a thin amount, including across the eyebrows, this oil lingers beautifully for a fairly long time. I rub it in a little more around the eyebrow areas so the oil doesn&#x27;t seep down into the eye later as it warms from your skin. This is a very fine product &amp; the oils are very pure. The effects are some of the most amazing I have ever seen, changing the entire experience of essential oils for me. There is something about the extraction process that renders these oils very pure.</li>
            <li> I purchased doTerra Intune roll on oil after reading some positive reviews.  My 10 year old son struggles staying on task and focusing at school. I was impressed that the product arrived within 2 days and started using it immediately.  It has an earthy smell reminiscent of patchouli. I have been applying it to the back of my son&#x27;s neck every morning; and while it does have a nice smell, I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my son&#x27;s ability to focus while doing homework.  I should mention that I also apply it a 2nd time in the afternoon about 1/2 hr. before he starts homework.  I do like the smell but 36.00 is a lot to pay for it.  I am disappointed, perhaps it does work on some individuals. It has been about 2 weeks so far without any improvement.  I don&#x27;t think I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> Smell is a bit strong but very calming blend and easy application</li>
            <li> DO TERRA OILS ARE THE BEST.  THIS ONE KEEPS THE  MOOD ELEVATED.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Product was as expected.</li>
            <li> This is the second bottle I bought. I&#x27;m totally hooked on the scent of this bottle.</li>
            <li> A friend suggested this oil for my son who was having some behavioral issues (not paying attention or listening to directions, and emotional outbursts). I started using the oil about a month ago and I can&#x27;t believe the difference. My son seems to have more control over his emotions and is noticeably calmer and focused. I would not just say that for no reason, we have tried many other things that did not work. For example, we used to take him to a restaurant and he would be climbing all over the chairs, running around and completely uncontrollable within 5 minutes of being there. With some changes to his diet and regular use of this oil in the morning and lavender oil at night, he sits down at the restaurant, keeps himself busy and eats all of his food. Unbelievable. Highly recommend trying this before jumping to any kind of behavioral diagnosis. It really can&#x27;t hurt anything since its natural.</li>
            <li> Awesome product - very high quality</li>
            <li> Love, love, love my InTune by doTERRA!  When I am feeling a little &amp;#34;scattered&amp;#34; in put this on and within 15 minutes I can tell I am beginning to get my focus back.</li>
            <li> Product smells so strong my son is unable to wear it. I was very hopeful of this product but I don&#x27;t know how it would work. All I know is after him taking a bath he still smelled like this stuff. NO way I could send him to school with it.</li>
            <li> How often do you apply to your child? Thinking about buying this for my nephew who is struggling in school. Do you just apply once a day in the morning?</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 13 yr old who has ADHD-Inattentive type. I put it on the soles of his feet each morning. He has told me that he does feel as if he is able to focus more but, there has been no dramatic change in his grades. I tried it myself and I did notice that I was able to get quite a bit of work done without distractions.  In my opinion it does work but, not enough to help my son.</li>
            <li> Helps both my ADHD boys focus.  It is already mixed with a carrier oil so no need to worry(someone mentioned it wasn&#x27;t, she didn&#x27;t both to read the label).  It does smell a bit strong but works well for my boys.  It can go on the bottom of feet if the smell bothers you.  We love it!  It&#x27;s keeping the meds out of my second child.</li>
            <li> Can see a daily difference in my daughter on the days she remembers to wear this. Her grandparents and teachers have also noticed the change.</li>
            <li> This blend is very smooth and simultaneously soothing and focusing. I use it during the day after the noon hour when focus and concentration typically fades. It energizes my focus and I can make it through an afternoon of grant writing, program evaluation and meetings. I will buy it again so I can have one in my car and home as well as the office.</li>
            <li> Smell is so strong we couldn&#x27;t give it a fair chance on my ADD/Anxieity daughter. The smell was over powering with sandalwood.</li>
            <li> Scent: warm, peppery, and comforting: sandalwood strongly represented in this blend. 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Efficacy: mild. I would liken it to the effect of drinking a cup of weak tea, which has a mildly stimulating effect that lasts a couple of hours before fading and needing a refresher. 3 stars&lt;br /&gt;Overall value for the $$: 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As part of my effort to eliminate unnecessary chemicals and/or drugs from my life, I was intrigued by doTerra&#x27;s promise of an essential oil blend that would help me manage my ADHD without a prescription. It sounded farfetched, but as anybody knows who&#x27;s dealt with Attention Deficit Disorder, one can become very open-minded after exhausting other, more &amp;#34;mainstream&amp;#34; options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now in the spirit of full disclosure, I do take a prescription medication for my ADHD; but my children, also diagnosed with the disorder, appear to have side effect issues with the drugs which I do not. Thus, I tested the InTune Focus Blend on myself while taking a break from the meds -- about a two week &amp;#34;vacation&amp;#34; after having been on said meds for more than a year. After breakfast, I applied the oil with the roller sparingly to the back of my neck, just at the hairline, and rubbed it in lightly. I repeated this ritual daily in hopes that if it worked well, I would try it on the children next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can report that the InTune blend has a rich and pleasing scent, although a bit masculine. I can affirm that upon initial &amp;#34;dosing&amp;#34;, it does have a modest pick-me-up effect which lasts a couple of hours at best: about as long as the scent itself lingers noticeably. Unfortunately, two weeks&#x27; experimentation in this manner didn&#x27;t quite yield the kind of efficiency, focus, or productivity as the meds had. I do believe it helped, a bit...but I would have had to reapply it every two hours to sustain that level of stimulation evenly. This isn&#x27;t the kind of self-regulatory discipline that ADHD people are reputedly good at ;); I havea much easier time sticking to &amp;#34;one dose and forget it&amp;#34; methods. I KNOW my kids wouldn&#x27;t be reapplying the oil after every two hours (they&#x27;re at school, and that presents problems for regular dosing in and of itself -- and since they&#x27;re boys, they would not be caught wearing a perfumed pendant!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I like InTune&#x27;s aroma and it could have some benefit as a supplementation to my regular meds, perhaps for those late afternoons when my meds start to wear off and my energy level is flagging; this is also an ideal time to apply it to kids who are doing homework. And, InTune would make a fabulous cologne base for a man. I can tell that this product is blended of high quality oils, so the high price does seem somewhat justified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good try doTerra! I still have a high opinion of this company&#x27;s oils and am open to trying some of their other essential oil remedies. If only I could shake that nagging suspicion that 90% of the 5-star reviews are from doTerra&#x27;s sales reps shilling for their brand...</li>
            <li> I bought this to clear my head while finishing master&#x27;s thesis on a deadline. I didn&#x27;t love the spicy scent (reminiscent of Calvin Klein&#x27;s Obsession) but it worked. Recommend!</li>
            <li> Love this.  I use this on myself and my autistic ADHD child.  Helps me keep focused when I work from home and my child stay positive.  Smells great.</li>
            <li> We are pleased with this oil and believe it to be doing well for our grandson. We will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I was upset because this product came in a clear bottle with no labels, no text whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;The color was darker than expected, and the scent is overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;Too much floral, and just an all around disappointment.</li>
            <li> Love it and especially the smell!  Works great and is really helping me focus and stay calm during nursing school.</li>
            <li> Not loving the smell, BUT love love love the effect it has on my son. Has calmed him down considerably helping him focus.</li>
            <li> Very nice product...just waiting on results...I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll be encouraging</li>
            <li> I love this scent.  Very good benefits from the mis of different oils.  Smells so fresh and relaxing.  Love it when I exercise, especially for yoga.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell that it did anything other than make me smell funny. The smell isn&#x27;t bad, just different, not like perfume or cologne.</li>
            <li> I gave the blend 2 stars because I do believe it can work as it claims-- for those that love the scent of patchouli. Initially the scent is a lovely blend. The patchouli notes are extremely long lasting, however, and when all the other top notes dissipate after a few hours the patchouli is left--for days. I had to return it.</li>
            <li> shipped on tine&lt;br /&gt;Exactly as pictured&lt;br /&gt;Nice clean scent&lt;br /&gt;Must reapply throughout day&lt;br /&gt;Not to oily or thick roll on&lt;br /&gt;Will order again</li>
            <li> I just received my package and it is leaking from the package. Bottle isn&#x27;t broken but leaking from around the lid.</li>
            <li> My son is 3 and currently he does ABA in the morning. Sometimes he can get restless or frustrated. I place InTune on his neck and feet everyday, before each session.</li>
            <li> 2 1/2 stars really.  I can&#x27;t say that I see a difference in my son&#x27;s behavior but he enjoys putting it on his feet in the morning and thinks it works.  Placebo effect I guess.</li>
            <li> I am fairly new to essential oils outside of Lavender and Peppermint. This blend however, is amazing. It has strong tones of Patchouli and hints of the rest of the blend. I bought it for my son that has sensory processing disorder with hyperactivity. He is able to focus much easier when we use the oil. I have used it myself while writing and it is amazing.</li>
            <li> so far not doing the trick but i haven&#x27;t used diffuser yet, and my child is extreme impulse autism so don&#x27;t know if this is right for me. I know people personally who use it though and likes it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try for my 11 year old son who has ADHD I did not like how he reacted to it he became very angry and not himself at all. He is always very happy and goofy. I only tried it for 2 days and stopped. I am not sure why he reacted to it that way but will not try it again.</li>
            <li> Smells like patuli oil, and even when i put it on the bottom of me feet, people around me can smell it at work, (where i need it the most) they ask, &amp;#34;who is wearing patuli oil? &amp;#34;I can&#x27;t stand it!! &amp;#34;  So i sheepishly admit to wearing  this In Tune oil and they force me to go wash it off.  I have to admit.....i don&#x27;t like this strong smell either, but i wear it for the focus factor.  Haven&#x27;t noticed much difference.  I have to add fractionated coconut oil with the In Tune to damper down the aroma.</li>
            <li> My 8 y.o. has ADHD and at night when her meds are wearing off this helps her to maintain her focus and not get too crazy!</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful but it didn&#x27;t seem to help my concentration.</li>
            <li> I first experienced this wonderful scent at ecstatic dance and felt a heightened sense of awareness with random encounters.  When exiting the bank a while back, i could not resist the urge to inquire.  Checked out the manufacturer site and then visited, read reviews, and ordered through Amazon: the price difference is significant, though the quality and packaging seem the same.  i wear it when feeling slow to begin morning asana practice and/or when the day is heavy with priorities--i love the natural, grounding scent.  At this time, i place it at the base of the skull, directly below hair line; initially, i liked rolling it in neck crevice (thyroid location) though it would sometimes be too much for me, as i&#x27;m highly sensitive to smells. Organic essential oils awaken the body&#x27;s energy centers and nourish the mind, body, Spirit more than anything created in the &amp;#34;lab.&amp;#34;  Enjoy !</li>
            <li> only used it on th enottom of my feet every morning after delivery my son, but loved it and noticed a huge difference if i didn&#x27;t use it</li>
            <li> It smells nice, but ... it does NOT do anything to help with focus. My 5-year-old has attention problems and applying the oil does not make any difference at all in his attention level. I even tried it on myself and did not notice any increased focus levels at work. Also, after a couple of days of use we both got an itchy rash on our neck.</li>
            <li> I wear this essential oil every day and I love it and many of the other doTerra Blends. Have tried other essential oils but these blends can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> The scent of this is sooo strong that it outweighs any potential benefits. I can still smell it on my child&#x27;s socks even after washing them multiple times. At school other kids were commenting on the smell and I could barely handle it myself.</li>
            <li> Many essential oils blended in one bottle with a roller-ball topper attached. Not a problem until you are taught (by someone else or through your own research) that at the very least this bottle of mixed oils is at full strength and shouldn&#x27;t be used on certain ages of children at all or without diluting their factory-sent rollerball that is pure, before using. Very disappointing to know this company does not seem to have proper safety usage for their customers not at the top of their priority.</li>
            <li> I had a friend use In Tune on my daughter.  At first it wasn&#x27;t so bad, but as the day went on, my daughter would not stop whining!!  I finally asked her what her problem was, but as she came closer to me (we were in an outside setting), I could tell exactly what was going on…she stunk!!!!  When we got into the car for the drive home, the entire family was overwhelmed by the smell.  My poor little girl gagged constantly, and even threw up from the smell at one point.  After repeated attempts to wash the smell off, I finally gave up and sent her to bed.  Unfortunately, she was up half the night complaining that the smell was making her sick…and honestly, it was having the same effect on myself.  By morning, the clothes that she was wearing the day before, had been sent to the deck, that&#x27;s right, they were banned from the house!  I can only hope that eventually we will be able to rid the house, and my daughter of the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no proof as to whether this oil actually works for what it is claimed to work for.  It is claimed to work for aiding in concentration and focus, but the only way I witnessed it working, is that it forced everyone around to focus on that horrible smell!  It smells so strongly of what I assume to be patula oil, that it is hard to focus on anything else.  I am glad my friend allowed me to sample it before I purchased it, because I know for certain, that this will NOT be something I purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> Smells remind you on a grandma no offense, I&#x27;m young and my fiancé was repelled by the smell and kept calling me grandma and I couldn&#x27;t stop thinking I was at a grandparents house. Tried washing smell out and couldn&#x27;t same day. Granted I felt great and mind was clear but never buying again. If you need to focus and don&#x27;t want others going who smells like grandma/pa buy confianza at livelifenaturallyforyou.com bc there is no smell and that calmed me right away. I like to experiment w oils vs supplements but man I cannot get over smelling so bad!</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it is cheaper than going straight to a consultant. That&#x27;s naughty, but I tried this oil at a party and I was extremely impressed with how focused I felt afterwards. This oil is good, but I distinctly remember the first oil I tried had a little more patchouli in it. For the price, I can&#x27;t complain--I will add a couple of drops more of patchouli. Is this the EXACT SAME oil that you can get at a doTERRA consultant? I honestly don&#x27;t know--maybe, maybe not. If you want to trust what you&#x27;re getting, go to a consultant. I just decided to try this out, and while it is good, it does seem a little different than the one I tried at a doTERRA party.</li>
            <li> Works great in calming my 8-yr old son with his ADHD. The only thing now is that he is discouraged in using it since the smell is strong to others and one child told him that it smelled like poison. I know the child doesn&#x27;t understand that they&#x27;re essential oils and not some type of nice-smelling cologne. Is there another oil that works just as well but doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent? Besides that, it really does work.</li>
            <li> It seems to help me focus but honestly smells like mothballs. I wear it daily now and does help me gather my thoughts. I suffer from attention deficit but no hyperactivity. So cannot claim any calming effects.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and as described.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Smells horrible. I barely put some on my hand to see how it would smell and I can still smell it on my coat. The only thing I was focused on was how bad I stunk. It might be ok for a man, definitely not a feminine smell.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and as promised</li>
            <li> Smells sooo bad...we added cinnamon leaf oil to change the smell.  It has worked wonders in my opinion. So hapy we tried it!!</li>
            <li> Still evaluating to see if this actually works for my 6 year old ADD child. We used it last week and he had a great week at school... Coincidence?  But I can say that it smells great! He loves it and we love it!</li>
            <li> Smell is not really pleasant</li>
            <li> This product is awesome.  I am a law student which requires a lot of serious discipline.  This stuff is one of my lifelines for those days that concentrating on difficult and often dry subject seems impossible.</li>
            <li> This obviously works for some people, but I could not handle the wretched smell.</li>
            <li> No change in my grandson&#x27;s behavior!</li>
            <li> Received in a Roll On bottle WITHOUT the roller attached or even in the package. What you have is a bottle. Turn it over to roll it on and you&#x27;ll spill it everywhere.</li>
            <li> This is a very high quality product, so a little goes a long way.  It is a beautiful, long lasting earthy scent that keeps you alert and focused.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it relaxes me or not but I do like the smell. I also use it on my husband.&lt;br /&gt;Quite pricey but all oils are expensive. Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that this would work for my 14 year old,she applied it religiously but unfortunately we did not notice a difference.</li>
            <li> This is the most godawful blend I have every tried.  I just wish I could get my money back&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even my daughter has asked me not to use this anymore the aroma is just godawful.  What a mistake on my part and it was rather pricey&lt;br /&gt;I will stick to my old stand by of lavender, sweet orange, lemon grass, etc.</li>
            <li> I use this during class when I feel like I&#x27;m dosing off. It is effective, yes, but I would advise that the smell is very strong. To me it has a strong hint of wood. Some students in class looked over to see what I was rolling on the back of my neck, haha.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;m not quite sure if it is a manufacturer issue or if keeping the Roll on in my backpack has to do anything with it, but after a few months the roller ball somehow detached and fell out. I am still able to use it though.</li>
            <li> Everyday on my nine year old. He is off MEDS and this HELPS him! So satisfied with this!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been great for my daughters&#x27; focus and attention.  Even their teachers have noticed. I&#x27;ll buy more i the future.</li>
            <li> Great oil for attention and focus. If the smell is a bit off-putting, try rolling on the feet before putting on socks. I noticed the oil works better on the bottom of the feet than on the neck and the smell isn&#x27;t as noticeable to others.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything for us.  We tried it several times.  Others say they like the smell, but I just don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> My daughter has add, and we did not want to do drugs.  Our chiropractor recommended this. Her teacher saw me thevother day and showed me a math test, and thevorganization and score were way better than anything she has done before.  I do not knowvif it is bc of the oil, but I do know we will continue using it.</li>
            <li> Seems to do the trick. Definitely have to rub it on my 7 year olds feet and put socks on. The smell is pretty strong.</li>
            <li> My wife says she can see the calm settle over me when I breathe in this wonderful oil. My body relaxes and my mood improves noticeably. I used to apply a little to my hands, rub them together to warm the oil and breathe in the scent. Now I&#x27;ve taken to applying it to my throat and shirt at the beginning of the day so I can enjoy the scent while on the move. It helps me start out the day right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;doTerra oils are a little expensive. But this little bottle goes a long way. It has a roll-on applicator, so you can control the amount used very easily. If you want your bottle of InTune to go even further, you can dilute it with Fractionated Coconut Oil without changing that warm, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Interesting smell.  Seems to be helping my son think a bit clearer.</li>
            <li> Great product! Improvement in work production has increased after using this product. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I use this oil from time to time with my son who has ADHD. It works for a short period of time but I have noticed the difference in his attention span improving. The scent isn&#x27;t too bad (per my son).</li>
            <li> great product!!! fast shipping- great price - thank you!</li>
            <li> I got this for my 15 year old son who has ADHD trying to go natural with treatment but he refuses to use it BUT I have difficulty staying on task and have been using it. I love it and it definitely helps. Now if it smelled like cologne my son would use it!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Actually does help with focusing for someone with ADD!</li>
            <li> Used on my grandson to help with focusing in his classes and teachers have noticed a change. He seems alot more focused&lt;br /&gt;and working harder in school.</li>
            <li> Great for adhd and autism.  Son is focusing a lotbetter in school</li>
            <li> This is my favorite blend. Amazing results: improves concentration, sharpens focus and as a bonus prevents headaches! Wow, I am impressed! This stuff really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells very good but also very strong. I was afraid of wearing it to work because of how strong the smell is. So I researched how to lessen the smell. All you have to do is to apply a drop of Doterra Lemon oil on top of InTune. Thats it! It neutralizes the smell.&lt;br /&gt;100% recommend it!</li>
            <li> I heard about this product through one of my friends because I mentioned that I have ADD but hate taking the medication because of how it makes me feel, and she told me uses this because she has ADD as well. So eventually I decided to try it out and I love it. It&#x27;s not as strog as taking medication but it still helps in a lighter more comfortable way. It definitely takes some getting used to the smell thoug. It&#x27;s a bit too strong.</li>
            <li> Works great for my son in helping with his ADHD.  It would work even better I am sure if it was applied twice a day.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, seems to help my focus especially in the morning.</li>
            <li> Waiting to see if it works</li>
            <li> This stuff is my four year olds magic angel potion. Seriously.. works wonders</li>
            <li> Seems to be helping with my friends ADD.</li>
            <li> This was my first Doterra product that I purchased and I have to tell you, I&#x27;m enjoying the smell this product contains. Not only do I know that I am getting an all natural oil but I noticed that it has kept me focused. Needless to say I am hooked on Doterra, I also take the multivitamins pack and it definitely has increased my energy. A little pricey but I have found that I&#x27;d rather take this knowing that I&#x27;m taking something that is not altered or has unknown chemicals in it.</li>
