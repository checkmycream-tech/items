            <li>Great eyeliner goes on smooth</li>
            <li>This eyeliner is wonderful and very durable!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s waterproof and doesn&#x27;t smudge much!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;The brush built into the lid is convenient, and it&#x27;s a nice brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used everything from Kat von D to Stila, and all the popular ones on the market.</li>
            <li>I may learn to love this even more but for now I&#x27;d not quite as good as liquid.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to apply also.</li>
            <li>This is by far the BEST gel eyeliner I have EVER used.</li>
            <li>love love love this eyeliner!</li>
            <li>this product arrived in pretty good time, I love the freebies that come with it!</li>
            <li>It glides on very smooth.</li>
            <li>Goes on nice and smooth and stays on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It isn&#x27;t escalate and cheap!(It has also eyeliner brush, so I think it is cheap!)</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I just love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really cute</li>
            <li>works fantastic!</li>
            <li>either :)))</li>
            <li>and I already love it.</li>
            <li>In fact, I had to build it up and apply it a couple times for me to be satisfied with the pigmentation.</li>
            <li>However, in terms of longevity, I have to say this performs slightly better than my Tarte clay gel liner (which tends to get dry/flaky as the day</li>
            <li>and I need something more waterproof.</li>
            <li>I love this gel liner, the product itself deserves five starts.</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product even though I love this brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good if you&#x27;re a beginner.</li>
            <li>but this 1 is pretty good</li>
            <li>I love how easily this eyeliner goes on and</li>
            <li>I love Tony Moly, but this was a huge miss :</li>
            <li>I really love how smoothly it goes on and</li>
            <li>I also enjoy the design of it, with the brush that is on top.</li>
            <li>It glides easily</li>
            <li>Easy, easy application by design.  </li>
            <li>The product itself stays on well and washes off easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to remove</li>
            <li>but I prefer to use a longer one (but its good for practice if you are new to gel eyeliner).  </li>
            <li>how bold the color is, the design is also really cute.</li>
            <li>It got here fast, and I love it!</li>
            <li>I am not a fan of cheap make-up, so I always end up spending a million dollars on make-up at Sephora or MAC.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much I bought one for my daughter.</li>
            <li>The gel applies smoothly and it lasts all day, even if I sweat.</li>
            <li>The brush is also fantastic.</li>
            <li>Fortunate buy.</li>
            <li>I bought extra for gifts, my friends loved it and found it much better quality than brands in US.</li>
            <li>I use to have a gel Bobbi Brown eyeliner, in comparison the Tonymoly brand sets better, is more visible like i dont have to go over the same area twice, and is so much more cost friendly!</li>
            <li>The brush is soft and precise and the gel is nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I was soo excited to try this out</li>
            <li>It is the first gel eyeliner I have used, so I can&#x27;t compare it to others, but it works much better than pencil and liquid pen types I have tried.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best eyeliner i&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;m pretty old!</li>
            <li>when I applied the product it went on smooth and thick looks perfect!</li>
            <li>Did not like I bought due to the many good reviews, but it just would not set even w/</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner and it&#x27;s very well pigmented.</li>
            <li>But I use TONYMOLY to enhance my winged eyeliner (I only use it on the tips, since the brush is so good at making tapered lines) and it works wonders.</li>
            <li>i really like it :)</li>
            <li>i own several eyeliner brushes but the one included is actually pretty good, the eyeliner stays on well, does not smudge much</li>
            <li>This seller is cool they include lots of samples</li>
            <li>The color is very rich too, and comes of quick with gentle makeup remover.</li>
            <li>It can get kind of messy if the weather is warm or if you accidentally touch your eyes.</li>
            <li>This is a great gel eyeliner and is super black</li>
            <li>This is a great eyeliner, it comes with a little brush</li>
            <li>For me this eyeliner is more of a natural looking color.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite eyeliner EVER.</li>
            <li>while I do appreciate the ease of having the brush right in the cap, I don&#x27;t use it because I don&#x27;t like the shape or how it deposits the product on my eyes.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s easy enough to use a larger brush if that&#x27;s what you are more comfortable</li>
            <li>This is one of the first eyeliners that doesn&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li>First eyeliner I&#x27;ve used that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>It is definitely something I will buy again as it is very affordable, and it is a great product from someone who is mono-lid like me because my eye make up tends to crease or smudge and American products don&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>it.i personally think it is much better than Est√©e Lauder eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Overall I am satisfied with the product</li>
            <li>IF: you first wear an eyelid primer, 2.</li>
            <li>Easy to glide on but not very dark.</li>
            <li>love this liner shipped and arrived fast last a longtime will buy again</li>
            <li>The jet black color is amazing but it smudges a lot.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t dry out and stays put - even in hot, humid weather!</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this eyeliner, but figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try since the price is right.</li>
            <li>but...the thing is, it smears easily and I&#x27;ll end up having raccoon eyes fast :( other than that it is a awesome product i love Tony Moly</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really fade and it&#x27;s really pigmented.</li>
            <li>My eyes are very almond shaped - very pointy at either end - and my lids are also hooded with a crease.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even gone in a lightly chlorinated pool with the eyeliner on, only to come out with it still looking perfect!&lt;br</li>
            <li>fast ship, and</li>
            <li>Oh my goodness I really like this liner.</li>
            <li>and also I have very oily eyelids.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It didn&#x27;t stay on very well</li>
            <li>I have very oily lids and this eyeliner stays put.</li>
            <li>I really like this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I wear contacts and my eyes get very watery sometimes, so</li>
            <li>this is a nice liner, but I&#x27;d only use it if I were to apply a very simple line.</li>
            <li>It glides on easily and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I will say that I think I would prefer an angled brush, but it works decently.</li>
            <li>Also if you do use it for your waterline or to tight-line, little bits might end up in your eye and cause even more irritation so beware.</li>
            <li>But with a little superglue, you might be ok.</li>
            <li>My favorite eyeliner hands down!</li>
            <li>I live in desert area so I need waterproof</li>
            <li>The company that ship it also put in several fun samples too - unexpected bonus.</li>
            <li>Well, it can congeal sometimes in the corners since my eyes get really watery, but it won&#x27;t happen until ten or twelve hours of straight wear.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and long lasting</li>
            <li>it stays on very little smudge so far 1 of the better ones.</li>
            <li>I threw my Maybelline and Loreal ones away because they smudge too much for me and the brushes has become so stiff that they hurt my eyes (even though I clean them before and after each use).</li>
            <li>Instead I use a small, soft angled brush which makes the creamy liner glide on MUCH better.</li>
            <li>It applies very creamy/smooth which concerned me since I was looking for an eyeliner that would not smudge, but to my surprise, after it set it was good for at least 8 hours on average.</li>
            <li>is little, but I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>I find that this is just too light without applying a few coats.  </li>
            <li>It does smudge a bit later in the day though, which kind of sucks because the packaging takes up quite a bit of space in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li>: Definitely lasts a decent amount of time, but it isn&#x27;t smudge-proof.</li>
            <li>Not too dark but more of a lighter shade of black.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 15 year old who loves to try different styles with makeup.</li>
            <li>a very tiny bit will smear and go in my under eye area but is easily fixed.</li>
            <li>I love how smooth the eye liner goes on, giving a thick black line without being messy.  </li>
            <li>It stays for a whole day without leaving dark circle on my yes.</li>
            <li>Super dark black eyeliner that stays on, no matter what.</li>
            <li>Sick of poor quality, I turned to Amazon to find something easy on my pockets, yet good on my eyes.</li>

            <li> love this liner shipped and arrived fast last a longtime will buy again</li>
            <li> The jet black color is amazing but it smudges a lot.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t dry out and stays put - even in hot, humid weather!</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this eyeliner, but figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try since the price is right.</li>
            <li> but...the thing is, it smears easily and I&#x27;ll end up having raccoon eyes fast :( other than that it is a awesome product i love Tony Moly</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really fade and it&#x27;s really pigmented.</li>
            <li> My eyes are very almond shaped - very pointy at either end - and my lids are also hooded with a crease.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even gone in a lightly chlorinated pool with the eyeliner on, only to come out with it still looking perfect!&lt;br</li>
            <li> fast ship, and</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness I really like this liner.</li>
            <li> and also I have very oily eyelids.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It didn&#x27;t stay on very well</li>
            <li> I have very oily lids and this eyeliner stays put.</li>
            <li> I really like this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I wear contacts and my eyes get very watery sometimes, so</li>
            <li> this is a nice liner, but I&#x27;d only use it if I were to apply a very simple line.</li>
            <li> It glides on easily and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I will say that I think I would prefer an angled brush, but it works decently.</li>
            <li> Also if you do use it for your waterline or to tight-line, little bits might end up in your eye and cause even more irritation so beware.</li>
            <li> But with a little superglue, you might be ok.</li>
            <li> My favorite eyeliner hands down!</li>
            <li> I live in desert area so I need waterproof</li>
            <li> The company that ship it also put in several fun samples too - unexpected bonus.</li>
            <li> Well, it can congeal sometimes in the corners since my eyes get really watery, but it won&#x27;t happen until ten or twelve hours of straight wear.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and long lasting</li>
            <li> it stays on very little smudge so far 1 of the better ones.</li>
            <li> I threw my Maybelline and Loreal ones away because they smudge too much for me and the brushes has become so stiff that they hurt my eyes (even though I clean them before and after each use).</li>
            <li> Instead I use a small, soft angled brush which makes the creamy liner glide on MUCH better.</li>
            <li> It applies very creamy/smooth which concerned me since I was looking for an eyeliner that would not smudge, but to my surprise, after it set it was good for at least 8 hours on average.</li>
            <li> is little, but I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> I find that this is just too light without applying a few coats.  </li>
            <li> It does smudge a bit later in the day though, which kind of sucks because the packaging takes up quite a bit of space in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> : Definitely lasts a decent amount of time, but it isn&#x27;t smudge-proof.</li>
            <li> Not too dark but more of a lighter shade of black.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 15 year old who loves to try different styles with makeup.</li>
            <li> a very tiny bit will smear and go in my under eye area but is easily fixed.</li>
            <li> I love how smooth the eye liner goes on, giving a thick black line without being messy.  </li>
            <li> It stays for a whole day without leaving dark circle on my yes.</li>
            <li> Super dark black eyeliner that stays on, no matter what.</li>
            <li> Sick of poor quality, I turned to Amazon to find something easy on my pockets, yet good on my eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to control how thick or thin you want and the cover is consistent.</li>
            <li> liner definitely lasts a long time, but because it didn&#x27;t have the sort of pigmentation I expect from a liner, it&#x27;s not something I would use too often unless, say, it&#x27;s raining outside</li>
            <li> Long story short</li>
            <li> Sometimes I touch it up if I am going to be out all day long, but it still isn&#x27;t really necessary to do so.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last very long with primer</li>
            <li> Every eyeliner, except for a few liquid ones, would smudge onto the upper part of my eyelid (where the \\&quot;hood\\&quot; is), congeal in the corners, or come off completely.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be a little weak in that regard--it had a slightly glossy finish, and wasn&#x27;t really as black and opaque as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> It stays all day long and doesn&#x27;t smudge like others I&#x27;ve tried before!</li>
            <li> This packaging is a bit strange but it has a brush in the handle making it convenient to bring anywhere!</li>
            <li> Some dry before you get to the end of the pot</li>
            <li> i have dry skin</li>
            <li> The only negative is how EASILY the stupid brush breaks when you&#x27;re opening it for the first time.</li>
            <li> I totally recommend the Cat winks mascara and the cherry pink lip tint!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s flat but rounded so you can get a super thin line or a really thick wide stroke based on how you use it.</li>
            <li> The brush is too rough and hurt my eyes when applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The seller sent the product sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> However, breaking my bank for make-up isn&#x27;t always something I can do, so I also end up getting other brands at CVS.</li>
            <li> I never will use any other eyeliner ever again</li>
            <li> and I would choose it over any other eyeliner I have tried.</li>
            <li> Need a couple of coats for it to be dark.</li>
            <li> Use it as both eyeliner and black eye cream for evenings</li>
            <li> Given the virtually unanimous praise for this product, it was slightly underwhelming.&lt;br</li>
            <li> : I like my black liners to be pitch-black--like opaque, matte, and literally black.</li>
            <li> a black shadow &amp; the brush was soooo stif.</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly, but I was a little disappointed that it shipped in an envelope instead of</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little smoother/more black and it stays on longer than the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s less than half the cost of all of the ones I&#x27;ve tried before!)</li>
            <li> In this regard, it&#x27;s definitely worse than my current &#x27;holy grail&#x27; liner, the Tarte clay gel</li>
            <li> It also takes quite a while to set, so don&#x27;t touch your eyes for a few minutes after applying this product.</li>
            <li> When I got mine, the handle was broken, so only gets three stars.</li>
            <li> This is like my everyday need.</li>
            <li> I usually use MAC and my eyeliner was running out</li>
            <li> The only bad thing I&#x27;d say about this product is that it can smudge or run if you don&#x27;t set it with a little bit of translucent powder or black eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time with eyeliners they smudge</li>
            <li> I always have a very hard time finding an eyeliner that doesn&#x27;t smudge or bother my eyes.</li>
            <li> I was also a little disappointed that my brush didn&#x27;t extend, as I have seen in videos of the product.</li>
            <li> but no matter how thin or thick I draw the line, it still smudges like crazy!</li>
            <li> I decided to try The TONYMOLY Backstage Gel Eyeliner even though I was skeptical by</li>
            <li> , it melts, i don&#x27;t get what the raves are all about, sorry</li>
            <li> but I am really disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent quality eyeliner, easy to put on. Such a practical way of packaging the brush and eyeliner together. I bought extra for gifts, my friends loved it and found it much better quality than brands in US.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great liner and it applies well. It does smudge a bit later in the day though, which kind of sucks because the packaging takes up quite a bit of space in my makeup bag. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to people who plan on using this on their waterline or tight-lining, it irritates your eyes quite a bit. Also if you do use it for your waterline or to tight-line, little bits might end up in your eye and cause even more irritation so beware. Long story short this is a nice liner, but I&#x27;d only use it if I were to apply a very simple line. It&#x27;s pretty good if you&#x27;re a beginner.</li>
            <li> Goes on nice and smooth and stays on. The brush is not the greatest but quality of liner is outstanding for the price.</li>
            <li> love this liner shipped and arrived fast last a longtime will buy again</li>
            <li> Best gel eyeliner I own. The brush is soft and precise and the gel is nice and smooth. I threw my Maybelline and Loreal ones away because they smudge too much for me and the brushes has become so stiff that they hurt my eyes (even though I clean them before and after each use).</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and long lasting</li>
            <li> I live in desert area so I need waterproof eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t escalate and cheap!(It has also eyeliner brush, so I think it is cheap!)</li>
            <li> One of the best gel eyeliners out there. Use it as both eyeliner and black eye cream for evenings</li>
            <li> I love it. This gel liner is awesome. It would go out if you rub your eyes though. It glides easily and I just love it. It doesn&#x27;t really fade and it&#x27;s really pigmented. It&#x27;s really cute and I would buy it again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Easy to glide on but not very dark. Need a couple of coats for it to be dark. For me this eyeliner is more of a natural looking color. Not too dark but more of a lighter shade of black.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner and it&#x27;s very well pigmented. It glides on easily and lasts a long time. The only bad thing I&#x27;d say about this product is that it can smudge or run if you don&#x27;t set it with a little bit of translucent powder or black eyeshadow. It can get kind of messy if the weather is warm or if you accidentally touch your eyes.</li>
            <li> WOW. This is by far the BEST gel eyeliner I have EVER used. I am not a fan of cheap make-up, so I always end up spending a million dollars on make-up at Sephora or MAC. However, breaking my bank for make-up isn&#x27;t always something I can do, so I also end up getting other brands at CVS. Sick of poor quality, I turned to Amazon to find something easy on my pockets, yet good on my eyes. This blew my mind. It seldom feathers, and it stays on my water line ALL day without running. Even if I cry, wipe my eyes, or even take a nap--it&#x27;s still there! I can wear it for 8 hours, no problem. Sometimes I touch it up if I am going to be out all day long, but it still isn&#x27;t really necessary to do so. NO smudging and NO &amp;#34;smile line&amp;#34; on my eyelid. GREAT. JUST GREAT.</li>
            <li> Best gel eyeliner I&#x27;ve used! I liked it so much I bought one for my daughter. It glides on very smooth. I use to have a gel Bobbi Brown eyeliner, in comparison the Tonymoly brand sets better, is more visible like i dont have to go over the same area twice, and is so much more cost friendly! I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Super dark black eyeliner that stays on, no matter what. I have oily eyelids in a humid climate, which doesn&#x27;t play well with makeup. But I use TONYMOLY to enhance my winged eyeliner (I only use it on the tips, since the brush is so good at making tapered lines) and it works wonders. The only negative is how EASILY the stupid brush breaks when you&#x27;re opening it for the first time. But with a little superglue, you might be ok.</li>
            <li> This is a great eyeliner, it comes with a little brush but I prefer to use a longer one (but its good for practice if you are new to gel eyeliner).  It goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t dry out and stays put - even in hot, humid weather! The color is very rich too, and comes of quick with gentle makeup remover. The company that ship it also put in several fun samples too - unexpected bonus.</li>
            <li> Best liner I&#x27;ve every used. Easy, easy application by design.  I&#x27;ll buy again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through just about every type of eyeliner you can imagine. But they always smudge, wear off, or give me raccoon eyes. My eyes are very almond shaped - very pointy at either end - and my lids are also hooded with a crease. Every eyeliner, except for a few liquid ones, would smudge onto the upper part of my eyelid (where the \\&quot;hood\\&quot; is), congeal in the corners, or come off completely. This is one of the first eyeliners that doesn&#x27;t do that. Well, it can congeal sometimes in the corners since my eyes get really watery, but it won&#x27;t happen until ten or twelve hours of straight wear. I&#x27;ve even gone in a lightly chlorinated pool with the eyeliner on, only to come out with it still looking perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush it comes with is little, but I enjoy using it. But it&#x27;s easy enough to use a larger brush if that&#x27;s what you are more comfortable with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is going to be my go-to eyeliner forever!</li>
            <li> this product arrived in pretty good time, I love the freebies that come with it! &amp;lt;3333 when I applied the product it went on smooth and thick looks perfect! but...the thing is, it smears easily and I&#x27;ll end up having raccoon eyes fast :( other than that it is a awesome product i love Tony Moly I totally recommend the Cat winks mascara and the cherry pink lip tint!!! works fantastic!</li>
            <li> Love this eyeliner! it doesnt smudge or end up on my upper lids. Does not give me the raccoon eyes. This is by far the best eyeliner i&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;m pretty old!</li>
            <li> I really love it! It stays all day long and doesn&#x27;t smudge like others I&#x27;ve tried before! Totally recommend it!</li>
            <li> love love love this eyeliner! Stays on ALL DAY and doesn&#x27;t smudge. My favorite eyeliner hands down!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using gel eyeliner to create a simple cat eye every day for the last 8 years. I&#x27;ve cycled through countless bottles of the MAC Fluidline Gel Eyeliner ($16.50), the Bobbi Brown Long-Wear Gel Eyeliner ($25), and the Tarte Amazonian Clay Gel Pot Eyeliner ($21) and each one had flaws! Some dry before you get to the end of the pot so you have to throw it away, while others rub off or fade throughout the day. I decided to try The TONYMOLY Backstage Gel Eyeliner even though I was skeptical by it&#x27;s price (It&#x27;s less than half the cost of all of the ones I&#x27;ve tried before!) and it is now the only eyeliner I will ever use. The gel applies smoothly and it lasts all day, even if I sweat. It does rub off if you touch it but if you leave it alone, it holds up! The brush is also fantastic. I&#x27;ve purchased eyeliner brushes before and I&#x27;ve never tried one as good as this. It&#x27;s flat but rounded so you can get a super thin line or a really thick wide stroke based on how you use it. I love it! I will be re-ordering as soon as it runs out, which won&#x27;t be for a while!</li>
            <li> fast ship, and i really like it :)</li>
            <li> i have dry skin so the liner shouldn&#x27;t melt off my eyes, even when i set it, it melts, i don&#x27;t get what the raves are all about, sorry</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this eyeliner, but figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try since the price is right. I always have a very hard time finding an eyeliner that doesn&#x27;t smudge or bother my eyes. I wore this one for an entire day without any issues at all. it did not smudge AT ALL, and my eyes did not look allergy attacked either :))) I love it!</li>
            <li> I have a hard time with eyeliners they smudge run disappear but this 1 is pretty good it stays on very little smudge so far 1 of the better ones.I will order again</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is wonderful and very durable!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s waterproof and doesn&#x27;t smudge much!&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 15 year old who loves to try different styles with makeup. I usually use MAC and my eyeliner was running out and it always makes my eyeliner smudge even if I don&#x27;t touch it.. I ventured onto amazon looking to try a Gel eyeliner after seeing reviews on this I decided to try it out. It got here fast, and I love it! I just got it 20 minutes ago and I already love it. I would buy this again and recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> First eyeliner I&#x27;ve used that lasts all day. Very easy to apply also.</li>
            <li> I kept reading raving reviews about how this liner literally does not budge/flake off/smudge/etc, how amazingly pigmented it is, etc etc., so of course I had to give it a shot. Given the virtually unanimous praise for this product, it was slightly underwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PIGMENTATION: I like my black liners to be pitch-black--like opaque, matte, and literally black. I found this product to be a little weak in that regard--it had a slightly glossy finish, and wasn&#x27;t really as black and opaque as I would have liked. In fact, I had to build it up and apply it a couple times for me to be satisfied with the pigmentation. In this regard, it&#x27;s definitely worse than my current &#x27;holy grail&#x27; liner, the Tarte clay gel liner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LONGEVITY: Definitely lasts a decent amount of time, but it isn&#x27;t smudge-proof. It also takes quite a while to set, so don&#x27;t touch your eyes for a few minutes after applying this product. However, in terms of longevity, I have to say this performs slightly better than my Tarte clay gel liner (which tends to get dry/flaky as the day progresses).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This liner definitely lasts a long time, but because it didn&#x27;t have the sort of pigmentation I expect from a liner, it&#x27;s not something I would use too often unless, say, it&#x27;s raining outside and I need something more waterproof. For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it though!</li>
            <li> This packaging is a bit strange but it has a brush in the handle making it convenient to bring anywhere! It applies very creamy/smooth which concerned me since I was looking for an eyeliner that would not smudge, but to my surprise, after it set it was good for at least 8 hours on average. It is definitely something I will buy again as it is very affordable, and it is a great product from someone who is mono-lid like me because my eye make up tends to crease or smudge and American products don&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> I like but its not 100% waterproof, because after hours I still get panda eye. LOL</li>
            <li> Did not like I bought due to the many good reviews, but it just would not set even w/ a black shadow &amp; the brush was soooo stif. I used it w/ a primer, pre-lined w/ a pencil liner :o/ nothing. I love Tony Moly, but this was a huge miss :o((((</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness I really like this liner. Fortunate buy. Will last awhile but I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love how easily this eyeliner goes on and while I do appreciate the ease of having the brush right in the cap, I don&#x27;t use it because I don&#x27;t like the shape or how it deposits the product on my eyes. Instead I use a small, soft angled brush which makes the creamy liner glide on MUCH better. The product itself stays on well and washes off easily. I would probably buy this again.</li>
            <li> This eye liner is really good. It stays for a whole day without leaving dark circle on my yes. Easy to remove too.love it.i personally think it is much better than Est√©e Lauder eyeliner.</li>
            <li> This is a great gel eyeliner and is super black but it doesn&#x27;t last very long with primer and also I have very oily eyelids.</li>
            <li> I love this gel liner, the product itself deserves five starts. I wish the brush it comes with was angled and that it actually extended.</li>
            <li> The brush is too rough and hurt my eyes when applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product even though I love this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t stay on very well either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry</li>
            <li> I like this product. No smears</li>
            <li> Great eyeliner goes on smooth i own several eyeliner brushes but the one included is actually pretty good, the eyeliner stays on well, does not smudge much, this is good but then it means you ll need very good make up remover. This seller is cool they include lots of samples</li>
            <li> love it! I have very oily lids and this eyeliner stays put. a very tiny bit will smear and go in my under eye area but is easily fixed. would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I really like this eyeliner. I find it comparable to Eye Studio Gel liner from Maybelline. It&#x27;s a little smoother/more black and it stays on longer than the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush built into the lid is convenient, and it&#x27;s a nice brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful! I never will use any other eyeliner ever again</li>
            <li> I was soo excited to try this out but I am really disappointed. It is advertised as waterproof, and says it will stay on for hours, but it doesn&#x27;t even stay on my eyelids for 5 minutes..I have hooded eyelids but no matter how thin or thick I draw the line, it still smudges like crazy! I really love how smoothly it goes on and how bold the color is, the design is also really cute. But I&#x27;m probably never going to wear it outside unless maybe if it is Halloween and I want to look like a raccoon/panda.</li>
            <li> The jet black color is amazing but it smudges a lot.</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly, but I was a little disappointed that it shipped in an envelope instead of a box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides that, the eyeliner itself is a great product. It is the first gel eyeliner I have used, so I can&#x27;t compare it to others, but it works much better than pencil and liquid pen types I have tried. I also enjoy the design of it, with the brush that is on top. I will say that I think I would prefer an angled brush, but it works decently. I was also a little disappointed that my brush didn&#x27;t extend, as I have seen in videos of the product. The product stays on my eyes quite well, though if I rub my eyes it does smudge a bit. It seems to be relatively water resistant. Overall I am satisfied with the product and I would choose it over any other eyeliner I have tried.</li>
            <li> I wear contacts and my eyes get very watery sometimes, so finding a liner that is truly waterproof is great!  this eyeliner works wonders IF: you first wear an eyelid primer, 2. wear just enough liner and 3. set it with a eyeshadow or powder.</li>
            <li> When I got mine, the handle was broken, so only gets three stars.</li>
            <li> There are lots of reviews on this product, and I figured that I wouldn&#x27;t mind having another gel liner in my makeup kit. This is by far my favorite eyeliner EVER. I&#x27;ve used everything from Kat von D to Stila, and all the popular ones on the market. This beats them by far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has great staying power, doesn&#x27;t smudge, and is great for beginners.</li>
            <li> This is a great eyeliner! It stays on wonderfully and the packaging is genius. The seller sent the product sooner than expected. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Totally recommend this. This is like my everyday need. like I neeeeedd it. I dont need anything else but this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but I prefer a liquid at this point.  I find that this is just too light without applying a few coats.  I may learn to love this even more but for now I&#x27;d not quite as good as liquid.  For what it is it&#x27;s a good product.  It&#x27;s a good gel eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I love how smooth the eye liner goes on, giving a thick black line without being messy.  It&#x27;s easy to control how thick or thin you want and the cover is consistent.</li>
