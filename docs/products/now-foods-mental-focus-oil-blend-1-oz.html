            <li>Now is my favorite EO brand!!</li>

            <li>This is good stuff....</li>
            <li>I think that I will always buy the NOW products because they are really good.</li>

            <li>Very lovely item -</li>
            <li>Love using this in our diffuser for the living room!</li>
            <li>I like to make my own blends.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter thinking it would be nice for her and help her study...</li>
            <li>for the effectiveness, I am no expert, but I honestly believe it does work.</li>
            <li>It also helps me feel more energetic which is a bonus!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that they use 6 very easy to find oils.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love mint, my family is not as fond of it because they find it overpowering</li>
            <li>but it is really refreshing</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I will probably keep it myself and try to mix it with something else to see if it can smell better.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite oils to diffuse.</li>
            <li>Lovely blend of lemon and peppermint.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>It was ok.  </li>
            <li>I mentioned that I diffuse this at my sons homeschooling desk and I am pleased to say it works for him too.</li>
            <li>It keeps him more focused on the task at hand and not on distractions.</li>
            <li>Smells ok.</li>
            <li>Not terrible, but not my favorite.</li>
            <li>This blend has a nice clean, invigorating smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>It really does give your brain an awakening! :)</li>
            <li>Smell really nice,Though I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s helped my focus more or not... but love the smell ;)</li>
            <li>I have absolutely fallen in love with this stuff.</li>
            <li>True story:</li>
            <li>It is fresh and clean and I will continue to use it but not buy again.</li>
            <li>Wears off fairly quickly</li>
            <li>And I love most essential oils.</li>
            <li>Luckily i work with a lot of nurses &amp; i had one take my blood pressure because i felt like i was about to pass out-</li>
            <li>I do urge you to try this one if you are like me and have a career that required focus and calm</li>
            <li>I might try to make my own next time.</li>
            <li>My kids were making up games and giggling and talking about how much fun organizing was.  </li>
            <li>My kids normally cant do anything for 3 hours straight and still be happy, especially not cleaning and organizing!  </li>
            <li>This is fantastic, my new favorite.&lt;br /&gt;carry</li>
            <li>The label is clean and simple and the ingredients/ instructions are easy to read.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted..</li>
            <li>I bought the Now Foods Peaceful Sleep, Cheer Up Buttercup and Metal Focus all together.</li>
            <li>Nice , but I am still not focused mentally</li>
            <li>Smells nice, not what I expected.</li>
            <li>great for using just before tests after those late night study sessions.</li>
            <li>I felt ok enough to drive home as i figured the symptoms would ease up over the course of the evening....</li>
            <li>Also, like most essential oil bottles it comes with a plastic dropper cap..</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s seems to be a good as the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m positive it&#x27;ll work for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>Quit taking ritalin for my ADD about a year ago when I stopped taking all medications.. Really needed something to help me focus and this does the trick.</li>
            <li>When you buy the NOW Food eucalyptus oil, it has the recipe for a mental focus oil blend: 3 drops eucalyptus, 2 drops peppermint, 2 drops tangerine.</li>
            <li>The NOW Foods Mental Focus, smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>Now this may have been a coincidence, but I really don&#x27;t think it was.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure this helped me to focus mentally, but it sure smells nice.</li>
            <li>But I think the crisp peppermint and wintergreen clear my head.</li>
            <li>I will never be without this oil, it is exactly like Young Living PanAway at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>It might be me slowing down to say, &amp;#34;I need to focus&amp;#34; when I&#x27;ve started to procrastinate or my mind wanders more than the scent.</li>
            <li>It has a really pleasant smell and it&#x27;s one we all seem to agree on which can be tough for a family of 6.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>i started to feel a little sleepy &amp; a bit better between 1-2am &amp; went to sleep.</li>
            <li>And I usually stop to take a whiff, then get an hour or two of good, solid work done.</li>
            <li>Then one of my coworkers walked with me outside to try to get some fresh air into my lungs &amp; try to relax.</li>
            <li>until you&#x27;ve experienced the benefits of essential oils for yourself it&#x27;s hard to believe how well they work!  </li>
            <li>you are new to the e.o. World and don&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money on oils, NOW Foods is the way to go.</li>
            <li>but my first time using the NOW Food Mental Focus blend 5 drops in a diffuser for maybe 2-3 minutes (diffuser did 30 min on &amp; 30 min off rotation) &amp; i started having a severe allergic reaction.</li>
            <li>so i am still, as i am typing this, having a really terible case of dry mouth</li>
            <li>Mental Focus is very minty.</li>
            <li>it around with you and sniff it throughout your day or put 30 drops into a small spray bottle with fresh water to use as a room/body spray.</li>
            <li>Even after i calmed down a bit i still felt very week &amp; my throat felt constricted.</li>

            <li> I have no idea if i am allergic to the mixture of these oils or one specifically, but i just thought i may want to warn others out there that even a person who has NO known allergies can have a possible allergic reaction to Essential Oils.... just be careful.</li>
            <li> I expected that, as I&#x27;m not a fan of wintergreen-type smells.</li>
            <li> I have never written a bad review &amp; i usually love the NOW brand for vitamins &amp; other things....</li>
            <li> Along with the other 4 oils, they all give you mental focus.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s minty although there are other oils in it like lemon, grapefruit, rosemary, and basil</li>
            <li> the wintergreen and peppermint overpower the other scents.</li>
            <li> It does keep me sharp all day.</li>
            <li> The strongest scents are the wintergreen and peppermint, which are known for their effectiveness in making you alert (along with a thousand other uses).</li>
            <li> but a killer headache happened and Mental Focus zapped it away!</li>
            <li> As far as i know, i am not allergic to anything, but this EO mixture inhaled via diffuser caused me to start to feel dizzy, then weak, then started to cause my throat to feel like it was swelling up...</li>
            <li> The bottle its self is dark to preserve and protect the oils from sun exposure.</li>
            <li> then after about another 15-20 minutes it went down to 110/60.</li>
            <li> It was hard for me to put aside what other people where saying about the purity of their oils but now that I have, I don&#x27;t see any other way to go as a beginner.</li>
            <li> I used it in my oil locket and the few drops I used lasted 4 days.</li>
            <li> I woke up today thinking the Benadryl had cured the weird throat constriction feeling, but it started to come back....</li>
            <li> I usually buy my oils from Amazon</li>
            <li> but I hardly mind.</li>
            <li> but that is hardly a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> Within 15 minutes all 3 kids took a turn for the worse and began fussing, fighting, and crying.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Wears off fairly quickly but I hardly mind. I definitely notice a difference. Quit taking ritalin for my ADD about a year ago when I stopped taking all medications.. Really needed something to help me focus and this does the trick. I apply it to my temples or the back of my neck (or both) every couple hours if I&#x27;m at work or studying. It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.. I just wish it lasted a bit longer but that is hardly a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> I keep this scent in my car and use it in my car diff-user. I love it. It&#x27;s minty although there are other oils in it like lemon, grapefruit, rosemary, and basil the wintergreen and peppermint overpower the other scents. I love mint, my family is not as fond of it because they find it overpowering but it is really refreshing</li>
            <li> I had to give it to the thrift store it smelled so gross. And I love most essential oils. It almost smelled like musty cigarettes. yuck.</li>
            <li> I bought the Now Foods Peaceful Sleep, Cheer Up Buttercup and Metal Focus all together. Mental Focus is very minty. It is fresh and clean and I will continue to use it but not buy again. I like to make my own blends.</li>
            <li> Nice , but I am still not focused mentally</li>
            <li> I love this product.  The fragrance is wonderful!  It does keep me sharp all day.</li>
            <li> Love using this in our diffuser for the living room! It has a really pleasant smell and it&#x27;s one we all seem to agree on which can be tough for a family of 6. It also helps me feel more energetic which is a bonus!</li>
            <li> Smells nice, not what I expected. My plan is to use it in my classroom. I&#x27;m hoping it will give me a quiet edge over my 7th and 8th graders.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this helped me to focus mentally, but it sure smells nice. I like the peppermint smell. I might try to make my own next time. When you buy the NOW Food eucalyptus oil, it has the recipe for a mental focus oil blend: 3 drops eucalyptus, 2 drops peppermint, 2 drops tangerine. However, this pre-made blend seems to have different ingredients: lemon, peppermint, wintergreen, basil, rosemary, grapefruit.</li>
            <li> Now is my favorite EO brand!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter thinking it would be nice for her and help her study...maybe it will, but this oil does not smell good.  Is that supposed to help you focus???  I doubt she will ever use it.  I will probably keep it myself and try to mix it with something else to see if it can smell better.</li>
            <li> This blend has a nice clean, invigorating smell. And, yes, I feel it improves my focus! I use it at work, where I spend 8+ hours at a standing workstation. I sometimes blend it with lavender. I&#x27;ll continue to purchase this one!</li>
            <li> This is good stuff....great for using just before tests after those late night study sessions.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite oils to diffuse. It really does give your brain an awakening! :)</li>
            <li> Lovely blend of lemon and peppermint. It&#x27;s strong but not overpowering. I used it in my oil locket and the few drops I used lasted 4 days. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great &amp;#34;refreshing&amp;#34; scent!!</li>
            <li> I use this at work. I love the smell. It might be me slowing down to say, &amp;#34;I need to focus&amp;#34; when I&#x27;ve started to procrastinate or my mind wanders more than the scent. But I think the crisp peppermint and wintergreen clear my head. And I usually stop to take a whiff, then get an hour or two of good, solid work done.</li>
            <li> Smell really nice,Though I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s helped my focus more or not... but love the smell ;)</li>
            <li> I have never written a bad review &amp; i usually love the NOW brand for vitamins &amp; other things.... but my first time using the NOW Food Mental Focus blend 5 drops in a diffuser for maybe 2-3 minutes (diffuser did 30 min on &amp; 30 min off rotation) &amp; i started having a severe allergic reaction. As far as i know, i am not allergic to anything, but this EO mixture inhaled via diffuser caused me to start to feel dizzy, then weak, then started to cause my throat to feel like it was swelling up... all within maybe 3 minutes. Luckily i work with a lot of nurses &amp; i had one take my blood pressure because i felt like i was about to pass out- my BP was 188/110. Then one of my coworkers walked with me outside to try to get some fresh air into my lungs &amp; try to relax. After a bit she checked my BP again &amp; it was 140/90, then after about another 15-20 minutes it went down to 110/60. Even after i calmed down a bit i still felt very week &amp; my throat felt constricted. I felt ok enough to drive home as i figured the symptoms would ease up over the course of the evening.... but the throat pressure/constricted feeling was still there at 10:45pm. I then called my Pharmacist &amp; told him the situation, asked him what i should take- he told me Benadryl, so i took the recommended dosage (2 tabs for adults) &amp; waitied for some signs of relief.... i started to feel a little sleepy &amp; a bit better between 1-2am &amp; went to sleep. I woke up today thinking the Benadryl had cured the weird throat constriction feeling, but it started to come back.... so i am still, as i am typing this, having a really terible case of dry mouth &amp; i still have the throat pressure. I have no idea if i am allergic to the mixture of these oils or one specifically, but i just thought i may want to warn others out there that even a person who has NO known allergies can have a possible allergic reaction to Essential Oils.... just be careful.</li>
            <li> Very lovely item - until you&#x27;ve experienced the benefits of essential oils for yourself it&#x27;s hard to believe how well they work!  I do urge you to try this one if you are like me and have a career that required focus and calm concentration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also add that this was a very nice transaction - very speedy shipping with excellent packaging!</li>
            <li> This is fantastic, my new favorite.&lt;br /&gt;carry it around with you and sniff it throughout your day or put 30 drops into a small spray bottle with fresh water to use as a room/body spray.</li>
            <li> It was ok.  I probably won&#x27;t reorder this blend.</li>
            <li> The NOW Foods Mental Focus, smells fantastic! I have absolutely fallen in love with this stuff. I diffuse it at my desk when working, at my sons desk when homeschooling, and in my car (on a cotton ball in the air vent). I love the fact that they use 6 very easy to find oils. Lemon, peppermint, wintergreen, basil, Rosemary, and grapefruit e.o. make up this bottle. The bottle its self is dark to preserve and protect the oils from sun exposure. Also, like most essential oil bottles it comes with a plastic dropper cap.. Life saver if you don&#x27;t have a glass dropper. The label is clean and simple and the ingredients/ instructions are easy to read.&lt;br /&gt;As for the effectiveness, I am no expert, but I honestly believe it does work. The strongest scents are the wintergreen and peppermint, which are known for their effectiveness in making you alert (along with a thousand other uses). Along with the other 4 oils, they all give you mental focus. I mentioned that I diffuse this at my sons homeschooling desk and I am pleased to say it works for him too. It keeps him more focused on the task at hand and not on distractions. If it can work on a autistic/ ADD 3 y.o. I&#x27;m positive it&#x27;ll work for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;If you are new to the e.o. World and don&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money on oils, NOW Foods is the way to go. It was hard for me to put aside what other people where saying about the purity of their oils but now that I have, I don&#x27;t see any other way to go as a beginner.</li>
            <li> Smells great and it&#x27;s seems to be a good as the more expensive brands. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Smells ok. Not terrible, but not my favorite. I expected that, as I&#x27;m not a fan of wintergreen-type smells.</li>
            <li> I like the sent a lot. I think that I will always buy the NOW products because they are really good.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff. I use it in my classroom daily. The kids like the scent and so do I.</li>
            <li> True story: The day I received this I immediately began diffusing it in my kids playroom.  We then organized and cleaned for 3 hours.  My kids were making up games and giggling and talking about how much fun organizing was.  I had to unplug the diffuser because I was moving the piece of furniture it was sitting on.  Within 15 minutes all 3 kids took a turn for the worse and began fussing, fighting, and crying.  Now this may have been a coincidence, but I really don&#x27;t think it was.  My kids normally cant do anything for 3 hours straight and still be happy, especially not cleaning and organizing!  The mixture smells really good also!</li>
            <li> I usually buy my oils from Amazon but today I purchased this at a retail store. I will never be without this oil, it is exactly like Young Living PanAway at a fraction of the cost. I&#x27;m away from home and wasn&#x27;t going to open this until I returned home but a killer headache happened and Mental Focus zapped it away!</li>
