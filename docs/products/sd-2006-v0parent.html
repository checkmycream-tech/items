    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Very happy with this product now that I have been using it for months.</li>
            <li>It seems to be effective without burning or singing.  </li>
            <li>Fingers crossed, but it appears effective.</li>
            <li>but dose not make me bold lol</li>
            <li>I do have hopes that with continued use I might see better results.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>But hey girls, if u know any product better, please share.</li>
            <li>Love u gals, and neva forget, u r</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>For the price, I&#x27;d say its better than one I paid 50 dollars for and did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product, as I have never come across anything better than this for the problem of Hirsutism.</li>
            <li>right now I can&#x27;t say that I would.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I guess I had higher expectations.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t completely stopped the regrowth, but has significantly reduced the hair.</li>
            <li>I am updating after a few more months of use - it does work, there has been a significant reduction in the rate of regrowth.</li>
            <li>Years ago , I used a roll-on product, but can&#x27;t remember the exact name, was very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>But in the long run, they increased my facial fair and made them thicker and blacker.</li>
            <li>This absolutely does not work.</li>
            <li>meh, cannot really say yes</li>
            <li>So if you have hirsutism then it&#x27;s really a blessing.</li>
            <li>If I applied it for a whole day/night...</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed any decrease in hair growth.</li>
            <li>Person I gave this as a present appears happy and have never complained or said anything good or bad.</li>
            <li>I actually wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone that is looking for positive results.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I did not expect anything (as I have used so many products in the past, and everything made it worse)</li>
            <li>It keeps the hair from growing back so fast.</li>
            <li>so far i dont know if it is working</li>
            <li>I am a 27 years old girl of Indian origin.</li>
            <li>it is good to apply everyday, and I will see if I will need to use it less and lesser in the future.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a light, faint scent, it doesn&#x27;t irritate or burn when applying it, even if it is applied right after removing hair.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell that much of a difference, there seems to be slightly less regrowth</li>

            <li> I have coarse facial hair and over a year some it went completely white, some still grow back but slowly and much</li>
            <li> I have pretty dark, thick hair, so it might work for people with thinner, lighter colored hair, but wouldn&#x27;t suggest it to people with hair like myself, generally.</li>
            <li> This product is about the same as other products on the market.</li>
            <li> This works well if you keep rubbing it in until it is almost dry.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several methods of facial hair removal/hiding in the past - like shaving, waxing, bleach, laser hair removal.</li>
            <li> and I believe the hair is starting to grow in a little slower since I started using it.</li>
            <li> there was very little hair growth than usual during that time period and the hair were much finer.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a few months now on facial hair that I remove by plucking with tweezers.</li>
            <li> There is still the problem of ingrown hair, as I still wax my face, once in a week and a half and pluck the other</li>
            <li> not worth it</li>
            <li> I use this on coarse, thick hairs on my chin.</li>
            <li> I have had this problem of hirsutism since few years now due to PCOS.</li>
            <li> and it there is much less hair on my chin.</li>
            <li> The spray is water like with slightly citrous fragrance (Like Vinegar).&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably lessened hair growth a little, but I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in the texture of the hair itself, which is what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> wait a few minutes after the treatment to apply it</li>
            <li> A waste of time.</li>
            <li> Hopefully after few months of usage, I will be a happier person.  </li>
            <li> No More spray along with Oral Contraceptives Pills (I have been taking Pills for a year now).</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure if this does what its suppose to.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still wondering if this product would have worked, since I could not get past the smell to use it!</li>
            <li> Sorry for all girls with the problem of hirsutism, its a nightmare.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a product like this since vaniqua is so expensive and needs an Rx.</li>
            <li> I desperately wanted/want to get rid of them.&lt;br /&gt;Since</li>
            <li> This also increased ingrown hair on my face :(.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 months and still no change, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had horrible chin hair and have been using this for about a month</li>
            <li> Hate it !!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used as directed and cannot tell that it is working at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 months now. It keeps the hair from growing back so fast. I use this on coarse, thick hairs on my chin. I haven&#x27;t noticed as of yet changes in the texture of the hair. I do have hopes that with continued use I might see better results. For the price, I&#x27;d say its better than one I paid 50 dollars for and did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> This absolutely does not work. I tried it on my legs, arms, and and face but I saw no change whatsoever. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 months and still no change, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> smelled like nail polish remover and didn&#x27;t do anything. not worth it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this does anything. I stopped using it. I have yet to find anything that acutally slows the rate your hair grows.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  It seems to be effective without burning or singing.  Fingers crossed, but it appears effective. Recommended online.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for four months on my arms, underarms, and bikini area. It&#x27;s probably lessened hair growth a little, but I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in the texture of the hair itself, which is what I was hoping for. I have pretty dark, thick hair, so it might work for people with thinner, lighter colored hair, but wouldn&#x27;t suggest it to people with hair like myself, generally.</li>
            <li> so far i dont know if it is working so we shall see hope it works but dose not make me bold lol</li>
            <li> meh, cannot really say yes it is or isint working may after another year. I shave every 2-3 weeks at the moment this could be the cause.</li>
            <li> I have coarse facial hair and over a year some it went completely white, some still grow back but slowly and much finer.&lt;br /&gt;I think if I use it for another year, it would be gone.</li>
            <li> Love it. But you have to follow the directions. You will notice a change. I&#x27;m still doing the treatment but it does work. My skin doesn&#x27;t burn afterwards like Nair did. It even works on the face. So if you have hirsutism then it&#x27;s really a blessing. It can sting a bit so wait a few minutes after the treatment to apply it and you have to massage it in to your skin. There&#x27;s no smell. It has a cooling affect. I love it. It can leave your hands sticky.</li>
            <li> Item arrived timely. Was purchased as a gift. Person I gave this as a present appears happy and have never complained or said anything good or bad. I can&#x27;t give an opinion of the lasting or quality feature.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all. A waste of time. It&#x27;s just sitting on my desk collecting dust and taking up space.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still wondering if this product would have worked, since I could not get past the smell to use it!</li>
            <li> This works well if you keep rubbing it in until it is almost dry.  I had horrible chin hair and have been using this for about a month and it there is much less hair on my chin.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t do the job as promoted,</li>
            <li> I am a 27 years old girl of Indian origin. I have had this problem of hirsutism since few years now due to PCOS. I have tried several methods of facial hair removal/hiding in the past - like shaving, waxing, bleach, laser hair removal. But in the long run, they increased my facial fair and made them thicker and blacker. This also increased ingrown hair on my face :(. I desperately wanted/want to get rid of them.&lt;br /&gt;Since about four weeks ago, I have started using this Skin Doctors Hair No More spray along with Oral Contraceptives Pills (I have been taking Pills for a year now). I am very happy with the results. Honestly, I did not expect anything (as I have used so many products in the past, and everything made it worse)....but this product is atleast working in the correct direction.&lt;br /&gt;Here are my observations :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The spray is water like with slightly citrous fragrance (Like Vinegar).&lt;br /&gt;2. If I applied it for a whole day/night...there was very little hair growth than usual during that time period and the hair were much finer.&lt;br /&gt;3. There is still the problem of ingrown hair, as I still wax my face, once in a week and a half and pluck the other times.&lt;br /&gt;4. Initially (As even the product says)...it is good to apply everyday, and I will see if I will need to use it less and lesser in the future. (I will keep you updated)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product, as I have never come across anything better than this for the problem of Hirsutism.It is not a overnight solution, but as I said earlier, it seems to be working in the direction in my case. It has made the hair growth slower and finer. Hopefully after few months of usage, I will be a happier person.  But hey girls, if u know any product better, please share. Sorry for all girls with the problem of hirsutism, its a nightmare. Hate it !!! Love u gals, and neva forget, u r so bful xxx</li>
            <li> I tried it for a while now and I&#x27;m not sure if this does what its suppose to. I haven&#x27;t really noticed any decrease in hair growth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a product like this since vaniqua is so expensive and needs an Rx. It seems to be working well.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any change after using this product for several weeks, even thought I followed all the instructions and used as directed.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a few months now on facial hair that I remove by plucking with tweezers. I can&#x27;t tell that much of a difference, there seems to be slightly less regrowth and I believe the hair is starting to grow in a little slower since I started using it. I follow the directions and I guess I had higher expectations. When the bottle is gone I will decide if I would buy it again, right now I can&#x27;t say that I would.&lt;br /&gt;It has a light, faint scent, it doesn&#x27;t irritate or burn when applying it, even if it is applied right after removing hair. It&#x27;s actually soothing on the skin and seems to be moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;*Update* I am updating after a few more months of use - it does work, there has been a significant reduction in the rate of regrowth. Very happy with this product now that I have been using it for months. It hasn&#x27;t completely stopped the regrowth, but has significantly reduced the hair. YAY! I also changed my rating from 3 stars to 4. 5 stars if it actually stopped ALL the hair, which I don&#x27;t even know if that&#x27;s possible.</li>
            <li> This product is about the same as other products on the market. I actually wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone that is looking for positive results. Years ago , I used a roll-on product, but can&#x27;t remember the exact name, was very inexpensive. Wish I could find it.</li>
