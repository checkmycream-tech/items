    <ol>
            <li>This product is awesome!!  </li>
            <li>and she thought it was wonderful to see that it was a shaved as well.</li>
            <li>Excellent.</li>
            <li>Totally a great product!!</li>
            <li>I thought this would be a great kit.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a great product</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>It works great for the price I would recommend</li>
            <li>It does however grasp the hair and just pull it lol..</li>
            <li>Worked great but died after two months of use.  </li>
            <li>I liked her work and excellent</li>
            <li>works great and it was delivered in a timely manner....</li>
            <li>Great purchase at a good price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase :)</li>
            <li>It is also a pain to clean!!!</li>
            <li>so I just plug in the charger and use it simultaneously which probably isn&#x27;t a good thing.</li>
            <li>the razor is good, but the epilator needs help.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t work that good</li>
            <li>do this will make a wonderful gift for a funny gift exchange</li>
            <li>And you can use it while it&#x27;s charging unlike many others!</li>
            <li>It has two speeds which is nice.</li>
            <li>The fact it has a battery and doesn&#x27;t have to be plugged in is nice.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>It removes hairs, but you have to roll it over your skin many times to get all of it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think you can get a functional epilator for a better price.</li>
            <li>I really love this epilator/shaver</li>
            <li>I admit it kinda hurts the most in your under arms</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect solution for unwanted hairs in embarrassing places, since you aren&#x27;t left with stubble .  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used much better epilators for the price of this unit.</li>
            <li>Save your money ladies and get a better epilator.  </li>
            <li>Waxing would be a better alternative than this piece of junk.</li>
            <li>but I had difficulty with the 2 pins on the top coming out of their place and almost falling out.</li>
            <li>and now I am out of funds I could have used on a better one.  </li>
            <li>Had my husband buy me a better one for my birthday üòâ</li>
            <li>Ô∏è love this..</li>
            <li>I completely love it.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with how long my hair has stayed gone.  </li>
            <li>This one is/was the cheapest and has been absolutely the best by far... and it even comes with a shaver, a brush and a buffer!</li>
            <li>The shaver head works fine.  </li>
            <li>It also looks feels really cheap and plastic.</li>
            <li>It honestly worked really really well.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get all the hair, TAKES FOREVER, definitely  cheap option to see if you are an epilator person</li>
            <li>It is very nice, and gentle, well about as gentle as an epilator can be.  </li>
            <li>I was still not sure about it since the brand wasn&#x27;t a household name like some of the others, but this epilator works great!  </li>
            <li>The light on the machine is a huge help, it makes sure you&#x27;re seeing really well</li>
            <li>I was excited  for this to arrive and to use this product.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this.</li>
            <li>It has not disappointed.</li>
            <li>so feel I have to have clean legs</li>
            <li>Thanks :)</li>
            <li>I can get ok results by using the clipper blade on the side, but the main part of the razor head doesn&#x27;t work at all for me.&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li>After getting over the initial shock of this thing pulling hair out (tweezing), she is very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>u gotta be a pain freak to use it down below lol</li>
            <li>For those new to epilating, buy a better model to start with or it may just turn you off of epilating which would be a shame.</li>
            <li>But I never had to replace my old-school epilator (which did hurt more than this new rotating head style).  </li>
            <li>compact size, lightweight, light, works while charging, rechargeable, travel pouch, fast speeds, detachable head for</li>
            <li>I would have rated this worth it if the pins had stayed in place</li>
            <li>maybe because it was my first time trying it</li>
            <li>The Lady remington ep 7010 is same price yet MUCH BETTER.</li>
            <li>My Phillips brand epilator, which I bought for about the same price a year ago, is a much better product.</li>
            <li>Loved it for the first few weeks.</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator I had reviewed many and took a chance on this one seeing as it only had 3 reviews at my time of purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through so many epilators of all different prices...</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled by the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I had to stop after just a couple of seconds, and can&#x27;t imagine using it for large areas.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be using it anymore, and I certainly don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to grip.&lt;br /&gt;There is a tiny spotlight on the on/off switch that really does help you to see where you may have missed</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s just too much for me.</li>
            <li>That may not be much of a concern for some people, but I can&#x27;t deal with that for long.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really, I can&#x27;t imagine using it on any area.  </li>
            <li>Reasonably priced, came with exfoliating sponge, charger, and a bag for storage .</li>
            <li>the red power light turns on so it is getting power.  </li>
            <li>The white light bulb comes on INBETWEEN the 2 settings, but turns off (instead of on) when it clicks into place.  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>, only reality is I have a razor with I pin left on the top with 1 pink foam piece and an epilator that misses many hairs when I use it.  </li>
            <li>Not worth the money you are better of tweezing the hairs off instead.</li>
            <li>And it shipped fast, comes in a cute pink little fabric bag with an instruction booklet (that you don&#x27;t really need because it&#x27;s so easy to use)</li>
            <li>You would do better with a pair of hand-held tweezers, plucking each hair individually, than trying to remove hair with this epilator.</li>
            <li>I had plans to purchase a more expensive epilator, but after reading the reviews (all were fantastic at the time I purchased)</li>
            <li>She said it works better than all the others she had in the past.</li>
            <li>My Mother is 94 years old and loves her new device.</li>
            <li>Every time I used it I would have to watch for the pins that held the pink foam on top in place slipping out.  </li>
            <li>it is so loud.  </li>
            <li>The results, therefore, last longer and your skin is much smoother.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just old.  </li>
            <li>First time purchasing an epilator and it missed tons of hair and  kept going over it super slowly.</li>
            <li>than to trust a cluster of reviews that were posted so close to the listing date for this epilator‚ÄîI wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they were written by relatives or employees who never actually used the product.</li>
            <li>I purchased this when the cord for my previous epilator started working only when held a certain way.</li>
            <li>My hair grows back pretty quickly and i got tired of shaving my legs every other day.</li>

            <li> than to trust a cluster of reviews that were posted so close to the listing date for this epilator‚ÄîI wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they were written by relatives or employees who never actually used the product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this when the cord for my previous epilator started working only when held a certain way.</li>
            <li> My hair grows back pretty quickly and i got tired of shaving my legs every other day.</li>
            <li> Hair should be long enough to be removed.</li>
            <li> Hovering over each individual hair, and zooming in, one at a time, sometimes removed the hair--after several tries.</li>
            <li> I only found 1 pink foam piece</li>
            <li> But not to long after I started to use it, it broke.</li>
            <li> She has been wanting this for a long time.</li>
            <li> I searched and found one had slipped down the drain and the other was near the bathtub!  </li>
            <li> I  eventually was in a rush and forgot to watch for the loose pins and out they came along with the 2 pink foam pieces flying somewhere in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> : loud unexpected kinda scared me, no guard from tweezers so at a bad angle you will feel the metal brush against your skin which does not snag but feels like a rug burn on sensitive areas</li>
            <li> often feel more painful to me than to other people so</li>
            <li> Extremely painful, leaves numerous bumps (which go away after a short period of time), and doesn&#x27;t exactly pull the hairs out unless you go over it thousands of times.</li>
            <li> It DOES hurt, but from what i&#x27;ve read of every other epilator on the market, they all do.</li>
            <li> I did my research thinking that maybe it was just a defect in my charger but turns out a lot of other people who have gotten this epilator</li>
            <li> I finally got tired of torturing myself back then &amp; threw it away.  </li>
            <li> Not worth getting this item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it ever pulled out a single hair.</li>
            <li> I used epilators in my twenties &amp; thirties, maybe that&#x27;s why I have less hair now.  </li>
            <li> and I got mine for half the price.  </li>
            <li> Rechargeable and comes with charger, epilator and electric razor heads, and a little bag to store it all.&lt;br /&gt;Turned</li>
            <li> The little pin gaurd thing in front of the tweezers kept falling out.</li>
            <li> I have to go over the ones left behind with a tweezer.</li>
            <li> And then I tried circular motions and It just wasn&#x27;t ripping out my hair waste of money</li>
            <li> The higher speed makes it less painful.</li>
            <li> but after a broken leg/ankle last summer, it is hard for me to shave in the shower now</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t charge it before using it</li>
            <li> Not sure I will ever shave my legs again.</li>
            <li> not really pleased with this device.  </li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> this is my first one ever,I was afraid to try it because the tweezers look a bit scary</li>
            <li> , I figured that at least I got an electric razor out of it, but that is pretty worthless.  </li>
            <li> Scrolling across the skin produced no results for me, no matter how slowly I moved, or how closely I pressed to the surface of my skin.</li>
            <li> and it is the least painful of all of the other ones i&#x27;ve had over the years...</li>
            <li> /&gt;The epilator hurt worse than I thought it would.  </li>
            <li> This product is useless as an epilator!</li>
            <li> but the shaver head came broken very very disappointed</li>
            <li> , again, it may not be so bad for others, but I can&#x27;t use it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> &amp; I wouldn&#x27;t need to write a bad review,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this because of how painful it is.</li>
            <li> this thing defiitely works but it&#x27;s painful as hell.</li>

            <li> Bought this a while back and it&#x27;s okay. It removes the hair if you go over the area a couple times but doesn&#x27;t get everything. I have to go over the ones left behind with a tweezer. Hair should be long enough to be removed. Not going to lie it hurts! It is also a pain to clean!!! T_T I usually don&#x27;t charge it before using it so I just plug in the charger and use it simultaneously which probably isn&#x27;t a good thing. Over all it works.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this because of how painful it is. It removes hairs, but you have to roll it over your skin many times to get all of it. That&#x27;s just too much for me. Keep skin taut when using this.</li>
            <li> this thing defiitely works but it&#x27;s painful as hell. once you get use to the pinches then its bearable. fyi... u gotta be a pain freak to use it down below lol ouchy!</li>
            <li> Not worth the money you are better of tweezing the hairs off instead. It also looks feels really cheap and plastic.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a great kit.  Rechargeable and comes with charger, epilator and electric razor heads, and a little bag to store it all.&lt;br /&gt;Turned it on, and it is so loud.  That may not be much of a concern for some people, but I can&#x27;t deal with that for long.&lt;br /&gt;The epilator hurt worse than I thought it would.  I had to stop after just a couple of seconds, and can&#x27;t imagine using it for large areas.  Really, I can&#x27;t imagine using it on any area.  I do have a nerve issue and things often feel more painful to me than to other people so, again, it may not be so bad for others, but I can&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;So, I figured that at least I got an electric razor out of it, but that is pretty worthless.  I can get ok results by using the clipper blade on the side, but the main part of the razor head doesn&#x27;t work at all for me.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very disappointed.  I won&#x27;t be using it anymore, and I certainly don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> My Mother is 94 years old and loves her new device. She said it works better than all the others she had in the past. The price was so low I was concerned about the quality. So far so good! Recommended!</li>
            <li> My hair grows back pretty quickly and i got tired of shaving my legs every other day. The way epilators work is that they pluck individual hairs (regular shaving just cuts them off at skin level). The results, therefore, last longer and your skin is much smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ivog Pro X-tweez is the only epilator I have used, but I find that it works quite well. It DOES hurt, but from what i&#x27;ve read of every other epilator on the market, they all do. Your hair is being plucked from the root, after all. But it also works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It is rechargeable.&lt;br /&gt;You can use it while it is plugged in, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about running out of battery.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to grip.&lt;br /&gt;There is a tiny spotlight on the on/off switch that really does help you to see where you may have missed hairs.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a head for shaving as well.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheap!&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t grab every hair in one sweep. You must go over each spot several times.&lt;br /&gt;It hurts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great product and I would repurchase it. I don&#x27;t think you can get a functional epilator for a better price.</li>
            <li> I really love this epilator/shaver this is my first one ever,I was afraid to try it because the tweezers look a bit scary idk maybe because it was my first time trying it lol I admit it kinda hurts the most in your under arms hopefully I an get used to it,bikini line and legs didn&#x27;t hurt at all. It works great for the price I would recommend</li>
            <li> It is very nice, and gentle, well about as gentle as an epilator can be.  Great purchase at a good price.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!!  I just wish I would&#x27;ve found it sooner.  It&#x27;s the perfect solution for unwanted hairs in embarrassing places, since you aren&#x27;t left with stubble .  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used much better epilators for the price of this unit. The Lady remington ep 7010 is same price yet MUCH BETTER. The IVog&lt;br /&gt;doesnt have nearly enough heads and when it does finally grasp a hair, it doesnt grasp the hair well enough to pull it out.  It does however grasp the hair and just pull it lol.. Save your money ladies and get a better epilator.  For those new to epilating, buy a better model to start with or it may just turn you off of epilating which would be a shame.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced, came with exfoliating sponge, charger, and a bag for storage . It has two speeds which is nice. It does the job! Not sure I will ever shave my legs again. The higher speed makes it less painful. And after a minute or two you get used to it.</li>
            <li> First time purchasing an epilator and it missed tons of hair and  kept going over it super slowly. And then I tried circular motions and It just wasn&#x27;t ripping out my hair waste of money but the shaver head came broken very very disappointed</li>
            <li> Extremely painful, leaves numerous bumps (which go away after a short period of time), and doesn&#x27;t exactly pull the hairs out unless you go over it thousands of times. And although it pulls some out, 1/4 of them are just clipped closely to the skin. Would NOT buy again, or recommend to anyone. Waxing would be a better alternative than this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> I purchased this when the cord for my previous epilator started working only when held a certain way. I had plans to purchase a more expensive epilator, but after reading the reviews (all were fantastic at the time I purchased) I figured I&#x27;d save a lot of money by going with this iVog instead. That was a mistake.  The fact it has a battery and doesn&#x27;t have to be plugged in is nice. The shaver head works fine.  The epilator, which was all I wanted, does nothing. I&#x27;m not sure it ever pulled out a single hair. After trying to use this product repeatedly with different hair lengths, I gave up and returned it. My Phillips brand epilator, which I bought for about the same price a year ago, is a much better product. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the positive reviews. This product is useless as an epilator!</li>
            <li> not really pleased with this device.  the razor is good, but the epilator needs help.  do this will make a wonderful gift for a funny gift exchange</li>
            <li> My wife loves it she had just the tweezers and she thought it was wonderful to see that it was a shaved as well.</li>
            <li> I have used this twice since it arrived.  Today I went to use it &amp; the red power light turns on so it is getting power.  But when I try to put it in either setting, nothing.  The white light bulb comes on INBETWEEN the 2 settings, but turns off (instead of on) when it clicks into place.  Can&#x27;t accidentally miss the setting notches. It was inexpensive, but not for only 2 uses.  I am 60 yo &amp; don&#x27;t have a lot of hair on my legs.  I used epilators in my twenties &amp; thirties, maybe that&#x27;s why I have less hair now.  Probably not.  I&#x27;m just old.  But I never had to replace my old-school epilator (which did hurt more than this new rotating head style).  I finally got tired of torturing myself back then &amp; threw it away.  I now go to the pool for exercise classes 3X each week so feel I have to have clean legs but after a broken leg/ankle last summer, it is hard for me to shave in the shower now so I thought I&#x27;d try this hair removal system again.&lt;br /&gt;  I tried to contact the company hoping they would replace it &amp; I wouldn&#x27;t need to write a bad review, but I found no way to do so.</li>
            <li> Loved it for the first few weeks. It honestly worked really really well. But after about two-three months, it wouldn&#x27;t charge anymore. And well if it&#x27;s not charging, then it obviously won&#x27;t be working. I did my research thinking that maybe it was just a defect in my charger but turns out a lot of other people who have gotten this epilator have the same issue around the same amount of time. I can&#x27;t even replace the charger because it isn&#x27;t sold separately any where else. :/</li>
            <li> Excellent. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Works well, but the guards seem to make it more difficult to reach hairs.</li>
            <li> I bought this based off it having some of the highest customer review scores.  I was still not sure about it since the brand wasn&#x27;t a household name like some of the others, but this epilator works great!  My sister has one from another brand and ours both work equally as well and I got mine for half the price.  I&#x27;m very happy with how long my hair has stayed gone.  The light on the machine is a huge help, it makes sure you&#x27;re seeing really well so you don&#x27;t miss any hairs.</li>
            <li> Worked great but died after two months of use.  Maybe I just got a dud?</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift.</li>
            <li> I was excited  for this to arrive and to use this product.  On my 1st use it seemed to work well but I had difficulty with the 2 pins on the top coming out of their place and almost falling out. Every time I used it I would have to watch for the pins that held the pink foam on top in place slipping out.  I  eventually was in a rush and forgot to watch for the loose pins and out they came along with the 2 pink foam pieces flying somewhere in the bathroom.  I searched and found one had slipped down the drain and the other was near the bathtub!  I only found 1 pink foam piece and now I don&#x27;t know what to do.  I would have rated this worth it if the pins had stayed in place, only reality is I have a razor with I pin left on the top with 1 pink foam piece and an epilator that misses many hairs when I use it.  Very disappointed in this product and now I am out of funds I could have used on a better one.  Not worth getting this item.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this. But not to long after I started to use it, it broke. The little pin gaurd thing in front of the tweezers kept falling out. I even had my husband glue it in for me. It also didn&#x27;t get alot of the hair either. Had my husband buy me a better one for my birthday üòâ</li>
            <li> I hated this product. It didn&#x27;t pull any hair out just broke it  I returned it</li>
            <li> I liked her work and excellent</li>
            <li> works great and it was delivered in a timely manner....thanks</li>
            <li> Everything was perfect‚ùóÔ∏è love this.. I am giving this as a gift to my niece.. She has been wanting this for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator I had reviewed many and took a chance on this one seeing as it only had 3 reviews at my time of purchase. It has not disappointed. It has all the features I was looking for at an affordable price and its cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: compact size, lightweight, light, works while charging, rechargeable, travel pouch, fast speeds, detachable head for razor&lt;br /&gt;Cons: loud unexpected kinda scared me, no guard from tweezers so at a bad angle you will feel the metal brush against your skin which does not snag but feels like a rug burn on sensitive areas</li>
            <li> than to trust a cluster of reviews that were posted so close to the listing date for this epilator‚ÄîI wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they were written by relatives or employees who never actually used the product. You would do better with a pair of hand-held tweezers, plucking each hair individually, than trying to remove hair with this epilator. Scrolling across the skin produced no results for me, no matter how slowly I moved, or how closely I pressed to the surface of my skin. Hovering over each individual hair, and zooming in, one at a time, sometimes removed the hair--after several tries. I‚Äôve been using an epilator (different brand) for six years, so I‚Äôm not a newbie‚ÄîI know how these things are supposed to work. I returned it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through so many epilators of all different prices... This one is/was the cheapest and has been absolutely the best by far... and it even comes with a shaver, a brush and a buffer! And you can use it while it&#x27;s charging unlike many others! I completely love it. And it shipped fast, comes in a cute pink little fabric bag with an instruction booklet (that you don&#x27;t really need because it&#x27;s so easy to use) and it is the least painful of all of the other ones i&#x27;ve had over the years... Totally a great product!! Thanks :)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get all the hair, TAKES FOREVER, definitely  cheap option to see if you are an epilator person but i&#x27;d rather recommend philips or brawn!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work that good</li>
            <li> Wife loves it.  After getting over the initial shock of this thing pulling hair out (tweezing), she is very pleased with the results.  Also enjoys chasing me around trying to tweeze my leg and arm hair.</li>
            <li> Pulls a lot and irritates some areas. Not what I was looking for.</li>
