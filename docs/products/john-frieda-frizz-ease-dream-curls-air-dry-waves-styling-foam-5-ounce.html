            <li>SO amazing.</li>
            <li>this one leaves me with tousled beachy non crunchy perfect waves all day - sometimes I even look reasonable the morning after......</li>
            <li>I am sure it is a good product, it just does not keep my curl intact.  </li>
            <li>Probably a good product for fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Dream Curls is the greatest and I use it daily...</li>
            <li>I like this product a lot more than I thought I would.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I subscribed to it.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s my favorite way to use it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It did ok.</li>
            <li>you will love this product too.</li>
            <li>but this isn&#x27;t my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Makes my fine hair slightly more curly than it would be without it.</li>
            <li>your hair and washes out easily and keeps your hair tangle</li>
            <li>My hair is fine textured, but I have a lot of it.</li>
            <li>I have fine, wavy hair.</li>
            <li>The product smells fresh and clean too.</li>
            <li>mostly just added volume which still looked decent.</li>
            <li>Put it in my hair after my shower and went to bed, when I woke up my hair was dry and looked amazing.  </li>
            <li>good by blowdryer and less $$ spend on hair spray too.....</li>
            <li>Product works well but can be found much cheaper elsewhere!</li>
            <li>Split hair in middle part and distribute three pumps per side from top of ear to ends</li>
            <li>I have tried every curl enhancement product out there - I have thick/course wavy hair that is not straight enough to look good without a blowout and not curly enough to look nice, all the other products were either crunchy or looked good at first but fell flat leaving me with &amp;#34;rats nest&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It looked very disheveled.</li>
            <li>I just work 3 pumps of this through my wet hair, along with some leave in conditioner and my hair is more curly than whirly.</li>
            <li>Not really very foamlike (not like mousse), but more foamy than liquid.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t hold the wave really,</li>
            <li>Somehow manages to make my wavy hair straight.</li>
            <li>This controls the frizz and really brings out the curl.</li>
            <li>With this product, it lays in loose curls all over and even looks great the second day after just running a wide-toothed comb through it the next morning.</li>
            <li>Use less then you think you need, and your hair will have nice soft waves/curls.</li>
            <li>My hair dries in perfect little curls with hardly any frizz.</li>
            <li>Most curly hair products weight it down or make it crunch.</li>
            <li>I love that it didn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff and crunchy like many of the other beach wave products.</li>
            <li>Makes my naturally wavy hair very defined, which it never is because I don&#x27;t use heat tools (blow dryer, curler, etc).</li>
            <li>My hair is not thick.</li>
            <li>I used the Dream curls on my hair, after air drying it a few days later, it really produced a much better result.</li>
            <li>This is definitely the new main ingredient in mine.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair soft, tames the frizz and keeps the wave/curl.</li>
            <li>My waves were soft and touchable after air drying.</li>
            <li>Squeeze as much moisture as possible</li>
            <li>I would recommend the regular Dream Curl Spray instead for finer textures that get weighed down easily.  </li>
            <li>I blow dry just near the scalp not the hanging hair.</li>
            <li>I am thinking this might work better for people with tight curls and thick hair.</li>

            <li> I leave my hair wet and by time I get to work</li>

            <li> This product helped my curly hair come back after a few weeks of straighting.</li>
            <li> I have really liked other JF products but this is worthless.</li>
            <li> Routinely flip head upside down and scrunch hair in five minute intervals until hair is dry</li>
            <li> (i.e., it did not clump together like it does with some other conditioning/taming products).</li>
            <li> I use it to revive my curls and tame frizz on dry hair.</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and not crunchy or hard at all, I&#x27;m not sure how it works</li>
            <li> Pricey and not worth it for my hair type.  </li>
            <li> but less than that...don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> My air-dry hair is definitely less frizzy than before.</li>
            <li> The trick is to drop your head upside down between your knees and scrunch it in your hair a little section at a time..</li>
            <li> No crunchiness and little or no frizz.</li>
            <li> To compare, I air dried my hair without this product a few days before trying the product.</li>
            <li> Without the Dream Curls product my hair air dried in uneven, sort of frizzy waves/curls.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product but it leaves my hair limp and sticky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried about 3 other brands and never liked the way my hair felt afterwards.</li>
            <li> My hair is curly and wavy but very thick and with this product it takes forever to dry.  </li>
            <li> It would probably work well for people with very tight curls...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll go to sleep as usual.</li>
            <li> so I decided to try this and was unhappy.  </li>
            <li> (blowdrying can make it frizz out badly, unless I decide to straighten it).</li>
            <li> , I look like I combed out a bad perm--very triangular hair (unless I spend the time to blow-dry every morning).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it gave me any waves :(</li>
            <li> This is the worst!</li>

            <li> I am always searching for good curly hair products.  I think Frizz Ease makes the best non-salon products.  Dream Curls is the greatest and I use it daily...so I decided to try this and was unhappy.  It doesn&#x27;t hold the curl.  It would probably work well for people with very tight curls...but less than that...don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> This works great! It leaves your hair soft, tames the frizz and keeps the wave/curl. My hair look beautiful. It&#x27;s meant to air-dry so I will use this in the summer and the cans of Frizz Ease in the winter so I can blow-dry my hair. I blow dry just near the scalp not the hanging hair. The trick is to drop your head upside down between your knees and scrunch it in your hair a little section at a time.. The next day you can spray with water, scrunch your hair and bring it all back. The best product I have found.</li>
            <li> Makes my naturally wavy hair very defined, which it never is because I don&#x27;t use heat tools (blow dryer, curler, etc). Will definitely continue to use this daily.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work, but it didn&#x27;t. It made my wavy hair crunchy and not soft. It looked very disheveled. I gave it to a friend and it didn&#x27;t work for her either.</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF IS AMAZING. My hair dries in perfect little curls with hardly any frizz. A must have for summer!!!</li>
            <li> I have wavy,frizzy hair.this product does what it says,my curls were more defined and looked and felt great.</li>
            <li> Use less then you think you need, and your hair will have nice soft waves/curls. No crunchiness and little or no frizz.</li>
            <li> Makes my fine hair slightly more curly than it would be without it. I&#x27;m not sure if I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it gave me any waves :(</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot more than I thought I would. I have wavy hair and need to blow it dry every day. I tried this product and it does wonders. I leave my hair wet and by time I get to work it looks great. I&#x27;m so glad I subscribed to it. My hair feels soft and not crunchy or hard at all, I&#x27;m not sure how it works but my hair stays curly all day.</li>
            <li> I have tried every curl enhancement product out there - I have thick/course wavy hair that is not straight enough to look good without a blowout and not curly enough to look nice, all the other products were either crunchy or looked good at first but fell flat leaving me with &amp;#34;rats nest&amp;#34; hair by the end of the day......this one leaves me with tousled beachy non crunchy perfect waves all day - sometimes I even look reasonable the morning after......good by blowdryer and less $$ spend on hair spray too.....Frizz Ease please let me know if you discontinue, I&#x27;ll buy all your stock so I can have enough to use until I die!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for my 2B curls. My hair is fine textured, but I have a lot of it. Most curly hair products weight it down or make it crunch. I just work 3 pumps of this through my wet hair, along with some leave in conditioner and my hair is more curly than whirly. My hair is soft and less frizzy. Every curly haired girl knows that you have to find the &amp;#34;cocktail&amp;#34; that works for you. This is definitely the new main ingredient in mine.</li>
            <li> Great product for retaining and defining curls. Works on damp or dry hair - oftentimes I use it to revive my curls and tame frizz on dry hair. I have 3A type curls. Not really very foamlike (not like mousse), but more foamy than liquid. Works great, smells good.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of John Frieda products, especially their Frizz Ease line. So, I was excited to try this product because my hair does best if I air dry my curly/wavy hair (blowdrying can make it frizz out badly, unless I decide to straighten it). Anyhow, this product worked well. To compare, I air dried my hair without this product a few days before trying the product. Without the Dream Curls product my hair air dried in uneven, sort of frizzy waves/curls. It also felt dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used the Dream curls on my hair, after air drying it a few days later, it really produced a much better result. My hair looked smoother and not frizzy. The waves/curls laid well and yet I still had good movement with my hair (i.e., it did not clump together like it does with some other conditioning/taming products). The product did enhance my waves/curls and my hair did not feel as dry as it does when I air dry it without this product. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love that it didn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff and crunchy like many of the other beach wave products. I&#x27;ve tried about 3 other brands and never liked the way my hair felt afterwards. My waves were soft and touchable after air drying. The product smells fresh and clean too.</li>
            <li> Product works well but can be found much cheaper elsewhere!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product to enhance my waves, without any crunch or grit. This product works perfectly. Here&#x27;s my favorite way to use it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Squeeze as much moisture as possible ut of damp hair&lt;br /&gt;2. Finger comb to detangle&lt;br /&gt;3. Split hair in middle part and distribute three pumps per side from top of ear to ends&lt;br /&gt;4. Routinely flip head upside down and scrunch hair in five minute intervals until hair is dry&lt;br /&gt;5. Make a very loose braid (so as not to ruin the waves).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I&#x27;ll go to sleep as usual. When I wake up I&#x27;ll have glorious beach waves minus the frizz and dryness that salt sprays give me. This product is so lightweight, I can&#x27;t feel it in my hair!</li>
            <li> This product helped my curly hair come back after a few weeks of straighting. It also keep my heat use to a minimum now!</li>
            <li> I have slightly wavy hair and was hoping this would help the curl hold when I don&#x27;t blow dry it straight. It did ok. Didn&#x27;t hold the wave really, mostly just added volume which still looked decent.</li>
            <li> Put it in my hair after my shower and went to bed, when I woke up my hair was dry and looked amazing.  LOVE this product!!!! Will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Disappointingly sticky… I can&#x27;t stand her products that make me want to wash my hands after touching my hair. Maybe this is just because my hair is waist long and I always have to &#x27;adjust&#x27; it when it&#x27;s loose.</li>
            <li> Gives you great curls.</li>
            <li> This is the best.  It actually does what it says it will do. Your hair stay in place with great waves.&lt;br /&gt;If you happen to fall asleep  you just finger comb your hair and you look great once again.  It does not clump up&lt;br /&gt;in your hair and washes out easily and keeps your hair tangle free.&lt;br /&gt;if you have curly hair you will love this product too.</li>
            <li> This is the worst! Somehow manages to make my wavy hair straight. Will never buy again. I have really liked other JF products but this is worthless.</li>
            <li> I have fine, wavy hair. When I air dry it, it just gets frizzy due to the humidity in Georgia. This controls the frizz and really brings out the curl. Love it!</li>
            <li> This will work for my days off.  I am sure it is a good product, it just does not keep my curl intact.  By the end of the day my hair is almost flat.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my hair.  Pricey and not worth it for my hair type.  I have long wavy to curly curls.  My hair is not thick. I would recommend the regular Dream Curl Spray instead for finer textures that get weighed down easily.  I am thinking this might work better for people with tight curls and thick hair.</li>
            <li> This product has CHANGED my life! I have wavy/frizzy hair and without this product, I look like I combed out a bad perm--very triangular hair (unless I spend the time to blow-dry every morning). With this product, it lays in loose curls all over and even looks great the second day after just running a wide-toothed comb through it the next morning. SO amazing.</li>
            <li> My air-dry hair is definitely less frizzy than before. I don&#x27;t have curls but helps with air-dry frizz a lot.</li>
            <li> Probably a good product for fine hair.  My hair is curly and wavy but very thick and with this product it takes forever to dry.  I use a lot of Frizz Ease products but this isn&#x27;t my favorite.  I still use it but have to use the hair dryer some as well.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product but it leaves my hair limp and sticky.</li>
