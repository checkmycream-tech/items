            <li>I love the way it feels so much better than a wash cloth.</li>
            <li>A brush with many uses.</li>
            <li>Now, I have all-in-one, very handy and gentle to my skin.</li>
            <li>Brush I purchased was exactly as it was described and more importantly I feel it was a great price.  </li>
            <li>What a clean feeling!  </li>
            <li>It was great for dry brushing and felt even more amazing using it in the shower.</li>
            <li>nice brush, useful, bought 2, gave one to my daughter, she loves hers also...</li>
            <li>This is nice, make feel you fresh, its what I was looking for,  </li>
            <li>My skin used to hurt after brushing it, but now I chose this bath brush and it actually feels good!</li>
            <li>the side with knobs falls off easily.</li>
            <li>Cleaning those hard-to-reach places was never been so easy</li>
            <li>I slept so good after using the brush highly recommend</li>
            <li>We used every day and we love the product is working specially for Celulitis</li>
            <li>It is very nicely made and I love the double sided feature.</li>
            <li>The product is really good and the customer service was also good  &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;I had mine for two weeks and the head broke off  exposing sharp nails.</li>
            <li>Having both massaging head and exfoliating side on one brush is awesome because it takes up less space in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>It has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Overall, great quality wood handle and bristles.</li>
            <li>Great for back scratching too, I just wish it was maybe 2 inches longer</li>
            <li>Thanks for a nice product.</li>
            <li>amazing brush very fuctional.  </li>
            <li>The rubbery side does a very nice job of massaging the back and adding a dash of zen to the morning ablations!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>and I have enjoyed it so much!  </li>
            <li>Bbelow is my original post.</li>
            <li>It measures a long 17 inches which is great</li>
            <li>I cant reach clean.</li>
            <li>This is by the far the most innovative product in beauty supplies.</li>
            <li>If you have a sensitive skin and needs better care then chose this brush!</li>
            <li>Believe it or not, it is also great for scrubbing the bath tub and sinks.</li>
            <li>I love this brush so much that I&#x27;ve recommended it to everyone I know.  </li>
            <li>(that&#x27;s a falsehood - I completely forgot about it in my own elderly way)</li>
            <li>I can finally reach all parts of my body and walk out of the bath with a nice, smooth and comfortable feeling.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve grown older, I&#x27;ve noticed the need to better care for myself.  </li>
            <li>and it is great for a massager when you cannot get somebody to give you that massage on the back that you really need...</li>
            <li>It came quickly</li>
            <li>I apply shower gel to the long stemmed bristles and give myself a good washing and ticklish massage,&lt;br /&gt;Cleanses without leaving residue or irritations and supposedly rids cellulite which I can&#x27;t say because I have none.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love my new brush.</li>
            <li>I saw a difference immediately the first time I used it!  </li>
            <li>The handle is strong and I like it, but I wish it were longer, I could reach more of my back if it were.  </li>
            <li>I love the 17&amp;#34; long handle that makes it so much easier to use... and the natural bristles feels great.</li>
            <li>But its very sturdy and both the brush and massaging sides  feel great on my dry itchy skin!</li>
            <li>Very good for washing and massaging your body, especially legs and back.</li>
            <li>I received this product complimentary in exchange for my unbiased review and opinion.</li>
            <li>just right</li>
            <li>I like this brush because it&#x27;s well made and with the right bath scrub</li>
            <li>but I would gladly pay full price for my next one.</li>
            <li>I do my own pedicures and then wash brush in hot water to rid cross-contamination and germs for the next use.</li>
            <li>This one arrives just soft enough to be comfortable as well as effective right from the start.  </li>
            <li>So, when I got the opportunity to review this long handled bath brush, I was kind of excited.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Feels amazing for dry brushing and massage.</li>
            <li>Nice handle length and comfortable but firm bristles.</li>
            <li>The brush has soft, but strong, bristles.  </li>
            <li>It actually felt really good on my skin, since it is made of natural fibers.</li>
            <li>this is a great brush, not too hard or soft and the massager on the opposite side is good for the hip area.  </li>
            <li>great for reaching those hard places for scratching and bathing.</li>
            <li>Those of you who&#x27;ve ever gotten a rotator cuff tear know that it makes reaching around to the back definitely challenging.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly the product that I have been looking for.</li>
            <li>Really disappointed...and the price just dropped a week after I bought it...great!</li>
            <li>I was able to get this during a recent promotion and boy</li>
            <li>The quality also feels good and not cheap or anything.</li>
            <li>easy to dry and keep clean.</li>
            <li>I really like the brush...not too rough, and really does make your skin feel better!</li>
            <li>the bristles were kind of pressed down when I got them</li>
            <li>First Ilike that the handle is so long: now I easily can rub my back plus the bristles of the brush feel very nice and soft but at the same time you can exfoliate and cleanse your skin.</li>
            <li>The brushes are gentle yet really exfoliate my whole body.  </li>
            <li>I like this so much</li>
            <li>It got here fast</li>
            <li>I also use this on my thighs as it really helps with the cellulite there too.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Itâ€™s so much softer and smoother.</li>
            <li>Its exfoliation property is very relaxing and soothing indeed.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Finally a brush that I can use to scrub my own back.  </li>
            <li>This bath brush is a good quality brush that has bristles that are firm but not harsh on the skin and works well as an exfoliator and skin cleanser.  </li>
            <li>This is highly recommended for anybody.</li>
            <li>I could really use a brush handle another inch or two in length to comfortably reach the middle of my back.</li>
            <li>looks ok, but a few things&lt;br</li>
            <li>This bath brush has definitely been helpful in getting read of a build-up of cellulite, and not only that, but it is quite comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are soft enough where it does not irritate my skin but strong enough to exfoliate.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft and new.</li>
            <li>I love the massaging side of this brush, after a long day I would massage my back in the hot shower giving me that extra help to relax and get rid of the neck and back pain from the day.</li>
            <li>I love that the handle is long enough to reach my back</li>
            <li>I can clean my back easy and those hard to reach places too!  </li>
            <li>Overall I really like the quality and sturdy feel.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive, and this does not irritate my skin at all.  </li>
            <li>the bristles are really soft but not too soft feels</li>
            <li>It leaves my body leaving extremely soft and glowing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The handle is sturdy, the bristles seem to be well-secured, and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the brush thus far.  </li>
            <li>The brush is soft but still feels that it is doing the job.  </li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:417d4f2f92c391adfd554d5a4eecfe5d]]I do not take baths very often, showers daily.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and long enough to catch the spots on your back</li>
            <li>This brush works really well on dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>so, thanks to its long handle.</li>
            <li>Finally got around to looking for a new brush, saw this one, and ordered it.  </li>
            <li>It helps to tone and tighten my skin while helping to make it smooth and soft by removing all the dry dead skin.</li>
            <li>The bristles are firm enough to make your skin feel clean, but soft enough to make your skin feel refreshed.</li>
            <li>My fiance&#x27; tried the bristle side to wash his back and said it felt good, not too hard but firm</li>
            <li>The handle is even longer than I expected, whish is very convenient.</li>
            <li>The longer handle makes it easy to reach those hard to get to places on my back...</li>
            <li>brush works as well as any standard natural bristled brush, although it has the &amp;#34;bonus&amp;#34; side with wooden nubbins too.  </li>
            <li>I use it to exfoliate my entire body to get all the dead cells off after soaking my body in hot water.</li>
            <li>handle not long enough</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love this brush.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting better finish, but this gets the job done I guess.</li>
            <li> The huge plus for me was the cellulite fighter side of the brush: it feels so nice</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more convenient that way.</li>
            <li> This product is the perfect answer to my variety and bulky bath needs like the towelette for my face and back, loofah for my arms and legs and manicure brush for my soles.</li>
            <li> I love it...</li>
            <li> Love this brush.  </li>
            <li> I love a good back and body brush and this is a great one for the price.</li>
            <li> love that.</li>
            <li> This is the very best back brush that I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Extremely pleased with the quality of the brush.</li>
            <li> And it has a dual side to use as well that is a cellulite fighter for those legs and love handles</li>
            <li> it from me :-)</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I absolutely love this bath brush.</li>
            <li> I have some mosquito bites that I was able to use it&#x27;s brush on that relived the itching with out damaging the skin.</li>
            <li> The description was really appealing plus, thereâ€™s a money-back guarantee so</li>
            <li> I just love how my skin feels after using this brush.</li>
            <li> I love the quality of the bristles.</li>
            <li> They answered my questions in a timely manner &amp; made sure I was pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels so much better than a wash cloth.</li>
            <li> A brush with many uses.</li>
            <li> Now, I have all-in-one, very handy and gentle to my skin.</li>
            <li> Brush I purchased was exactly as it was described and more importantly I feel it was a great price.  </li>
            <li> What a clean feeling!  </li>
            <li> It was great for dry brushing and felt even more amazing using it in the shower.</li>
            <li> nice brush, useful, bought 2, gave one to my daughter, she loves hers also...</li>
            <li> This is nice, make feel you fresh, its what I was looking for,  </li>
            <li> My skin used to hurt after brushing it, but now I chose this bath brush and it actually feels good!</li>
            <li> the side with knobs falls off easily.</li>
            <li> Cleaning those hard-to-reach places was never been so easy</li>
            <li> I slept so good after using the brush highly recommend</li>
            <li> We used every day and we love the product is working specially for Celulitis</li>
            <li> It is very nicely made and I love the double sided feature.</li>
            <li> The product is really good and the customer service was also good  &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;I had mine for two weeks and the head broke off  exposing sharp nails.</li>
            <li> Having both massaging head and exfoliating side on one brush is awesome because it takes up less space in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> It has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Overall, great quality wood handle and bristles.</li>
            <li> Great for back scratching too, I just wish it was maybe 2 inches longer</li>
            <li> Thanks for a nice product.</li>
            <li> amazing brush very fuctional.  </li>
            <li> The rubbery side does a very nice job of massaging the back and adding a dash of zen to the morning ablations!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> and I have enjoyed it so much!  </li>
            <li> Bbelow is my original post.</li>
            <li> It measures a long 17 inches which is great</li>
            <li> I cant reach clean.</li>
            <li> This is by the far the most innovative product in beauty supplies.</li>
            <li> If you have a sensitive skin and needs better care then chose this brush!</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, it is also great for scrubbing the bath tub and sinks.</li>
            <li> I love this brush so much that I&#x27;ve recommended it to everyone I know.  </li>
            <li> (that&#x27;s a falsehood - I completely forgot about it in my own elderly way)</li>
            <li> I can finally reach all parts of my body and walk out of the bath with a nice, smooth and comfortable feeling.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve grown older, I&#x27;ve noticed the need to better care for myself.  </li>
            <li> and it is great for a massager when you cannot get somebody to give you that massage on the back that you really need...</li>
            <li> It came quickly</li>
            <li> I apply shower gel to the long stemmed bristles and give myself a good washing and ticklish massage,&lt;br /&gt;Cleanses without leaving residue or irritations and supposedly rids cellulite which I can&#x27;t say because I have none.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love my new brush.</li>
            <li> I saw a difference immediately the first time I used it!  </li>
            <li> The handle is strong and I like it, but I wish it were longer, I could reach more of my back if it were.  </li>
            <li> I love the 17&amp;#34; long handle that makes it so much easier to use... and the natural bristles feels great.</li>
            <li> But its very sturdy and both the brush and massaging sides  feel great on my dry itchy skin!</li>
            <li> Very good for washing and massaging your body, especially legs and back.</li>
            <li> I received this product complimentary in exchange for my unbiased review and opinion.</li>
            <li> just right</li>
            <li> I like this brush because it&#x27;s well made and with the right bath scrub</li>
            <li> but I would gladly pay full price for my next one.</li>
            <li> I do my own pedicures and then wash brush in hot water to rid cross-contamination and germs for the next use.</li>
            <li> This one arrives just soft enough to be comfortable as well as effective right from the start.  </li>
            <li> So, when I got the opportunity to review this long handled bath brush, I was kind of excited.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Feels amazing for dry brushing and massage.</li>
            <li> Nice handle length and comfortable but firm bristles.</li>
            <li> The brush has soft, but strong, bristles.  </li>
            <li> It actually felt really good on my skin, since it is made of natural fibers.</li>
            <li> this is a great brush, not too hard or soft and the massager on the opposite side is good for the hip area.  </li>
            <li> great for reaching those hard places for scratching and bathing.</li>
            <li> Those of you who&#x27;ve ever gotten a rotator cuff tear know that it makes reaching around to the back definitely challenging.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly the product that I have been looking for.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed...and the price just dropped a week after I bought it...great!</li>
            <li> I was able to get this during a recent promotion and boy</li>
            <li> The quality also feels good and not cheap or anything.</li>
            <li> easy to dry and keep clean.</li>
            <li> I really like the brush...not too rough, and really does make your skin feel better!</li>
            <li> the bristles were kind of pressed down when I got them</li>
            <li> First Ilike that the handle is so long: now I easily can rub my back plus the bristles of the brush feel very nice and soft but at the same time you can exfoliate and cleanse your skin.</li>
            <li> The brushes are gentle yet really exfoliate my whole body.  </li>
            <li> I like this so much</li>
            <li> It got here fast</li>
            <li> I also use this on my thighs as it really helps with the cellulite there too.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Itâ€™s so much softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> Its exfoliation property is very relaxing and soothing indeed.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> Finally a brush that I can use to scrub my own back.  </li>
            <li> This bath brush is a good quality brush that has bristles that are firm but not harsh on the skin and works well as an exfoliator and skin cleanser.  </li>
            <li> This is highly recommended for anybody.</li>
            <li> I could really use a brush handle another inch or two in length to comfortably reach the middle of my back.</li>
            <li> looks ok, but a few things&lt;br</li>
            <li> This bath brush has definitely been helpful in getting read of a build-up of cellulite, and not only that, but it is quite comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are soft enough where it does not irritate my skin but strong enough to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel soft and new.</li>
            <li> I love the massaging side of this brush, after a long day I would massage my back in the hot shower giving me that extra help to relax and get rid of the neck and back pain from the day.</li>
            <li> I love that the handle is long enough to reach my back</li>
            <li> I can clean my back easy and those hard to reach places too!  </li>
            <li> Overall I really like the quality and sturdy feel.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive, and this does not irritate my skin at all.  </li>
            <li> the bristles are really soft but not too soft feels</li>
            <li> It leaves my body leaving extremely soft and glowing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The handle is sturdy, the bristles seem to be well-secured, and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the brush thus far.  </li>
            <li> The brush is soft but still feels that it is doing the job.  </li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:417d4f2f92c391adfd554d5a4eecfe5d]]I do not take baths very often, showers daily.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and long enough to catch the spots on your back</li>
            <li> This brush works really well on dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> so, thanks to its long handle.</li>
            <li> Finally got around to looking for a new brush, saw this one, and ordered it.  </li>
            <li> It helps to tone and tighten my skin while helping to make it smooth and soft by removing all the dry dead skin.</li>
            <li> The bristles are firm enough to make your skin feel clean, but soft enough to make your skin feel refreshed.</li>
            <li> My fiance&#x27; tried the bristle side to wash his back and said it felt good, not too hard but firm</li>
            <li> The handle is even longer than I expected, whish is very convenient.</li>
            <li> The longer handle makes it easy to reach those hard to get to places on my back...</li>
            <li> brush works as well as any standard natural bristled brush, although it has the &amp;#34;bonus&amp;#34; side with wooden nubbins too.  </li>
            <li> I use it to exfoliate my entire body to get all the dead cells off after soaking my body in hot water.</li>
            <li> handle not long enough</li>
            <li> On and tall people take note: I&#x27;m over 5&#x27;11 so having a long bath brush is important for me, and this sucker is 17&#x27;&#x27; long!</li>
            <li> I used the natural bristle side, primarily as a dry brush before showering (to remove dry skin and exfoliate).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The side with the small wooden nubs we don&#x27;t really use but seems to be well made.  </li>
            <li> but I saw exactly the same in CVS for less cost, maybe a half price</li>
            <li> The handle is long enough.</li>
            <li> And the brush is well made and will surely last for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is sturdy and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> The brush that I received only counted as 17&amp;#34; long if you included the string at the end of the handle.  </li>
            <li> During my last move, my old trusty bath brush went missing.  </li>
            <li> I started using it on my back where my skin is very dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> I will update my review with any long term use observations in terms of durability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Long handle brush reaches all areas of my body.</li>
            <li> Not only does it wash your back, it also has rows of rubbery little knobs on the reverse of the brush itself.  </li>
            <li> It has a soft brush and a massaging bristle on a 17 inches length handle, it can reach the back skin that I always had the hard time scrubbing using the towelette or the loofah.</li>
            <li> I use it weekly to help with dry skin before showering</li>
            <li> i use mine for dry brushing every morning.</li>
            <li> Dry brushing has changed my life.</li>
            <li> I can exfoliate my dry skin and get rid of callus on my feet.</li>
            <li> which I normally had a hard time doing.</li>
            <li> Long handle for short armed people like me who cant reach the small of their back.</li>
            <li> that have the handle and the head of the brush made into two pieces that over time come loose and fall off.  </li>
            <li> I thought maybe if I start using whatever is loose will fall out and the rest will stay...</li>
            <li> It works well to clean my skin and remove my icky dead skin that somehow survived our harsh winter.  </li>
            <li> The handle is also long enough to reach areas on my back that is hard to reach allowing me to scrub and exfoliate the ignored areas.</li>
            <li> It can also use as brush to remove calluses and dead skin on legs and sole, and elbows.</li>
            <li> Three holes were already empty when I unpacked it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it 3 days and 5 holes are already empty.</li>
            <li> The brush head (wood) was split and the finish was rough.  </li>
            <li> The bristle stay a bit stiff so it scratches and cleans your back well.</li>
            <li> so I can use it one other parts of my body.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it was ever glued well enough</li>
            <li> Long handle makes it convenient and the bristles are firm but not scratching</li>
            <li> Bristle area is too small and handle is too short.</li>
            <li> you can also flip the brush other and use it as a massager.</li>
            <li> You can use it for dry skin brushing to to remove dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other natural bristle bath brushes that started out too harsh and had to be broken in.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are not too hard and don&#x27;t scratch the skin during the dry massage.</li>
            <li> Bristles are somewhat abrasive, and you can put a little liquid soap on the bristles to soften them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy and the nubbies on the reverse side of the brush helped my sore neck and shoulders.  </li>
            <li> its either they are bulky or harsh on skin.</li>
            <li> I hope to see a difference with cellulite I have been using it everyday for almost a month.</li>
            <li> The bristles are firm but not too stiff.</li>
            <li> The one small issue is that I wish the brush head were a bit wider as I think it is a bit narrow and prefer a wider brush head.  </li>
            <li> Face towels or loofah are the common products we use to help us remove dead skins and dirt on our skin but</li>
            <li> Upon using once alot of the bristles fell off of my brush, not sure if just a defective product or what.</li>
            <li> No more irritated skin.</li>
            <li> Makes cleaning those hard to get to places easier.</li>
            <li> It was late in arriving</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive, and I hate using brush on my skin.</li>
            <li> Ohio winters are really bad on my skin but despite that, you have to exfoliate which sometimes, frankly, sucks.</li>
            <li> but recently I got a nasty rotator cuff tear.  </li>
            <li> and it exfolicates all that nasty skin that you need to get rid of everyday...</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this bath brush.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Really nice bath brush.  Great customer sevice</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  It&#x27;s not too heavy and the nubbies on the reverse side of the brush helped my sore neck and shoulders.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this bath brush.</li>
            <li> Finally a brush that I can use to scrub my own back.  I love this brush so much that I&#x27;ve recommended it to everyone I know.  It works well to clean my skin and remove my icky dead skin that somehow survived our harsh winter.  I recommend this brush to anyone.  It&#x27;s quality made and the length is perfect for all users.  I received this brush at a reduced price but I would gladly pay full price for my next one.</li>
            <li> I slept so good after using the brush highly recommend</li>
            <li> The bristles are firm enough to make your skin feel clean, but soft enough to make your skin feel refreshed. I like this so much I&#x27;m going to order the hand one so I can use it one other parts of my body.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve grown older, I&#x27;ve noticed the need to better care for myself.  This bath brush has definitely been helpful in getting read of a build-up of cellulite, and not only that, but it is quite comfortable to use.  I am also always looking for natural products, and this fits the bill perfectly.  At such a good price, it is a perfect buy!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for the perfect bath brush this is it! This is my favorite thing in my tube! The bristles are soft enough where it does not irritate my skin but strong enough to exfoliate. I love the massaging side of this brush, after a long day I would massage my back in the hot shower giving me that extra help to relax and get rid of the neck and back pain from the day. The handle is also long enough to reach areas on my back that is hard to reach allowing me to scrub and exfoliate the ignored areas.</li>
            <li> Love this brush.  I use it weekly to help with dry skin before showering</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:cb751e4aecbb3598a9d99e4c744a4195]] This bath brush is a good quality brush that has bristles that are firm but not harsh on the skin and works well as an exfoliator and skin cleanser.  The bristles are solidly in the brush and did not come out after use and even when I pulled them stayed solidly in the brush.  It has a nice reach at 17 inches and is well made.  The one thing we like about it in our household is how it is made in one piece unlike others we have had that have the handle and the head of the brush made into two pieces that over time come loose and fall off.  The one small issue is that I wish the brush head were a bit wider as I think it is a bit narrow and prefer a wider brush head.  The side with the small wooden nubs we don&#x27;t really use but seems to be well made.  I will update my review with any long term use observations in terms of durability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.5 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great Brush, nice and sturdy</li>
            <li> I found a VERY similar looking one at CVS for $6.99. I works well. The handle is long enough.</li>
            <li> looks ok, but a few things&lt;br /&gt;1. the side with knobs falls off easily. I am not sure if it was ever glued well enough&lt;br /&gt;2. the bristles were kind of pressed down when I got them&lt;br /&gt;3. the wood had some splinters, a sign of not so perfect polishing of the wood&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting better finish, but this gets the job done I guess.</li>
            <li> During my last move, my old trusty bath brush went missing.  I kept putting off replacing it (that&#x27;s a falsehood - I completely forgot about it in my own elderly way) but recently I got a nasty rotator cuff tear.  Those of you who&#x27;ve ever gotten a rotator cuff tear know that it makes reaching around to the back definitely challenging.  Finally got around to looking for a new brush, saw this one, and ordered it.  It got here fast and I tried it the next day.  This brush is talented!  Not only does it wash your back, it also has rows of rubbery little knobs on the reverse of the brush itself.  The rubbery side does a very nice job of massaging the back and adding a dash of zen to the morning ablations!</li>
            <li> Long handle makes it convenient and the bristles are firm but not scratching</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this bath brush. First Ilike that the handle is so long: now I easily can rub my back plus the bristles of the brush feel very nice and soft but at the same time you can exfoliate and cleanse your skin. The huge plus for me was the cellulite fighter side of the brush: it feels so nice and I like the fact that I&#x27;m using it in the shower for me it&#x27;s more convenient that way. And the brush is well made and will surely last for a long time. Love it!</li>
            <li> Great brush/bristles, great quality, but for my build (6&#x27;, 195 lbs) I could really use a brush handle another inch or two in length to comfortably reach the middle of my back.</li>
            <li> Great brush, good quality.</li>
            <li> I really like the brush...not too rough, and really does make your skin feel better!</li>
            <li> Everything was as described and promised. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This brush is great. I tried out the massaging end on my back and it felt so good with some soap. My fiance&#x27; tried the bristle side to wash his back and said it felt good, not too hard but firm and he also uses it occasionally to scratch his back (men!). Overall, great quality wood handle and bristles. None have come off from what I have seen. Easy to use and long enough to catch the spots on your back that your arms can&#x27;t reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> These bristles are perfect from day one.  I&#x27;ve had other natural bristle bath brushes that started out too harsh and had to be broken in.  This one arrives just soft enough to be comfortable as well as effective right from the start.  Great bath brush.</li>
            <li> Love this brush, it fits in your hand perfectly. Great for back scratching too, I just wish it was maybe 2 inches longer and it would be a 5</li>
            <li> This is exactly the product that I have been looking for. Face towels or loofah are the common products we use to help us remove dead skins and dirt on our skin but its either they are bulky or harsh on skin. This Bath Brush is perfect! It has a soft brush and a massaging bristle on a 17 inches length handle, it can reach the back skin that I always had the hard time scrubbing using the towelette or the loofah. It can also use as brush to remove calluses and dead skin on legs and sole, and elbows. The massaging bristle is heavenly, I can feel my muscles loosening and relaxing. This product is the perfect answer to my variety and bulky bath needs like the towelette for my face and back, loofah for my arms and legs and manicure brush for my soles. Now, I have all-in-one, very handy and gentle to my skin. Perfect gift for my family and friends to. I will definitely buy again for them.</li>
            <li> This bath brush truly does deliver spa results... I have used brushes here and there but they always falls apart.  This is sturdy and long lasting.  The brushes are gentle yet really exfoliate my whole body.  I saw a difference immediately the first time I used it!  I love it...excellent quality and results.</li>
            <li> Long handle brush reaches all areas of my body. Bristles are somewhat abrasive, and you can put a little liquid soap on the bristles to soften them. Overall I really like the quality and sturdy feel.</li>
            <li> Bristles falling out while unpacking. Three holes were already empty when I unpacked it. I thought maybe if I start using whatever is loose will fall out and the rest will stay...I&#x27;ve used it 3 days and 5 holes are already empty. Really disappointed...and the price just dropped a week after I bought it...great!</li>
            <li> this is a great brush, not too hard or soft and the massager on the opposite side is good for the hip area.  i use mine for dry brushing every morning.</li>
            <li> What a clean feeling!  Love this brush.  I was able to get this during a recent promotion and boy do I love it!  I can clean my back easy and those hard to reach places too!  My kids want one because they know how much I love mine!</li>
            <li> I like it, the only thing I wish was that the handle was flexible instead of wood. But its very sturdy and both the brush and massaging sides  feel great on my dry itchy skin!</li>
            <li> nice brush, useful, bought 2, gave one to my daughter, she loves hers also...good purchase.  Use it in shower and for &amp;#34;dry brushing &amp;#34; my kin which has specific health value....Thanks for a nice product.</li>
            <li> Great quality product! Great service!</li>
            <li> I ordered this item twice, and both times I received a brush that was different from this picture and description.  The brush that I received only counted as 17&amp;#34; long if you included the string at the end of the handle.  The handle was inserted into the brush head and the brush was glued on crookedly.  I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great brush. The bristles are not too hard and don&#x27;t scratch the skin during the dry massage.</li>
            <li> Bristle area is too small and handle is too short.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush. Nice handle length and comfortable but firm bristles. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love a good back and body brush and this is a great one for the price. the fact that is has a 17&amp;#34; wood handle was the selling point for me. The longer handle makes it easy to reach those hard to get to places on my back...love that. Also the bristles for well with my soap to provide a great lather. you can also flip the brush other and use it as a massager. It helps to tone and tighten my skin while helping to make it smooth and soft by removing all the dry dead skin.</li>
            <li> This is nice, make feel you fresh, its what I was looking for,  but I saw exactly the same in CVS for less cost, maybe a half price</li>
            <li> The bristle stay a bit stiff so it scratches and cleans your back well.</li>
            <li> Upon using once alot of the bristles fell off of my brush, not sure if just a defective product or what.</li>
            <li> The brush has soft, but strong, bristles.  Very good.  The handle is strong and I like it, but I wish it were longer, I could reach more of my back if it were.  All-in-all, it&#x27;s an excelent brush!</li>
            <li> We used every day and we love the product is working specially for Celulitis</li>
            <li> This is the very best back brush that I have ever owned. Extremely pleased with the quality of the brush. The company seems to be great as well.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush to on my cellulite that I get on my buttocks.I also use this on my thighs as it really helps with the cellulite there too. It helps me keep my places I cant reach clean. It feels great on my skin does not hurt. I really like it.</li>
            <li> Finally, I can get full-body exfoliation without going to the spa for a body scrub.  This brush is wonderful, effective, and it does not hurt even when applying a decent amount of pressure. My skin is sensitive, and this does not irritate my skin at all.  It makes my skin feel soft and new. This brush is the most effective way I know to exfoliate and control cellulite!</li>
            <li> If you have a sensitive skin and needs better care then chose this brush! I have never seen something like that before! My skin used to hurt after brushing it, but now I chose this bath brush and it actually feels good! The quality also feels good and not cheap or anything. I bought one for me and am thinking about buying some for my family, since I was so impressed from the first testing! I can finally reach all parts of my body and walk out of the bath with a nice, smooth and comfortable feeling. Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> I love the 17&amp;#34; long handle that makes it so much easier to use... and the natural bristles feels great. Makes cleaning those hard to get to places easier. And it has a dual side to use as well that is a cellulite fighter for those legs and love handles and it is great for a massager when you cannot get somebody to give you that massage on the back that you really need... the bristles are really soft but not too soft feels just right and it exfolicates all that nasty skin that you need to get rid of everyday... would recommend it to anybody looking for a shower brush. Received these discounted for unbiased review</li>
            <li> Great shower brush. My husband loves it and keep &amp;#34;stealing&amp;#34; it from me :-) It is very nicely made and I love the double sided feature.</li>
            <li> The brush head (wood) was split and the finish was rough.  I returned it to Amazon for credit.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I absolutely love this bath brush. I use it to exfoliate my entire body to get all the dead cells off after soaking my body in hot water. It leaves my body leaving extremely soft and glowing. I love that the handle is long enough to reach my back which I normally had a hard time doing. This is highly recommended for anybody. Believe it or not, it is also great for scrubbing the bath tub and sinks. &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This brush works really well on dry, sensitive skin. I started using it on my back where my skin is very dry and itchy. It has made a huge difference. No more irritated skin. Will be a forever user of this brush!</li>
            <li> amazing brush very fuctional.  Dry brushing has changed my life.</li>
            <li> I have a bath brush with a removable handle, but it seemed to be always falling off.  So, when I got the opportunity to review this long handled bath brush, I was kind of excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush works as well as any standard natural bristled brush, although it has the &amp;#34;bonus&amp;#34; side with wooden nubbins too.  I used the natural bristle side, primarily as a dry brush before showering (to remove dry skin and exfoliate).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is sturdy, the bristles seem to be well-secured, and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the brush thus far.  If that changes, I&#x27;ll post an update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received this product gratis in exchange for an honest evaluation. The opinions expressed are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Very wonderful product and will buy from him once again</li>
            <li> The brush is soft but still feels that it is doing the job.  It came quickly and I have enjoyed it so much!  I have some mosquito bites that I was able to use it&#x27;s brush on that relived the itching with out damaging the skin.</li>
            <li> I really loved the brush. It is everything I wanted. Very good for washing and massaging your body, especially legs and back. The handle is even longer than I expected, whish is very convenient.</li>
            <li> Bbelow is my original post. However the company reached out to me and sent me a brand-new brush within a week. The product is really good and the customer service was also good  &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;I had mine for two weeks and the head broke off  exposing sharp nails. It was great while it was in one piece</li>
            <li> returned it.  handle not long enough</li>
            <li> I am totally impressed with this product. My skin is very sensitive, and I hate using brush on my skin. This one however, is really different. The description was really appealing plus, thereâ€™s a money-back guarantee so, I ordered one for myself. And, I am very pleased with it. It actually felt really good on my skin, since it is made of natural fibers. Cleaning those hard-to-reach places was never been so easy so, thanks to its long handle. I just love how my skin feels after using this brush. Itâ€™s so much softer and smoother. Its exfoliation property is very relaxing and soothing indeed.  This is just amazing.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! I love the quality of the bristles. Feels amazing for dry brushing and massage. Perfect for lymphatic draining and exfoliation. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Ohio winters are really bad on my skin but despite that, you have to exfoliate which sometimes, frankly, sucks. I like this brush because it&#x27;s well made and with the right bath scrub, I&#x27;m having a spa-like experience especially with the massaging side. Having both massaging head and exfoliating side on one brush is awesome because it takes up less space in my bathroom. It says its for reducing cellulite and water retention, but it just feels great too! On and tall people take note: I&#x27;m over 5&#x27;11 so having a long bath brush is important for me, and this sucker is 17&#x27;&#x27; long! It works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Brush I purchased was exactly as it was described and more importantly I feel it was a great price.  I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> The brush is wonderful.  It was late in arriving but I was notified and I wasn&#x27;t in a hurry.  I really like this product.  It is as advertised.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush! It was great for dry brushing and felt even more amazing using it in the shower. The bristles are firm but not too stiff. But the customer service was the BEST part of my purchase. They answered my questions in a timely manner &amp; made sure I was pleased with my purchase. I will definitely purchase from this company again!</li>
            <li> This is by the far the most innovative product in beauty supplies. Two sided bristles to capture each part of your body from the oiliest skin to the driest. I can exfoliate my dry skin and get rid of callus on my feet. I do my own pedicures and then wash brush in hot water to rid cross-contamination and germs for the next use. Long handle for short armed people like me who cant reach the small of their back. I apply shower gel to the long stemmed bristles and give myself a good washing and ticklish massage,&lt;br /&gt;Cleanses without leaving residue or irritations and supposedly rids cellulite which I can&#x27;t say because I have none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would consider buying a brush for each member of the family because I like keeping my own stuff for my own usage.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:417d4f2f92c391adfd554d5a4eecfe5d]]I do not take baths very often, showers daily. I love my new brush. I lather it with my body cleanser and I am able to clean everywhere !!! I love the way it feels so much better than a wash cloth. I like the cellulite massage it makes your skin feel nice and refreshed.  You can use it for dry skin brushing to to remove dead skin cells. A brush with many uses. It measures a long 17 inches which is great so you do not have to bend and stretch to reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Bath and Body Brush helps you effectively cleanse and ex foliate. I hope to see a difference with cellulite I have been using it everyday for almost a month. I received this product complimentary in exchange for my unbiased review and opinion. All words and opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> love love love this! great for reaching those hard places for scratching and bathing. easy to dry and keep clean. I can&#x27;t shower without my exfoliating brush!</li>
