            <li>Perfect fit.</li>
            <li>34;too good to be true&amp;#34</li>
            <li>hope my review will give some who&#x27;s struggling to find a comfortable mask, to find one made perfectly as the Resmed AirFit P10!</li>

            <li>very satisfied customer, thankyou</li>
            <li>They work great, I am glad I ordered them.</li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted at a great price!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t fit perfectly for my machine, but I worked it out and is a good fit.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I wanted, the delivery was perfectly on time and it was very easy to install it.</li>
            <li>but they appear to be the genuine Resmed produst, great value.</li>
            <li>Excellent product and much cheaper than purchasing from the specialty store in which I got the CPAP.</li>
            <li>This was excellent finding this one at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Excellent in every way and so much cheaper than buying through the company.</li>
            <li>Great product, easy to put together and very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Perfect medium replacement older ResMed Swift assembly</li>
            <li>Very good service at reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>The nurses recommended trying a nasal pillow, and the ResMed was the what they claimed was most popular.  </li>
            <li>Works just fine &amp;#34;For Him&amp;#34; too!</li>
            <li>But even at that, it&#x27;s very comfortable.</li>
            <li>it is the easiest to use for me very comfortable to wear</li>
            <li>I suspect I&#x27;ll be ordering most all of my supplies from Amazon going forward.</li>
            <li>price was wonderful, ordering was simple.</li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t ask for better.</li>
            <li>I like it most because it seems like I&#x27;m not wearing anything at night,</li>
            <li>Hopefully I&#x27;ll do a bit more shopping and find them a bit cheaper.</li>
            <li>Sure the home respiratory people can send you this stuff and charge your insurance company.  </li>
            <li>Just like the one I had, love it.</li>
            <li>Wish we could size it more easily.</li>
            <li>This is much more comfortable and reliable when compared to masks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>works great, didn&#x27;t realize how worn out my old one was until I replaced it.</li>
            <li>Good price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Good Price, Fast Delivery.</li>
            <li>This is an original ResMed spare at a fraction of try cost since I was able to buy this without the Headgear which I did not need</li>
            <li>easy on the nose, easy to sleep with it on.</li>
            <li>It arrived very quickly by USPS.</li>
            <li>The nasal pillows are fine.  </li>
            <li>It fits me fine</li>
            <li>They work fine.</li>
            <li>This is the exact same product/brand/packaging and works perfect.</li>
            <li>Also if you have the full face mask, dump it for this model (Swift FX headgear) unless you like feeling like Darth Vader every night, this is much more comfortable.</li>
            <li>Super!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a man &amp; they fit just like the ones I got when I got my CAP unit.  </li>
            <li>The nose pillows are extremely comfortable.</li>
            <li>Great back up............</li>
            <li>Product came faster than estimated and now my wife is sleeping soundly again.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable and pliable.</li>
            <li>The pillows should be washed with soap and water every week or sooner to keep it free of oils, moisturizers, creams, etc that can build up causing it to irritate your skin.</li>
            <li>Great purchase, same as med men&#x27;s purchased thru doctor.</li>
            <li>Nice and soft and price was fair too, thanks.</li>
            <li>Did not realize just how important it was to keep clean</li>
            <li>This is exactly like the ones I&#x27;ve purchased at the doctors office for much more money.</li>
            <li>so I purchased all the tubing, parts and pieces and clean everything ...</li>
            <li>They are easy to use, easy to clean, very high quality.  </li>
            <li>consider it to be the same good quality as the original that came with my CPAP unit.</li>
            <li>Works great, as expected.</li>
            <li>Genuine Resmed, fit and function exactly as they should be.</li>
            <li>these fit really well and comfortable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve finally found the newest Resmed nasal pillows that are far superior than anything out there!</li>
            <li>Cost here for these is very reasonable and beats fighting the insurance companies, save yourself some problems and get them on line.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>Overall, I am satisfied with what I got.</li>
            <li>I use hot water and vinegar and salt to sterilize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>The medical supply place wanted to charge me forty-something dollars for one, so I was glad to find one here a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be sure to purchase this again in the next 6 months.</li>
            <li>Better than other options and arrived quickly</li>
            <li>so I took a chance here and glad I did because it&#x27;s exactly the same even though it&#x27;s marked &amp;#34;For Her&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>But this one I finally am using and have adapted to it just fine.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know if there&#x27;s a difference.</li>
            <li>/&gt;One important thing though, wash and sterilize regularly, both nasal pillows and hose.</li>
            <li>I have been using this type of mask for my APAP machine for years now and it works really well for me.</li>
            <li>You should change your nasal pillows on a reasonable interval aside from wiping them day to day with alcohol.</li>
            <li>I just really cant get over the price for a molded piece of rubber.</li>
            <li>After trying several masks, I really enjoy this.  </li>
            <li>very lite weight.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other cpap head gear and the ResMed Swift FX is my favorite,&lt;br</li>
            <li>Same replacement as original.</li>
            <li>Most people who are noncompliant using CPAP is mainly due to the mask they&#x27;re given.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re supposed to clean daily, but I do it about 3 times a week.</li>
            <li>12 hrs straight (highly unusual).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This would have cost me way more if I bought it from my local home health provider and would have been the same thing.</li>
            <li>The pillow was a direct fit and a simple install.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I could not find any normal mediums out there.</li>
            <li>, first night slept 8 hrs straight, the second night I slept</li>
            <li>, there&#x27;s no adjusting it, comes in either his or hers and both have 3 different size pillows that snap right on.</li>
            <li>so I got these new pillows</li>
            <li>These do wear out after using them for a while and replacing them every 60-90 days is my new plan.</li>
            <li>New Resmed</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recently I also had to start using CPAP and am very sensitive to anything that contacts my skin.</li>
            <li>Its the exact same part</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a small nose for sure and</li>
            <li>These nasal pillows were exactly the same as the ones I needed to replace.</li>
            <li>and its the exact same product.</li>
            <li>and hers are the his has a larger, more strech in the blue headgear, and comes with larger nose pieces than hers.</li>
            <li>Only thing MUCH cheaper also same exact nasal pillow I started with.</li>
            <li>I like the nasal pillows much better than the mask; these are very comfortable compared to a mask and much less expensive to replace for this high cost stuff!</li>
            <li>Once I got the product it was clear that &#x27;for her&#x27; was not correct.</li>
            <li>Trying to get a replacement for this piece through my DME company was a complete headache.  </li>
            <li>My dogs ate my old medium swift FX pillows piece</li>
            <li>I usually sport a goatee so the over the mouth or full face masks don&#x27;t seal very well for me.</li>
            <li>and I was forced to use the large that originally came with the CPAP.</li>
            <li>This is the exact same product I got from my medical supplier, just cheaper.  </li>
            <li>This item is exactly the same as the ones you get through insurance at the medical supply stores.  </li>
            <li>The nasal pillow was exactly what other suppliers provide.</li>
            <li>This is exactly the way other suppliers provide this product.</li>
            <li>You will not hear noisy exhalation or air with this because of the new design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Washing the headgear will shrink it back to original size, if it gets too loose,(haven&#x27;t had a problem so far with either one)  and should be done at least once a month.</li>
            <li>Buying these parts on Amazon cut my cost to 1/3 or less than what I would have normally paid, and it&#x27;s the exact same product.  </li>
            <li>the pillows seemed to go soft so quickly.usually last 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>aftr  about one,they actually were not adequately firm</li>
            <li>Very flexible and pliable and is not as intrusive as other masks that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Exact same thing that came with my machine down to the smallest detail.  </li>
            <li>I used this product in the past and it was identical to the previous product that I paid much more for.</li>
            <li>nasal pillows are very comfy and they cost much less on Amazon than in a medical&lt;</li>

            <li> 12 hrs straight (highly unusual).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This would have cost me way more if I bought it from my local home health provider and would have been the same thing.</li>
            <li> The pillow was a direct fit and a simple install.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I could not find any normal mediums out there.</li>
            <li> , first night slept 8 hrs straight, the second night I slept</li>
            <li> , there&#x27;s no adjusting it, comes in either his or hers and both have 3 different size pillows that snap right on.</li>
            <li> so I got these new pillows</li>
            <li> These do wear out after using them for a while and replacing them every 60-90 days is my new plan.</li>
            <li> New Resmed</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recently I also had to start using CPAP and am very sensitive to anything that contacts my skin.</li>
            <li> Its the exact same part</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a small nose for sure and</li>
            <li> These nasal pillows were exactly the same as the ones I needed to replace.</li>
            <li> and its the exact same product.</li>
            <li> and hers are the his has a larger, more strech in the blue headgear, and comes with larger nose pieces than hers.</li>
            <li> Only thing MUCH cheaper also same exact nasal pillow I started with.</li>
            <li> I like the nasal pillows much better than the mask; these are very comfortable compared to a mask and much less expensive to replace for this high cost stuff!</li>
            <li> Once I got the product it was clear that &#x27;for her&#x27; was not correct.</li>
            <li> Trying to get a replacement for this piece through my DME company was a complete headache.  </li>
            <li> My dogs ate my old medium swift FX pillows piece</li>
            <li> I usually sport a goatee so the over the mouth or full face masks don&#x27;t seal very well for me.</li>
            <li> and I was forced to use the large that originally came with the CPAP.</li>
            <li> This is the exact same product I got from my medical supplier, just cheaper.  </li>
            <li> This item is exactly the same as the ones you get through insurance at the medical supply stores.  </li>
            <li> The nasal pillow was exactly what other suppliers provide.</li>
            <li> This is exactly the way other suppliers provide this product.</li>
            <li> You will not hear noisy exhalation or air with this because of the new design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Washing the headgear will shrink it back to original size, if it gets too loose,(haven&#x27;t had a problem so far with either one)  and should be done at least once a month.</li>
            <li> Buying these parts on Amazon cut my cost to 1/3 or less than what I would have normally paid, and it&#x27;s the exact same product.  </li>
            <li> the pillows seemed to go soft so quickly.usually last 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> aftr  about one,they actually were not adequately firm</li>
            <li> Very flexible and pliable and is not as intrusive as other masks that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Exact same thing that came with my machine down to the smallest detail.  </li>
            <li> I used this product in the past and it was identical to the previous product that I paid much more for.</li>
            <li> nasal pillows are very comfy and they cost much less on Amazon than in a medical&lt;</li>
            <li> Should of tried this type first, before using the full-face hard plastic CPAP masks.</li>
            <li> My old one was in use for about a year and a half</li>
            <li> Not really a fan of my local medical supplier</li>
            <li> After long use it does start to hurt your nose.</li>
            <li> Wish that I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to replace the Nasal Pillow.  </li>
            <li> It is a waste it money to send a package that contains one small, one medium and one large.  </li>
            <li> and I had to buy the set of three small, medium and large --- what a waste.  </li>
            <li> Excellent..may have little adjustment period but not long.</li>
            <li> I would have gotten from the local company, a lot faster, a lot easier, and probably half the price.</li>
            <li> The hers comes with a purple headgear, a little smaller than the men&#x27;s and</li>
            <li> This product is a soft rubber not the hard plastic types.</li>
            <li> product was what was as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the different types of masks and had trouble adjusting to all of them including the FX nano.</li>
            <li> Even though it was the same named gear, it did not fit my head gear.</li>
            <li> ; deal and if you have been buying these from a regular medical supplier you know what I mean ($35 was the avg price)</li>
            <li> but I apparently ordered the wrong size and it was mote expensive than most.</li>
            <li> If your insurance doesn&#x27;t pay for them, it can be quite expensive to get them through normal medical supply channels.  </li>
            <li> We have had difficulty in the past with local availability.</li>
            <li> I have also had product arrive in ziplock bags with dust and other particles visible, which I believe calls into question the provenance of the items.</li>
            <li> but it fits just as any other resmed pillows for the swift FX</li>
            <li> Exactly like the one from my health care provider but less expensive.</li>
            <li> It was starting to slowly wear out</li>
            <li> performed like the ones i buy from the med. supply store but cost a lot less.</li>
            <li> Typically the product will come in sealed, sterile packaging from the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re tired of waking up due to the leaks, noise, or having to readjust your headgear look no further.</li>
            <li> Forms a tight seal, no leaks</li>
            <li> A little pricey for what you get</li>
            <li> This site was less expensive and I received the same quality product as I had from other sites.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find any stores around that sold them and the few I did find weren&#x27;t the correct ones.</li>
            <li> That small bad was sealed in a larger ResMed white bag.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> the pillows are XSmall, Small, Med.</li>
            <li> Anyone with a CPAP need at least four of these on hand to keep washed and dried ones on hand, so they can be changed each day.  </li>
            <li> This particular system was so horrible that every time he moved it would leak or was noisy and the exhalation port would blow in my face, constantly waking up the both of us!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I learned that the hard way -- germs seem to start breeding in there</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with this product is that I bought the wrong size!</li>
            <li> I hated using the large cause</li>
            <li> I bought this in the hope that &#x27;for her&#x27; was a false claim.</li>
            <li> Plus its just sanitary to keep things you&#x27;re breathing through from causing you to get sick due to bacteria etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sleep apnea supplies are always outrageously priced when purchased from medical equipment suppliers.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong  here.</li>
            <li> This nasal pillow system is horrible!</li>

            <li> Product is as described.</li>
            <li> Good price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Another perfect fit at a great price</li>
            <li> Exactly like the one from my health care provider but less expensive.</li>
            <li> Sleep apnea supplies are always outrageously priced when purchased from medical equipment suppliers.  This item was cheaper than my insurance copay and the exact product I usually get from the local medical supply outlet.</li>
            <li> Work great! And a great price!</li>
            <li> They say these are for women.  I&#x27;m a man &amp; they fit just like the ones I got when I got my CAP unit.  Only thing MUCH cheaper also same exact nasal pillow I started with.</li>
            <li> performed like the ones i buy from the med. supply store but cost a lot less. very pleased. will order these again</li>
            <li> Not really a fan of my local medical supplier; I&#x27;d rather do my shopping on line when I need it! Plus: I think the costs are lower, too...&lt;br /&gt;Works perfectly as a replacement for the original.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I wanted, the delivery was perfectly on time and it was very easy to install it. I will definitely recommend this product. Thank you</li>
            <li> I have had the best 6 nights sleep ever since getting this product. I highly recommend it!! Home run!!!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t fit perfectly for my machine, but I worked it out and is a good fit. Overall, I am satisfied with what I got.</li>
            <li> This is the exact same product I got from my medical supplier, just cheaper.  Same package, same ID numbers, same medium I always wear and I am a guy.  I will be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> Great product, easy to put together and very comfortable. I recommend this to everyone. easy on the nose, easy to sleep with it on.</li>
            <li> Works as described. After long use it does start to hurt your nose.</li>
            <li> Trying to get a replacement for this piece through my DME company was a complete headache.  Its the exact same part I would have gotten from the local company, a lot faster, a lot easier, and probably half the price.</li>
            <li> When I learned that I needed to use a CPAP device to sleep properly, I immediate became concerned about masks and my ability to wear one at night.  The nurses recommended trying a nasal pillow, and the ResMed was the what they claimed was most popular.  I tried this system and found that it worked perfectly for me...  I sometimes forget I have it on.  This is much more comfortable and reliable when compared to masks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any medical supply item, these pilows need to be replaced from time-to-time.  If your insurance doesn&#x27;t pay for them, it can be quite expensive to get them through normal medical supply channels.  Buying these parts on Amazon cut my cost to 1/3 or less than what I would have normally paid, and it&#x27;s the exact same product.  I suspect I&#x27;ll be ordering most all of my supplies from Amazon going forward.</li>
            <li> The nasal pillows are fine.  It is a waste it money to send a package that contains one small, one medium and one large.  Whichever size you use is what you need......not one of each.</li>
            <li> They also are the correct ones for the Mirage Swift FX for him, too.</li>
            <li> I use this product with my headgear on my cpap machine.  I&#x27;ve had no medical insurance for a few months and needed a replacement without the headache of paperwork, doctor&#x27;s visits and paying too much.  This works perfectly!  Thank You!</li>
            <li> This product is made well and works as described. I would recommend this to use with your cpap headgear assembly.</li>
            <li> product was what was as expected. price was wonderful, ordering was simple. couldn&#x27;t ask for better. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> My dogs ate my old medium swift FX pillows piece and I was forced to use the large that originally came with the CPAP. I hated using the large cause the holes were so big every time I moved in the night it would start blowing me in the face! I can stay asleep now with the medium.</li>
            <li> Excellent..may have little adjustment period but not long.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted at a great price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the different types of masks and had trouble adjusting to all of them including the FX nano. But this one I finally am using and have adapted to it just fine. It doesn&#x27;t leak like the masks do and I can sleep in just about any position I want without it giving me problems. I like it most because it seems like I&#x27;m not wearing anything at night, yet it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. By the way, I got the Nasal pillows, but not the &amp;#34;for her&amp;#34; style. I don&#x27;t really know if there&#x27;s a difference. I&#x27;ve read they&#x27;re both the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One important thing though, wash and sterilize regularly, both nasal pillows and hose. If not, you will eventually end up having problems with your throat. I learned that the hard way -- germs seem to start breeding in there and you will start having problems eventually. You&#x27;re supposed to clean daily, but I do it about 3 times a week. I use hot water and vinegar and salt to sterilize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, this is the best one to use. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this pillow because I needed a replacement ASAP.  This item is exactly the same as the ones you get through insurance at the medical supply stores.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why they call it HER. It fits me fine and I have no problem using it.  This is the second pair that I ordered.</li>
            <li> Wish that I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to replace the Nasal Pillow.  Excellent product and much cheaper than purchasing from the specialty store in which I got the CPAP.</li>
            <li> What can I say?  They work fine.</li>
            <li> works great, didn&#x27;t realize how worn out my old one was until I replaced it. thanks!</li>
            <li> I have tried many other cpap head gear and the ResMed Swift FX is my favorite,&lt;br /&gt;The nasal pillows are very comfy and they cost much less on Amazon than in a medical&lt;br /&gt;supply stores.</li>
            <li> What can I say? It fits my unit and works great. Nice and soft and price was fair too, thanks.</li>
            <li> Although this nasal pillow indicates its for a &amp;#34;her&amp;#34;, I am a male and it is identical to the one I replaced.&lt;br /&gt;I consider it to be the same good quality as the original that came with my CPAP unit.</li>
            <li> I have been using this type of mask for my APAP machine for years now and it works really well for me. I usually sport a goatee so the over the mouth or full face masks don&#x27;t seal very well for me. I needed to replace the one I had because it was starting to tear from us. I know these say they are &#x27;for her&#x27; and I&#x27;m not sure if I just got a &#x27;for her&#x27; mask to begin with. I don&#x27;t have a small nose for sure and these fit really well and comfortable. *shrug*</li>
            <li> I used this product in the past and it was identical to the previous product that I paid much more for.</li>
            <li> the pillows seemed to go soft so quickly.usually last 2 weeks. aftr  about one,they actually were not adequately firm</li>
            <li> Exact same thing that came with my machine down to the smallest detail.  The medical supply place wanted to charge me forty-something dollars for one, so I was glad to find one here a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> This was the same item the medical supply place was selling me at 4X the price and I had to buy the set of three small, medium and large --- what a waste.  This was excellent finding this one at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Worked on my ResMed perfectly.</li>
            <li> Very good service at reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> Out of shape, does not seal good. Leaks air...</li>
            <li> Well needed replacement.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a replacement for my Medium size Swift FX Nasal Pillow I got with my CPAP.  DME supplier wanted $40 for this so I took a chance here and glad I did because it&#x27;s exactly the same even though it&#x27;s marked &amp;#34;For Her&amp;#34;.  Works just fine &amp;#34;For Him&amp;#34; too!</li>
            <li> Works great, as expected.</li>
            <li> What a great deal at Amazon. Cepa website way overpriced. Fits great on headgear. Forms a tight seal, no leaks</li>
            <li> very satisfied customer, thankyou</li>
            <li> This site was less expensive and I received the same quality product as I had from other sites.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time, price was a fraction of that asked in Australia. I have not used the pillows yet but they appear to be the genuine Resmed produst, great value.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with this product is that I bought the wrong size! But even at that, it&#x27;s very comfortable. My old one was in use for about a year and a half and it was still functioning beautifully.</li>
            <li> I bought this in the hope that &#x27;for her&#x27; was a false claim. I could not find any normal mediums out there. Once I got the product it was clear that &#x27;for her&#x27; was not correct. These nasal pillows were exactly the same as the ones I needed to replace. No where on the packaging does it say &#x27;for her&#x27;. So these are just the standard medium nasal pillows, not a smaller version like it implies. They work great, I am glad I ordered them.</li>
            <li> I got my CPAP about 2 years ago and I have managed to keep the same head gear the entire time. It was starting to slowly wear out so I bought this. This would have cost me way more if I bought it from my local home health provider and would have been the same thing. It arrived very quickly by USPS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a her, but these things work great for me.  They are easy to use, easy to clean, very high quality.  I especially like the unobtrusive way they get the job done without making you feel like you have a squid on your face</li>
            <li> You should change your nasal pillows on a reasonable interval aside from wiping them day to day with alcohol. Couldn&#x27;t find any stores around that sold them and the few I did find weren&#x27;t the correct ones. Found them here on amazon. A little pricey for what you get but they were needed. Hopefully I&#x27;ll do a bit more shopping and find them a bit cheaper. The pillow was a direct fit and a simple install. I just really cant get over the price for a molded piece of rubber.</li>
            <li> Even though it was the same named gear, it did not fit my head gear.</li>
            <li> Replacement is of good quality and price. I bought this as a replacement for my husband&#x27;s CPAP machine. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> Did not realize just how important it was to keep clean so I purchased all the tubing, parts and pieces and clean everything ... EACH AND EVERY DAY</li>
            <li> This is my nose pillow of choice. I like the comfort and open feel of the Swift FX.  We have had difficulty in the past with local availability. Amazon did a great job of both having these in stock and getting them to us.</li>
            <li> Cost here for these is very reasonable and beats fighting the insurance companies, save yourself some problems and get them on line.</li>
            <li> Genuine Resmed, fit and function exactly as they should be.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit. Promptly shipped</li>
            <li> Typically the product will come in sealed, sterile packaging from the manufacturer.  I have also had product arrive in ziplock bags with dust and other particles visible, which I believe calls into question the provenance of the items.</li>
            <li> The nose pillows are extremely comfortable.</li>
            <li> Same replacement as original.</li>
            <li> Very happy with supplies we ordered. We searched and compared. This is what my husband needed for his cpap machine.</li>
            <li> The nasal pillow was exactly what other suppliers provide. The pillow was first in a small ziploc bag. That small bad was sealed in a larger ResMed white bag. This is exactly the way other suppliers provide this product. Amazon is just cheaper.</li>
            <li> Great back up............</li>
            <li> great price, quality and fit is great</li>
            <li> Sure the home respiratory people can send you this stuff and charge your insurance company.  But after the deductible and the copay, I come out cheaper getting from here and its the exact same product.</li>
            <li> I like the nasal pillows much better than the mask; these are very comfortable compared to a mask and much less expensive to replace for this high cost stuff!</li>
            <li> After trying several masks, I really enjoy this.  Reading with glasses before bed?  No problem.  Very flexible and pliable and is not as intrusive as other masks that I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;ll keep buying this one as a replacement.</li>
            <li> Literally...I thought this was a &amp;#34;too good to be true&amp;#34; deal and if you have been buying these from a regular medical supplier you know what I mean ($35 was the avg price) This is the exact same product/brand/packaging and works perfect. Also if you have the full face mask, dump it for this model (Swift FX headgear) unless you like feeling like Darth Vader every night, this is much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> I had this set up on my cpap and changed to a different style and it wasn&#x27;t working for me so I got these new pillows and they are working great. These do wear out after using them for a while and replacing them every 60-90 days is my new plan.</li>
            <li> Just like the one I had, love it. it is the easiest to use for me very comfortable to wear</li>
            <li> This is an original ResMed spare at a fraction of try cost since I was able to buy this without the Headgear which I did not need</li>
            <li> I have only used Swift FX so I cannot compare to anything else but it fits just as any other resmed pillows for the swift FX</li>
            <li> This product is a soft rubber not the hard plastic types. very lite weight. Should of tried this type first, before using the full-face hard plastic CPAP masks.</li>
            <li> Super!  Product came faster than estimated and now my wife is sleeping soundly again.  I&#x27;ll be sure to purchase this again in the next 6 months.</li>
            <li> Wish we could size it more easily.</li>
            <li> Excellent in every way and so much cheaper than buying through the company.</li>
            <li> Perfect medium replacement older ResMed Swift assembly</li>
            <li> This is exactly like the ones I&#x27;ve purchased at the doctors office for much more money. Can&#x27;t go wrong  here.</li>
            <li> Goes with the swift fx as part of the lightest headgear.  Comfortable and pliable. I have used this nasal pillow for years</li>
            <li> This nasal pillow system is horrible! My husband&#x27;s been on CPAP for over 15 yrs. He&#x27;s tried a lot of mask and nasal pillows and there&#x27;s always been a problem. This particular system was so horrible that every time he moved it would leak or was noisy and the exhalation port would blow in my face, constantly waking up the both of us!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve finally found the newest Resmed nasal pillows that are far superior than anything out there! Its called Resmed AirFit P10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I actually worked in a accredited sleep lab for yrs before medically retiring.  I&#x27;ve seen and used just about every mask on the market. Most people who are noncompliant using CPAP is mainly due to the mask they&#x27;re given.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I also had to start using CPAP and am very sensitive to anything that contacts my skin. Didn&#x27;t think that I would be able to sleep with it more than a couple hrs at best. Using the AirFit P10 was heavenly. I haven&#x27;t slept that well in yrs., first night slept 8 hrs straight, the second night I slept 12 hrs straight (highly unusual).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The New Resmed AirFit P10, will be the answer to all your prayers!  If you&#x27;re tired of waking up due to the leaks, noise, or having to readjust your headgear look no further. They&#x27;ve made this completely different. It weighs I believe 1.8 oz., there&#x27;s no adjusting it, comes in either his or hers and both have 3 different size pillows that snap right on. The difference in the his and hers are the his has a larger, more strech in the blue headgear, and comes with larger nose pieces than hers. I believe its Med, Lg, XL. The hers comes with a purple headgear, a little smaller than the men&#x27;s and the pillows are XSmall, Small, Med. You will not hear noisy exhalation or air with this because of the new design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Washing the headgear will shrink it back to original size, if it gets too loose,(haven&#x27;t had a problem so far with either one)  and should be done at least once a month. The pillows should be washed with soap and water every week or sooner to keep it free of oils, moisturizers, creams, etc that can build up causing it to irritate your skin. Plus its just sanitary to keep things you&#x27;re breathing through from causing you to get sick due to bacteria etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope my review will give some who&#x27;s struggling to find a comfortable mask, to find one made perfectly as the Resmed AirFit P10!</li>
