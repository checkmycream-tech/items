            <li> I thought this was the special edition from 2013 based off of the look of the bottle but it turned out to be the SE for the current year. My fiancé had really loved the 2013 edition because surprisingly they don&#x27;t smell the same</li>
            <li> Got this for my boyfriend. He loved it! He had wanted it for a while. The size of the bottle is nice and its not bad a price - usually in stores its WAY more. I&#x27;m so glad I got it! It will take him a while to go through it, but when he does, I&#x27;ll buy it again!</li>
            <li> me encanto el olor de la colonia, la recomiendo ampliamente, ya tenia la megra y no queria dejar de usar esta, huele tan  bien como la otra, por eso le califico con las 5 estrellas, en el futuro comprare mas de la misma marca</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a picky person in regards men colognes and this product fit my standards perfectly. I do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I got this for my dad for Christmas, he loved it. My father had actually gotten my boyfriend the Mont Blanc Legend Original, not the Special Edition. I was under the impression this would smell the same as the original Mont Blanc Legend, but my dad and boyfriend compared and said the scents were a little different.

            <li> Great compliments from women, they love the smell.</li>

            <li> Has a great fragance to it,love the style of the bottle. A real great buy. You will not be disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> The scent is a four, but the staying power is not. Not for me anyway. A good smell but it just does not last at all. I have to use way too much. Perhaps I just got a bum bottle.</li>
            <li> Bought this because I&#x27;ve gotten numerous compliments on the standard Legend cologne.  When I put this on the first time, my wife LOVED it.  She even likes it better than the standard.  Great buy for a great price!</li>
            <li> arrived fast, and it is a great fragrance for men&lt;br /&gt;Nice and spicy with tone of citrus, and last for a long time</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my little son, he loves Mont Blanc, surely a great surprise for him! and surely recommended, it is by all means a legend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a preference for Montblanc fragrances. This did not know her, but once again was very satisfied with their products</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great smell and for the price, the smell has a masculine smell like maybe armani code but a bit lighter. It&#x27;s a good smell but in my opinion mont Blanc should stick to making expensive pens, 10x the amount of the cologne they make.</li>
