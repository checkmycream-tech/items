            <li>I really enjoy that it has two heads as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the cost though it really should have been a better quality product and a bit more up to date style of tooth brush.  </li>

            <li>Who fan to get more interested in brushing her teeth, trying to make it less of a chore to a 7 year old is priceless.  </li>
            <li>I got it as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it!!</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t think it was worth the money.</li>
            <li>My 11 yr old son is a huge dr.</li>
            <li>absolutely love Doctor Who, but not enough to pay another $10 every time my toothbrush wears out.</li>
            <li>They are still working very well.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not very durable</li>
            <li>He was so pleased with his gift, his electric toothbrush stopped working all of the sudden last month</li>
            <li>Pretty cool other than that.</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact he ask we go buy a new tube of toothpaste  to go with the new toothbrush.</li>

            <li>so sad for my son who really loved it.  </li>
            <li>I gave this two stars because it arrived open and the original head was missing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s for display only, so far, so</li>
            <li>The vibrating handle has held up well, but after 9 months, we&#x27;ve pushed the original and replacement heads far past typical use.</li>

            <li> Made my roommate chuckle.  Very cute gift for any Dr. Who fan</li>
            <li> This is OK.  Not worth the money I paid for it, but I am trying to get my daughter who is a huge Dr. Who fan to get more interested in brushing her teeth, trying to make it less of a chore to a 7 year old is priceless.  My issue with it is, that it isn&#x27;t really a very good vibrating tooth brush.  The brush heads are poor quality and the vibration is low, but besides it is up to the standards of an electric toothbrush from the 80&#x27;s.  Electric tooth brush technology has come a LONG way since then and this offering is dismal.  The good things are that it kinda looks like a sonic screwdriver.  For the cost though it really should have been a better quality product and a bit more up to date style of tooth brush.  It literally is a regular toothbrush that vibrates very slightly, while most common ones vibrate and spin or move back and forth, and have different styles of bristles.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 12 year old nephew for getting good grades on his report card.  He loves it.</li>
            <li> Great!! I got it as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it!!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re considering purchasing this product, please know that no one sells replacement heads. Once the two including brushes wear out, you have to repurchase this entire product! This makes the cost of replacement $10 per brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love Doctor Who, but not enough to pay another $10 every time my toothbrush wears out.</li>
            <li> A must for any dr who fan</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my son, a huge Dr. Who fan.  He has been using it for a few days now, and really loves it. Does not make sonic screwdriver noises-does not light up-it was not intended to. It is just a great vibrating brush for the Dr. Who fan. Would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I got this to give as a gift.  Who cares if it works~it&#x27;s a great novelty!</li>
            <li> My grandsons are total Whovians!  The look on their faces when we opened the box was priceless!&lt;br /&gt;They were going to brush as soon as they got home. Good buy!</li>
            <li> Had this for a month now, and I absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a huge BBC Doctor Who fan and this toothbrush is meant for me.&lt;br /&gt;The included battery still lasts till this day. I really enjoy that it has two heads as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip, the gray plastic at the bottom of the head may fall off, so always have the head attached to the body before put it under the faucet.</li>
            <li> Xmas presents for my boys. They were a huge hit! even for teenage boys. They are still working very well.</li>
            <li> Purchased this 8 months ago and still going strong, my son loves it.</li>
            <li> Not sure if my husband will actually USE it, but he loves it.  He&#x27;s never seen one before, and as a present for his birthday, this was a serious hit.  Just to note, this has not been removed from the packaging.  It&#x27;s for display only, so far, so I can&#x27;t say if it actually WORKS.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 14 year old step,son as a stocking stuffer. He is a big Doctor Who fan, so he loved it.</li>
            <li> Broke within one week of use. Found out online that this is a big problem with this item. Would not have bought if I knew that</li>
            <li> My son is a huge Doctor Who fan. He loved it. I dont know that it has helped him to brush his teeth any more though.</li>
            <li> This is great and retains battery for long periods of time. It comes just as it looks in the picture. The only thing is that it has a paint vibrate and the handle vibrates as well as the brush.</li>
            <li> My 11 yr old son is a huge dr. Who fan. I will say it encourages him to brush his teeth . As a matter of fact he ask we go buy a new tube of toothpaste  to go with the new toothbrush. I was happy to find it also comes with batteries! I thought it was a good value.</li>
            <li> Arrived with damaged packaging and the brush handle was broken off.  Very cheaply made item.&lt;br /&gt;I use it to pollinate tomatoes in a greenhouse. I fixed it and it&#x27;s vibrating like it should.&lt;br /&gt;Neat design but poor quality and the packaging was not up to shipping.</li>
            <li> My son received this as a gift. He knocked his toothbrush off the counter &amp; the head broke. After I replaced the head with the extra, it happened again &amp; that was the end of that. It&#x27;s super cute &amp; my son loved it, I just wish the heads weren&#x27;t made out of cheapy plastic.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these (one for each of my young Whovians), and they loved them. Nothing special about the toothbrush part, but lots of fun! The vibrating handle has held up well, but after 9 months, we&#x27;ve pushed the original and replacement heads far past typical use. Alas, it&#x27;s not possible to get replacements (as far as I know). Definitely loses a star for that.</li>
            <li> Very cool toothbrush. My 13 year old niece loved it.</li>
            <li> my grand daughter used it but now has braces and her dentist gave her an Oral B</li>
            <li> Ordered these for my boys and they look a bit generic...it&#x27;s hard to know what it is supposed to be. They work but I didn&#x27;t think it was worth the money.</li>
            <li> Works great with no problems here. Seems well built. My son has been using everyday since purchase with no issues.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t care for doctor who but my girl does. she loves things like this. i&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not very durable but it serves a purpose.</li>
            <li> My niece loved this!!</li>
            <li> I gave this two stars because it arrived open and the original head was missing. They just taped it back together very poorly. I like the product, but come on!</li>
            <li> Got this as a Christmas gift for my ultra whovian (Dr Who Fan-my husband) because I knew he would love it. And he did! He was so pleased with his gift, his electric toothbrush stopped working all of the sudden last month and he was using a spare manual one while looking to replace it. It was SO hard not to give away this gift to him while putting off buying a new brush for him cus I knew he would love it. When he opened it he was so happy and said &#x27;and I need a new brush how awesome!&#x27;</li>
            <li> MY son was so happy to get this Dr Who toothbrush for Christmas! It works good. It arrived when promised. Very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> The top part needs to be more secure. It only twists on to make changing it easier, but it falls off while brushing. Pretty cool other than that.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush broke in 2 months..so sad for my son who really loved it.  It just broke in his hand.</li>
            <li> My 11 years old LOVES this toothbrush</li>
            <li> This is so fun!  My 9 yr old Whovian loved it!  Now if only Sonicare would make an actual Sonic toothbrush ...</li>
            <li> My son, huge Dr. Who fan loved this!</li>
            <li> it was a gift for christmas and my brother loved it!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as described. Has been functioning good for a week now.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t need a Dr. Who Toothbrush?</li>
