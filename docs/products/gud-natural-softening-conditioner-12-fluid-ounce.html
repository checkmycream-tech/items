    <ol>
            <li>So wonderful smelling</li>
            <li>Great scent!!!</li>
            <li>My family and I used it with excellent results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame the product smells wonderful</li>
            <li>The best conditioner I have used.</li>
            <li>The blood orange scent is awesome</li>
            <li>Good work, Bert&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>all these scents are great and no sulfates</li>
            <li>I suppose if you are one that likes all the chemicals and stuff in your products, you won&#x27;t be happy...</li>
            <li>This a very nice product.  </li>
            <li>I love this line of products by burts bees!</li>
            <li>Our family uses it with the matching shampoo and our hair looks and smells amazing.  </li>
            <li>gave the bottles to a friend thinking that she might have better luck with it, but it didn&#x27;t work for her either.  </li>
            <li>I love all the Gud products...</li>
            <li>Amazon definitely has the best price for it and many stores who carry Gud don&#x27;t have the Orange version.</li>
            <li>While it will not replace my regular conditioner (the best conditioner I have ever tried), it will be a stand in when I run out.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;The other scents are delicious too...</li>
            <li>Others say it flattens their hair, but mine tends to get big and frizzy, so it works great for me.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s frizzy hair is tamed and my wife says it looks &amp;#34;calm and beautiful.&amp;#34;  The pleasant scent of this product lasts until the next day (in our case anyway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year now and cannot say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>This conditioner works great on my girls long straight blonde hair and smells great too.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the way it makes my hair feel.&lt;br /&gt;Cruelty free and mostly natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave the product two stars is because it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>There are dozens of better conditioners - even natural ones - out there.</li>
            <li>whole line of goodies is for the people that live for back to basics, natural, good for you, fresh, and kind to your being...</li>
            <li>The hair products are so pure and clean...</li>
            <li>I use it on my daughters hair as well and the tangles come right out in the shower.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the orange scent and really appreciate the brands devotion to keeping it natural.  </li>
            <li>I had the Grapefruit first...</li>
            <li>I liked the smell of this conditioner, however the results were not fun.</li>
            <li>/&gt;One unusual caveat-</li>
            <li>I purchased the Gud Orange Petalooza Natural Softening Conditioner on a whim because I ran out of my regular conditioner (Oyin&#x27;s Honey Hemp) and needed something to use until I could order more.  </li>
            <li>I love the citrus scent and think this is a great basic shampoo with very little anything to wei down my hair.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Leaves jair soft and smells yummy!</li>
            <li>First of all, I understand that everyone&#x27;s hair is different, and what will work well for one person might not work well for another.  </li>
            <li>The biggest disappointment is how incredibly tangly the conditioner left my hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The conditioner is called \\&quot;softening conditioner\\&quot;, but my hair was anything but soft</li>
            <li>My hair is far from soft after using this product.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>When washing out the conditioner, my hair remained soft.  </li>
            <li>Works great, keeps us away from those bad shampoos that contain chemicals that kill us.</li>
            <li>My hair ended up looking dry like straw, and I probably have lots of new split ends.</li>
            <li>Even once I got my hair combed out and free of tangles, it was STILL tough to run the brush through it.  </li>

            <li> Not a huge problem for us, but if you really MUST have Orange, you might want to double check</li>
            <li> Did not detangle or soften my hair as well as other natural products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I just tied my hair back still wet and went to the store to get something</li>
            <li> The conditioner works well, and my wife (who has several documented chemical sensitivities) doesn&#x27;t react badly to it, and it leaves her hair shiny and healthy without a lingering &amp;#34;too-sweet&amp;#34; smell that some over-perfumed products can do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it does not live up to it&#x27;s claims.</li>
            <li> My mother tried it first and complained that she disliked it.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product with the coordinating shampoo, which was also a huge disappointment (I wrote a separate review for the shampoo).</li>
            <li> I actually think my hair is damaged, which sucks because I try really hard to use quality products &amp; treat my hair with care.</li>
            <li> But that scent is hard to find...</li>
            <li> It felt dry, brittle and was very difficult to run a shower comb through.  </li>
            <li> So sorry it&#x27;s been discontinued.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was VERY VERY disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I needed to sniff the coordinating conditioner after I had already sniffed the shampoo, but lesson learned: the conditioner smells awful, nothing like the shampoo.</li>
            <li> That being said, this stuff did a terrible job on my hair.  </li>

            <li> I love this line of products by burts bees! So wonderful smelling</li>
            <li> The conditioner works well, and my wife (who has several documented chemical sensitivities) doesn&#x27;t react badly to it, and it leaves her hair shiny and healthy without a lingering &amp;#34;too-sweet&amp;#34; smell that some over-perfumed products can do.&lt;br /&gt;One unusual caveat- we ordered both the Orange &amp;#34;Gud&amp;#34; shampoo and conditioner...we received the Orange shampoo, but we received a bottle of Vanilla &amp;#34;Gud&amp;#34; conditioner, labelled as &amp;#34;Orange&amp;#34; by Amazon.  Not a huge problem for us, but if you really MUST have Orange, you might want to double check what arrives before you open it and start using it.</li>
            <li> I adore the fragrance. So sorry it&#x27;s been discontinued.</li>
            <li> This is a division of Burt&#x27;s Bees products. I love the smell and the way it makes my hair feel.&lt;br /&gt;Cruelty free and mostly natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Leaves jair soft and smells yummy!</li>
            <li> I bought this product with the coordinating shampoo, which was also a huge disappointment (I wrote a separate review for the shampoo). I didn&#x27;t think I needed to sniff the coordinating conditioner after I had already sniffed the shampoo, but lesson learned: the conditioner smells awful, nothing like the shampoo. The biggest disappointment is how incredibly tangly the conditioner left my hair.  I actually think my hair is damaged, which sucks because I try really hard to use quality products &amp; treat my hair with care. My hair ended up looking dry like straw, and I probably have lots of new split ends. This conditioner did nothing to care for or improve the quality of my hair. There are dozens of better conditioners - even natural ones - out there.</li>
            <li> all these scents are great and no sulfates</li>
            <li> I liked the smell of this conditioner, however the results were not fun. Did not detangle or soften my hair as well as other natural products I&#x27;ve used. I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> First of all, I understand that everyone&#x27;s hair is different, and what will work well for one person might not work well for another.  That being said, this stuff did a terrible job on my hair.  I used the matching shampoo with it, but I won&#x27;t review that here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner is called \\&quot;softening conditioner\\&quot;, but my hair was anything but soft once I got out of the shower.  It felt dry, brittle and was very difficult to run a shower comb through.  Even once I got my hair combed out and free of tangles, it was STILL tough to run the brush through it.  I didn&#x27;t even bother drying it.  I just tied my hair back still wet and went to the store to get something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave the bottles to a friend thinking that she might have better luck with it, but it didn&#x27;t work for her either.

            <li> I love all the Gud products...The hair products are so pure and clean...I had the Grapefruit first...But that scent is hard to find...&lt;br /&gt;The other scents are delicious too...I suppose if you are one that likes all the chemicals and stuff in your products, you won&#x27;t be happy...&lt;br /&gt;This whole line of goodies is for the people that live for back to basics, natural, good for you, fresh, and kind to your being...&lt;br /&gt;I am smitten with GUD..&lt;br /&gt;Best, snowhugs</li>
            <li> My husband won&#x27;t use this because of the string smell, which is a plus.  All for me!  I love the citrus scent and think this is a great basic shampoo with very little anything to wei down my hair.  Good work, Bert&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> I Like the citrus scent and I am upset that they are not selling this scent in the stores anymore!</li>
            <li> This is way cheaper to add-on  with Amazon Prime than it is in any grocery store. Works great, keeps us away from those bad shampoos that contain chemicals that kill us.</li>
            <li> Great scent!!! Have Ben using for over a year with no complaints. Others say it flattens their hair, but mine tends to get big and frizzy, so it works great for me. I use it on my daughters hair as well and the tangles come right out in the shower.</li>
            <li> I use this on my kids and for myself.  I LOVE the orange scent and really appreciate the brands devotion to keeping it natural.  We buy Orange Petalooza shampoo and conditioner again and again.  Amazon definitely has the best price for it and many stores who carry Gud don&#x27;t have the Orange version.</li>
            <li> This a very nice product.  Our family uses it with the matching shampoo and our hair looks and smells amazing.  My daughter&#x27;s frizzy hair is tamed and my wife says it looks &amp;#34;calm and beautiful.&amp;#34;  The pleasant scent of this product lasts until the next day (in our case anyway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.  My family and I used it with excellent results.</li>
            <li> I bought this product recently after I saw it in Cosmo.  My mother tried it first and complained that she disliked it.  I wasn&#x27;t convinced so I gave it a try.  I was VERY VERY disappointed.  After rinsing my hair it still felt dirty/heavy.  It felt as though I&#x27;d washed my hair with lotion rather than conditioner.  My hair is far from soft after using this product.  The next morning it looked greasy.  It&#x27;s a shame the product smells wonderful but it does not live up to it&#x27;s claims.</li>
            <li> The best conditioner I have used. I have sensitive skin and it never bothers me. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year now and cannot say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works great on my girls long straight blonde hair and smells great too.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Gud Orange Petalooza Natural Softening Conditioner on a whim because I ran out of my regular conditioner (Oyin&#x27;s Honey Hemp) and needed something to use until I could order more.  I have afro textured hair (4a) so I need a conditioner that will soften and detangle.  I was not disappointed.  After washing, I applied a generous amount to my hair.  While it did not give me the same results as my regular conditioner (Oyin&#x27;s Honey Hemp) it did soften and detangling was a breeze.  When washing out the conditioner, my hair remained soft.  The blood orange scent is awesome and I can still smell it in my hair the morning after.  While it will not replace my regular conditioner (the best conditioner I have ever tried), it will be a stand in when I run out.</li>
