            <li>Would it be bright in a darker hotel room while you are traveling?</li>
            <li>With the 10X magnifying I can see so good.</li>
            <li>The adjustable height makes it an awesome free-standing mirror leaving my two hands free to apply face cream.  </li>
            <li>Size of the mirror is good but the mirror itself collapses.</li>
            <li>Now I have owned my fair share of make-up mirrors, but none of them come even close to this mirror.</li>

            <li>Love, love, love this portable mirror!  </li>

            <li>Too big for a purse but perfect for travel or home!</li>
            <li>I received a free product in exchange for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I was pleased to receive this one.</li>
            <li>love that the mirror came with batteries</li>
            <li>, so I was able to experience it immediately.</li>
            <li>really love this mirror-</li>
            <li>the item was in a bubble wrap sleeve, it looked ok until I pulled product out of the sleeve</li>
            <li>Mirror has perfect amount of light, and magnification is clear at all angles.</li>
            <li>It is my favorite by far.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can think of many family members that would love this mirror.</li>
            <li>The thing I like most about it is I can still carry it in my purse.  </li>
            <li>received this product for free in exchange for sharing my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>love</li>
            <li>I love this light.</li>
            <li>more important -  </li>
            <li>The height and angle of the mirror can be adjusted so that you can position it so it is most comfortable for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This LED Lighted Makeup Mirror is absolutely fantastic.  </li>
            <li>The magnification is good, but the led lighting is still dim for me.  </li>
            <li>First of all, it features a regular mirror as well as a 10X magnification mirror ideal for tweeting and make-up application.</li>
            <li>Great for travel and for magnification at home as long as there is additional light sources.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!  </li>
            <li>loved that the mirror easily opens, stays closed when needed and can easily be sized depending on the height you need it.</li>
            <li>Good mirror just not as big as I wanted it.</li>
            <li>The mirror is ok but the batteries run out fast.</li>
            <li>It is a compact size, but it can be used to get right at your face and apply makeup with plenty of light any where you</li>
            <li>My mirror was delivered quickly and packed well.  </li>
            <li>The magnified mirror, along with the brilliant light,  is substantial enough for me to see every facial nuance .</li>
            <li>I read other reviews mentioning how bright the light is.  </li>
            <li>good quality, not too large - so if you are looking for a big mirror this isn&#x27;t it.  </li>
            <li>This is one powerful mirror.</li>
            <li>I received this mirror complimentary in exchange for my unbiased opinion and review.</li>
            <li>It will not stay open unless it is straight up, not overly impressed with the product especially for the price you pay when it doesn&#x27;t do all the functions stated!</li>
            <li>The illumination light is just right to spot any flaws in natural light.  </li>
            <li>Much more powerful that my big plug in mirror</li>
            <li>I was delighted to see this little gem.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!!</li>
            <li>so much- really!</li>
            <li>So, it provides a better view than a regular compact.</li>
            <li>This is worth a little more money!</li>
            <li>The batteries are easy to put in with a tiny battery cover within.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is no need for a large mirror taking up space on my counter.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>If you have ever used a lighted 3 mirror make-up mirror, do not expect this to light up similarly.  </li>
            <li>Very handy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>mirror is perfect because it is small enough to take anywhere but large enough to apply your makeup without having to hold it up to your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so again I thought if this were brand new it would have been much tighter</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t look brand new, but</li>
            <li>WOW, What a powerful little mirror.  </li>
            <li>Not small not big.</li>
            <li>What a powerful little mirror.</li>
            <li>A little too powerful if you don&#x27;t like seeing all your imperfections.</li>

            <li> so again I thought if this were brand new it would have been much tighter</li>

            <li> Not small not big.</li>
            <li> What a powerful little mirror.</li>
            <li> A little too powerful if you don&#x27;t like seeing all your imperfections.</li>
            <li> Works amazingly well for plucking eyebrows, but a little difficult to use for applying makeup.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s poorly designed:&lt;br /&gt;Given the awkward placement of the on/off light switch - it&#x27;s too easy to accidentally leave it in the on position and deplete the batteries post haste.  </li>
            <li> When you open the mirror there is one side that has the battery case and an on switch and the other side has the two mirrors.&lt;br</li>
            <li> First the product inside the shipping box appeared somewhat broken down, when I went to open the box</li>
            <li> It is compact when it is closed</li>
            <li> Adjustable Height Stand to Open to 11 Inches - Folds Down to Less than 2 Inches.</li>
            <li> for my personal preference the mirror was just too small</li>
            <li> One mirror magnifies 10X the other</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy and the light is so dim as to be worthless.</li>
            <li> mirror closes down to two 1.5 inches to it</li>
            <li> It is difficult to use the stand and it is considerably smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> I use everyday.</li>
            <li> and I have a small compact mirror to put makeup on.</li>
            <li> I never knew I had such weird eyebrows.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ugly - a big, heavy blob of shiny, black plastic.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Hard to see through it unless there is lights on in room.</li>
            <li> Hard to hold.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In sum...a disappointment all &#x27;round.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I have the worst pores..</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is worth a little more money! Well made. The two mirrors can be adjusted and there is no distortion. Too big for a purse but perfect for travel or home!</li>
            <li> good quality, not too large - so if you are looking for a big mirror this isn&#x27;t it.  Folds great.  When opened, it stays standing in a tall position.  Great lighting,  Fits perfect into my medicine cabinet. Gets the job done, and doesn&#x27;t take up a ton of space.</li>
            <li> Good mirror just not as big as I wanted it.</li>
            <li> I do a lot of traveling so this item is perfect.  Compact yet great quality.</li>
            <li> I received a free product in exchange for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have wanted a lighted makeup mirror for awhile so I was pleased to receive this one. I was delighted to see this little gem. It is a compact size, but it can be used to get right at your face and apply makeup with plenty of light any where you go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that the mirror came with batteries, so I was able to experience it immediately. I literally sat for 15 minutes looking at my skin- IN HORROR. OMG. I have the worst pores.. now I know I need to go do a mud mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The man of the house is ripping tweezers out so he can pull his nose hairs.. This mirror is going to change grooming in this house.. for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this would be an amazing gift for someone. It is awesome for the bathroom, or most probably for me, at a desk or cubicle.. if I leave this thing around at home, the man of the house is going to be bald, and he is going to take all my mud masks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love this mirror- thanks so much- really!</li>
            <li> First the product inside the shipping box appeared somewhat broken down, when I went to open the box the item was in a bubble wrap sleeve, it looked ok until I pulled product out of the sleeve it didn&#x27;t look brand new, but why I returned it the item would not stand up, it kept collapsing from its own weight, so again I thought if this were brand new it would have been much tighter&lt;br /&gt;And for my personal preference the mirror was just too small</li>
            <li> Great for traveling.  Works amazingly well for plucking eyebrows, but a little difficult to use for applying makeup.</li>
            <li> The mirror is ok but the batteries run out fast. Hard to see through it unless there is lights on in room.</li>
            <li> What a powerful little mirror. Much more powerful that my big plug in mirror I use everyday. In fact, I think my big mirror has just been replaced. The perfect size for travel as well. I love it and the lights are very bright.</li>
            <li> This is one powerful mirror. A little too powerful if you don&#x27;t like seeing all your imperfections. This LED Lighted Makeup Mirror magnifies from a 1X - 10 X depending on which of the two sides you look at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is perfect for tweezing and pore refining as you can see every hair and every pore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LED bulbs never need to be replaced however you will need 3 AAA batteries. The batteries are easy to put in with a tiny battery cover within.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter kept saying she had a hairy forehead which I guess she never saw in any of our home mirrors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror closes down to two 1.5 inches to it can be taken with you anywhere Drop it in your purse, suitcase, wherever. When you open the mirror there is one side that has the battery case and an on switch and the other side has the two mirrors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror is perfect because it is small enough to take anywhere but large enough to apply your makeup without having to hold it up to your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved that the mirror easily opens, stays closed when needed and can easily be sized depending on the height you need it.</li>
            <li> Mirror has perfect amount of light, and magnification is clear at all angles. No distortions could be detected. Portability is great and unit is perfect for vacations or everyday carrying in your purse. Unit is nicely balanced in the hand to limit dropping.</li>
            <li> I have a big stand up mirror to put makeup on and I have a small compact mirror to put makeup on. Now I have the best mirror to put makeup on.&lt;br /&gt;This LED LIGHTED MAKEUP MIRROR IS AWESOME !!!!  ( LED Lighted Makeup Mirror )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the perfect size. Not small not big. It is compact when it is closed you can even take it with you put it in your bag. When it opens there are 2 magnifying mirrors. One mirror magnifies 10X the other 1X. The best feature is that it is lighted. Once it is opened it lights up around the outside of both mirrors. You can stand it on a table or hold it in your hand. I always sit while I put my makeup on. With the 10X magnifying I can see so good. I love this light. It is my favorite by far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for tweezing eyebrows. Adjustable Height Stand to Open to 11 Inches - Folds Down to Less than 2 Inches. Would make a great gift. I can think of many family members that would love this mirror. I received this mirror complimentary in exchange for my unbiased opinion and review. All opinions and reviews are my own.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice makeup mirror.  It&#x27;s about 3 times as big as the regular makeup mirror compact. So, it provides a better view than a regular compact. The thing I like most about it is I can still carry it in my purse.  The magnifying mirror is really nice as it helps with applying makeup. It makes eyebrow tweezing a breeze because you can see all those stray hairs.  The adjustable height makes it an awesome free-standing mirror leaving my two hands free to apply face cream.  It is nicely sized and weight if I need to hold it in one hand.  The illumination light is just right to spot any flaws in natural light.  I have given up my smaller compact and separate magnifying mirror and the LED Lighted Makeup Mirror is all I use now.  I received this at no cost for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Size of the mirror is good but the mirror itself collapses. It will not stay open unless it is straight up, not overly impressed with the product especially for the price you pay when it doesn&#x27;t do all the functions stated!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t recommend this item...&lt;br /&gt;Aesthetically. it&#x27;s ugly - a big, heavy blob of shiny, black plastic.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t imagine keeping it a handbag ( as has been suggested by others ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But more important -  it&#x27;s poorly designed:&lt;br /&gt;Given the awkward placement of the on/off light switch - it&#x27;s too easy to accidentally leave it in the on position and deplete the batteries post haste.  Which I did.&lt;br /&gt;(By the way, be warned - stingy seller does not even include the 2 required to use the item).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum...a disappointment all &#x27;round.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my wife, she loves it, easy to see yourself on the 10x size and perfect on the opposite, the light comes in very handy all the time.</li>
            <li> The magnification is good, but the led lighting is still dim for me.  Hard to hold.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this portable mirror!  After going thru several cheaper versions, I finally decided to spring for this one.  Worth every penny!  Wish I would have bought it 5 years ago.</li>
            <li> Perfect size and works very well.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mirror!  I was looking for a mirror to keep in my desk at work, but already purchased a 2nd one for home.  This would be the perfect travel mirror as well.  Thanks so much!!</li>
            <li> My mirror did not come with batteries, so FYI, the bottom twists off.  Don&#x27;t put a flat-edge screwdriver in the slot to pop it open like I did because you might break it!  Fortunately, I finally figured it out before I broke mine.  There were no instructions in the box.  Seems like a good mirror with nice lighting otherwise.</li>
            <li> WOW, What a powerful little mirror.  The magnified mirror, along with the brilliant light,  is substantial enough for me to see every facial nuance . The mirror is space saving. I can leave it in a drawer until its needed.  There is no need for a large mirror taking up space on my counter. The mirror can either fold together to put away, or open with a twist, to reveal  two different strength lighted mirrors, and a stand.  My mirror was delivered quickly and packed well.  Berklan Supplies is a very competent organization.  I will be happy to do business with them again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy and the light is so dim as to be worthless.</li>
            <li> This LED Lighted Makeup Mirror is absolutely fantastic.  Now I have owned my fair share of make-up mirrors, but none of them come even close to this mirror. This mirror has a number of awesome features that make it truly unique. First of all, it features a regular mirror as well as a 10X magnification mirror ideal for tweeting and make-up application. Additionally, it features super bright LED bulbs that light up BOTH mirrors very brightly.  Lastly, this mirror goes from a 2 inch compact to a 11 inch fully adjustable mirror in seconds.  The height and angle of the mirror can be adjusted so that you can position it so it is most comfortable for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for sharing my honest and unbiased review. Opinion is entirely my own.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed in this product. It is difficult to use the stand and it is considerably smaller than I expected. I wanted it to take on a trip but I don&#x27;t think I will even bother taking it.</li>
            <li> Mirror would not stay in position and it was immpossible to see anymore than an inch of my face at a time. Sent it back.</li>
            <li> This did not meet my expectations.  I read other reviews mentioning how bright the light is.  If you have ever used a lighted 3 mirror make-up mirror, do not expect this to light up similarly.  It is not that bright.  Would it be bright in a darker hotel room while you are traveling? Possibly.  The magnification is as promised.  It functions well, just don&#x27;t think it is in anyway a substitute for a larger lighted mirror.  Great for travel and for magnification at home as long as there is additional light sources.</li>
            <li> This works just great for me. Very handy.&lt;br /&gt;I love it.&lt;br /&gt; I never knew I had such weird eyebrows.</li>
