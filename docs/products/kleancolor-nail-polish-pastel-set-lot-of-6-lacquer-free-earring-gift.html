            <li>but I just wish it was better quality.</li>

            <li>Love the colors.</li>
            <li>These pastel colors are great for easter time or whenever really.</li>
            <li>I love the colors and the polish</li>
            <li>I will stick to the better brands from now on.</li>
            <li>These pastel colors are great for easter time or whenever really.</li>
            <li>so that is another reason to love them.</li>
            <li>I love it and think it is alot better than the earring gift it said would be sent.</li>
            <li>I recommend this polish to anyone who loves to paint their nails. :)</li>
            <li>But I love the colors</li>
            <li>I saw these in the salon I was at and wanted my own so these shades add just the pop of color I needed to set off the summer right!</li>
            <li>At first I didnt think this nail polish would be too good because it was so cheap.</li>
            <li>all nail polish is meant to be put on with two light coats anyways :)))).</li>
            <li>i got cute earinggs for free.</li>
            <li>Chips &amp; peels fairly easy</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t chip or wear off that easily with me</li>
            <li>but I put a little bit of nail polish thinner in the bottle and it worked perfect</li>
            <li>They cover in one coat which is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I did get two pairs of free earrings.</li>
            <li>All the colors looked great on white plastic,,,so</li>
            <li>When I got the package,I was really excited to try the polish out.</li>
            <li>I assume they&#x27;ll look great if you use a white undercoat first.</li>
            <li>I really like it and plan on ordering more</li>
            <li>I love the colors soooo much</li>
            <li>so there isn&#x27;t really a need for a top coat</li>
            <li>and they sent them to me and arrived quick so thankful to have gotten</li>
            <li>I got these for my wife and she loved the colors, but she was upset at how long it lasted.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite brand of polish.</li>
            <li>:) also the customer service is amazing I was missing two bottles</li>
            <li>The polish is nice and thick with a smooth finish!</li>
            <li>what I do is apply a quick dry top coat</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this brand soon :-)</li>
            <li>But the colors are pretty.</li>
            <li>i finally tried two of the colors and they are adorable.</li>
            <li>and i usually never get excited about anything.</li>
            <li>The manicure does not last more than a day with these nail polish.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very upset because the main reason I purchased these was because I really wanted the shade I didn&#x27;t receive!!</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that I think it chips too easily.  </li>
            <li>I am somewhat of a nail polish snob and have certain brands I tend to stick to, and these passed my tests.</li>
            <li>The colors are actually very opaque, I didn&#x27;t get earrings with it,..</li>
            <li>It is so streaky, takes years to dry, chips so easily, and dries up in the bottle fast.</li>
            <li>right now i have the light blue on my toes and fingernails and yellow on my two ring fingers.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these</li>
            <li>I was also sent a cute little elephant earring as a gift with the set.</li>
            <li>Nice thick colors.</li>
            <li>I even use them in my crafts, they go on even, and stay true to their color, also does not take long to dry, most of the them I only use one coat..</li>
            <li>but it is a yellow other than that I love the colors and the way they look</li>
            <li>my two missing bottles will buy another set from this seller again and if I could give more then 5 stars I would something to be aware of is yes they do take a while to dry</li>
            <li>Long dry time and peels easily</li>
            <li>and I didnt have the right pink I needed to paint cows on another daughters</li>
            <li>these colors are very pretty, but are so intense I am not sure I would call them &#x27;pastel&#x27;</li>
            <li>She put on an overcoat of clear and it still only lasted her a couple of days before she had to repaint them.</li>
            <li>Even on plastic tips it is so thick I had to add nail polish remover to the bottle to smooth it out.</li>
            <li>I was really disappointed because the color is beautiful.</li>
            <li>but when I received mine in the mail I did not receive a pair of earing, and the purple, blue, pink and even the yellow of the nail polishes are very very watery.</li>
            <li>The colors are great, but the polish just peels off.  :(</li>

            <li> and I didnt have the right pink I needed to paint cows on another daughters</li>
            <li> these colors are very pretty, but are so intense I am not sure I would call them &#x27;pastel&#x27;</li>
            <li> She put on an overcoat of clear and it still only lasted her a couple of days before she had to repaint them.</li>
            <li> Even on plastic tips it is so thick I had to add nail polish remover to the bottle to smooth it out.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed because the color is beautiful.</li>
            <li> but when I received mine in the mail I did not receive a pair of earing, and the purple, blue, pink and even the yellow of the nail polishes are very very watery.</li>
            <li> The colors are great, but the polish just peels off.  :(</li>
            <li> I love the colors, but the polish is a little thin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, but not a bad thick.</li>
            <li> yellow is really pale and looks a little white</li>
            <li> and that was pink and purple.</li>
            <li> One day I needed a pink</li>
            <li> so I borrowed the pink from this set.</li>
            <li> Watery not very good cover, don&#x27;t last long on nails, would not buy again</li>
            <li> They are a little bit thick going on so my first time applying one of these polishes was very messy.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the purple yet, but it looks a tad dark.</li>
            <li> but the purple is a lil to dark and</li>
            <li> I use a base, and top coat and put two coats on this on.  </li>
            <li> The colors of the polish are not exactly like the picture and the polish is thick, which takes longer to dry.</li>
            <li> In less than a week it arrived at my house.</li>
            <li> But with a little nail polish remover added to it</li>
            <li> Gave to my little cousins</li>
            <li> Lasts just a few days.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received lots of compliments on my nails lately, the pink is one of my favorites!</li>
            <li> One of the colors is ugly and won&#x27;t be used but other than that they&#x27;re decent quality.</li>
            <li> some are a little thick in the formula</li>
            <li> The polish usually doesn&#x27;t come off until I remove it with nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> I guess some colors are kinda thick and hard to apply.</li>
            <li> When I received them they are kinda thick and goopy.</li>
            <li> Every color I tried was thick and globby.</li>
            <li> I tried thinning it out and no matter what I did, it was still thick.</li>
            <li> She said the polish was way too thick and didn&#x27;t apply well.</li>
            <li> The purple wasn&#x27;t too bad, the pink one was a complete fail!</li>
            <li> They are not good.</li>
            <li> Very thick and dries without a shine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very upset &amp; disappointed. :(</li>
            <li> but I was sadly mistaken.</li>
            <li> I bought this set as a gift for my daughter and she was not impressed.</li>

            <li> They are okay. When I received them they are kinda thick and goopy. I had to add thinner to use</li>
            <li> I saw these in the salon I was at and wanted my own so these shades add just the pop of color I needed to set off the summer right!</li>
            <li> Love the colors and shared with my nail tech . Highly recommend these</li>
            <li> Love this nail polish</li>
            <li> Love the colors! They are a little bit thick going on so my first time applying one of these polishes was very messy. But with a little nail polish remover added to it and bam it&#x27;s great! Love these!</li>
            <li> these are great colors, I love them I stamp my nails also and use a brush to color in with these they are great I even use them in my crafts, they go on even, and stay true to their color, also does not take long to dry, most of the them I only use one coat..</li>
            <li> This nail polish is great! At first I didnt think this nail polish would be too good because it was so cheap. It&#x27;s thick, but not a bad thick. It goes on nicely and you don&#x27;t even need 2 coats. The finished product looks very solid and shiny. Beautiful. And the colors of course are very nice. I haven&#x27;t tried the purple yet, but it looks a tad dark. Still cute. It was delivered perfectly on time, too. In less than a week it arrived at my house. Awesome. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this brand soon :-)</li>
            <li> I purchased these on July 9th. I received these today. I reviewed every color EXCEPT for sheer pastel cocoa!!! Instead I received an orange. I&#x27;m very upset because the main reason I purchased these was because I really wanted the shade I didn&#x27;t receive!! I&#x27;m very upset &amp; disappointed. :(</li>
            <li> in love with all the colors</li>
            <li> Watery not very good cover, don&#x27;t last long on nails, would not buy again</li>
            <li> I love the colors, but the polish is a little thin. All in all there are great for the money</li>
            <li> The polish is nice colors, and the thickness is really nice. Goes on well, and dries well.  The only drawback is that I think it chips too easily.  I use a base, and top coat and put two coats on this on.  Lasts just a few days.</li>
            <li> This is the worst nail polish I have ever used. It is so streaky, takes years to dry, chips so easily, and dries up in the bottle fast. I hate this product and advise you not to buy it.</li>
            <li> Love these nail polishes amazing for stamping which is why I bought them some are a little thick in the formula but I put a little bit of nail polish thinner in the bottle and it worked perfect :) also the customer service is amazing I was missing two bottles and I emailed the seller about this issue and they sent them to me and arrived quick so thankful to have gotten my two missing bottles will buy another set from this seller again and if I could give more then 5 stars I would something to be aware of is yes they do take a while to dry so either try to not do things for a while or what I do is apply a quick dry top coat and it works perfect :)</li>
            <li> We bought these for a cute a tween daughter of our beautician.  Big hit!  Love the colors! Love the value.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on my nail color  it goes so good with my design I really like it and plan on ordering more</li>
            <li> I bought this set for the pastel turquoise. When I got the package,I was really excited to try the polish out. Every color I tried was thick and globby. I tried thinning it out and no matter what I did, it was still thick. I gave up on trying to use them. But the colors are pretty.</li>
            <li> Mmmm its okay I guess some colors are kinda thick and hard to apply. I&#x27;ve only used them once and that was pink and purple. The purple wasn&#x27;t too bad, the pink one was a complete fail! Pastel just isn&#x27;t my thing nail polish wise I guess.</li>
            <li> I just started using kleancolor polish this year and I swear by it. The colors are awesome. The polish is nice and thick with a smooth finish!</li>
            <li> Not that good of Polish,  comes out light &amp; Clumpy</li>
            <li> A gift for my teenage daughter. Thought she would of liked them a bit more then she did. Chips &amp; peels fairly easy</li>
            <li> They are not good. Do not buy. You are wasting your money</li>
            <li> one of my bottles were broke when i received this order</li>
            <li> I like it good colors..looks nice</li>
            <li> LOVE the polishes! They cover in one coat which is fantastic. The colors are so nice! I receive would order again!</li>
            <li> Very thick and dries without a shine. I was upset. I did get two pairs of free earrings. Even on plastic tips it is so thick I had to add nail polish remover to the bottle to smooth it out.</li>
            <li> these colors are very pretty, but are so intense I am not sure I would call them &#x27;pastel&#x27;</li>
            <li> The colors are great, but the polish just peels off.  :(</li>
            <li> i was very excited about ordering these after I read all the good reviews about them. but when I received mine in the mail I did not receive a pair of earing, and the purple, blue, pink and even the yellow of the nail polishes are very very watery. and putting multiple coats didn&#x27;t even help ): . after reading all the good review I didn&#x27;t think I was going to have any problems with them . but I was sadly mistaken. and very disappointed  ): ): ):</li>
            <li> I love the colors soooo much but I just wish it was better quality. Chipps off within 3 days even with a great top coat.&lt;br /&gt; Would reccomend to people who arent nail polish freaks like I am . Gave to my little cousins</li>
            <li> Long dry time and peels easily</li>
            <li> so i have a lot to say about this product.&lt;br /&gt;all good things.&lt;br /&gt;first of all i was sooo happy when it came. then i  took it out of the package and my happiness grew.&lt;br /&gt;so i finally tried two of the colors and they are adorable. right now i have the light blue on my toes and fingernails and yellow on my two ring fingers. colors are great together. one coat does make it streaky but the second coat you defiantly wont see streaks, but all nail polish is meant to be put on with two light coats anyways :)))). im truley happy getting this and i usually never get excited about anything. i recommend this producttt 110%&lt;br /&gt;plus i got cute earinggs for free. what more could you want???</li>
            <li> fatal !! The manicure does not last more than a day with these nail polish. I do not recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful shades!  I haven&#x27;t worn the polish yet, but used all the colors to mark my toothbrush and identify it as mine.  All the colors looked great on white plastic,,,so I assume they&#x27;ll look great if you use a white undercoat first.</li>
            <li> Every color is pastel but the purple is a lil to dark and yellow is really pale and looks a little white but it is a yellow other than that I love the colors and the way they look wasnt happy about the earings they are cute but not on lol but great price and got here before est. delivery</li>
            <li> Good nail polish. Love the colors. Great for spring. Plus the polish is shiny so there isn&#x27;t really a need for a top coat</li>
            <li> Love all these colors! They absolutely go on beautifully and are great for the spring! I&#x27;ve received lots of compliments on my nails lately, the pink is one of my favorites!</li>
            <li> The polish is great, but I didn&#x27;t come with a free earring gift. It came with 2 glitter things to go with the polish...</li>
            <li> Nice colors, great shipping experience</li>
            <li> The colors of the polish are not exactly like the picture and the polish is thick, which takes longer to dry.</li>
            <li> These pastel colors are great for easter time or whenever really. They go on smooth and they look great. Nice quality</li>
            <li> One of my daughters ordered these with her Christmas Amazon money. One day I needed a pink and I didnt have the right pink I needed to paint cows on another daughters toes so I borrowed the pink from this set. It looked so good I did my toes as well! I am VERY impressed at how nice the polish went on and how well it held up. I am somewhat of a nail polish snob and have certain brands I tend to stick to, and these passed my tests. I think I may order a set for myself.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and the polish</li>
            <li> I bought this set as a gift for my daughter and she was not impressed. She said the polish was way too thick and didn&#x27;t apply well. It was a waste of money. I will stick to the better brands from now on.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite brand of polish. I am happy that I got 6 of them at such a great price. These pastel colors are great for easter time or whenever really. They go on smooth and they look great. They don&#x27;t chip or wear off that easily with me so that is another reason to love them. The polish usually doesn&#x27;t come off until I remove it with nail polish remover. I was also sent a cute little elephant earring as a gift with the set. I love it and think it is alot better than the earring gift it said would be sent. I recommend this polish to anyone who loves to paint their nails. :)</li>
            <li> One of the colors is ugly and won&#x27;t be used but other than that they&#x27;re decent quality. Nice thick colors.</li>
            <li> I got these for my wife and she loved the colors, but she was upset at how long it lasted. She put on an overcoat of clear and it still only lasted her a couple of days before she had to repaint them.</li>
            <li> The colors are actually very opaque, I didn&#x27;t get earrings with it,..But I love the colors the bad thing is that my purple polish did not have a brush on it, when I opened it there was just the stick I was really disappointed because the color is beautiful.</li>
