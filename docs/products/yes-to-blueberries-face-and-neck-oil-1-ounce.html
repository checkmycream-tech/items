            <li>A little goes a long way, so the price is worth it.</li>

            <li> Just ok, don&#x27;t see any difference. Like the one I was using much better.</li>
            <li> I usually enjoy most of the products from this line. They are really good at making your skin feel pampered and like you are taking care of it. The blueberry scent threw me off and was hard to get used to, especially with it being on my face all day. I am pretty sensitive to scents and look for products that are not overpowering.  Probably will try a different product next time.</li>
            <li> Excellent for aging skin.</li>
            <li> A bit messy &amp; sticky but worth the price I thought.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  People have complimented my skin so much since I started using this line of products. I always had oily skin and am a total SWEATER but in my older age my skin was needing something (late 30s) and I tried this.  The oil actually helped balanced my skin and it&#x27;s less oily now, even though I still sweat like a ***** in a church house.</li>
            <li> I love this item.  I read about it in a Goodhousekeeping Magazine.  I have been happy with this&lt;br /&gt;product and have been able to stick with using it because the use is so easy!</li>
            <li> My first face oil, and I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  It makes my face so soft and not oily at all.  It only takes a small amount, and I use it every night.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it goes on smooth and absorbs great! My skin can&#x27;t stand most lotions, it sits on top and makes me sweat. This oil absorbs in without an irritating barrier, spreds wonderfully and smells good too! I feel this has mad my skin look more hydrated and even since I started using it. A little goes a long way, so the price is worth it.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, especially for those of us with dry skin. Got my mother in law hooked.</li>
            <li> While I like facial oils and the Yes To brand I&#x27;m not crazy about this product. It smells great - fruity without being fake. I like that its a pretty natural product. I like the oils that come with droppers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like is the texture. It is very heavy and thick, so thick it is difficult to cover your whole face with a few drops withot a lot of rubbing- and i dont want to do a lot of rubbing on my face. It is also slow to absorb -so slow I cant use this if I want to get makeup on right after. My experience with other facial oils is that it is very easy to spread a few drops all over my face and that absorption is fast. I didn&#x27;t use this enough to say whether it has any anti-aging effects, though in my experience those claims are usually exaggerated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Ill be sticking with Loreal age perfect facial oil for the less viscous texture I prefer.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff,.... in the few days I have been using it it has made my skin dewy and people notice how good my skin is looking. You only need a very small amount which is good</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, super soothing and moisturizing. Smells delicious without being perfumey. My husband likes it too!</li>
            <li> My sister-in-law told me about this product, and after using it for a while, I&#x27;ve told others.</li>
            <li> I have to say I honestly love this stuff, I love how it makes my skin look and feel and I love how every time I use it, it smells like I&#x27;m at the spa.</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way! But wow, it smells awesome, feels awesome and is making a difference! I have not broken out from it either, I was a little concerned about a face and neck oil. I have used nightly for a month and tonight my husband said out of nowhere that my skin looked really nice!? So, yes...I will keep using this!</li>
            <li> My face is velvety soft and moisturized after using this product.  I no longer have to use more expensive products. I also like that it is natural and a little goes a long way.  I recommend.</li>
            <li> I realize I needed something very moisturizing at night, and I&#x27;ve read that oil form is the easiest to absorb, so I gave this a try.  Overnight, it made my skin super smooth!  Smoother than I&#x27;ve ever seen it.  I was using a serum underneath it.  Can&#x27;t get away with using one product at a time anymore.  I was also a bit afraid of oil clogging my pores and acne, but none flared up so far.  I&#x27;m going to use this over my retinol cream too,  or somehow fit it into my multi-product routine that I need a chart to keep track of!</li>
