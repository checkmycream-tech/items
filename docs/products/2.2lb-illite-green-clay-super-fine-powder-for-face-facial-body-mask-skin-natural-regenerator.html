            <li>Very nice clay to work with.  </li>
            <li>in papers and plastic tape, very nicely.</li>
            <li>and I have to say that I really loved it.</li>
            <li>This is not the best clay mask, it&#x27;s cheap for a reason.  </li>
            <li>He was a pleasure to deal with and the product itself was of good quality.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a good thing though.  </li>
            <li>Good product and good price.</li>
            <li>It is a good clay I do like it</li>
            <li>Just watch a youtube video (clairedelys i think) on making a gentler mask with this, and youre good to go.</li>
            <li>and I loved it.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>being said, the product seems good quality and is a generous amount for the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that good a price, I felt.</li>
            <li>It does detox perfect and u even lose inches of toxic water as u sweet under the foil.</li>
            <li>Overall, it is an excellent product for an excellent price.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;this is not so great if buying it for facials---too harsh---perhaps for tougher body parts, feet/tongue, it would be ok.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I love this clay!</li>
            <li>That would probably cost him more than I even paid for the clay!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>and i still have most of the product!</li>
            <li>The package arrived on time, hand wrapped (with love!)</li>
            <li>If u plus wrap in a foil u will feel amazing after 20min.</li>
            <li>Great product fantastic service</li>
            <li>skin feels amazing, tightened and refreshed.</li>
            <li>but I decided to do one for this item specifically just because I really liked the product.</li>
            <li>It tightens pores nicely.</li>
            <li>When I decided to make my own powder foundation, I knew I needed this product.  </li>
            <li>Great product, everything in the description is definitely true about it!was</li>
            <li>You would want to strain thru a very fine cloth or seive to remove them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product and very fast shipping</li>
            <li>/&gt;It mixes to a very smooth paste</li>

            <li>I love this face mask.</li>
            <li>The seller contacted me via email (seeing as how this was coming from Portugal to Oklahoma) and kept in touch to make sure it arrived on time and wasn&#x27;t damaged.  </li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>just more wrinkles i could say.</li>
            <li>Absolutely perfect for my personal uses.</li>
            <li>I am definetly looking forward to using this product and will definetly order more if I see the results I need.</li>
            <li>I love this clay.</li>
            <li>But overall best gift from the earth to your skin.</li>
            <li>Plus, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it has many minerals in it.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Will buy more of this product, works well for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful multi-usages stuff, used internally or externally.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>It does make an awesome facial mask.</li>
            <li>This is actually the best deal I have ever got from an Amazon purchase.</li>
            <li>My wife and daughters love it.</li>
            <li>I tried to steer the grittier parts to the parts that needed more grit, like my elbows.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d purchased this for use in skincare, but will not be able to use it for any product intended for use on the face.</li>
            <li>Better protected than Fort Knox.  </li>
            <li>All is well though, the clay is good and the price is right.</li>
            <li>My face felt very clean after I washed the mud off.</li>
            <li>I feel very clean .after.  </li>
            <li>Green clay is marvelous -- amazing price as well.</li>
            <li>It came very well wrapped and in good condition</li>
            <li>This product was very affordable and the quality was surprisingly good</li>
            <li>Also, to be fair, I knew right away it would not be a quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>Easy to work with,</li>
            <li>easy to apply (just googled instructions)</li>
            <li>I received my package very quickly.</li>
            <li>Came very quickly.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s easy to use and I can use it as an exfoliant before letting it settle as a mask.</li>
            <li>it easy to spread and wash off</li>
            <li>You can feel the mask working, but it is strong</li>
            <li>Very good product, lasts a long time (and I use it up to 3 times a week).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m am using it in my facial soap bars and it works beautifully.</li>
            <li>Overall I think this clay is really great and works nicely, but I really recommend it if you have some acne or acne scars that you want to get rid of if you decide to use it as a face mask :)</li>
            <li>highly recommend for this product was sent to me, I am very satisfied and pleased, because if there was a mistake on their part, they will correct it right away, I say this from experience, and always hasen effort that we as customers are satisfied.</li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t fine</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fine artist</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product elsewhere and paid a lot more money to get a super fine product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is not as super fine as I was expecting; I put it into a mason jar for storage and got some interesting sediment layers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This will work fine for my intended use, which is body wraps.  </li>
            <li>I even forgot i ordered it and got a bit of a chill when i found this package that looked like a huge block of powder dugs in my mailbox.</li>
            <li>This green clay is awesome stuff</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always tried to find the replacement of &amp;#34;Burt&#x27;s Bees Pore Refining Mask&amp;#34; after it&#x27;s no longer available in the market.</li>
            <li>I feel comfortable.</li>
            <li>Green clay truly is mother nature at her best!</li>
            <li>The shipping was surprisingly fast which was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li>Lovely silky feel and a fresh scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic product for using in clay masks and bath products.</li>
            <li>And the seller is fantastic on service.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>Thnx a lot i am very satisfied with it ,it very fine clay for both facial of face &amp; body.</li>
            <li>Makes the skin smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t label this clay as super fine powder.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product and my skin is still looking great after lasting the whole day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered this clay because the price/quantity and super fine clay ( it&#x27;s supposed to treat deeper)  </li>
            <li>I am pretty sure I am under surveillance by law enforcement as we speak....</li>
            <li>Then again, I am not a cosmetic scientist and this may be what super fine means in that industry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>luck with whatever fun project you are doing!</li>
            <li>The mask was very pleasant and it made my skin super smooth although it dried out the skin.</li>
            <li>The combination works perfectly and I really like the results - better even than the masks I&#x27;d been buying all these years - leaving smooth skin texture and small pores.</li>
            <li>It even came packaged in a foreign newspaper, which was fascinating to read :)</li>
            <li>This is the second time I have ordered this product, and i am not only impressed with how clear it leaves my skin in a short amount of time, but also the customer service is excellent too...</li>
            <li>I used it to make a diy face powder I have also mixed with water to make a mask I have had good results with both.</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t use it more than maybe once per week, as it is very drying.</li>
            <li>And nobody can blame the seller for the slow shipping, so I am 100% happy with this clay, this transaction, and this seller!!</li>
            <li>Good service overall.  </li>
            <li>Fresh dry clay great for acne prone oily skin.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a good clay quality with quick result when mixed with olive oil</li>
            <li>Super fine in this instance does not mean silky and soft like a really good baby powder.  </li>
            <li>I revived my order quickly considering the distance...  </li>
            <li>I got it the next day, and was very impressed with his understanding of my concern, as well as the offer to ship international with tracking!</li>
            <li>I love the natural way to smooth my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Anyways over all feels wonderful and will continue to use until this is gone, but will probably use a different product next time I buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>A little grainy but mixing it together more effectively gives a smooth mask.</li>
            <li>He gave me a good idea why it might be delayed, and how long it might be.</li>
            <li>after using it for the first time, i got good result instantly.</li>
            <li>Exactly what i was expecting!</li>
            <li>Pulls out black heads very effective.</li>
            <li>This has been a great addition to my skin care regimen and would recommend this to anyone looking for a product without harsh chemicals to brighten up your skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used and made a lot of face masks in my life and this was my favorite one so far.  </li>
            <li>Not a miracle product but worth a try.</li>
            <li>it worth it.</li>
            <li>I bought this clay for two purposes, facial masks and making my own makeup.</li>
            <li>Really nice personal note attached.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>but it was worth it.</li>
            <li>This product comes from Portugal and it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very clean and soft afterwards.  </li>
            <li>improved my roseacea and shaving issues right away.  </li>
            <li>It might be too dark for fair skin.</li>
            <li>It arrived right on time and was exactly what I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li>Yes, there are larger particles that you should probably either sift out or sift and crush (maybe if you have a mortar and pestle?), but the clay does a great job for a facial mask.</li>
            <li>Just make sure that you read carefully the directions specially if you mix it with water and drink it.</li>
            <li>I love how tight it gets when it dries and how easily it rinses off.</li>
            <li>and I liked it because the product wasn&#x27;t damaged like I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>The bag looks exactly like the photo.  </li>
            <li>None of it spilled out and I was able to open it without any problems.  </li>
            <li>I felt my skin become smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I got the package a bit late but the product looks great.</li>
            <li>u have a mask for the whole body!</li>
            <li>I am really amazed by this product!</li>
            <li>Most of it is powder and dissolved in liquid, but there were prominent small rocks(?)</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>So when the first shipment didn&#x27;t get to me, I emailed the seller and he immediately apologized and resent the item.</li>
            <li>and this is my first time ever using it</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how secure the packaging was.</li>
            <li>really penetrates and &amp;#34;cleans&amp;#34; out the gunk in your pores!</li>
            <li>more thing: directions aren&#x27;t in English.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the clay!</li>
            <li>It did an ok job tightening the pores on my nose, but the misleading description makes me concerned about what the actual ingredients are.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I saw a difference in my arms and stomach after the first use.</li>
            <li>Works better than any commercial ready-made mask I&#x27;ve tried, (and I&#x27;ve tried a LOT).</li>
            <li>and I could noticeably see an improvement in my pores with in the first week, and also apply to my neck.</li>
            <li>There are many different qualities of clay in the market</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Also, I used it as a mask on my face and it&#x27;s very soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I have purchased green clay before and it was great; but this was definitely not green clay.</li>
            <li>The item has been exactly as described and very well packaged to preserve purity&lt;</li>
            <li>Add water or favorite oil and apply to face as a mask remove when dry use it one or two times a week.</li>
            <li>Pure delight to use.  </li>
            <li>And it did have to travel across a large body of water.</li>
            <li>My skin feels amazing, the mask gets extremely tight when it dries.</li>
            <li>No actual complaints, but when a product labels itself as &amp;#34;super fine&amp;#34; i am expecting baby powder fine.</li>
            <li>it can be a bit messy but that is easy to clean up.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something that needs to be perfectly smooth and has very microscopic granules, you will need to sift it and maybe pulverize further to achieve that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t get acne as much anymore.</li>
            <li>It was wrapped very well to prevent damage.</li>
            <li>My solution is to mix the clay 50/50  with a cheap, commercial mask to help it stick to my skin.  </li>
            <li>No tracking number to track and seller wants to blame the USPS.  </li>
            <li>Now I know I don&#x27;t really have an &amp;#34;adult acne&amp;#34</li>
            <li>But it came, and it was very well packaged.</li>
            <li>Very well wrapped.</li>
            <li>fast shipping, item was as described</li>
            <li>It was very neat.  </li>
            <li>When you remove the mask also, DONT RUB IT OFF with a washcloth unless you sift it really well..</li>
            <li>I find it to be very cost</li>
            <li>Much appreciated.  </li>
            <li>and my skin has responded very well both times.</li>
            <li>company send this much sooner,that was my expectation.</li>
            <li>I have also very oily hair</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>At best this is a disappointment,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s become harder to find a good, reasonably-priced facial clay mask.  </li>
            <li>The clay itself is nice and green.</li>
            <li>I bought this after seeing a pinterest post about how to make my own anti-shine powder using green clay, coco powder, and cornstarch.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t find the recommended clay at the grocery store</li>
            <li>I was very satisfied overall, but be ready for a long wait!</li>
            <li>After much research, I ordered this very fine green powder coming from Europe where they use it a lot more than in other countries.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure the color has much to do with anything, to be honest.</li>
            <li>The shipment date when you order, etc, is pretty clear about that.  </li>
            <li>The powder has no grass or other natural refreshing elements scent like Burt&#x27;s Bees, just pure dirt.</li>
            <li>Had a lot of tiny pebbles inside the clay -- would have loved if this was 100% soft like powdered sugar like the other clays come.</li>
            <li>I use many different clays to make beauty products, or poultices for injuries, some of them I use internally.</li>
            <li>It is a main cause of Dermatitus for one thing, it&#x27;s a metal, its toxic.</li>
            <li>To give u a fine texture that u want u need to mix it with very little hot water!</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend ..</li>
            <li>Great product, which i can tell by comparing few other brands/kinds of clay i used before.</li>
            <li>Grind is not as fine as I expected.  </li>
            <li>(My bentonite clay is smooth and slippery when it is wet.)</li>
            <li>Anyway the clay itself is more gray than green</li>
            <li>Or perhaps this is normal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quality is one that is rare and its so simple to use.</li>
            <li>I never got the first shipment because it was apparently confiscated by someone probably who said \\&quot;Ooh</li>
            <li>I am hoping to be able to use it as an ingredient in a body or foot scrub, so the purchase won&#x27;t be a waste of money.</li>
            <li>I have other ckays that are fine</li>
            <li>Has made pores less obvious and gives a nice lift.</li>
            <li>Clay is just the way I expected to be: natural and easy to apply on skin.</li>
            <li>Because of it&#x27;s super fine grain, a little bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it for a face mask, and recommend it for anti shine powder if you have a more olive or dark skin tone.  </li>
            <li>It was gray/brown and very coarse with a lot of grains in it, not the super fine green power I was expecting.</li>
            <li>This is the only time I actually got the genuine clay as advertised.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin (rosacea).</li>
            <li>An enormous amount of clay for a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Your skin feel very clean, firm and softly.</li>
            <li>It makes my face so soft!</li>
            <li>With only three spoons of clay and two spoons of hot water</li>
            <li>The clay is grainy, not super fine like my bentonite clays.</li>
            <li>my bag was not super fine powder---lots of granules sand size and larger!&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s actually pretty rocky almost like regular sand</li>
            <li>This is not a super fine clay.</li>
            <li>Shipping costs very reasonable and the product arrived much sooner than expected.  </li>
            <li>There was just a little bit of graininess to the powder, some particles that were not quite so fine, but if you don&#x27;t mind a bit of exfoliation, it isn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was well worth the wait and price since French Green Clay in the US costs double the price and is sold in smaller amounts.&lt;br /&gt;The package was well wrapped, had a laugh with my friends about how secure it</li>
            <li>this stuff does not look green, its not even fine powder like it says it is.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unless you&#x27;re hoping to impress someone with the green-ness of your clay mask (if they aren&#x27;t scared and run away first hehe ;-) ), then I will be picking this product over a super green looking mask that either has additives or is just way more expensive.</li>
            <li>clay itself still seems to be of a high quality, but in case others are interested in/concerned about the specific color of the clay you get, you may want to buy a different product.</li>
            <li>The clay wasn&#x27;t fine enough there were large sharp pcs left.</li>
            <li>so I can clearly see a difference, but</li>
            <li>Skin was refreshed and stayed clear for days afterwards.</li>
            <li>It felt soothing and really soft on my skin.  </li>
            <li>My face felt baby soft after I washed the clay off my face.  </li>
            <li>So far I like it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tried this on my face, and I really like the results.</li>
            <li>Next time I will be going to my whole foods market and picking it up in bulk.</li>
            <li>Very well done, I would definitely go through this company again.</li>
            <li>I actually really appreciated the extra thought.</li>
            <li>Splash water on directly to loosen.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much 2.2 lbs was, but I&#x27;ll be using it for the next decade.</li>
            <li>and I am an adult...</li>
            <li>Use it as a mask, after rinsing your face will feel soft.</li>
            <li>But my nose is hyper sensitive.</li>
            <li>the homeland&#x27;s natural health and beauty product industry?</li>
            <li>The course, gravely texture really surprised me.</li>
            <li>I am a ceramicist and creator of a line of natural skincare-</li>
            <li>, THIS IS NOT GREEN CLAY (bentonite).  </li>
            <li>What I received was not green clay.</li>
            <li>(stay tuned as I have never done this before and may be completely inept)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Left my skin smoother, most of the dead skin and excess oils gone after just one application..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a terrible product, but I&#x27;ve gotten higher quality for less, not to mention it has a small quantity.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While the small grains might be problematic for some applications, this will work just fine for my intended use.</li>
            <li>The product I received, in different packaging, was not completely super fine.  </li>
            <li>although everything is in another language :) Really thought it would take a long time to get here for the low price I paid, but it was here in a little over a week!</li>
            <li>delivered sooner than expected and the cost for the delivery was very reasonable ( comes from Portugal</li>
            <li>i really like this green clay, after a facial mask i can feel and see that my face is soft, hydrates and looks fresh.</li>
            <li>Product is exactly what I expected to receive based on the reviews and product description.  </li>
            <li>but that was only because this came from Portugal and not inside the US where I live.</li>
            <li>I have mature, aging yet sensitive, acne skin and gives instant relieve.</li>
            <li>I love this product, a little goes a long way and it will last forever.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and allergies that caused a rash to appear on my hairline recently.  </li>
            <li>I read the other reviews before I ordered and this was exactly what i wanted</li>
            <li>I leave the large particles in and just try to be careful when applying/rinsing the mask.</li>
            <li>I do have oily uneven skin with tendency for breakouts and after the first usage I already see the results!</li>
            <li>it just needs a little more work to break it down...</li>
            <li>This product has helped to clear my skin and has multiple uses!</li>
            <li>Apparently Homeland Security is on the lookout for natural health and beauty products that could possibly endanger, uh...</li>
            <li>I have ordered this product from five different places, but none of those were genuine French green illite clay.</li>
            <li>A previous comment stated that it wasn&#x27;t green clay; I don&#x27;t agree - it IS more of an army green, so it&#x27;s more grey-green, but the clay does the job sucking everything out the way that dirt/mud (previous comment) wouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I read quite a few reviews that stated that this product has lots of grit and should be sifted and they were right.</li>
            <li>My hairs have stopped to fall down like it was usually with many others shampoos that I tried.  </li>
            <li>This will last a long long time,as it makes so much with just alittle of the powder.</li>
            <li>Since I have been using this green clay, it had really clears up and prevented breakouts!</li>
            <li>This particular one, I will use to make cleansing grains due to its texture.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t green clay, and it&#x27;s not a super fine powder.</li>
            <li>apparently super fine means kinda gritty, but its not so bad</li>
            <li>This green clay is of very high quality.</li>
            <li>This green clay is of very high quality.  </li>

            <li> in papers and plastic tape, very nicely.</li>
            <li> and I have to say that I really loved it.</li>
            <li> This is not the best clay mask, it&#x27;s cheap for a reason.  </li>
            <li> He was a pleasure to deal with and the product itself was of good quality.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a good thing though.  </li>
            <li> Good product and good price.</li>
            <li> It is a good clay I do like it</li>
            <li> Just watch a youtube video (clairedelys i think) on making a gentler mask with this, and youre good to go.</li>
            <li> and I loved it.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> being said, the product seems good quality and is a generous amount for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that good a price, I felt.</li>
            <li> It does detox perfect and u even lose inches of toxic water as u sweet under the foil.</li>
            <li> Overall, it is an excellent product for an excellent price.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;this is not so great if buying it for facials---too harsh---perhaps for tougher body parts, feet/tongue, it would be ok.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this clay!</li>
            <li> That would probably cost him more than I even paid for the clay!</li>

            <li> and i still have most of the product!</li>
            <li> The package arrived on time, hand wrapped (with love!)</li>

            <li> It tightens pores nicely.</li>
            <li> When I decided to make my own powder foundation, I knew I needed this product.  </li>
            <li> Great product, everything in the description is definitely true about it!was</li>
            <li> You would want to strain thru a very fine cloth or seive to remove them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> /&gt;It mixes to a very smooth paste</li>

            <li> It does make an awesome facial mask.</li>
            <li> This is actually the best deal I have ever got from an Amazon purchase.</li>
            <li> My wife and daughters love it.</li>
            <li> I tried to steer the grittier parts to the parts that needed more grit, like my elbows.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d purchased this for use in skincare, but will not be able to use it for any product intended for use on the face.</li>
            <li> Better protected than Fort Knox.  </li>
            <li> All is well though, the clay is good and the price is right.</li>
            <li> My face felt very clean after I washed the mud off.</li>
            <li> I feel very clean .after.  </li>
            <li> Green clay is marvelous -- amazing price as well.</li>
            <li> It came very well wrapped and in good condition</li>
            <li> This product was very affordable and the quality was surprisingly good</li>
            <li> Also, to be fair, I knew right away it would not be a quick delivery.  </li>
            <li> Easy to work with,</li>
            <li> easy to apply (just googled instructions)</li>
            <li> I received my package very quickly.</li>
            <li> Came very quickly.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s easy to use and I can use it as an exfoliant before letting it settle as a mask.</li>
            <li> it easy to spread and wash off</li>
            <li> You can feel the mask working, but it is strong</li>
            <li> Very good product, lasts a long time (and I use it up to 3 times a week).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m am using it in my facial soap bars and it works beautifully.</li>
            <li> Overall I think this clay is really great and works nicely, but I really recommend it if you have some acne or acne scars that you want to get rid of if you decide to use it as a face mask :)</li>
            <li> highly recommend for this product was sent to me, I am very satisfied and pleased, because if there was a mistake on their part, they will correct it right away, I say this from experience, and always hasen effort that we as customers are satisfied.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t fine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fine artist</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product elsewhere and paid a lot more money to get a super fine product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not as super fine as I was expecting; I put it into a mason jar for storage and got some interesting sediment layers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This will work fine for my intended use, which is body wraps.  </li>
            <li> I even forgot i ordered it and got a bit of a chill when i found this package that looked like a huge block of powder dugs in my mailbox.</li>
            <li> This green clay is awesome stuff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always tried to find the replacement of &amp;#34;Burt&#x27;s Bees Pore Refining Mask&amp;#34; after it&#x27;s no longer available in the market.</li>
            <li> I feel comfortable.</li>
            <li> Green clay truly is mother nature at her best!</li>
            <li> The shipping was surprisingly fast which was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li> Lovely silky feel and a fresh scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fantastic product for using in clay masks and bath products.</li>
            <li> And the seller is fantastic on service.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> Thnx a lot i am very satisfied with it ,it very fine clay for both facial of face &amp; body.</li>
            <li> Makes the skin smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t label this clay as super fine powder.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product and my skin is still looking great after lasting the whole day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this clay because the price/quantity and super fine clay ( it&#x27;s supposed to treat deeper)  </li>
            <li> I am pretty sure I am under surveillance by law enforcement as we speak....</li>
            <li> Then again, I am not a cosmetic scientist and this may be what super fine means in that industry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> luck with whatever fun project you are doing!</li>
            <li> The mask was very pleasant and it made my skin super smooth although it dried out the skin.</li>
            <li> The combination works perfectly and I really like the results - better even than the masks I&#x27;d been buying all these years - leaving smooth skin texture and small pores.</li>
            <li> It even came packaged in a foreign newspaper, which was fascinating to read :)</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have ordered this product, and i am not only impressed with how clear it leaves my skin in a short amount of time, but also the customer service is excellent too...</li>
            <li> I used it to make a diy face powder I have also mixed with water to make a mask I have had good results with both.</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t use it more than maybe once per week, as it is very drying.</li>
            <li> And nobody can blame the seller for the slow shipping, so I am 100% happy with this clay, this transaction, and this seller!!</li>
            <li> Good service overall.  </li>
            <li> Fresh dry clay great for acne prone oily skin.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a good clay quality with quick result when mixed with olive oil</li>
            <li> Super fine in this instance does not mean silky and soft like a really good baby powder.  </li>
            <li> I revived my order quickly considering the distance...  </li>
            <li> I got it the next day, and was very impressed with his understanding of my concern, as well as the offer to ship international with tracking!</li>
            <li> I love the natural way to smooth my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Anyways over all feels wonderful and will continue to use until this is gone, but will probably use a different product next time I buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> A little grainy but mixing it together more effectively gives a smooth mask.</li>
            <li> He gave me a good idea why it might be delayed, and how long it might be.</li>
            <li> after using it for the first time, i got good result instantly.</li>
            <li> Exactly what i was expecting!</li>
            <li> Pulls out black heads very effective.</li>
            <li> This has been a great addition to my skin care regimen and would recommend this to anyone looking for a product without harsh chemicals to brighten up your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used and made a lot of face masks in my life and this was my favorite one so far.  </li>
            <li> Not a miracle product but worth a try.</li>
            <li> it worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought this clay for two purposes, facial masks and making my own makeup.</li>
            <li> Really nice personal note attached.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> but it was worth it.</li>
            <li> This product comes from Portugal and it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> My skin feels very clean and soft afterwards.  </li>
            <li> improved my roseacea and shaving issues right away.  </li>
            <li> It might be too dark for fair skin.</li>
            <li> It arrived right on time and was exactly what I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li> Yes, there are larger particles that you should probably either sift out or sift and crush (maybe if you have a mortar and pestle?), but the clay does a great job for a facial mask.</li>
            <li> Just make sure that you read carefully the directions specially if you mix it with water and drink it.</li>
            <li> I love how tight it gets when it dries and how easily it rinses off.</li>
            <li> and I liked it because the product wasn&#x27;t damaged like I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> The bag looks exactly like the photo.  </li>
            <li> None of it spilled out and I was able to open it without any problems.  </li>
            <li> I felt my skin become smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I got the package a bit late but the product looks great.</li>
            <li> u have a mask for the whole body!</li>
            <li> I am really amazed by this product!</li>
            <li> Most of it is powder and dissolved in liquid, but there were prominent small rocks(?)</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> So when the first shipment didn&#x27;t get to me, I emailed the seller and he immediately apologized and resent the item.</li>
            <li> and this is my first time ever using it</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how secure the packaging was.</li>
            <li> really penetrates and &amp;#34;cleans&amp;#34; out the gunk in your pores!</li>
            <li> more thing: directions aren&#x27;t in English.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the clay!</li>
            <li> It did an ok job tightening the pores on my nose, but the misleading description makes me concerned about what the actual ingredients are.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I saw a difference in my arms and stomach after the first use.</li>
            <li> Works better than any commercial ready-made mask I&#x27;ve tried, (and I&#x27;ve tried a LOT).</li>
            <li> and I could noticeably see an improvement in my pores with in the first week, and also apply to my neck.</li>
            <li> There are many different qualities of clay in the market</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Also, I used it as a mask on my face and it&#x27;s very soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I have purchased green clay before and it was great; but this was definitely not green clay.</li>
            <li> The item has been exactly as described and very well packaged to preserve purity&lt;</li>
            <li> Add water or favorite oil and apply to face as a mask remove when dry use it one or two times a week.</li>
            <li> Pure delight to use.  </li>
            <li> And it did have to travel across a large body of water.</li>
            <li> My skin feels amazing, the mask gets extremely tight when it dries.</li>
            <li> No actual complaints, but when a product labels itself as &amp;#34;super fine&amp;#34; i am expecting baby powder fine.</li>
            <li> it can be a bit messy but that is easy to clean up.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something that needs to be perfectly smooth and has very microscopic granules, you will need to sift it and maybe pulverize further to achieve that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t get acne as much anymore.</li>
            <li> It was wrapped very well to prevent damage.</li>
            <li> My solution is to mix the clay 50/50  with a cheap, commercial mask to help it stick to my skin.  </li>
            <li> No tracking number to track and seller wants to blame the USPS.  </li>
            <li> Now I know I don&#x27;t really have an &amp;#34;adult acne&amp;#34</li>
            <li> But it came, and it was very well packaged.</li>
            <li> Very well wrapped.</li>
            <li> fast shipping, item was as described</li>
            <li> It was very neat.  </li>
            <li> When you remove the mask also, DONT RUB IT OFF with a washcloth unless you sift it really well..</li>
            <li> I find it to be very cost</li>
            <li> Much appreciated.  </li>
            <li> and my skin has responded very well both times.</li>
            <li> company send this much sooner,that was my expectation.</li>
            <li> I have also very oily hair</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> At best this is a disappointment,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s become harder to find a good, reasonably-priced facial clay mask.  </li>
            <li> The clay itself is nice and green.</li>
            <li> I bought this after seeing a pinterest post about how to make my own anti-shine powder using green clay, coco powder, and cornstarch.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t find the recommended clay at the grocery store</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied overall, but be ready for a long wait!</li>
            <li> After much research, I ordered this very fine green powder coming from Europe where they use it a lot more than in other countries.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure the color has much to do with anything, to be honest.</li>
            <li> The shipment date when you order, etc, is pretty clear about that.  </li>
            <li> The powder has no grass or other natural refreshing elements scent like Burt&#x27;s Bees, just pure dirt.</li>
            <li> Had a lot of tiny pebbles inside the clay -- would have loved if this was 100% soft like powdered sugar like the other clays come.</li>
            <li> I use many different clays to make beauty products, or poultices for injuries, some of them I use internally.</li>
            <li> It is a main cause of Dermatitus for one thing, it&#x27;s a metal, its toxic.</li>
            <li> To give u a fine texture that u want u need to mix it with very little hot water!</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend ..</li>
            <li> Great product, which i can tell by comparing few other brands/kinds of clay i used before.</li>
            <li> Grind is not as fine as I expected.  </li>
            <li> (My bentonite clay is smooth and slippery when it is wet.)</li>
            <li> Anyway the clay itself is more gray than green</li>
            <li> Or perhaps this is normal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quality is one that is rare and its so simple to use.</li>
            <li> I never got the first shipment because it was apparently confiscated by someone probably who said \\&quot;Ooh</li>
            <li> I am hoping to be able to use it as an ingredient in a body or foot scrub, so the purchase won&#x27;t be a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have other ckays that are fine</li>
            <li> Has made pores less obvious and gives a nice lift.</li>
            <li> Clay is just the way I expected to be: natural and easy to apply on skin.</li>
            <li> Because of it&#x27;s super fine grain, a little bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it for a face mask, and recommend it for anti shine powder if you have a more olive or dark skin tone.  </li>
            <li> It was gray/brown and very coarse with a lot of grains in it, not the super fine green power I was expecting.</li>
            <li> This is the only time I actually got the genuine clay as advertised.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin (rosacea).</li>
            <li> An enormous amount of clay for a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Your skin feel very clean, firm and softly.</li>
            <li> It makes my face so soft!</li>
            <li> With only three spoons of clay and two spoons of hot water</li>
            <li> The clay is grainy, not super fine like my bentonite clays.</li>
            <li> my bag was not super fine powder---lots of granules sand size and larger!&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s actually pretty rocky almost like regular sand</li>
            <li> This is not a super fine clay.</li>
            <li> Shipping costs very reasonable and the product arrived much sooner than expected.  </li>
            <li> There was just a little bit of graininess to the powder, some particles that were not quite so fine, but if you don&#x27;t mind a bit of exfoliation, it isn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was well worth the wait and price since French Green Clay in the US costs double the price and is sold in smaller amounts.&lt;br /&gt;The package was well wrapped, had a laugh with my friends about how secure it</li>
            <li> this stuff does not look green, its not even fine powder like it says it is.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;re hoping to impress someone with the green-ness of your clay mask (if they aren&#x27;t scared and run away first hehe ;-) ), then I will be picking this product over a super green looking mask that either has additives or is just way more expensive.</li>
            <li> clay itself still seems to be of a high quality, but in case others are interested in/concerned about the specific color of the clay you get, you may want to buy a different product.</li>
            <li> The clay wasn&#x27;t fine enough there were large sharp pcs left.</li>
            <li> so I can clearly see a difference, but</li>
            <li> Skin was refreshed and stayed clear for days afterwards.</li>
            <li> It felt soothing and really soft on my skin.  </li>
            <li> My face felt baby soft after I washed the clay off my face.  </li>
            <li> So far I like it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried this on my face, and I really like the results.</li>
            <li> Next time I will be going to my whole foods market and picking it up in bulk.</li>
            <li> Very well done, I would definitely go through this company again.</li>
            <li> I actually really appreciated the extra thought.</li>
            <li> Splash water on directly to loosen.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much 2.2 lbs was, but I&#x27;ll be using it for the next decade.</li>
            <li> and I am an adult...</li>
            <li> Use it as a mask, after rinsing your face will feel soft.</li>
            <li> But my nose is hyper sensitive.</li>
            <li> the homeland&#x27;s natural health and beauty product industry?</li>
            <li> The course, gravely texture really surprised me.</li>
            <li> I am a ceramicist and creator of a line of natural skincare-</li>
            <li> , THIS IS NOT GREEN CLAY (bentonite).  </li>
            <li> What I received was not green clay.</li>
            <li> (stay tuned as I have never done this before and may be completely inept)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Left my skin smoother, most of the dead skin and excess oils gone after just one application..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a terrible product, but I&#x27;ve gotten higher quality for less, not to mention it has a small quantity.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While the small grains might be problematic for some applications, this will work just fine for my intended use.</li>
            <li> The product I received, in different packaging, was not completely super fine.  </li>
            <li> although everything is in another language :) Really thought it would take a long time to get here for the low price I paid, but it was here in a little over a week!</li>
            <li> delivered sooner than expected and the cost for the delivery was very reasonable ( comes from Portugal</li>
            <li> i really like this green clay, after a facial mask i can feel and see that my face is soft, hydrates and looks fresh.</li>
            <li> Product is exactly what I expected to receive based on the reviews and product description.  </li>
            <li> but that was only because this came from Portugal and not inside the US where I live.</li>
            <li> I have mature, aging yet sensitive, acne skin and gives instant relieve.</li>
            <li> I love this product, a little goes a long way and it will last forever.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and allergies that caused a rash to appear on my hairline recently.  </li>
            <li> I read the other reviews before I ordered and this was exactly what i wanted</li>
            <li> I leave the large particles in and just try to be careful when applying/rinsing the mask.</li>
            <li> I do have oily uneven skin with tendency for breakouts and after the first usage I already see the results!</li>
            <li> it just needs a little more work to break it down...</li>
            <li> This product has helped to clear my skin and has multiple uses!</li>
            <li> Apparently Homeland Security is on the lookout for natural health and beauty products that could possibly endanger, uh...</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product from five different places, but none of those were genuine French green illite clay.</li>
            <li> A previous comment stated that it wasn&#x27;t green clay; I don&#x27;t agree - it IS more of an army green, so it&#x27;s more grey-green, but the clay does the job sucking everything out the way that dirt/mud (previous comment) wouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I read quite a few reviews that stated that this product has lots of grit and should be sifted and they were right.</li>
            <li> My hairs have stopped to fall down like it was usually with many others shampoos that I tried.  </li>
            <li> This will last a long long time,as it makes so much with just alittle of the powder.</li>
            <li> Since I have been using this green clay, it had really clears up and prevented breakouts!</li>
            <li> This particular one, I will use to make cleansing grains due to its texture.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t green clay, and it&#x27;s not a super fine powder.</li>
            <li> apparently super fine means kinda gritty, but its not so bad</li>
            <li> This green clay is of very high quality.</li>
            <li> This green clay is of very high quality.  </li>
            <li> The particle size is not consistent, there are large (for clay) sharp pieces that actually cut my skin.  </li>
            <li> it can certainly handle my little boo-boos!</li>
            <li> I left the finer stuff in a mask (about a 1:1 water:clay ratio) on my face, neck and chest, and since about a teaspoon covered those areas and still had some left over, this will last a long time with once a week use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t know what to expect from &#x27;green clay&#x27; and this clay is definitely more grey than green, but it blended well with the other ingredients for my powder makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The color was definitely more on the grey side, compared with French Green clays I have purchased in the past from other companies, but I don&#x27;t know if that affects the quality in any way.</li>
            <li> The packaging was extremely secure, almost to the point that it was difficult to get it open.</li>
            <li> , the only down side is that it looks bigger in the picture on line than it actually is.</li>
            <li> So now my face doesn&#x27;t feel dry nor do I worry about psoriasis as much..and dry scaly facial skin issues.</li>
            <li> It does take a long time to receive,but considering where it is coming from that is understandable.</li>
            <li> This clay is not super fine like the advertisement said, and i didnt find that it was particularly green either it was like ordinary gray clay</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a muddy grey color.</li>
            <li> There were actually a few tiny  (really tiny) bits of sand that obviously did not dissolve.  </li>
            <li> This stuff lasts LONG!</li>
            <li> It takes about 10 minutes to dry</li>
            <li> I could feel the dry parts pull.</li>
            <li> only thing I could possibly complain about is that the clay is not finely sifted.  </li>
            <li> The most unpleasant shopping experience on Amazon.</li>
            <li> As shampoo,  I rinse with water mixed up with a little cider vinager.</li>
            <li> The package was as described and wrapped a few extra times in case of leakage.</li>
            <li> Clay came sooner than expected.  </li>
            <li> I received it around the time it was expected, coming from Portugal and all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used it with a kelp treatment and French Green Clay.</li>
            <li> took a tablespoon of the clay powder and added water to it to see if the graininess would resolve itself when wet.  </li>
            <li> I bought this particular clay to add to soap recipes as I love the pale green color it imparts in a pale or white soap base.</li>
            <li> texture is gritty, not easy to mix or work with.</li>
            <li> As I said, it was not an unpleasant effect, but it was much darker and a different shade from another batch I had made, so it looks like completely different</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made a clay face mask with the green clay last night by mixing it with a little greek yogurt and raw honey.  </li>
            <li> There were definitely bits of gravel and small chunks of clay in the product.</li>
            <li> Other than that I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> because I have extremely oily skin</li>
            <li> Like I say everything what I use i react to it,but this gentler than any other clay i ever use....</li>
            <li> Compared to origins active charcoal mask AND MAC&#x27;s volcanic ash, i prefer this over all of them.</li>
            <li> This is not suitable for mixing with facial lotion and water.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this particular clay (or at least the package I received) is a very DARK green color, much darker than the clay image shown with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was tightly wrapped in plastic and taped closed.  </li>
            <li> Was hard to open</li>
            <li> The only inconvenience is that it arrived darn late.</li>
            <li> I used common sense and mixed water in until I had the muddy thickness I desired.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s greyish green and goes to brown when it&#x27;s wet, but</li>
            <li> My acne scars faded and my face was less oilier than it used to be</li>
            <li> The clay also was somewhat more clumpy than refined and there were a few darker flecks of clay suspended in the soap base.</li>
            <li> It took longer than a typical ship from what I&#x27;ve purchased on Amazon before</li>
            <li> I had green clay from base formula and it was way better.</li>
            <li> Normally I get impatient to wash a face mask off because it gets uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> (I made it into a thick paste and let it dry - somewhere between 10 and 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> Never got to use there was so much tape on packaging the bag ripped while we were trying to get it open :(</li>
            <li> I thought green masks were supposed to be green, this is grey and it gets really, ridiculously hard when it dries.</li>
            <li> It is a little grainy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It was a little grainy, which I did not expect.</li>
            <li> Its a dangerous compound, without knowing how much cobalt is in this</li>
            <li> I mix it with water and green tea.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and have read the green tea clay helps absorb the oil and imperfections from the skin.</li>
            <li> They say you can determine the authenticity of your green clay mask by the color.  </li>
            <li> I attempted to make a mud wrap, but it was just too messy.</li>
            <li> I even told a lady at the store who was looking for another green clay item,the store didnt have it,so i mentioned this one and told her where to find it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an organic green clay mask and when I saw this I had to try it.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the green stuff I was expecting...</li>
            <li> Was expecting green clay but received gray clay even though it says green on the packaging.</li>
            <li> particulary ordered this green clay for easing my stiff shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is &amp;#34;detoxing&amp;#34; but it feels less oily.  </li>
            <li> After using i was little red ( I&#x27;m after everything what i use unfortunately).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually make reviews</li>
            <li> The bag is thin like a paper bag and stapled closed.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what I have, can&#x27;t read the language plus no packing slip.</li>
            <li> I usually use it in the shower anyways.</li>
            <li> I look like an alien when I put it on, and it closes up my pores and clears my skin.</li>
            <li> I put it in a small glass dish with filtered water and mix with my finger to get the consistency I want.</li>
            <li> green dirt EVERYWHERE!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s often hard to decide which one to pick up.</li>
            <li> and it sucks out all the excess oil.</li>
            <li> least twice a week, after shower,  I applied it from my neck to shoulders and arms.&lt;br /&gt;Feel</li>
            <li> It does have a slightly, vaguely swampy smell, like what you&#x27;d expect from stuff dug up from a wet area.</li>
            <li> It has small rocks in it and smells like a sewer!</li>
            <li> No matter how long it stays on my face, it drys out the skin crazy, it doesn&#x27;t help the pore or brighten the face,</li>
            <li> It works for seriously injured elephants and rhinos -</li>
            <li> Seriously, give it a shot.</li>
            <li> Not only does it not do a thing for my skin, it came like the worst dirt you&#x27;ll ever find, with various, large-sized sand-feeling granuals throughout.  </li>
            <li> It came packed ridiculously well.</li>
            <li> Either way, it came within the shipping time and it&#x27;s not so bad for such an inexpensive product.</li>
            <li> Duh!  </li>
            <li> Can be used as a base in mineral make-up, as well as a deep cleaning mask.</li>
            <li> A thin envelope taped around a brick shaped package of powder.</li>
            <li> lasts a long time and does not go bad!</li>
            <li> Nothing is - though there is a vague start to directions on the listing.</li>
            <li> I tried using this clay by itself but since it is just powdered clay it has no &amp;#34;body&amp;#34; and goes on very thin.  </li>
            <li> clay turned almost dark gray in the soap base -- not an unpleasant color, but not at all what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe I waited a month for this product and the result is so disappointing.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t so bad.</li>
            <li> at worst, it&#x27;s dangerous.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind it does take a while to arrive, so be patient you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually make reviews but I decided to do one for this item specifically just because I really liked the product. It came very well wrapped and in good condition and I liked it because the product wasn&#x27;t damaged like I expected it to be. I used this clay as a face mask with just water and I have to say that I really loved it. I had some acne on my cheeks and acne scars but just after using this about 3 times a week for 2 weeks, I saw results. My acne scars faded and my face was less oilier than it used to be so I don&#x27;t get acne as much anymore. After receiving this product I gave some to a friend who has a lot of acne and she didn&#x27;t know how to get rid of it so I recommend using this clay and she has seen results too. Overall I think this clay is really great and works nicely, but I really recommend it if you have some acne or acne scars that you want to get rid of if you decide to use it as a face mask :)</li>
            <li> This is not the best clay mask, it&#x27;s cheap for a reason.  It has small rocks in it and smells like a sewer!</li>
            <li> This came well packaged.  The bag looks exactly like the photo.  It was tightly wrapped in plastic and taped closed.  None of it spilled out and I was able to open it without any problems.  The bag is thin like a paper bag and stapled closed.  I just put the rest in a ziplock bag after I opened it, no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made a clay face mask with the green clay last night by mixing it with a little greek yogurt and raw honey.  I&#x27;ve used and made a lot of face masks in my life and this was my favorite one so far.  The honey made it smell wonderful.  Normally I get impatient to wash a face mask off because it gets uncomfortable.  Not this time.  It felt soothing and really soft on my skin.  My face felt baby soft after I washed the clay off my face.  I have very sensitive skin and allergies that caused a rash to appear on my hairline recently.  The clay mask didn&#x27;t irritate my skin and actually seems to have reduced the swelling and irritation from the rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I could possibly complain about is that the clay is not finely sifted.  It is a little grainy.  Once it was mixed with liquid it wasn&#x27;t an issue.  You can feel it but it isn&#x27;t scratchy.  Sifting it through cheesecloth should get rid of the graininess if it&#x27;s an issue for anyone.  Overall, it is an excellent product for an excellent price.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll order more when I run out.</li>
            <li> Not sure what I have, can&#x27;t read the language plus no packing slip. But it looks like it might be what I ordered.</li>
            <li> I revived my order quickly considering the distance...  It was wrapped very well to prevent damage. I used it to make a diy face powder I have also mixed with water to make a mask I have had good results with both.</li>
            <li> Very good quality....</li>
            <li> The quality of the clay was great. I felt my skin become smooth and soft. I have oily skin and it sucks out all the excess oil. I agree with others in that I wouldn&#x27;t label this clay as super fine powder. There were definitely bits of gravel and small chunks of clay in the product. Other than that I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> great mask great product</li>
            <li> I bought this particular clay to add to soap recipes as I love the pale green color it imparts in a pale or white soap base. Unfortunately, this particular clay (or at least the package I received) is a very DARK green color, much darker than the clay image shown with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clay turned almost dark gray in the soap base -- not an unpleasant color, but not at all what I was expecting. The clay also was somewhat more clumpy than refined and there were a few darker flecks of clay suspended in the soap base. As I said, it was not an unpleasant effect, but it was much darker and a different shade from another batch I had made, so it looks like completely different soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clay itself still seems to be of a high quality, but in case others are interested in/concerned about the specific color of the clay you get, you may want to buy a different product.</li>
            <li> I keep in my facial regimen</li>
            <li> So far I like it, it seems to be working with the seaweed and lime juice and honey, to get rid of cellulite.  With anything it is a process and will take time to work.  But, see a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> I love this face mask. I mix it with water and green tea. It makes my face so soft! I use a brush to apply it. I mix it with non metal utensils.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I just mixed with almost equal parts clay to water. My skin is definitely softer after removing the mask. It takes about 10 minutes to dry and I feel cleaner. I&#x27;m not sure if it is &amp;#34;detoxing&amp;#34; but it feels less oily.  Will get some flaking if you do not moisturize.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful!!  It arrived right on time and was exactly what I thought it would be.  The seller contacted me via email (seeing as how this was coming from Portugal to Oklahoma) and kept in touch to make sure it arrived on time and wasn&#x27;t damaged.  I will definitely be buying this again.  Easy to work with, easy to apply (just googled instructions) and my skin feels wonderful.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Terrific product. It makes your skin so soft and smooth. Has made pores less obvious and gives a nice lift. Not a miracle product but worth a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried this on my face, and I really like the results. My face felt very clean after I washed the mud off. (I made it into a thick paste and let it dry - somewhere between 10 and 20 minutes. I could feel the dry parts pull. I made faces just to see what it would look like when it cracked. I looked rather like a zombie. Lol )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a little grainy, which I did not expect. (My bentonite clay is smooth and slippery when it is wet.) Not a problem for me, though.</li>
            <li> This green clay is awesome stuff and it works well for my homemade mud mask, the only down side is that it looks bigger in the picture on line than it actually is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a terrible product, but I&#x27;ve gotten higher quality for less, not to mention it has a small quantity. Next time I will be going to my whole foods market and picking it up in bulk.</li>
            <li> It took a tad longer than I anticipated, but then it was sent from Portugal, so no complaints there. There was just a little bit of graininess to the powder, some particles that were not quite so fine, but if you don&#x27;t mind a bit of exfoliation, it isn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s become harder to find a good, reasonably-priced facial clay mask.  I tried using this clay by itself but since it is just powdered clay it has no &amp;#34;body&amp;#34; and goes on very thin.  My solution is to mix the clay 50/50  with a cheap, commercial mask to help it stick to my skin.  The combination works perfectly and I really like the results - better even than the masks I&#x27;d been buying all these years - leaving smooth skin texture and small pores.</li>
            <li> The sender was great with replying my emails. I got the package a bit late but the product looks great. cannot wait to try it out! Will leave a feedback once I try it! I would recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> its a very good product. after using it for the first time, i got good result instantly. i love it</li>
            <li> Had a lot of tiny pebbles inside the clay -- would have loved if this was 100% soft like powdered sugar like the other clays come.</li>
            <li> This is amazing clay that gives amazing results with first use! U just need to know how to use it! To give u a fine texture that u want u need to mix it with very little hot water! With only three spoons of clay and two spoons of hot water u have a mask for the whole body! If u plus wrap in a foil u will feel amazing after 20min. It does detox perfect and u even lose inches of toxic water as u sweet under the foil. Also I have used it for clients with back pain and muscle aches, it helped them! I am really amazed by this product!</li>
            <li> Great to use after steaming yor face.  It tightens pores nicely.</li>
            <li> The item took a while to ship, probably the longest I have waited for anything. In fact I forgot about it. Lol! All is well though, the clay is good and the price is right. The clay is grainy, not super fine like my bentonite clays. I use many different clays to make beauty products, or poultices for injuries, some of them I use internally. This particular one, I will use to make cleansing grains due to its texture.</li>
            <li> YOU SHOULD BUY THIS PRODUCT. do your research and you can do so much with green clay. it worth it. its a wonderful price</li>
            <li> I like this item, this item was very good, I am very happy with this item, It came in the promised time.</li>
            <li> Great pulling effect! Left my skin smoother, most of the dead skin and excess oils gone after just one application..</li>
            <li> The product I received, in different packaging, was not completely super fine.  Most of it is powder and dissolved in liquid, but there were prominent small rocks(?) mixed in.  I plan to sift the contents to get rid of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon needs to update this product title.</li>
            <li> Great product and very fast shipping</li>
            <li> Yes, there are larger particles that you should probably either sift out or sift and crush (maybe if you have a mortar and pestle?), but the clay does a great job for a facial mask. I leave the large particles in and just try to be careful when applying/rinsing the mask. A previous comment stated that it wasn&#x27;t green clay; I don&#x27;t agree - it IS more of an army green, so it&#x27;s more grey-green, but the clay does the job sucking everything out the way that dirt/mud (previous comment) wouldn&#x27;t. Unless you&#x27;re hoping to impress someone with the green-ness of your clay mask (if they aren&#x27;t scared and run away first hehe ;-) ), then I will be picking this product over a super green looking mask that either has additives or is just way more expensive. The price is awesome for the quantity. I will buy it again and also recommend it to friends and family.</li>
            <li> The clay wasn&#x27;t fine enough there were large sharp pcs left.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always tried to find the replacement of &amp;#34;Burt&#x27;s Bees Pore Refining Mask&amp;#34; after it&#x27;s no longer available in the market. Then I found this at Amazon. I couldn&#x27;t believe I waited a month for this product and the result is so disappointing. The powder has no grass or other natural refreshing elements scent like Burt&#x27;s Bees, just pure dirt. I&#x27;ve tried 3 mins, 5 mins, 10 mins.. to 30 mins. No matter how long it stays on my face, it drys out the skin crazy, it doesn&#x27;t help the pore or brighten the face, just more wrinkles i could say. The most unpleasant shopping experience on Amazon.</li>
            <li> When I decided to make my own powder foundation, I knew I needed this product.  Although the shipment did not arrive on time, the seller worked with me to ensure I received the package one way or another, even if it meant shipping a second package!  This product has helped to clear my skin and has multiple uses!</li>
            <li> Product is exactly what I expected to receive based on the reviews and product description.  It even came packaged in a foreign newspaper, which was fascinating to read :)</li>
            <li> I bought this clay for two purposes, facial masks and making my own makeup. I have oily skin and have read the green tea clay helps absorb the oil and imperfections from the skin. I LOVE this product and my skin is still looking great after lasting the whole day. It took longer than a typical ship from what I&#x27;ve purchased on Amazon before but that was only because this came from Portugal and not inside the US where I live. The package itself was secured with newspaper and a lot of tape to protect the bag of clay. Very well done, I would definitely go through this company again.</li>
            <li> Exactly what i was expecting! Ty</li>
            <li> It works for seriously injured elephants and rhinos - it can certainly handle my little boo-boos!</li>
            <li> Waiting 6 weeks and still did not receive.  No tracking number to track and seller wants to blame the USPS.  Maybe it was USPS fault but it is the sellers responsibility to get the item to the buyer in a timely manner using  services that will do just that.  If USPS does not do the job they should be using someone that does.  I should have trusted PRIOR feedback stating DID NOT RECEIVE ITEM!</li>
            <li> Now I know I don&#x27;t really have an &amp;#34;adult acne&amp;#34; problem.  I just needed to start using a mask, and exfoliating regularly.  Duh!  They say you can determine the authenticity of your green clay mask by the color.  Well, this must be the real deal because it is truly GREEN.  I&#x27;ve used it about 4 times, 2 or 3 times per week.  I use only distilled water with my clay.  A little goes a long way!  My skin feels very clean and soft afterwards.  I blot with witch hazel and moisturize with jojoba afterwards to prevent dryness.  Shipping does take forever and a day, i almost forgot i&#x27;d ordered it.  But it came, and it was very well packaged.</li>
            <li> my bag was not super fine powder---lots of granules sand size and larger!&lt;br /&gt;this is not so great if buying it for facials---too harsh---perhaps for tougher body parts, feet/tongue, it would be ok.</li>
            <li> I love this clay! You can feel the mask working, but it is strong so I wouldn&#x27;t use it more than maybe once per week, as it is very drying. I was concerned with the elapsed time since my order, so I contacted the seller. He gave me a good idea why it might be delayed, and how long it might be. He then offered to send a replacement with tracking info should it not arrive by the end of the week. I got it the next day, and was very impressed with his understanding of my concern, as well as the offer to ship international with tracking! That would probably cost him more than I even paid for the clay! I was very satisfied overall, but be ready for a long wait! And nobody can blame the seller for the slow shipping, so I am 100% happy with this clay, this transaction, and this seller!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I use it with a bit of water and Frankincense and Melaleuca...works wonders!</li>
            <li> I attempted to make a mud wrap, but it was just too messy. Now I just use it as a weekly mud mask. It makes my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Great product fantastic service</li>
            <li> I love the natural way to smooth my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I particulary ordered this green clay for easing my stiff shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;At least twice a week, after shower,  I applied it from my neck to shoulders and arms.&lt;br /&gt;Feel great!</li>
            <li> The item has been exactly as described and very well packaged to preserve purity&lt;br /&gt;It mixes to a very smooth paste</li>
            <li> Absolutely perfect for my personal uses. Can be used as a base in mineral make-up, as well as a deep cleaning mask.</li>
            <li> do not like to wash this off over my sink or tub, because it turns into a mud</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this clay because the price/quantity and super fine clay ( it&#x27;s supposed to treat deeper)  I use it for cleaning my skin and hair also. As shampoo,  I rinse with water mixed up with a little cider vinager. I feel very clean .after.  My hairs have stopped to fall down like it was usually with many others shampoos that I tried.  Very well wrapped. I received it at time. Also, I used it as a mask on my face and it&#x27;s very soft and clean. I feel comfortable. Julie Qc, Canada</li>
            <li> The tape and newspaper wrap was to keep the product contained in the packaging. I actually really appreciated the extra thought. So when the first shipment didn&#x27;t get to me, I emailed the seller and he immediately apologized and resent the item. He was a pleasure to deal with and the product itself was of good quality. Thank you!</li>
            <li> fast shipping, item was as described</li>
            <li> I received this product earlier than what I had thought. The packaging was extremely secure, almost to the point that it was difficult to get it open. That&#x27;s a good thing though.  It came wrapped in layers of newspaper, my fiance and I had a kick out of browsing the pages and seeing how newspapers are set up in a different country. It was very neat.  Anyway the clay itself is more gray than green so I was a bit worried that maybe there is something else in it? Or perhaps this is normal. I&#x27;m no expert on clay and this is my first time ever using it but boy does it work! My skin feels amazing, the mask gets extremely tight when it dries. I was hoping to start a clay regimen in the morning but the seller says to only use this clay externally, i&#x27;m taking their advice and purchasing a food grade clay for consumption and using this one strictly for cosmetic purposes.  Green clay truly is mother nature at her best!</li>
            <li> I received my package very quickly. I was surprised at how secure the packaging was. I am definetly looking forward to using this product and will definetly order more if I see the results I need.</li>
            <li> I have had this almost a year and i still have most of the product! lasts a long time and does not go bad! really penetrates and &amp;#34;cleans&amp;#34; out the gunk in your pores! it can be a bit messy but that is easy to clean up. I usually use it in the shower anyways. excellent product!</li>
            <li> Received in a timely manner: feels AWESOME - tightens well as it dries. No actual complaints, but when a product labels itself as &amp;#34;super fine&amp;#34; i am expecting baby powder fine. I read quite a few reviews that stated that this product has lots of grit and should be sifted and they were right. When you remove the mask also, DONT RUB IT OFF with a washcloth unless you sift it really well.. Yowie with the grit!! Splash water on directly to loosen. Anyways over all feels wonderful and will continue to use until this is gone, but will probably use a different product next time I buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing: directions aren&#x27;t in English. Nothing is - though there is a vague start to directions on the listing.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the clay! The package was as described and wrapped a few extra times in case of leakage. Really nice personal note attached. I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product itself- although everything is in another language :) Really thought it would take a long time to get here for the low price I paid, but it was here in a little over a week!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this item twice.It is wonderful.I find it to be very cost effective.&lt;br /&gt;It works great. It does take a long time to receive,but considering where it is coming from that is understandable. I even told a lady at the store who was looking for another green clay item,the store didnt have it,so i mentioned this one and told her where to find it.I hope she did. GREAT STUFF!</li>
            <li> Great product but took a month to receive. There is no way to know that until after purchasing the product and you receive a tracking number.</li>
            <li> Terrific product.  Seller was in communication with me and very courteous!  Much appreciated.  Will purchase again</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t green clay, and it&#x27;s not a super fine powder. It did an ok job tightening the pores on my nose, but the misleading description makes me concerned about what the actual ingredients are.</li>
            <li> I love this clay. I have mature, aging yet sensitive, acne skin and gives instant relieve. I mix it up with a bit of honey and apple cider vinegar. The only inconvenience is that it arrived darn late. I even forgot i ordered it and got a bit of a chill when i found this package that looked like a huge block of powder dugs in my mailbox. Gave me the heebie jeebies there for a moment. But overall best gift from the earth to your skin.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t so bad. It ships internationally, so it takes a while to receive it. It kinda feels and smells like cement, though. I thought green masks were supposed to be green, this is grey and it gets really, ridiculously hard when it dries. I don&#x27;t know if that is very good for your skin. Plus, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it has many minerals in it. Kinda feels synthetic. Either way, it came within the shipping time and it&#x27;s not so bad for such an inexpensive product.</li>
            <li> This green clay is of very high quality. The customer service is excellent. My wife is very happy. She would recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> This clay is not super fine like the advertisement said, and i didnt find that it was particularly green either it was like ordinary gray clay</li>
            <li> Good product and good price.</li>
            <li> I love this product, a little goes a long way and it will last forever. It helped with my acne and made my face feel wonderful. The shipping was surprisingly fast which was a nice surprise. I love how tight it gets when it dries and how easily it rinses off.</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews before I ordered and this was exactly what i wanted so i agree with everyone else.</li>
            <li> this stuff does not look green, its not even fine powder like it says it is.&lt;br /&gt;its texture is gritty, not easy to mix or work with. I hope ibget refund or exchage for someeals.</li>
            <li> A ton of clay in this package. I didn&#x27;t realize how much 2.2 lbs was, but I&#x27;ll be using it for the next decade. The clay itself is nice and green. Has an earthy smell and feel. A little grainy but mixing it together more effectively gives a smooth mask. I look like an alien when I put it on, and it closes up my pores and clears my skin. I can feel that pulling, pulsing sensation. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> All my girlfriends want to know where they can get some too. Great stuff!!</li>
            <li> Too course for masks. Will use for bathing.</li>
            <li> apparently super fine means kinda gritty, but its not so bad</li>
            <li> Clay came sooner than expected.  Very nice clay to work with.  I&#x27;m am using it in my facial soap bars and it works beautifully.</li>
            <li> It is a good clay I do like it but it isn&#x27;t fine it&#x27;s actually pretty rocky almost like regular sand I have other ckays that are fine so I can clearly see a difference, but I still like this clay it just needs a little more work to break it down...</li>
            <li> i received it and i immediately used it, it&#x27;s a good clay quality with quick result when mixed with olive oil</li>
            <li> highly recommend for this product was sent to me, I am very satisfied and pleased, because if there was a mistake on their part, they will correct it right away, I say this from experience, and always hasen effort that we as customers are satisfied.</li>
            <li> Instantly clears up skin!</li>
            <li> Very good product, lasts a long time (and I use it up to 3 times a week). I will continue to purchase from this supplier.</li>
            <li> Green clay is marvelous -- amazing price as well. Shipping costs very reasonable and the product arrived much sooner than expected.  It arrived intact and very secure. I have used the clay twice and my skin has responded very well both times.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! Of course its going to smell &amp;#34;swampy&amp;#34; its clay. Just watch a youtube video (clairedelys i think) on making a gentler mask with this, and youre good to go. This stuff lasts LONG! Ive had the same bag for about 2 years (granted i use it atmost 2 times a month). Leaves your skin so soft and smooth. Well worth the price. Compared to origins active charcoal mask AND MAC&#x27;s volcanic ash, i prefer this over all of them. For those who want a finer grain, just get yourself a mortar &amp; pestle.</li>
            <li> Very nice! Excellent service</li>
            <li> I received it around the time it was expected, coming from Portugal and all.&lt;br /&gt;It was well worth the wait and price since French Green Clay in the US costs double the price and is sold in smaller amounts.&lt;br /&gt;The package was well wrapped, had a laugh with my friends about how secure it looked.&lt;br /&gt;I use the clay once a week and it keeps blemishes from my face.</li>
            <li> Great packaging! Lovely silky feel and a fresh scent.It&#x27;s a fantastic product for using in clay masks and bath products.</li>
            <li> I wish this product had come with instructions. I used common sense and mixed water in until I had the muddy thickness I desired. I saw a difference in my arms and stomach after the first use. I have a lot of weight to lose and these are problem areas for me. The skin seemed invigorated. I am using this product along with sea salt exfoliant, castor oil with lavender oil, and elastin lotion. I have seen great improvement.</li>
            <li> Works better than any commercial ready-made mask I&#x27;ve tried, (and I&#x27;ve tried a LOT). Seriously, give it a shot.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have ordered this product, and i am not only impressed with how clear it leaves my skin in a short amount of time, but also the customer service is excellent too... because I have extremely oily skin I am prone to breakouts and I am an adult... Since I have been using this green clay, it had really clears up and prevented breakouts! Certainly a great purchase!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an organic green clay mask and when I saw this I had to try it. It has done wonders on my skin and I could noticeably see an improvement in my pores with in the first week, and also apply to my neck. It&#x27;s quality is one that is rare and its so simple to use. I put it in a small glass dish with filtered water and mix with my finger to get the consistency I want. This has been a great addition to my skin care regimen and would recommend this to anyone looking for a product without harsh chemicals to brighten up your skin. Keep in mind it does take a while to arrive, so be patient you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> company send this much sooner,that was my expectation. Product is awesome. I have very sensitive skin (rosacea). After using i was little red ( I&#x27;m after everything what i use unfortunately). I use with chamomile essential oil (german is soothing)and see improvement in my skin..Like I say everything what I use i react to it,but this gentler than any other clay i ever use....I have also very oily hair and this is almost miracle for my hair..So thank you for great product and great company.</li>
            <li> I bought this after seeing a pinterest post about how to make my own anti-shine powder using green clay, coco powder, and cornstarch.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t find the recommended clay at the grocery store so I turned to Amazon and found this.  An enormous amount of clay for a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from &#x27;green clay&#x27; and this clay is definitely more grey than green, but it blended well with the other ingredients for my powder makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I have also been using this clay once a week as a face mask.  Because of it&#x27;s super fine grain, a little bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it for a face mask, and recommend it for anti shine powder if you have a more olive or dark skin tone.  It might be too dark for fair skin.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase. The package arrived on time, hand wrapped (with love!) in papers and plastic tape, very nicely. I peeled it off and the package was in great shape after traveling all the way from Portuguese.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels amazing, tightened and refreshed. Will buy more of this product, works well for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff works in body wraps, but you have to drink lots of water as it pulls impurities from your body, you can become congested and stuffy if you dont drink enough water to flush the toxians out.</li>
            <li> There are many different qualities of clay in the market and it&#x27;s often hard to decide which one to pick up. After much research, I ordered this very fine green powder coming from Europe where they use it a lot more than in other countries. It&#x27;s a wonderful multi-usages stuff, used internally or externally. Just make sure that you read carefully the directions specially if you mix it with water and drink it.</li>
            <li> Fantastice wrapping, I was wondering how it will arrive, but the packadging was so well done done that it seemed like I got it from a local shop. Took a bit longer to get here but it was worth it.</li>
            <li> Came very quickly. Was hard to open but that was alright. Nice and fine . Very impressed . Would buy from them again.</li>
            <li> Never got to use there was so much tape on packaging the bag ripped while we were trying to get it open :( green dirt EVERYWHERE!</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I use it to make a homemade Earthpaste, cosmetics and masks. I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!  I&#x27;ve used it for facial masks and I loved it. It&#x27;s easy to mix and to apply and effective on my skin. Customer service is beyond excellent. Would highly recommend .. Thank you</li>
            <li> Very good clay, it blends well with seaweed powder.</li>
            <li> If you are buying this for a facial mask, don&#x27;t buy this. This is not suitable for mixing with facial lotion and water. I had green clay from base formula and it was way better.</li>
            <li> Clay is just the way I expected to be: natural and easy to apply on skin. Makes the skin smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> Grind is not as fine as I expected.  But it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face and body and it has worked wonderfully on my skin. I&#x27;m really impressed with how it has evened out my skin-tone and has taken away any redness in my skin. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Feels great on face and body.</li>
            <li> Your skin feel very clean, firm and softly. Good product.</li>
            <li> great quality, def cleans the skin</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Great Product!</li>
            <li> Thnx a lot i am very satisfied with it ,it very fine clay for both facial of face &amp; body.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Used it with a kelp treatment and French Green Clay. And it was wonderful...improved my roseacea and shaving issues right away.  PS: you need to use it twice for best effects with Kelp.  So now my face doesn&#x27;t feel dry nor do I worry about psoriasis as much..and dry scaly facial skin issues.</li>
            <li> I imagined the mask would absorb many blackheads out, but my nose showed just a small reduction and the rest of my face also showed a small difference in clarity. Otherwise, it&#x27;s easy to use and I can use it as an exfoliant before letting it settle as a mask.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Will order it again!</li>
            <li> Great product, everything in the description is definitely true about it!was delivered sooner than expected and the cost for the delivery was very reasonable ( comes from Portugal I think). I do have oily uneven skin with tendency for breakouts and after the first usage I already see the results! I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I did not buy this because it said it contains Cobalt....Cobalt!!!!!  Its a dangerous compound, without knowing how much cobalt is in this, you should never, ever, put Cobalt on your skin. It is a main cause of Dermatitus for one thing, it&#x27;s a metal, its toxic. Do your homework before you putting things on your skin or eating them for that matter. I&#x27;m a fine artist and I use gloves when handling cobalt blue oil paints, it is a poison and can cause cancer. Look at all the things it is used for and you will get it. Don&#x27;t buy this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> Fresh dry clay great for acne prone oily skin. Add water or favorite oil and apply to face as a mask remove when dry use it one or two times a week.</li>
            <li> Not only does it not do a thing for my skin, it came like the worst dirt you&#x27;ll ever find, with various, large-sized sand-feeling granuals throughout.  It&#x27;s nothing but dirt.</li>
            <li> This product comes from Portugal and it was worth the wait. Use it as a mask, after rinsing your face will feel soft.</li>
            <li> Packaging was...interesting. A thin envelope taped around a brick shaped package of powder. I am pretty sure I am under surveillance by law enforcement as we speak....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the product seems good quality and is a generous amount for the price.</li>
            <li> This is not a super fine clay. I have purchased this product elsewhere and paid a lot more money to get a super fine product. For the price, it is a bargain. Just understand it is grainy.&lt;br /&gt;Also, this product is shipped from the Netherlands so it takes quite a while to receive it. It does make an awesome facial mask.</li>
            <li> Great product, works wonders in the homemade wraps!</li>
            <li> Pure delight to use.  And the seller is fantastic on service.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product from five different places, but none of those were genuine French green illite clay. This is the only time I actually got the genuine clay as advertised. This is actually the best deal I have ever got from an Amazon purchase. I would recommend this seller to anyone!</li>
            <li> This green clay is of very high quality.  Works great on exfoliating the skin.  My wife and daughters love it.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the green stuff I was expecting... it&#x27;s greyish green and goes to brown when it&#x27;s wet, but whatever. I&#x27;m not sure the color has much to do with anything, to be honest. Just means there&#x27;s a slightly different mineral component. It does have a slightly, vaguely swampy smell, like what you&#x27;d expect from stuff dug up from a wet area. But my nose is hyper sensitive. My husband smelled nothing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not as super fine as I was expecting; I put it into a mason jar for storage and got some interesting sediment layers. I tried to steer the grittier parts to the parts that needed more grit, like my elbows. Yes, I put it on my elbows to help exfoliate. It&#x27;s that good a price, I felt. I left the finer stuff in a mask (about a 1:1 water:clay ratio) on my face, neck and chest, and since about a teaspoon covered those areas and still had some left over, this will last a long time with once a week use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping can be a hassle. Apparently Homeland Security is on the lookout for natural health and beauty products that could possibly endanger, uh... the homeland&#x27;s natural health and beauty product industry? No, wait, that can&#x27;t be it... we don&#x27;t have one of those... endanger, uh... I give up. I never got the first shipment because it was apparently confiscated by someone probably who said \\&quot;Ooh, I&#x27;ve been meaning to try this stuff! Yoink!\\&quot;. I contacted the seller and was promptly sent another one.</li>
            <li> Great for masks and to add to powdered makeup to cover redness in skin</li>
            <li> Pulls out black heads very effective. Found recipes online for total body treatments and use them often.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> Was expecting green clay but received gray clay even though it says green on the packaging. It was gray. Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> Felt like at the spa.Skin was refreshed and stayed clear for days afterwards.Would recommend this totally.This will last a long long time,as it makes so much with just alittle of the powder.</li>
            <li> A really good product.!! I love it.!!!</li>
            <li> The course, gravely texture really surprised me. I&#x27;d purchased this for use in skincare, but will not be able to use it for any product intended for use on the face. I am hoping to be able to use it as an ingredient in a body or foot scrub, so the purchase won&#x27;t be a waste of money. The color was definitely more on the grey side, compared with French Green clays I have purchased in the past from other companies, but I don&#x27;t know if that affects the quality in any way.</li>
            <li> My problem with this clay is that it had a lot of big scratchy ROCKS.. so you have to sieve it before us it</li>
            <li> this mask worked perfectly, I do once it a month and I luv it easy to spread and wash off</li>
            <li> Great product, which i can tell by comparing few other brands/kinds of clay i used before. Very good for skin. I received packadge in 2 days i belive. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. I am a ceramicist and creator of a line of natural skincare- I know my clay.  I can&#x27;t use this, not only is it not labelled for sale in the U.S., THIS IS NOT GREEN CLAY (bentonite).  It&#x27;s a muddy grey color. The particle size is not consistent, there are large (for clay) sharp pieces that actually cut my skin.  At best this is a disappointment, at worst, it&#x27;s dangerous. I DO NOT RECOMMEND FOR SKINCARE.</li>
            <li> What I received was not green clay. It smells like dirt and looks like dirt. It was gray/brown and very coarse with a lot of grains in it, not the super fine green power I was expecting. I have purchased green clay before and it was great; but this was definitely not green clay.</li>
            <li> i really like this green clay, after a facial mask i can feel and see that my face is soft, hydrates and looks fresh. i recommend this product</li>
            <li> Took a loooong time to arrive.  I do have the patience of a gnat though. And it did have to travel across a large body of water. Also, to be fair, I knew right away it would not be a quick delivery.  The shipment date when you order, etc, is pretty clear about that.  So no problem there.  Good service overall.  It came packed ridiculously well. Better protected than Fort Knox.  It took me awhile to break into it, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will upload a photo for you of what I received. (stay tuned as I have never done this before and may be completely inept)&lt;br /&gt;It is not silky smooth.  It does have a bit of coarseness to it.&lt;br /&gt;I sifted it and took comparison photos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will work fine for my intended use, which is body wraps.  If you are looking for something that needs to be perfectly smooth and has very microscopic granules, you will need to sift it and maybe pulverize further to achieve that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a tablespoon of the clay powder and added water to it to see if the graininess would resolve itself when wet.  To some extent it did.  There were actually a few tiny  (really tiny) bits of sand that obviously did not dissolve.  You would want to strain thru a very fine cloth or seive to remove them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the small grains might be problematic for some applications, this will work just fine for my intended use. Just keep in mind what your end result needs to be before purchasing.  Super fine in this instance does not mean silky and soft like a really good baby powder.  Then again, I am not a cosmetic scientist and this may be what super fine means in that industry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck with whatever fun project you are doing!</li>
            <li> The mask was very pleasant and it made my skin super smooth although it dried out the skin. This product was very affordable and the quality was surprisingly good</li>
