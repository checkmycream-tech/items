            <li>All of the brushes have a nice light-weight feel to them when held.</li>
            <li>The case they come in is really nice.</li>
            <li>The case this comes with is also really nice.  </li>
            <li>i got the brush after reading great reviews, once receive the order it look very nice and decent price.</li>
            <li>The set is elegant and I love how they feel when swept across my skin!</li>
            <li>They have not received them yet, but when my girlfriend gift wrapped these, she completely flipped her lid at how awesome they were.  </li>
            <li>To say that I feel I&#x27;m putting on my best face is an understatement; my makeup looks professionally done, and believe me, I&#x27;m no professional!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the fact they come in this nice pouch</li>
            <li>great set of good quality brushes for such a good price.  </li>
            <li>The case they come in is elegant and nice to look at.</li>
            <li>I feel that a lot of drugstore brushes work more effectively than these.</li>
            <li>Basically, for the ladies that do love having nice makeup tools</li>
            <li>Beautifully mace, good weight and the brushes are silky soft.</li>
            <li>These are great brushes - soft, very high quality, and the case is perfect.</li>
            <li>Great investment, nice, soft hairs</li>
            <li>It was my favorite as well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even know how to begin to explain how much I LOVE these brushes.</li>
            <li>GET IT :))</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>However, I do wish painting brushes came with really cute brush cases like this :)</li>
            <li>My favorite brush is the tiny, pointed eyeliner brush that applies my gel eyeliner so perfectly.</li>
            <li>I really love this set.</li>
            <li>My favorite brush out of this set is the eyeshadow blender brush.</li>
            <li>It really does a great job blending my eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>I am more than pleased with this purchase..</li>
            <li>That said, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use it on my compact blush anyway.</li>
            <li>How many quality synthetic brushes can you buy for that price?</li>
            <li>I bought these after looking for a long time for a pair of brushes that I felt would be the best for me.  </li>
            <li>This is a very nice high quality set.  </li>
            <li>Very nice quality very soft brushes.  </li>
            <li>The powder brush is too soft to get a good coating from the compact powder I was using and resulted in the top of the compact powder getting a glazed top that had to be scraped</li>
            <li>Other brushes are like cake without icing, they are good, but these brushes are like having your cake and eating it too, AMAZING!</li>
            <li>The strong chemical odor of the case mellowed out and I no longer smell it anymore, which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes and would have given a 5 star review were it not for the super softness of the brushes that do not work well with compact makeup.</li>
            <li>Very soft and the materials there made of are really good.</li>
            <li>These brushes put it on smooth and make it look like it&#x27;s melted into the skin.  </li>
            <li>and I would recommend them to anyone who wants a nice set of brushes.</li>
            <li>I bought some makeup brushes by Christian Dior and they do not look this great</li>
            <li>The quality compared to other sets is very good.</li>
            <li>They are also super easy to clean with brush cleaner.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a buy!</li>
            <li>the only thing nice is the makeup brush case!</li>
            <li>His need for make up made it a gift he was excited to receive.</li>
            <li>worth it!</li>
            <li>These are my first set of quality synthetic brushes and I love them.</li>
            <li>I purchased these brushes on sale and must say they were nicely packaged and the whole set is very attractive--at a friendly price!</li>
            <li>If I can make three women happy with a few clicks of a mouse, it&#x27;s a 5-star deal for sure.</li>
            <li>The brushed are soft, they don&#x27;t shed, and they are very attractive.</li>
            <li>I have also had much better experiences with certain drugstore brushes like EcoTools and Sonia</li>
            <li>I say buy real technique brushes from Ulta way better than this.</li>
            <li>Glued them back on and all good now</li>
            <li>would recommend these brushes, but would warn that you might want to get better eyeshadow brushes if you really like to blend your makeup.</li>
            <li>The handles are smooth and are the right length.</li>
            <li>I am a person that is super picky about the things I use on my face</li>
            <li>High quality vegan makeup brushes are scarce, and I am glad I found these.</li>
            <li>I love experimenting with make-up and trying new looks.</li>
            <li>I love the handles on these brushes and looks very professional.</li>
            <li>I first bought a set for my sister and was a bit jealous that I didn&#x27;t have them!</li>
            <li>When I first opened the set, I wanted to play with it for hours,and do all of my girlfriends makeup!</li>
            <li>, I thought that was funny!</li>
            <li>and they are so soft and super easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The case that comes with this particular set of brushes is wonderful, each piece sits very snug in the pockets and there is a flap that folds down over them</li>
            <li>So much more natural looking.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t get what is worth.</li>
            <li>The quality of these brushes are worth the price.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this whole set, but I think there are some brushes that I didn&#x27;t end up caring for as much as I thought I would.&lt;br</li>
            <li>On the bright side, these brushes haven&#x27;t shed on my face like cheaper ones have in the past and don&#x27;t irritate my skin because they are super silky.</li>
            <li>I am not at all overly sensitive to odors, but this smell is more overwhelming than a car full of dead fish in August.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried all the brushes out there, actually only fairly cheap ones, but what a difference quality makes!  </li>
            <li>One brush all the brissel came out the first 2-3 times I used it.</li>
            <li>Others only ok.</li>
            <li>only looks cute.</li>
            <li>I felt like a kid on Christmas morning when I opened this case and saw all the many different brushes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, these brushes are really pretty and nice-looking.</li>
            <li>Vinyl case was a tad smelly when first opened but the smell has lessened over time.</li>
            <li>The jumbo fan brush is a lot of fun, I love to lightly sweep powder or a little shimmer on my face with it!</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t happy, I got 3 brushes that were the same &amp; 1 was loose where it joins at the handle....</li>
            <li>I really love the extra large fan brush to dust off makeup from the face.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I did not favor was the strong odor of the case that I hope dissipates over time.</li>
            <li>She said that she had just bought a single brush like one in this kit that was $20 by itself and the one in this kit was better than the one she bought.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are super soft, but they still pick up/deposit/blend makeup really well.</li>
            <li>I have real technique and I wish I didnt buy these lite makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>I really needed these brushes.</li>
            <li>I was very dissapointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I really like these brushes.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>but I really like these brushes.</li>
            <li>and I was really nervous buying this</li>
            <li>The case is durable, and very well made.</li>
            <li>I love the case, it makes them look so professional, and my friends think I actually know what I am doing!</li>
            <li>clean them regularly and have never seen the hairs come out, paint come off the handles, or brushes detach from the handles.</li>
            <li>Not sure I&#x27;ll ever use all the brushes, there are so many but well worth the money to me.</li>
            <li>Bristles were falling out of all the brushes sent back did not feel they were good quality and were not worth the money paid</li>
            <li>However the faux leather pouch looks really cheap and smells like some strange toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li>The first thing I did when I opened these brushes was to play with the tips of them, I could tell just by looking at them that they were professional quality brushes.</li>
            <li>I have a big collection of brushes i want to stay away from MAC because they can be expensive and been trying other brands that are as great quality as they are and these brushes are as good as it can get.</li>
            <li>The large powder brush is so soft, it&#x27;s almost like using a gentle breeze to apply the makeup</li>
            <li>I liked the brushes when I first received them, however after moderate use for a little over a month the heads of the brushes began falling off the wood handles.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Fibers don&#x27;t come off in your hand, which indicates high quality&lt;br</li>
            <li>high quality.  </li>
            <li>These brushes are of high quality.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend that you get them before the price goes up.</li>
            <li>As many people mentioned they do smell a little</li>
            <li>I wish they were a little more firm for better application.</li>
            <li>its a waste of money you have better luck with dollar brushes than these.</li>
            <li>within a short time I tossed them in the trash because they shed all over the place and when I washed them I would loose more bristles.</li>
            <li>I thought it could be new</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this set of brushes to anyone, novice or professional.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t shed and are very soft.</li>
            <li>So, naturally, I bought a set for me!</li>
            <li>Yes, the odor mentioned was noted but airing for few days made it fine.</li>
            <li>The large fan brush was used only once in a test as I had never used that type of brush and it also fell apart.  </li>
            <li>want to buy another set of these right now to save for when these are worn, though I anticipate that to be a very long time from now!</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and of professional quality.  </li>
            <li>So far, the bristles haven&#x27;t shed at all.</li>
            <li>My impression of these makeup brushes is that they are quite soft to the touch (haven&#x27;t used them with my makeup</li>
            <li>Some of the brushes are almost \\&quot;too\\&quot; soft while others are too \\&quot;stiff\\&quot; to blend and apply my makeup properly--which is why I docked a star.</li>
            <li>They are so soft and I haven&#x27;t had any shedding at all of the bristles.  </li>
            <li>it is almost completely gone.</li>
            <li>And they are really soft on the skin.</li>
            <li>Again, the only thing I did not like was the strong odor of the case and the slightly frayed hairs on the sides of both of the fan brushes.</li>
            <li>and I only got four small ones for more money.  </li>
            <li>I had another set of brushes that I didn&#x27;t spent very much on and</li>
            <li>She started to use them and she like them because they were soft but after the second week of used they were coming off of their handle.</li>
            <li>but like I barely have time to be here giving reviews about products and now I have the time to give them</li>
            <li>Although it did smell a little funny, after I washed the brushes and let the case air out</li>
            <li>Very soft brushes and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used a few of these brushes I was just blown away, My eye makeup looked completely different than it did when I used a cheaper set of brushes.</li>
            <li>I have another set of brushes that are made from animal hair and they are so hard to clean and are not soft at all.</li>
            <li>so other people don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did and take a long time in reviewing an item that you pay so much money for it</li>
            <li>The other brushes are very soft and applies my make up with ease.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> How many quality synthetic brushes can you buy for that price?</li>
            <li> I bought these after looking for a long time for a pair of brushes that I felt would be the best for me.  </li>
            <li> This is a very nice high quality set.  </li>
            <li> Very nice quality very soft brushes.  </li>
            <li> The powder brush is too soft to get a good coating from the compact powder I was using and resulted in the top of the compact powder getting a glazed top that had to be scraped</li>
            <li> Other brushes are like cake without icing, they are good, but these brushes are like having your cake and eating it too, AMAZING!</li>
            <li> The strong chemical odor of the case mellowed out and I no longer smell it anymore, which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes and would have given a 5 star review were it not for the super softness of the brushes that do not work well with compact makeup.</li>
            <li> Very soft and the materials there made of are really good.</li>
            <li> These brushes put it on smooth and make it look like it&#x27;s melted into the skin.  </li>
            <li> and I would recommend them to anyone who wants a nice set of brushes.</li>
            <li> I bought some makeup brushes by Christian Dior and they do not look this great</li>
            <li> The quality compared to other sets is very good.</li>
            <li> They are also super easy to clean with brush cleaner.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a buy!</li>
            <li> the only thing nice is the makeup brush case!</li>
            <li> His need for make up made it a gift he was excited to receive.</li>
            <li> worth it!</li>
            <li> These are my first set of quality synthetic brushes and I love them.</li>
            <li> I purchased these brushes on sale and must say they were nicely packaged and the whole set is very attractive--at a friendly price!</li>
            <li> If I can make three women happy with a few clicks of a mouse, it&#x27;s a 5-star deal for sure.</li>
            <li> The brushed are soft, they don&#x27;t shed, and they are very attractive.</li>
            <li> I have also had much better experiences with certain drugstore brushes like EcoTools and Sonia</li>
            <li> I say buy real technique brushes from Ulta way better than this.</li>
            <li> Glued them back on and all good now</li>
            <li> would recommend these brushes, but would warn that you might want to get better eyeshadow brushes if you really like to blend your makeup.</li>
            <li> The handles are smooth and are the right length.</li>
            <li> I am a person that is super picky about the things I use on my face</li>
            <li> High quality vegan makeup brushes are scarce, and I am glad I found these.</li>
            <li> I love experimenting with make-up and trying new looks.</li>
            <li> I love the handles on these brushes and looks very professional.</li>
            <li> I first bought a set for my sister and was a bit jealous that I didn&#x27;t have them!</li>
            <li> When I first opened the set, I wanted to play with it for hours,and do all of my girlfriends makeup!</li>
            <li> , I thought that was funny!</li>
            <li> and they are so soft and super easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The case that comes with this particular set of brushes is wonderful, each piece sits very snug in the pockets and there is a flap that folds down over them</li>
            <li> So much more natural looking.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t get what is worth.</li>
            <li> The quality of these brushes are worth the price.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this whole set, but I think there are some brushes that I didn&#x27;t end up caring for as much as I thought I would.&lt;br</li>
            <li> On the bright side, these brushes haven&#x27;t shed on my face like cheaper ones have in the past and don&#x27;t irritate my skin because they are super silky.</li>
            <li> I am not at all overly sensitive to odors, but this smell is more overwhelming than a car full of dead fish in August.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried all the brushes out there, actually only fairly cheap ones, but what a difference quality makes!  </li>
            <li> One brush all the brissel came out the first 2-3 times I used it.</li>
            <li> Others only ok.</li>
            <li> only looks cute.</li>
            <li> I felt like a kid on Christmas morning when I opened this case and saw all the many different brushes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, these brushes are really pretty and nice-looking.</li>
            <li> Vinyl case was a tad smelly when first opened but the smell has lessened over time.</li>
            <li> The jumbo fan brush is a lot of fun, I love to lightly sweep powder or a little shimmer on my face with it!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t happy, I got 3 brushes that were the same &amp; 1 was loose where it joins at the handle....</li>
            <li> I really love the extra large fan brush to dust off makeup from the face.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I did not favor was the strong odor of the case that I hope dissipates over time.</li>
            <li> She said that she had just bought a single brush like one in this kit that was $20 by itself and the one in this kit was better than the one she bought.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are super soft, but they still pick up/deposit/blend makeup really well.</li>
            <li> I have real technique and I wish I didnt buy these lite makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> I really needed these brushes.</li>
            <li> I was very dissapointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> but I really like these brushes.</li>
            <li> and I was really nervous buying this</li>
            <li> The case is durable, and very well made.</li>
            <li> I love the case, it makes them look so professional, and my friends think I actually know what I am doing!</li>
            <li> clean them regularly and have never seen the hairs come out, paint come off the handles, or brushes detach from the handles.</li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;ll ever use all the brushes, there are so many but well worth the money to me.</li>
            <li> Bristles were falling out of all the brushes sent back did not feel they were good quality and were not worth the money paid</li>
            <li> However the faux leather pouch looks really cheap and smells like some strange toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li> The first thing I did when I opened these brushes was to play with the tips of them, I could tell just by looking at them that they were professional quality brushes.</li>
            <li> I have a big collection of brushes i want to stay away from MAC because they can be expensive and been trying other brands that are as great quality as they are and these brushes are as good as it can get.</li>
            <li> The large powder brush is so soft, it&#x27;s almost like using a gentle breeze to apply the makeup</li>
            <li> I liked the brushes when I first received them, however after moderate use for a little over a month the heads of the brushes began falling off the wood handles.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Fibers don&#x27;t come off in your hand, which indicates high quality&lt;br</li>
            <li> high quality.  </li>
            <li> These brushes are of high quality.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend that you get them before the price goes up.</li>
            <li> As many people mentioned they do smell a little</li>
            <li> I wish they were a little more firm for better application.</li>
            <li> its a waste of money you have better luck with dollar brushes than these.</li>
            <li> within a short time I tossed them in the trash because they shed all over the place and when I washed them I would loose more bristles.</li>
            <li> I thought it could be new</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this set of brushes to anyone, novice or professional.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t shed and are very soft.</li>
            <li> So, naturally, I bought a set for me!</li>
            <li> Yes, the odor mentioned was noted but airing for few days made it fine.</li>
            <li> The large fan brush was used only once in a test as I had never used that type of brush and it also fell apart.  </li>
            <li> want to buy another set of these right now to save for when these are worn, though I anticipate that to be a very long time from now!</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and of professional quality.  </li>
            <li> So far, the bristles haven&#x27;t shed at all.</li>
            <li> My impression of these makeup brushes is that they are quite soft to the touch (haven&#x27;t used them with my makeup</li>
            <li> Some of the brushes are almost \\&quot;too\\&quot; soft while others are too \\&quot;stiff\\&quot; to blend and apply my makeup properly--which is why I docked a star.</li>
            <li> They are so soft and I haven&#x27;t had any shedding at all of the bristles.  </li>
            <li> it is almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> And they are really soft on the skin.</li>
            <li> Again, the only thing I did not like was the strong odor of the case and the slightly frayed hairs on the sides of both of the fan brushes.</li>
            <li> and I only got four small ones for more money.  </li>
            <li> I had another set of brushes that I didn&#x27;t spent very much on and</li>
            <li> She started to use them and she like them because they were soft but after the second week of used they were coming off of their handle.</li>
            <li> but like I barely have time to be here giving reviews about products and now I have the time to give them</li>
            <li> Although it did smell a little funny, after I washed the brushes and let the case air out</li>
            <li> Very soft brushes and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used a few of these brushes I was just blown away, My eye makeup looked completely different than it did when I used a cheaper set of brushes.</li>
            <li> I have another set of brushes that are made from animal hair and they are so hard to clean and are not soft at all.</li>
            <li> so other people don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did and take a long time in reviewing an item that you pay so much money for it</li>
            <li> The other brushes are very soft and applies my make up with ease.</li>
            <li> Another thing I didn&#x27;t like but will get used to is that the brushes are thick and take a long time to dry after I clean them.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re also thick, certainly recommend!</li>
            <li> I think they will last a long time to come.</li>
            <li> but it is not a major concern</li>
            <li> I wish the brushes could of been as nice as the case:(</li>
            <li> If you are used to nice brushes you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I mean it did not look bad with my other brushes, but it looked amazing with the Elite set, my makeup looked like a professional had applied it!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a faint smell that comes from the case so the bristles smelled a tiny bit at first.</li>
            <li> (I did not really like the foundation brush</li>
            <li> Received these brushes in the mail only to open them and have 5 of them with broken handles and flared out bristles.</li>
            <li> not worth the price.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is I did not like the eyeshadow brush.</li>
            <li> Too flat and hard.</li>
            <li> Typically if you purchased a cheaper set of brushes,(I have before)</li>
            <li> the little fibers will come out on your fingers, but not with this set.</li>
            <li> not practical, wastes a lot of makeup, inefficient.</li>
            <li> a FEW OF THE BRUSHES HANDLES CAME OFF.....</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with these brushes they are soft</li>
            <li> I noticed that the two fan brushes (the small and little) had a slightly noticeable amount of frayed/curled bristles on the sides</li>
            <li> I am purchasing some fuller and thicker drugstore eyeshadow brushes because these eyeshadow brushes are just too stiff, thin, and short to apply eyeshadow, it almost hurts my eyelids.</li>
            <li> one of the brush came off on the first day so that was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> My other brushes were leaving my make up looking really heavy and fake bake on my face despite is being MAC.  </li>
            <li> Not happy that I paid $55 for what I thought would be quality brushes to find them falling apart after minimal use, then charged a restock fee when I return them as defective!!</li>
            <li> just a no good damaged product.</li>
            <li> I returned the brushes due to the poor quality and the fact they were falling apart therefore not usable, and was charged a restock fee!!  </li>
            <li> I felt it was bulky with a lot of unnecessary brushes and not the quality of my Lancôme brush set..</li>
            <li> was way too expensive for the quality.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I am using them wrong?</li>
            <li> They are the type of brushes you would see being sold at Sephora for a really expensive price.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want something to expensive</li>
            <li> You just can&#x27;t got wrong with the quality and the price!</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>

            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried all the brushes out there, actually only fairly cheap ones, but what a difference quality makes!  My other brushes were leaving my make up looking really heavy and fake bake on my face despite is being MAC.  These brushes put it on smooth and make it look like it&#x27;s melted into the skin.  So much more natural looking.</li>
            <li> This brushes are the best! They are synthetic and very good quality! I just love them! Definitely worth a buy!</li>
            <li> I got two of these as Christmas gifts for my mother and my aunt.  They have not received them yet, but when my girlfriend gift wrapped these, she completely flipped her lid at how awesome they were.  She said that she had just bought a single brush like one in this kit that was $20 by itself and the one in this kit was better than the one she bought.  So obviously I just bought another one.  If I can make three women happy with a few clicks of a mouse, it&#x27;s a 5-star deal for sure.</li>
            <li> I love the case, it makes them look so professional, and my friends think I actually know what I am doing! I have done several of my friends make-up (including one for her wedding) and the brushes work great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I clean them regularly and have never seen the hairs come out, paint come off the handles, or brushes detach from the handles. They work great and I would recommend them to anyone who wants a nice set of brushes.</li>
            <li> As many people mentioned they do smell a little but thats not the problem. one of the brush came off on the first day so that was very disappointing. Also they dont blend well. I say buy real technique brushes from Ulta way better than this. I have real technique and I wish I didnt buy these lite makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> I liked the brushes when I first received them, however after moderate use for a little over a month the heads of the brushes began falling off the wood handles.  The large fan brush was used only once in a test as I had never used that type of brush and it also fell apart.  I returned the brushes due to the poor quality and the fact they were falling apart therefore not usable, and was charged a restock fee!!  Not happy that I paid $55 for what I thought would be quality brushes to find them falling apart after minimal use, then charged a restock fee when I return them as defective!!</li>
            <li> So glad I ordered these brushes, they&#x27;re amazing quality!!! Great investment, nice, soft hairs and they&#x27;re also thick, certainly recommend!</li>
            <li> Bristles were falling out of all the brushes sent back did not feel they were good quality and were not worth the money paid</li>
            <li> These brushes are of great quality compared to most that you can buy on the website.  The bristles are soft and of professional quality.  I really love the extra large fan brush to dust off makeup from the face.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> i got the brush after reading great reviews, once receive the order it look very nice and decent price. Start to use it, the stipple hair brush falls off in chunk...still manage to use it and the hair still fall off. I thought it could be new that&#x27;s why the hair keep coming off. I think the hair is not glue on good for this stipple brush. It was my favorite as well. Send the seller a feedback and have no reply. I think I gonna have to return this item, since the price drop almost $14 since I have purchase it within a week.</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved the brushes!! great Material and they DO NOT shed!</li>
            <li> This set of brushes is the best I have ever owned! Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every brush you could ever imagine needing is included&lt;br /&gt;Fibers don&#x27;t come off in your hand, which indicates high quality&lt;br /&gt;The difference in how my face looks is astounding&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to buy another set of these right now to save for when these are worn, though I anticipate that to be a very long time from now! To say that I feel I&#x27;m putting on my best face is an understatement; my makeup looks professionally done, and believe me, I&#x27;m no professional!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this set of brushes to anyone, novice or professional. I am really enjoying owning these brushes!</li>
            <li> I really needed these brushes. I don&#x27;t know what I would do without them now. ugh buy these they are awesome.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes for my daughter for her birthday. She started to use them and she like them because they were soft but after the second week of used they were coming off of their handle. I should have write this review from that time but like I barely have time to be here giving reviews about products and now I have the time to give them so other people don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did and take a long time in reviewing an item that you pay so much money for it and you don&#x27;t get what is worth. So disappointed.</li>
            <li> One brush all the brissel came out the first 2-3 times I used it. Others only ok. not worth the price.</li>
            <li> not practical, wastes a lot of makeup, inefficient. only looks cute. I was very dissapointed with this purchase. Enough said.</li>
            <li> had it a a while now.  ITs good HOWEVER a FEW OF THE BRUSHES HANDLES CAME OFF..... Glued them back on and all good now</li>
            <li> Received these brushes in the mail only to open them and have 5 of them with broken handles and flared out bristles. just a no good damaged product. was way too expensive for the quality. i tried contacting the seller. i still havent heard from them. i tried reaching them via email and through the phone and nothing. DO NOT BUY! its a waste of money you have better luck with dollar brushes than these.</li>
            <li> These brushes are beautiful and seem to be of ggod quality. However the faux leather pouch looks really cheap and smells like some strange toxic chemicals. I am not at all overly sensitive to odors, but this smell is more overwhelming than a car full of dead fish in August.&lt;br /&gt;I wish they would just send the brushes in a throw away package.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! I love the fact they come in this nice pouch so I can take them anywhere. And I have every brush I need to apply makeup with. They are also super easy to clean with brush cleaner. Would get another set like them in the future</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes. I first bought a set for my sister and was a bit jealous that I didn&#x27;t have them! So, naturally, I bought a set for me! The bristles are super soft, but they still pick up/deposit/blend makeup really well. There&#x27;s a faint smell that comes from the case so the bristles smelled a tiny bit at first. I left them out for a day, then the smell was gone. So far, the bristles haven&#x27;t shed at all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know how to begin to explain how much I LOVE these brushes. I felt like a kid on Christmas morning when I opened this case and saw all the many different brushes. There is a brush for anything and everything you can think of, you will never want to purchase another brush set again! When I first opened the set, I wanted to play with it for hours,and do all of my girlfriends makeup! The quality of these brushes are worth the price. The first thing I did when I opened these brushes was to play with the tips of them, I could tell just by looking at them that they were professional quality brushes. Typically if you purchased a cheaper set of brushes,(I have before) you can run your fingers through the tips of the brushes and the little fibers will come out on your fingers, but not with this set. The first time I used a few of these brushes I was just blown away, My eye makeup looked completely different than it did when I used a cheaper set of brushes. I mean it did not look bad with my other brushes, but it looked amazing with the Elite set, my makeup looked like a professional had applied it! The case that comes with this particular set of brushes is wonderful, each piece sits very snug in the pockets and there is a flap that folds down over them so if you drop them, or turn them sideways they will not fall out. It is not big or bulky, it even fits in my purse! This Elite 18 piece makeup brush set is like the icing on the cake! Other brushes are like cake without icing, they are good, but these brushes are like having your cake and eating it too, AMAZING! You will not be disapointed with this set! GET IT :))</li>
            <li> high quality.  great set of good quality brushes for such a good price.  apply and blend nicely and don&#x27;t shed and and thet wash well.</li>
            <li> I purchased these brushes on sale and must say they were nicely packaged and the whole set is very attractive--at a friendly price! :) The case they come in is elegant and nice to look at. All of the brushes have a nice light-weight feel to them when held. The only thing I did not favor was the strong odor of the case that I hope dissipates over time. My impression of these makeup brushes is that they are quite soft to the touch (haven&#x27;t used them with my makeup yet)and seem to be made with good quality. I noticed that the two fan brushes (the small and little) had a slightly noticeable amount of frayed/curled bristles on the sides but it is not a major concern and I don&#x27;t think it will hinder their performance. The set is elegant and I love how they feel when swept across my skin! I would recommend these brushes to anyone! Again, the only thing I did not like was the strong odor of the case and the slightly frayed hairs on the sides of both of the fan brushes. However, I think the hairs will straighten out and relax once I wash and use them. Otherwise, they are a beautiful brush set at at a great bargain! I will try to update my review after I use them for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. My husband thought these were my painting brushes (I&#x27;m an artist), I thought that was funny! However, I do wish painting brushes came with really cute brush cases like this :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATED REVIEW ON 2/25/13***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, these brushes are really pretty and nice-looking. The strong chemical odor of the case mellowed out and I no longer smell it anymore, which is a huge plus. Some of the brushes are almost \\&quot;too\\&quot; soft while others are too \\&quot;stiff\\&quot; to blend and apply my makeup properly--which is why I docked a star. Perhaps I am using them wrong? On the bright side, these brushes haven&#x27;t shed on my face like cheaper ones have in the past and don&#x27;t irritate my skin because they are super silky. I have also had much better experiences with certain drugstore brushes like EcoTools and Sonia Kashuk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use mineral blush and powder for my face, but use liquid foundation (I did not really like the foundation brush it came with). I wish they were a little more firm for better application. I feel that a lot of drugstore brushes work more effectively than these. For the $50 price tag on sale, I am not going to return them because I still think they have great value and offer a variety of tools. Another thing I didn&#x27;t like but will get used to is that the brushes are thick and take a long time to dry after I clean them. My favorite brush is the tiny, pointed eyeliner brush that applies my gel eyeliner so perfectly. The jumbo fan brush is a lot of fun, I love to lightly sweep powder or a little shimmer on my face with it! I am purchasing some fuller and thicker drugstore eyeshadow brushes because these eyeshadow brushes are just too stiff, thin, and short to apply eyeshadow, it almost hurts my eyelids. I really wanted to love this whole set, but I think there are some brushes that I didn&#x27;t end up caring for as much as I thought I would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these brushes, but would warn that you might want to get better eyeshadow brushes if you really like to blend your makeup.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with these brushes they are soft and they don&#x27;t brake on my face like my MAC brushes did.  PLUS amazing price!</li>
            <li> These are really beautiful brushes. Beautifully mace, good weight and the brushes are silky soft. Fast shipping. Vinyl case was a tad smelly when first opened but the smell has lessened over time. Not sure I&#x27;ll ever use all the brushes, there are so many but well worth the money to me.</li>
            <li> I bought some makeup brushes by Christian Dior and they do not look this great and I only got four small ones for more money.  I will be taking them back to Macy&#x27;s tomorrow.  This is a very nice high quality set.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was nervous about ordering brushes online but I really like these brushes. They don&#x27;t shed and are very soft.</li>
            <li> I am a person that is super picky about the things I use on my face and I was really nervous buying this but I have to say I am very impressed with this product. The quality of this product is amazing. The brushed are soft, they don&#x27;t shed, and they are very attractive. They are the type of brushes you would see being sold at Sephora for a really expensive price. The case it comes in is a bit big but it&#x27;s very nice and attractive looking as well. Basically, for the ladies that do love having nice makeup tools this is a must buy. You just can&#x27;t got wrong with the quality and the price!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t happy, I got 3 brushes that were the same &amp; 1 was loose where it joins at the handle....the only thing nice is the makeup brush case! I wish the brushes could of been as nice as the case:(</li>
            <li> These brushes are of high quality.  Very soft brushes and long lasting.  Very happy customer.</li>
            <li> I really love this set. The quality compared to other sets is very good. I love the handles on these brushes and looks very professional. My only complaint is I did not like the eyeshadow brush. Too flat and hard. The other brushes are very soft and applies my make up with ease. My favorite brush out of this set is the eyeshadow blender brush. It really does a great job blending my eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> The order came in in two days! Great brushes. I have a big collection of brushes i want to stay away from MAC because they can be expensive and been trying other brands that are as great quality as they are and these brushes are as good as it can get. Very soft and the materials there made of are really good. The seller had done a great job by shopping it ASAP. Got the order in 3 days.</li>
            <li> I am more than pleased with this purchase.. Excellent quality, zero shedding, and zero smells.. The case is durable, and very well made.</li>
            <li> These are great brushes - soft, very high quality, and the case is perfect. High quality vegan makeup brushes are scarce, and I am glad I found these. I think they will last a long time to come.</li>
            <li> If you are used to nice brushes you will be disappointed. I felt it was bulky with a lot of unnecessary brushes and not the quality of my Lancôme brush set..</li>
            <li> I love these brushes and would have given a 5 star review were it not for the super softness of the brushes that do not work well with compact makeup. The powder brush is too soft to get a good coating from the compact powder I was using and resulted in the top of the compact powder getting a glazed top that had to be scraped off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loose powders or finishing is what these brushes work best with. My favorites are the foundation brushes that blend foundation evenly, angled eye brush to feather the eyebrow pencil, and powder brush. The large powder brush is so soft, it&#x27;s almost like using a gentle breeze to apply the makeup ( I&#x27;m not making this up!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 4 stars is also for not giving me a smaller, tighter, angled blush brush. That said, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use it on my compact blush anyway.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality very soft brushes.  Use it every day.</li>
            <li> Realized I would never use so many brushes but made a great gift for a friend in theater. His need for make up made it a gift he was excited to receive. Yes, the odor mentioned was noted but airing for few days made it fine.</li>
            <li> These brushes are like a pillow of paradise, as my favorite youtuber girl likes to say! worth it!</li>
            <li> These are my first set of quality synthetic brushes and I love them. I have another set of brushes that are made from animal hair and they are so hard to clean and are not soft at all. I had another set of brushes that I didn&#x27;t spent very much on and within a short time I tossed them in the trash because they shed all over the place and when I washed them I would loose more bristles. I have had these brushes for about 1 month and they are so soft and super easy to clean. I haven&#x27;t had a problem with any shedding. The handles are smooth and are the right length. The case they come in is really nice. I would highly recommend that you get them before the price goes up. Just think about it, each brush is just $3.27. How many quality synthetic brushes can you buy for that price?</li>
            <li> I have never bought a set of brushed before in my life.  I have always been the sponge/I will use whatever the makeup came with type of person.  I bought these after looking for a long time for a pair of brushes that I felt would be the best for me.  I didn&#x27;t want something to expensive and I wanted a variety of brushes.  When these brushes came in I immediately wanted to do my makeup.  They are so soft and I haven&#x27;t had any shedding at all of the bristles.  I would recommend this to everyone.  The case this comes with is also really nice.  Although it did smell a little funny, after I washed the brushes and let the case air out it is almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> I love experimenting with make-up and trying new looks. These brushes are absolutely amazing in helping me to achieve the desired looks and effects I want. And they are really soft on the skin.</li>
            <li> LOVE THESE BRUSHES! And this is coming from a MAC Queen :D Get these brushes while you can. I don&#x27;t see very many of these.</li>
            <li> A beautiful set!  I have a good quality brush for every step of my cosmetics routine.  The brushes wash up nice!  I love them!</li>
