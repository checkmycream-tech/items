            <li>I love the way this product makes my skin feel when I step out of the bath, from the relaxing moment I get in the tub and soak, till the moment I get out, my skin feels softer and tighter and cleaner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too sure about dissolving cellulite, but I just started using the product</li>
            <li>First off, it smells AMAZING!</li>
            <li>I LOVE, LOVE,</li>
            <li>Where do I begin with my love for Vi Tae Skinny Bath??</li>
            <li>Ladies, this is especially great during that time of the month when you&#x27;re feeling like a big ol bag of bloat!!</li>
            <li>The fragrance could be better.</li>
            <li>I love the way these Skinny Bath bath salts smell and how they make me feel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that it has NO Parabens;</li>
            <li>I stayed in much longer than twenty minutes because it was so relaxing and smelled great.</li>
            <li>and I was so relaxed and was able to get the most satisfying sleep that night in a while.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it makes you feel so relaxed.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m confident this helps with the results.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love bath products and wanted to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I will try to use more often this time around to see if it makes difference in my cellulite.</li>
            <li>Even more though, I can feel the difference.  </li>
            <li>I love the way this product makes my skin feel when I step out of the bath, from the relaxing moment I get in the tub and soak, till the  moment I get out, my skin feels softer and tighter and cleaner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too sure about dissolving cellulite, but I just started using the product</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that you need to be eating a healthy diet along with exercise and drinking plenty of water.</li>
            <li>makes me want to stay in tub even longer, feels so healthy and skin glows</li>
            <li>This really is excellent for my fluid retention.  </li>
            <li>Feel so much better, after bathing.  </li>
            <li>Try it, love it.</li>
            <li>The customer service is outstanding.</li>
            <li>I recieved this product for free for my honest review</li>
            <li>love it it does get rid of inflammation and bloat</li>
            <li>I have bought better scrubs in drug stores.</li>
            <li>Homemade versions are better.</li>
            <li>Love this product.....</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the way my skin feels after using it.  </li>
            <li>So, it does a pretty good job at smoothing your skin.</li>
            <li>But honestly I would continue to use anyway just because of how relaxed I felt, being a mom of three and going to school full time.</li>
            <li>Soaking in warm water with these salts greatly reduces the fluid retention, swelling, and also makes my skin feel more taut and smooth.</li>
            <li>I felt quite relieved after using it in a warm bath - will reorder when this first one runs out!</li>
            <li>very good for fluid retention</li>
            <li>I read very good reviews prior to using this product.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a miracle cure for cellulite, but it does sure tighten my skin and does seem to smooth it in places.  </li>
            <li>It Easy bath salts now</li>
            <li>The scent is very mild.</li>
            <li>But what I recieved was a headache from the strong smell of the bath salt, and did not help my skin in the ways they said it would.</li>
            <li>can actually see some difference after my first container of this stuff, which is awesome!  </li>
            <li>I bought two and am so pleased with just my first bath!</li>
            <li>I was super excited to try this!</li>
            <li>Makes skin really smooth.</li>
            <li>and I cannot say that I experienced the Cellulite dissolving or fluid reducing promises.</li>
            <li>However, my skin did feel firm and these seemed to do a marvelous job on water retention/bloating.  </li>
            <li>Contains the wonderful healing properties of the dead sea salts with a glorious aromatherapy and added scent.  </li>
            <li>So ignore that part and enjoy the bath!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li>I know some would like the oil to soak in and enjoy the smoothness of your skin afterwards.</li>
            <li>These sea salts smell divine and leave my skin so smooth.</li>
            <li>MY BODY FEELS SMOOTH, LOOKS HEALTHIER, AND THE SALTS ARE SO RELAXING</li>
            <li>I could tell a difference in the dimples on my thighs on the second use ... great product</li>
            <li>Each time I&#x27;ve used it since, I had the bathroom door open when it filled and found the scent to be sweet, attractive, and not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff falls nothing short of amazing!</li>
            <li>and I was so relaxed and was able to get the most satisfying sleep that night in a while.t only drank water before and after my bath but throughout my bath.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the tingle when you first get in the water.  </li>
            <li>and I was so excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to see that after 2 days I had gotten this product.</li>
            <li>And happily, there was no unpleasant residue left to clean after bathing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received this product in exchange for my honest review and I will definitely purchase more in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used this bath for a couple reasons: to help with tension after a long day of helping a friend move and also because I was interested to see how this helped make me more &amp;#34;skinny.&amp;#34; The bath salts felt good, the oils smooth and the aromas were pleasant and overall I did feel refreshed after ward.</li>
            <li>More like a healthy, subtle toned feel to my skin, which I&#x27;m completely loving!</li>
            <li>First I must say that the products scent is a bit strong.</li>
            <li>Just an all around super product.</li>
            <li>I thought that was super generous of the company.</li>
            <li>The sent is very strong so if you have a sensitive nose you may not like these.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to follow these instructions, if you don&#x27;t, be prepared for some pretty killer muscle cramps.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to follow these instructions, if you don&#x27;t, be prepared for some pretty killer muscle cramps.</li>
            <li>bath is now beautifully scented and, after getting out, my muscles are relaxed and skin firm.  </li>
            <li>Just the smell is a bit strong, and I don&#x27;t really like the smell.</li>
            <li>Very luxurious!!</li>
            <li>After the first use!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use as often as I should have because with my busy schedule quick showers work better for me.</li>
            <li>However, I have to say that when I did get the chance to soak, my skin was very smooth and soft after adding the salts to my bath water.</li>
            <li>Received this product complimentary to try &amp; review.  </li>
            <li>I can not say enough good things about this bath soak, and highly recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li>NO Acrylamide; No Phelon Carbolic Acid; NO Dioxane; NO Toluene; NO Artificial Colors; NO Artificial Scents.</li>
            <li>It does smell nice though, but nothing significantly different than a bit of epson salts and some eucalyptus.</li>
            <li>My favorite part though is how soft my skin is.  </li>
            <li>I have to say that of all the cellulite antics that I&#x27;ve tried, this one so far has shown the MOST difference in the quickest</li>
            <li>2) after the bath my skin had a distinct oily feel to it that didn&#x27;t rinse off right away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered several of their other products as well, and am equally impressed by the quality of their products, their customer service, packaging and prompt shipping services.</li>
            <li>I put moisturizer on right out of the tub</li>
            <li>The scent is very strong, so I would recommend that you have the bathroom window or door open when you fill the tub.  </li>
            <li>After the first week I started seeing results.  </li>
            <li>but it really does what it promises!</li>
            <li>I first ordered it and took it with me on a &#x27;relaxation / health retreat&#x27; trip to the mountains</li>
            <li>and I think soaking in these salts first increases the effects of the moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Love the aroma, and it is definitely a relaxing bath.</li>
            <li>Lost 3 lbs after first usage.  </li>
            <li>It dissolves pretty well in the water.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I tried this company/product.</li>
            <li>These salts are definitely top of the line and will definitely order again!</li>
            <li>I tried it tonight other than the promised results I was so relaxed, it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>flakes are large and do not dissolve immediately in a hot bath.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough yet to see if it actually works, but it does have a very pleasant aroma...</li>
            <li>Maybe I just need to use it longer, but I am pretty much out of it.</li>
            <li>As long as I think of this as an all natural, aromatic bath I really liked it.</li>
            <li>I just ordered a few more jars since it seems like Amazon sells out fairly quickly</li>
            <li>The product overall is fine.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that my legs don&#x27;t ache as much and after working out it took the soreness out of my muscles.</li>
            <li>I drank a whole bottle of water beforehand and after as instructed because you will sweat.....</li>
            <li>No noticeable difference after going through the whole thing.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really expect this to do anything to my cellulite.</li>
            <li>It is very relaxing</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t really noticed any skin tightening/smoothing yet.</li>
            <li>The company, Vi-Tae, is very customer oriented.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel skinny or look skinnier, but frankly, I didn&#x27;t see that as a real expectation anyway.</li>
            <li>i found that the smell did not bother me as much</li>
            <li>so very relaxing....</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.  </li>
            <li>i find it to be very relaxing.</li>
            <li>It is much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used them, I had the door closed while the tub filled</li>
            <li>Smells great, all natural, so relaxing, and definitely makes you sweat away some extra fluid.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this product and how it left my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Two drawbacks, kind of small container for quantity use and my husband wasnt a fan of the smell.</li>
            <li>The essential oils make my skin feel so soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>While you will feel a renewed sense of firmness, it does not strip your skin of the natural moisture, and actually leaves it with a silky smooth feel.</li>
            <li>My thighs feel much more tight n taught-like...not in a &amp;</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients seem to be of high quality</li>
            <li>The smell of the salt is strong (which I prefer) it helped open my sinus&#x27; and the smell really lasted a long time!</li>
            <li>I kept my environment low key, low light and low sound during all this</li>
            <li>I kept my environment low key, low light and low sound during all this</li>
            <li>makes my skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li>I used this product for the first time last night and woke up 3 pounds skinnier!  </li>
            <li>it wouldn&#x27;t hold up, like so many other similar claims.</li>
            <li>I sit at a desk all day for work and my ankles tend to swell some days, but an evening soak in this stuff really seems to help get my ankles back to normal.  </li>
            <li>This product leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft and I have noticed less cellulite.</li>
            <li>This really is a professional grade, spa quality product.</li>
            <li>but I have taken 5 so far with a 1/4 of a cup of the product each time and</li>
            <li>On;ly used this once so far</li>
            <li>I like doTERRA essential oils; and tried their cellulite mixture, but it was to much work mixing etc.</li>
            <li>This product draws out retained fluid and leaves your skin feeling more firm...</li>
            <li>They arrived just when I needed them most after a particularly exhausting high strung couple of days.  </li>
            <li>At first, I felt like it was tightening my skin, but by the end of the jar (which is pretty small), it didn&#x27;t improve anything.</li>
            <li>I am not totally convinced of the cellulite dissolving claims but I am still a new user.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in cellulite but did see a reduction in fluid and that my legs &amp; bottom were firmer both after the soak &amp; the morning following.</li>
            <li>This is much easier and has all the same essential oils.</li>
            <li>It was super relaxing after a long, rough day at work.</li>
            <li>It arrived sealed, but once opened it was not full all the way to the top, not sure if that is normal or not, could be why I will not make my 8 baths.</li>
            <li>Ok, I have a decent amount of cellulite unfortunately.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something that is both completely natural and works, then look no further.</li>
            <li>In addition, the oils in the product left my skin feeling extremely soft.  </li>
            <li>(If you want immediate, you might want to hit a medical spa instead of taking the natural route).  </li>
            <li>and it was very relaxing but still did not help in any other way.</li>
            <li>The absolute answer to soothing your muscles and spirit of after a day of physical or mental exertion.</li>
            <li>Its so relaxing and my skin is definitely more firm for a few days after soaking in it.</li>
            <li>Like any woman over 30, genetically predisposed to cellulite only major surgery will rid me of it completely, but this has helped enough that short skirts are no longer embarrassing.  </li>

            <li> I love the way this product makes my skin feel when I step out of the bath, from the relaxing moment I get in the tub and soak, till the moment I get out, my skin feels softer and tighter and cleaner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too sure about dissolving cellulite, but I just started using the product</li>

            <li> I LOVE, LOVE,</li>
            <li> Where do I begin with my love for Vi Tae Skinny Bath??</li>
            <li> Ladies, this is especially great during that time of the month when you&#x27;re feeling like a big ol bag of bloat!!</li>
            <li> The fragrance could be better.</li>
            <li> I love the way these Skinny Bath bath salts smell and how they make me feel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that it has NO Parabens;</li>
            <li> I stayed in much longer than twenty minutes because it was so relaxing and smelled great.</li>
            <li> and I was so relaxed and was able to get the most satisfying sleep that night in a while.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it makes you feel so relaxed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confident this helps with the results.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love bath products and wanted to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I will try to use more often this time around to see if it makes difference in my cellulite.</li>
            <li> Even more though, I can feel the difference.  </li>
            <li> I love the way this product makes my skin feel when I step out of the bath, from the relaxing moment I get in the tub and soak, till the  moment I get out, my skin feels softer and tighter and cleaner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too sure about dissolving cellulite, but I just started using the product</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that you need to be eating a healthy diet along with exercise and drinking plenty of water.</li>
            <li> makes me want to stay in tub even longer, feels so healthy and skin glows</li>
            <li> This really is excellent for my fluid retention.  </li>
            <li> Feel so much better, after bathing.  </li>
            <li> Try it, love it.</li>
            <li> The customer service is outstanding.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product for free for my honest review</li>
            <li> love it it does get rid of inflammation and bloat</li>
            <li> I have bought better scrubs in drug stores.</li>
            <li> Homemade versions are better.</li>
            <li> Love this product.....</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the way my skin feels after using it.  </li>
            <li> So, it does a pretty good job at smoothing your skin.</li>
            <li> But honestly I would continue to use anyway just because of how relaxed I felt, being a mom of three and going to school full time.</li>
            <li> Soaking in warm water with these salts greatly reduces the fluid retention, swelling, and also makes my skin feel more taut and smooth.</li>
            <li> I felt quite relieved after using it in a warm bath - will reorder when this first one runs out!</li>
            <li> very good for fluid retention</li>
            <li> I read very good reviews prior to using this product.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a miracle cure for cellulite, but it does sure tighten my skin and does seem to smooth it in places.  </li>
            <li> It Easy bath salts now</li>
            <li> The scent is very mild.</li>
            <li> But what I recieved was a headache from the strong smell of the bath salt, and did not help my skin in the ways they said it would.</li>
            <li> can actually see some difference after my first container of this stuff, which is awesome!  </li>
            <li> I bought two and am so pleased with just my first bath!</li>
            <li> I was super excited to try this!</li>
            <li> Makes skin really smooth.</li>
            <li> and I cannot say that I experienced the Cellulite dissolving or fluid reducing promises.</li>
            <li> However, my skin did feel firm and these seemed to do a marvelous job on water retention/bloating.  </li>
            <li> Contains the wonderful healing properties of the dead sea salts with a glorious aromatherapy and added scent.  </li>
            <li> So ignore that part and enjoy the bath!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li> I know some would like the oil to soak in and enjoy the smoothness of your skin afterwards.</li>
            <li> These sea salts smell divine and leave my skin so smooth.</li>
            <li> MY BODY FEELS SMOOTH, LOOKS HEALTHIER, AND THE SALTS ARE SO RELAXING</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference in the dimples on my thighs on the second use ... great product</li>
            <li> Each time I&#x27;ve used it since, I had the bathroom door open when it filled and found the scent to be sweet, attractive, and not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff falls nothing short of amazing!</li>
            <li> and I was so relaxed and was able to get the most satisfying sleep that night in a while.t only drank water before and after my bath but throughout my bath.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the tingle when you first get in the water.  </li>
            <li> and I was so excited to try it out.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to see that after 2 days I had gotten this product.</li>
            <li> And happily, there was no unpleasant residue left to clean after bathing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received this product in exchange for my honest review and I will definitely purchase more in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this bath for a couple reasons: to help with tension after a long day of helping a friend move and also because I was interested to see how this helped make me more &amp;#34;skinny.&amp;#34; The bath salts felt good, the oils smooth and the aromas were pleasant and overall I did feel refreshed after ward.</li>
            <li> More like a healthy, subtle toned feel to my skin, which I&#x27;m completely loving!</li>
            <li> First I must say that the products scent is a bit strong.</li>
            <li> Just an all around super product.</li>
            <li> I thought that was super generous of the company.</li>
            <li> The sent is very strong so if you have a sensitive nose you may not like these.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to follow these instructions, if you don&#x27;t, be prepared for some pretty killer muscle cramps.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to follow these instructions, if you don&#x27;t, be prepared for some pretty killer muscle cramps.</li>
            <li> bath is now beautifully scented and, after getting out, my muscles are relaxed and skin firm.  </li>
            <li> Just the smell is a bit strong, and I don&#x27;t really like the smell.</li>
            <li> Very luxurious!!</li>
            <li> After the first use!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use as often as I should have because with my busy schedule quick showers work better for me.</li>
            <li> However, I have to say that when I did get the chance to soak, my skin was very smooth and soft after adding the salts to my bath water.</li>
            <li> Received this product complimentary to try &amp; review.  </li>
            <li> I can not say enough good things about this bath soak, and highly recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> NO Acrylamide; No Phelon Carbolic Acid; NO Dioxane; NO Toluene; NO Artificial Colors; NO Artificial Scents.</li>
            <li> It does smell nice though, but nothing significantly different than a bit of epson salts and some eucalyptus.</li>
            <li> My favorite part though is how soft my skin is.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that of all the cellulite antics that I&#x27;ve tried, this one so far has shown the MOST difference in the quickest</li>
            <li> 2) after the bath my skin had a distinct oily feel to it that didn&#x27;t rinse off right away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered several of their other products as well, and am equally impressed by the quality of their products, their customer service, packaging and prompt shipping services.</li>
            <li> I put moisturizer on right out of the tub</li>
            <li> The scent is very strong, so I would recommend that you have the bathroom window or door open when you fill the tub.  </li>
            <li> After the first week I started seeing results.  </li>
            <li> but it really does what it promises!</li>
            <li> I first ordered it and took it with me on a &#x27;relaxation / health retreat&#x27; trip to the mountains</li>
            <li> and I think soaking in these salts first increases the effects of the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love the aroma, and it is definitely a relaxing bath.</li>
            <li> Lost 3 lbs after first usage.  </li>
            <li> It dissolves pretty well in the water.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I tried this company/product.</li>
            <li> These salts are definitely top of the line and will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> I tried it tonight other than the promised results I was so relaxed, it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> flakes are large and do not dissolve immediately in a hot bath.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough yet to see if it actually works, but it does have a very pleasant aroma...</li>
            <li> Maybe I just need to use it longer, but I am pretty much out of it.</li>
            <li> As long as I think of this as an all natural, aromatic bath I really liked it.</li>
            <li> I just ordered a few more jars since it seems like Amazon sells out fairly quickly</li>
            <li> The product overall is fine.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that my legs don&#x27;t ache as much and after working out it took the soreness out of my muscles.</li>
            <li> I drank a whole bottle of water beforehand and after as instructed because you will sweat.....</li>
            <li> No noticeable difference after going through the whole thing.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really expect this to do anything to my cellulite.</li>
            <li> It is very relaxing</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t really noticed any skin tightening/smoothing yet.</li>
            <li> The company, Vi-Tae, is very customer oriented.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel skinny or look skinnier, but frankly, I didn&#x27;t see that as a real expectation anyway.</li>
            <li> i found that the smell did not bother me as much</li>
            <li> so very relaxing....</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.  </li>
            <li> i find it to be very relaxing.</li>
            <li> It is much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used them, I had the door closed while the tub filled</li>
            <li> Smells great, all natural, so relaxing, and definitely makes you sweat away some extra fluid.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this product and how it left my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Two drawbacks, kind of small container for quantity use and my husband wasnt a fan of the smell.</li>
            <li> The essential oils make my skin feel so soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> While you will feel a renewed sense of firmness, it does not strip your skin of the natural moisture, and actually leaves it with a silky smooth feel.</li>
            <li> My thighs feel much more tight n taught-like...not in a &amp;</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients seem to be of high quality</li>
            <li> The smell of the salt is strong (which I prefer) it helped open my sinus&#x27; and the smell really lasted a long time!</li>
            <li> I kept my environment low key, low light and low sound during all this</li>
            <li> I kept my environment low key, low light and low sound during all this</li>
            <li> makes my skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time last night and woke up 3 pounds skinnier!  </li>
            <li> it wouldn&#x27;t hold up, like so many other similar claims.</li>
            <li> I sit at a desk all day for work and my ankles tend to swell some days, but an evening soak in this stuff really seems to help get my ankles back to normal.  </li>
            <li> This product leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft and I have noticed less cellulite.</li>
            <li> This really is a professional grade, spa quality product.</li>
            <li> but I have taken 5 so far with a 1/4 of a cup of the product each time and</li>
            <li> On;ly used this once so far</li>
            <li> I like doTERRA essential oils; and tried their cellulite mixture, but it was to much work mixing etc.</li>
            <li> This product draws out retained fluid and leaves your skin feeling more firm...</li>
            <li> They arrived just when I needed them most after a particularly exhausting high strung couple of days.  </li>
            <li> At first, I felt like it was tightening my skin, but by the end of the jar (which is pretty small), it didn&#x27;t improve anything.</li>
            <li> I am not totally convinced of the cellulite dissolving claims but I am still a new user.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in cellulite but did see a reduction in fluid and that my legs &amp; bottom were firmer both after the soak &amp; the morning following.</li>
            <li> This is much easier and has all the same essential oils.</li>
            <li> It was super relaxing after a long, rough day at work.</li>
            <li> It arrived sealed, but once opened it was not full all the way to the top, not sure if that is normal or not, could be why I will not make my 8 baths.</li>
            <li> Ok, I have a decent amount of cellulite unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something that is both completely natural and works, then look no further.</li>
            <li> In addition, the oils in the product left my skin feeling extremely soft.  </li>
            <li> (If you want immediate, you might want to hit a medical spa instead of taking the natural route).  </li>
            <li> and it was very relaxing but still did not help in any other way.</li>
            <li> The absolute answer to soothing your muscles and spirit of after a day of physical or mental exertion.</li>
            <li> Its so relaxing and my skin is definitely more firm for a few days after soaking in it.</li>
            <li> Like any woman over 30, genetically predisposed to cellulite only major surgery will rid me of it completely, but this has helped enough that short skirts are no longer embarrassing.  </li>
            <li> I bought this due to the natural ingredients and put some in my bath once a week for detoxing.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any fluid reducing, the aroma was nice but very expensive</li>
            <li> And I could really tell with just after once use how my skin on my legs were just a little tighter!</li>
            <li> After a long workout, this is the only thing i want in my bath water.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t had much sleep in a few days because I simply could not wind down enough to relax.  </li>
            <li> I like that this is a natural product with dead sea salts and essential oils.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your hard earned money....unless u are rich and just want to try....</li>
            <li> Additionally, the salts helped me some minor muscle aches which was a lovey bonus.</li>
            <li> Perhaps long term use would show results.</li>
            <li> But because they are supposed to help with water retention, I was still curious enough to try them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other bath salts that the smell doesn&#x27;t last</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase again and try other products from the line up.  </li>
            <li> I came across this while looking to relieve my dry skin.</li>
            <li> To use, just put a couple of tablespoons of this into your bath, sit back and relax for a half an hour.</li>
            <li> I have just a small amount left, no way it will fill the 1/4 cup again and definitely not enough to get me to the 8 baths.</li>
            <li> There were little white floating things all over the place in the water - even after about 20 minutes of soaking.</li>
            <li> I also was given a little card with a way to possibly receive up to 50% off just for buying the product.</li>
            <li> The detoxing essential oils gently pull toxins from the lymph system without causing a detox reaction and feeling ill.  </li>
            <li> I had knee reconstruction surgery a few years ago and still have a lot of swelling and fluid retention in my knee and sometimes my feet and ankles.</li>
            <li> I was really curious if these salts would help me.</li>
            <li> I am just getting used to this product and do not really have a results yet.  </li>
            <li> Buy regular dead sea salt.  </li>
            <li> The essential oils are relaxing (not overwhelming) and my skin is no longer dry.</li>
            <li> I have used both and the other not only lasts longer but costs less than half the price.</li>
            <li> After I got out, I wrapped myself in a big towel and went and laid down with a cozy blanket as instructed continuing to drink plenty of water because you will continue to sweat as your body kicks out all those toxins.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure if it is actually cellulite reducing, because I have started doing yoga about the same time that I started using these bath salts, but I can suggest to you a combination of this product and some yoga classes if you would like to firm up!</li>
            <li> I would try other scents&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try your other products.</li>
            <li> AND LOOKING FORWARD TO TRYING THEIR OTHER PRODUCTS</li>
            <li> It is no different than sugar exfoliating scrubs I made in the past.</li>
            <li> This is just like any other bath salt in my opinion</li>
            <li> Over all average product.</li>
            <li> (at least, I waited a month for it to come back in stock).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It helps me wind down and relax.</li>
            <li> I feel less flabby and the water retention isn&#x27;t there.</li>
            <li> For me, I&#x27;d have preferred an less oily finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It relaxes me and yes I feel way less stressed when I get out.</li>
            <li> I use this for maintaining a tone and tight body.</li>
            <li> And I wasn&#x27;t let down!</li>
            <li> I try to use only products with natural and or organic ingredients without all the chemicals that are bad for you.</li>
            <li> I used this in combination with the Vitae Firm Baby Firm and Vitae Skinny Bod lotions twice a week for about a month.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Ingredients from the bottle:  dead sea salts, pinus sylvestris (pine) needle oil, cupressus sempervirens (cypress) leaf/stem oil, salvia officinalis (sage) oil, juniperus communis (juniper) needle leaf oil, canarium luzonicum (elemi) oil &amp; pelargonium graveolens (geranium) flower oil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Will followup in a few months.</li>
            <li> It would be less expensive to just buy epsom salts with the same outcome.</li>
            <li> The scent is vaguely pine, mixed with sage and to me it seems a little eucalyptus.</li>
            <li> not sure it is doing anything</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> During cold season it not only slims you down but clears your sinuses too.</li>
            <li> This product has forced me to relax for 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li> Definitely sucks the water out of ya!  </li>
            <li> Plus the lid was broken when I received it.</li>
            <li> it does help my tired muscles tho, and here is a warning smells like vix.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I used this in combination with the Vitae Firm Baby Firm and Vitae Skinny Bod lotions twice a week for about a month.  After the first week I started seeing results.  While the results have not been drastic, I have noticed a reduction in cellulite.  Like any woman over 30, genetically predisposed to cellulite only major surgery will rid me of it completely, but this has helped enough that short skirts are no longer embarrassing.  Additionally, the salts helped me some minor muscle aches which was a lovey bonus.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to lose some extra fluid for a while now and nothing has helped.  Until this.  Great product that makes you want to just nap after.</li>
            <li> I LOOOOOVE these bath salts. I take a bath just because I have these to use. The sent is very strong so if you have a sensitive nose you may not like these. The scent is vaguely pine, mixed with sage and to me it seems a little eucalyptus. I&#x27;m not really sure if it is actually cellulite reducing, because I have started doing yoga about the same time that I started using these bath salts, but I can suggest to you a combination of this product and some yoga classes if you would like to firm up!</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and great price! Will add more comments to this review after I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> this salt works all I need to say on second gar now.</li>
            <li> Nothing like soaking in a bath of wonderful aromas and feeling your skin tighten as you get out. I feel less flabby and the water retention isn&#x27;t there. Love this product!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Makes for a wonderful bath experience has a delightful scent! I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product makes my skin feel when I step out of the bath, from the relaxing moment I get in the tub and soak, till the moment I get out, my skin feels softer and tighter and cleaner. I&#x27;m not too sure about dissolving cellulite, but I just started using the product and I will continue to purchase and use it.</li>
            <li> These bath salts are wonderful! They smell great, like being at a spa. The essential oils make my skin feel so soft &amp; smooth. Haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in cellulite but did see a reduction in fluid and that my legs &amp; bottom were firmer both after the soak &amp; the morning following. Received this product complimentary to try &amp; review.  No compensation was provided.</li>
            <li> I love this product! First off, it smells AMAZING! Great for a relaxing bath! Beyond that it is also helpful in reducing the appearance of cellulite and water retention. It is not drastic, but still noticeable. I wound definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It was a nice product but I did not prefer the scent at all. I would try other scents&lt;br /&gt; from the same company.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it does it but it really does what it promises!</li>
            <li> Good stuff honestly makes your skin feel great!</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Vi-tae&#x27;s Skinny Bath!  I first ordered it and took it with me on a &#x27;relaxation / health retreat&#x27; trip to the mountains and it was truly wonderful.  It has a great, relaxing scent (aromatherapy) and it&#x27;s very effective in the bath.  I&#x27;ve ordered it again and ordered one for a friend.  I highly recommend it.  I&#x27;ve ordered several of their other products as well, and am equally impressed by the quality of their products, their customer service, packaging and prompt shipping services. I feel Skinny Bath has definitely contributed to my weight loss and I&#x27;ve incorporated their products into my wellness program.</li>
            <li> I ordered &#x27;Skinny Bath&#x27;...I absolutely love it! Not only is it invigorating, but I have noticed the appearance of my cellulite diminishing! The smell is intoxicating, too! Great product. I&#x27;ll be ordering more!&lt;br /&gt;Suzy Petersen</li>
            <li> I felt quite relieved after using it in a warm bath - will reorder when this first one runs out!</li>
            <li> very good for fluid retention</li>
            <li> not sure it is doing anything</li>
            <li> Where do I begin with my love for Vi Tae Skinny Bath?? This stuff falls nothing short of amazing! If you&#x27;re looking for something that is both completely natural and works, then look no further. To use, just put a couple of tablespoons of this into your bath, sit back and relax for a half an hour. This product draws out retained fluid and leaves your skin feeling more firm...take that cellulite!! While you will feel a renewed sense of firmness, it does not strip your skin of the natural moisture, and actually leaves it with a silky smooth feel. I can not say enough good things about this bath soak, and highly recommend it to everyone! Ladies, this is especially great during that time of the month when you&#x27;re feeling like a big ol bag of bloat!! Just an all around super product. I did receive a discount on this in exchange for an honest review, however my opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough yet to see if it actually works, but it does have a very pleasant aroma...</li>
            <li> Makes skin really smooth. The fragrance could be better. Over all average product.</li>
            <li> Doesnt do anything good for my cellulite. They could make bigger jar for longer usage to see the difference in cellulite.</li>
            <li> I love the way these Skinny Bath bath salts smell and how they make me feel. The scent does remind me of the aromatherapy used in spas and during massage. It helps me wind down and relax. I like that this is a natural product with dead sea salts and essential oils. I try to use only products with natural and or organic ingredients without all the chemicals that are bad for you. I&#x27;m glad that it has NO Parabens; NO Phthalates; NO Sodium Lauryl Sulfates; NO Sodium Laureth Sulfate; NO Petroleum; NO Acrylamide; No Phelon Carbolic Acid; NO Dioxane; NO Toluene; NO Artificial Colors; NO Artificial Scents. This really is a professional grade, spa quality product. I had knee reconstruction surgery a few years ago and still have a lot of swelling and fluid retention in my knee and sometimes my feet and ankles. I was really curious if these salts would help me. Soaking in warm water with these salts greatly reduces the fluid retention, swelling, and also makes my skin feel more taut and smooth. I put moisturizer on right out of the tub and I think soaking in these salts first increases the effects of the moisturizer. I also noticed that my legs don&#x27;t ache as much and after working out it took the soreness out of my muscles. I am very pleased with this product. I received this product in exchange for my honest review and I will definitely purchase more in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m seem to be obsessed with Vitae! I have the Take It Easy bath salts now and I love them too!  They arrived just when I needed them most after a particularly exhausting high strung couple of days.  I hadn&#x27;t had much sleep in a few days because I simply could not wind down enough to relax.  I couldn&#x27;t wait till that evening to take a bath and see if these lived up to Vitae&#x27;s claims. Well let me you, I totally zenned out! I stayed in much longer than twenty minutes because it was so relaxing and smelled great. I drank a whole bottle of water beforehand and after as instructed because you will sweat.....alot.  I not only drank water before and after my bath but throughout my bath. After I got out, I wrapped myself in a big towel and went and laid down with a cozy blanket as instructed continuing to drink plenty of water because you will continue to sweat as your body kicks out all those toxins.  It&#x27;s important to follow these instructions, if you don&#x27;t, be prepared for some pretty killer muscle cramps. I kept my environment low key, low light and low sound during all this and I was so relaxed and was able to get the most satisfying sleep that night in a while.t only drank water before and after my bath but throughout my bath.

            <li> No noticeable difference after going through the whole thing.  It does smell nice though, but nothing significantly different than a bit of epson salts and some eucalyptus.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this product and how it left my skin feeling soft and smooth. I have taken 5 baths with this product since I received it and I cannot say that I experienced the Cellulite dissolving or fluid reducing promises. The info in the questions asked says you should get 8 baths out of it but I have taken 5 so far with a 1/4 of a cup of the product each time and I have just a small amount left, no way it will fill the 1/4 cup again and definitely not enough to get me to the 8 baths. It arrived sealed, but once opened it was not full all the way to the top, not sure if that is normal or not, could be why I will not make my 8 baths. Like I said it&#x27;s smells great, makes your skin feel great, but in the 5 uses I have had with it, I have not see a change in the things it says it will do. Maybe I just need to use it longer, but I am pretty much out of it.</li>
            <li> Love the aroma, and it is definitely a relaxing bath. I am not totally convinced of the cellulite dissolving claims but I am still a new user. Perhaps long term use would show results.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it makes you feel so relaxed.  Will buy again!</li>
            <li> 2nd purchase and yes  IT WORKS!! However, I take baths 3-4 times per week and work out 5 days per week for 35 minutes I&#x27;m confident this helps with the results. I use this for maintaining a tone and tight body.</li>
            <li> The manufacturer of this product offered me a sample of these salts for review purposes.  I absolutely love bath products and wanted to give it a try.  I didn&#x27;t really expect this to do anything to my cellulite. But because they are supposed to help with water retention, I was still curious enough to try them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, aside from the salt itself, these do contain a number of oils.  The scent is very strong, so I would recommend that you have the bathroom window or door open when you fill the tub.  The first time I used them, I had the door closed while the tub filled and I was almost overwhelmed with the scent.  Each time I&#x27;ve used it since, I had the bathroom door open when it filled and found the scent to be sweet, attractive, and not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flakes are large and do not dissolve immediately in a hot bath.  You can still see some of the flakes floating in the tub as you bathe, but by the time my 20 minute bath was gone, they had just about all dissolved.  And happily, there was no unpleasant residue left to clean after bathing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While my cellulite was not melted away, I didn&#x27;t expect that.  However, my skin did feel firm and these seemed to do a marvelous job on water retention/bloating.  In addition, the oils in the product left my skin feeling extremely soft.  Even now, as I type this, when I run my hands over my skin, it is noticeably softer and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bath is now beautifully scented and, after getting out, my muscles are relaxed and skin firm.  I would use these again in a heartbeat.  Heck, I&#x27;m using them tonight after I get off work!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product several months ago. I didn&#x27;t use as often as I should have because with my busy schedule quick showers work better for me. However, I have to say that when I did get the chance to soak, my skin was very smooth and soft after adding the salts to my bath water. So, it does a pretty good job at smoothing your skin. I will try to use more often this time around to see if it makes difference in my cellulite.</li>
            <li> I love this soak, smells good, feels good and is relaxing.  It isn&#x27;t a miracle cure for cellulite, but it does sure tighten my skin and does seem to smooth it in places.  I sit at a desk all day for work and my ankles tend to swell some days, but an evening soak in this stuff really seems to help get my ankles back to normal.  My favorite part though is how soft my skin is.  I love the smell and the tingle when you first get in the water.  I just ordered a few more jars since it seems like Amazon sells out fairly quickly (at least, I waited a month for it to come back in stock).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to stress that it isn&#x27;t going to get rid of all your cellulite, but it does do a good job at tightening and smoothing the skin.  By the time I got to the end of the jar I did see some improvement in the texture of my skin.  Combined longer term use with a good diet and exercise I could see this product leading to smoother skin.</li>
            <li> I have only tried this product for 3 soaks. It is very relaxing but I haven&#x27;t really noticed any skin tightening/smoothing yet. The scent is very mild. This product has forced me to relax for 15-20 minutes. Hoping to see results. I read very good reviews prior to using this product. The company, Vi-Tae, is very customer oriented. Since purchasing, I have received 2 emails asking about their product and answering any questions I had.</li>
            <li> Ok, I have a decent amount of cellulite unfortunately.  No matter how you slice it, it&#x27;s just going to take time for it to freakin&#x27; go away.&lt;br /&gt;BUT...I have to say that of all the cellulite antics that I&#x27;ve tried, this one so far has shown the MOST difference in the quickest time.&lt;br /&gt;Is my cellulite 100% gone?  No. (If you want immediate, you might want to hit a medical spa instead of taking the natural route).  But this IS working.&lt;br /&gt;I can actually see some difference after my first container of this stuff, which is awesome!  Even more though, I can feel the difference.  My thighs feel much more tight n taught-like...not in a &amp;#34;let&#x27;s strip you of all your oils so your skin dries and tightens up&amp;#34; kind of way.  More like a healthy, subtle toned feel to my skin, which I&#x27;m completely loving!</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time last night and woke up 3 pounds skinnier!  The smell is relaxing and my skin feel fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!</li>
            <li> Definitely sucks the water out of ya!  Lost 3 lbs after first usage.  I am just getting used to this product and do not really have a results yet.  I&#x27;ll have to check back for an update.</li>
            <li> I wish this came in an even bigger size.  Contains the wonderful healing properties of the dead sea salts with a glorious aromatherapy and added scent.  The absolute answer to soothing your muscles and spirit of after a day of physical or mental exertion. Great product and equally great company.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my cellulite or my waist. But i did like using the product as a way to relax. It smells nice in the jar but once it goes in the water you can&#x27;t smell it at all. It dissolves pretty well in the water. I received this product at a discounted price for my honest review, all opinions were my own.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product makes my skin feel when I step out of the bath, from the relaxing moment I get in the tub and soak, till the  moment I get out, my skin feels softer and tighter and cleaner. I&#x27;m not too sure about dissolving cellulite, but I just started using the product and I will continue to purchase and use it.</li>
            <li> I bought this due to the natural ingredients and put some in my bath once a week for detoxing.  The detoxing essential oils gently pull toxins from the lymph system without causing a detox reaction and feeling ill.  I only put in a couple of tablespoons of the product and soak for a 1/2 hour.  Some tingling occurs during the soak time on areas that are especially congested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients from the bottle:  dead sea salts, pinus sylvestris (pine) needle oil, cupressus sempervirens (cypress) leaf/stem oil, salvia officinalis (sage) oil, juniperus communis (juniper) needle leaf oil, canarium luzonicum (elemi) oil &amp; pelargonium graveolens (geranium) flower oil.</li>
            <li> I liked this product it smelled good was relaxing. My skin felt great after getting out of bath. I don&#x27;t have cellulite so i cannot say it would help with that. But it is a good bath. almost spa like feeling while bathing as well as after. this was sent to me in return for a honest opinion after trying. I would buy this again as I am always looking for aroma therapy bath products.</li>
            <li> I used this bath for a couple reasons: to help with tension after a long day of helping a friend move and also because I was interested to see how this helped make me more &amp;#34;skinny.&amp;#34; The bath salts felt good, the oils smooth and the aromas were pleasant and overall I did feel refreshed after ward. I didn&#x27;t feel skinny or look skinnier, but frankly, I didn&#x27;t see that as a real expectation anyway. As long as I think of this as an all natural, aromatic bath I really liked it. If I try to hold this to making me skinnier it wouldn&#x27;t hold up, like so many other similar claims. So ignore that part and enjoy the bath!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two things hold me back from a five star rating: 1) the salts didn&#x27;t fully dissolve. There were little white floating things all over the place in the water - even after about 20 minutes of soaking. No big deal, but it required a rinse off and a washing out of the tub. 2) after the bath my skin had a distinct oily feel to it that didn&#x27;t rinse off right away. I know some would like the oil to soak in and enjoy the smoothness of your skin afterwards. For me, I&#x27;d have preferred an less oily finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this product and I believe it did work to relax and work out my muscles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample of this product was provided by the manufacturer for review.</li>
            <li> The product overall is fine. I used it several times. Just the smell is a bit strong, and I don&#x27;t really like the smell. maybe just my personal preference.</li>
            <li> disappointed with the results which were none</li>
            <li> Works great! Smells awesome and my skin does feel smoother and tighter. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Product works as advertised.  Keep in mind that you need to be eating a healthy diet along with exercise and drinking plenty of water.</li>
            <li> These sea salts smell divine and leave my skin so smooth. You are only supposed to use 1/4 cup in a bath 2-3 times per week so I would guess this bottle will last me a month. I bought two and am so pleased with just my first bath!</li>
            <li> When I bought this item I wanted somthing to help me relax a bit and help the appearance of my skin. But what I recieved was a headache from the strong smell of the bath salt, and did not help my skin in the ways they said it would. Plus the lid was broken when I received it. After a couple uses (thinking it would help the cellulite dissolve and help the fluid in my knees and ankles) i found that the smell did not bother me as much and it was very relaxing but still did not help in any other way.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to try this! And I wasn&#x27;t let down! The smell of the salt is strong (which I prefer) it helped open my sinus&#x27; and the smell really lasted a long time! I&#x27;ve tried other bath salts that the smell doesn&#x27;t last but like 5-10 mins! But not this stuff! And I could really tell with just after once use how my skin on my legs were just a little tighter! Can&#x27;t wait to buy more!! *i received this with a promotional discount*</li>
            <li> so very relaxing....makes me want to stay in tub even longer, feels so healthy and skin glows</li>
            <li> On;ly used this once so far but i like the way it felt.  Jury&#x27;s still out on the skin tightening and cellulite loss though...  Great transaction, quick delivery if it&#x27;s as good as the reviews say then I will buy more from this seller!</li>
            <li> This really is excellent for my fluid retention.  Feel so much better, after bathing.  Thank you so much.  I can&#x27;t wait to try your other products.</li>
            <li> Do you have cellulite issues?  “Skinny Bath” is what you need. After looking for months I started using the product after reading the reviews. After a long workout, this is the only thing i want in my bath water. The product helps you relax and helps with the appearance of your skin. Try it, love it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel any difference, I wish I could get my money back....I soaked in tub for 20 minutes, sometimes 30 and added extra and still no different feeling.....it was just like I didn&#x27;t put anything in the water.....don&#x27;t waste your hard earned money....unless u are rich and just want to try....</li>
            <li> At first, I felt like it was tightening my skin, but by the end of the jar (which is pretty small), it didn&#x27;t improve anything. I think it was just drying my skin out enough to make it feel tighter, without causing my skin to be ashy or flaky. It would be less expensive to just buy epsom salts with the same outcome.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference yet it does help my tired muscles tho, and here is a warning smells like vix.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and price! Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Rest and relax, ​smooth soaking.</li>
            <li> Love this! Smells great, all natural, so relaxing, and definitely makes you sweat away some extra fluid.</li>
            <li> makes my skin feel very soft. haven&#x27;t used enough to know about cellulite reducer.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. The customer service is outstanding. Overall, I will be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> LOVE this!  Its so relaxing and my skin is definitely more firm for a few days after soaking in it. Ive only used it for a couple of weeks, I hope the skin firming builds up and the effects last longer after using it for a longer time.  Very luxurious!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any fluid reducing, the aroma was nice but very expensive</li>
            <li> I have used this product 2 times since I have recieved it. I like the product while in the bath. It relaxes me and yes I feel way less stressed when I get out. However I am not to fond of the menthol smell it gives out. Even after taking the bath the bathroom still smells like it. My husband doesn&#x27;t like it at all.I recieved this product for free for my honest review</li>
            <li> love it it does get rid of inflammation and bloat</li>
            <li> I LOVED IT. USED IT THE SAME DAY IT WAS DELIVERED....I HAVE BEEN USING THIS ONCE A WEEK SINCE I RECEIVED IT. MY BODY FEELS SMOOTH, LOOKS HEALTHIER, AND THE SALTS ARE SO RELAXING AS WELL. ALSO TOOK AWAY MY WORK-OUT ACHES AND PAINS (BONUS) I WILL BE REORDERING THIS PRODUCT. AND LOOKING FORWARD TO TRYING THEIR OTHER PRODUCTS AS WELL.</li>
            <li> Amazing, Buying more for self and will be sharing as well</li>
            <li> i find it to be very relaxing. Just dump it in and soak. During cold season it not only slims you down but clears your sinuses too. Two drawbacks, kind of small container for quantity use and my husband wasnt a fan of the smell.</li>
            <li> I loved the smell! It felt like I was at a spa. This product leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft and I have noticed less cellulite. I would definitely recommend this bath salt.</li>
            <li> Not into this product. It is no different than sugar exfoliating scrubs I made in the past. The aroma is over powering and unpleasant.  I have bought better scrubs in drug stores. I do not recommend this product for others to use. Homemade versions are better.</li>
            <li> The best stuff on earth. Leaves you feeling invigorating and serene at the same time. Will continue to purchase!!</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference in the dimples on my thighs on the second use ... great product</li>
            <li> Relaxing. Smells good too.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I try different bath salts all the time. This was the first time I tried this company/product. These salts are definitely top of the line and will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> Buy regular dead sea salt.  It is much cheaper.  I have used both and the other not only lasts longer but costs less than half the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ADDICTED!!!!! Love this product.....</li>
            <li> I tried it tonight other than the promised results I was so relaxed, it&#x27;s amazing I am hooked I can tell my skin is firmer! After the first use! So the product is amazing! But honestly I would continue to use anyway just because of how relaxed I felt, being a mom of three and going to school full time. I never get a break like I did tonight. I love the product! Thank you again!</li>
            <li> This is just like any other bath salt in my opinion but I wanted to try it. It&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Smelled great. Saw no difference with skin.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  I love the smell and the way my skin feels after using it.  I will definitely purchase again and try other products from the line up.  I am very pleased with my purchase.  The ingredients seem to be of high quality and I like that a lot.</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail yesterday and I was so excited to try it out. I was really excited to see that after 2 days I had gotten this product. First I must say that the products scent is a bit strong. I like the scent but others may not. It is a mixture of earth scents like a forest and mint. Also it dissolved very quickly in my water which I liked. It made my skin so silky after 2 use and I was happy about that. I also was given a little card with a way to possibly receive up to 50% off just for buying the product. I thought that was super generous of the company. I didn&#x27;t notice any viable results... but I will keep using it. It was super relaxing after a long, rough day at work.</li>
            <li> Ahhh I felt so relax after using this on my bath. The hubby loved it too</li>
            <li> I came across this while looking to relieve my dry skin. The essential oils are relaxing (not overwhelming) and my skin is no longer dry. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and noticed my skin does feel firmer. Hope to see improvement in my cellulite with continued use. I like doTERRA essential oils; and tried their cellulite mixture, but it was to much work mixing etc. This is much easier and has all the same essential oils. Only gave (3) stars for now, I&#x27;ll give it (5) stars if my cellulite improves by 50%.  Will followup in a few months.</li>
