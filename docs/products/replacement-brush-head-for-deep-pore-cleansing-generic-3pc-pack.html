            <li>Gave one of the brushes to my daughter and now we are both very satisfied with the quality.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>The cost savings will allow me to replace the brush heads much more often than I was!</li>
            <li>great product, good price, shipped quickly</li>
            <li>Cleans OK but not as good as Clarisonic brush heads.</li>
            <li>Does a good job, in my opinion this is a much better option than the name brand</li>
            <li>fits perfectly and so soft.  </li>
            <li>This item works OK.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Clarisonic Plus for many years.  </li>
            <li>The brush is able to vibrate and move without a problem.</li>
            <li>Just as good the real clarisonic heads!</li>
            <li>I changed them much more frequently only to realize the brushes just weren&#x27;t very good at all.</li>
            <li>These seem to be identical to the genuine Clarisonic brush head.  </li>
            <li>, these are FANTASTIC.  </li>
            <li>Now with these fantastic bruises I can change out my brush every 30-60 days as is recommended.</li>
            <li>Worth a try for the price</li>
            <li>much cheaper than original clearonie brush.</li>
            <li>Work just like the real heads!</li>
            <li>Brushes definitely work, but I think the generic is not as good as the real deal.</li>
            <li>The quality is fantastic, and the &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; is exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>Not a bad item just not the same.</li>
            <li>My new go to!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the Clarisonic system for years and have always purchased the OVER PRICED Clarisonic brand brush heads, I was excited but apprehensive about these 3 brushes I found on Amazon for such a fantastic price, 3 of these cost me HALF of what 1 of the Clarisonic brand brushes cost.  </li>
            <li>Not much difference in the original and this Maeline brush.</li>
            <li>Definitely not the same as original Clarisonic brush heads.</li>
            <li>This is my first purchase of a generic brush head</li>
            <li>Exactly the same as prestige brand brushes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it works quite as much as the name brand ones, but it fits the Mia and it does the job well enough</li>
            <li>Bristles are soft and cheep.</li>
            <li>Before I found these I would typically not change the brush head out</li>
            <li>In fact I would not be surprised if the same factory manufactures both.  </li>

            <li> fits perfectly and so soft.  much cheaper than original clearonie brush.</li>
            <li> Just as good the real clarisonic heads! After a while the cap doesn&#x27;t seem to want to stay on, but that&#x27;s not a big deal for me. These heads look identical, feel identical, and work the same as well! No issues with spraying water or causing breakouts on my face. Will repurchase again and again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve done a video review as well if you&#x27;re curious https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;ax4FPt9rBFU</li>
            <li> Work just like the real heads! I have not noticed a difference. - Molly Grimm</li>
            <li> Work well, but don&#x27;t look as they do in the picture</li>
            <li> OMG!! PERFECT fit for my ClairaSonic Mia!! I feel like a glowing Queen!</li>
            <li> great product, good price, shipped quickly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering these from Clarisonic for my Mia 2 for years, but they are like $25 each!  These look, feel and seem to work just as well for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> This item works OK. Definitely not the same as original Clarisonic brush heads. We have 3 Mia2 devices in our household and we all decided to give these a try. Will not reorder. Not a bad item just not the same. Cleans OK but not as good as Clarisonic brush heads. Worth a try for the price but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Bristles are soft and cheep. Does not clean as well as the clarisonic brand. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Does a good job, in my opinion this is a much better option than the name brand</li>
            <li> Brushes definitely work, but I think the generic is not as good as the real deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Clarisonic Plus for many years.  This is my first purchase of a generic brush head and I am delighted.  These seem to be identical to the genuine Clarisonic brush head.  I can see or feel no difference.  Thrilled to have discovered this much less expensive alternative.  Wish Maeline would also offer a generic Luxe brush.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as good as real clarisonic brush heads.  I changed them much more frequently only to realize the brushes just weren&#x27;t very good at all.</li>
            <li> They fit onto my Mia 2 Clarisonic brush perfect! I received these very quickly, a few days ahead of what it told me. They feel just like the Deep Pore Clarisonic heads, comes with all 3 heads. Great price!</li>
            <li> Little flimsy but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Exactly the same as prestige brand brushes. The brush is able to vibrate and move without a problem. My new go to!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my clarisonic</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Clarisonic system for years and have always purchased the OVER PRICED Clarisonic brand brush heads, I was excited but apprehensive about these 3 brushes I found on Amazon for such a fantastic price, 3 of these cost me HALF of what 1 of the Clarisonic brand brushes cost.  I notice NO DIFFERENCE whatsoever.  The quality is fantastic, and the &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; is exactly the same.  In fact I would not be surprised if the same factory manufactures both.  I read other reviewers state that these were lower quality but THAT IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE, these are FANTASTIC.  Before I found these I would typically not change the brush head out but maybe once a year, I over used them and hesitated because I simply did not want to pay $25 plus tax for each Clarisonic replacement.  Now with these fantastic bruises I can change out my brush every 30-60 days as is recommended.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly with my Clairsonic.Gave one of the brushes to my daughter and now we are both very satisfied with the quality. Great price, too!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference in appearance or function of these brush heads between the name brand and the Maeline I recently bought. I am quite happy with my purchase. The cost savings will allow me to replace the brush heads much more often than I was!</li>
            <li> Works well!  Not much difference in the original and this Maeline brush.</li>
            <li> Good alternative to clarisonic brushes. Very pleased.</li>
