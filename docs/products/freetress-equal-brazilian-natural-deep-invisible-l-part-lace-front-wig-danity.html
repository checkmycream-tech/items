            <li>I LOVE MY WIG!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Honey , I love this unit .</li>
            <li>Ive received many compliments on danity ..</li>
            <li>and this was my first!!!</li>
            <li>This is my first wig, I seen a lot of good reviews for it on YouTube</li>
            <li>When I first received it in the mail, it was absolutely gorgeous.</li>
            <li>My criteria while looking for this wig was one with a great natural looking part</li>
            <li>Wig was good, but tangled fast and wasn&#x27;t the color I ordered.</li>
            <li>Easy to put on, feels natural, looks great.</li>
            <li>and it tangles really easy, sheds, and smells like weave which is kinda head-aching</li>
            <li>A month later I purchased a different unit (Sensational Empress) which is a MUCH BETTER unit; she&#x27;s absolutely beautiful!</li>
            <li>The curl/wave pattern in full of body love that I didn&#x27;t have to do anything to it.</li>
            <li>and because I love the fit and realism of it, I&#x27;m more than willing to purchase another one.</li>
            <li>great if your hair is growing out natural and you need a quick change-up.</li>
            <li>hair is ALWAYS on fleek&amp;#34; they also ask me if I actually do hair and if i would do theirs lol.</li>
            <li>Even with the straps, I literally had to tie the bands in a knot to keep it secure (smh).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice wig but tangle too much</li>
            <li>The style is gorgeous and the curls are so luxuriously soft.  </li>
            <li>people believe that she&#x27;s a sew in because of the fact she blends so good with your natural hair.</li>
            <li>Received quickly, wig looks good, I purchased it for a one time formal occasion, surprisingly natural looking,</li>
            <li>This wig was Very pretty &amp; full but gets tangled and sheds quickly!</li>
            <li>It is not as full as it appears on the demonstrated version.</li>
            <li>So much so, that I&#x27;m buying it in two more colours.</li>
            <li>then that it&#x27;s very secure and realistic looking ðŸ’—</li>
            <li>Gorgeous long waves.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing it a month straight, and I really don&#x27;t have many complaints.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very flown and easy to brush,  I&#x27;ve only worn it once since it came yesterday :)</li>
            <li>hair is exactly how it looks in the pic and was surprised how soft it is also the curls are absolutely lovely.</li>
            <li>gave this wig all five stars because I feel as if I buy a synthetic lace front wig with a deep natural looking part for  under $40 that is as amazing as this</li>
            <li>It has lasted a long time, and I am so pleased.</li>
            <li>cool lace front but gets tangled super fast but is not human</li>
            <li>love it exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>I favor bangs, so I cut some in but this wig has a very natural look right out of the pack.  </li>
            <li>I really like this wig.</li>
            <li>EVERYONE thought this was my real hair.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still very wearable.</li>
            <li>I Will Soooooo Buy Another 1 Real Soon</li>
            <li>However, I will be getting this one again in another color, very soon.</li>
            <li>will be getting her in another color really soon .</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually wear long wigs, but it&#x27;s absolutely beautiful.</li>
            <li>Next, it tangles SOooOoooooOooOoo easily and frequently that it no way should this be advertised as &#x27;Shake-N-Go&#x27;;</li>
            <li>The wig is perfect the only con about it is that it tangles a little but other</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really wear wigs but since starting a new work out I needed to have a quick style in the morning</li>
            <li>Little did they know, it is a WIG not a weave baby. :)</li>
            <li>And I wish the wig was a little bit more fuller</li>
            <li>My first issue was that is was Super thin at the top and long and thick towards the bottom; gave me a real &#x27;stripper&#x27; kind of vibe.</li>
            <li>Now my current wig is lasting longer compared to the original one just lasted a month.</li>
            <li>The first I had worn is color number 1B and the second one is in color OH227144; it is shown in the pictures below.</li>
            <li>It feels really soft and looks so natural!</li>
            <li>The need make the combs more comfortable and less hard.</li>
            <li>Besides the tangling, I dislike you constantly has to re-position the wig to look natural since it can slip back and expose your real hairline and real hair.</li>
            <li>The only thing I can say is that the ends are beginning to look really frizzy, but what would you expect out of a synthetic wig?</li>
            <li>For a more natural look I wear it slightly behind my hairline</li>
            <li>I curled the hair on perm rods (pink) &amp; they bounced right back.</li>
            <li>This particular unit (Freetress Equal Brazilian) had the potential to make me never buy another lace front again...</li>
            <li>Anyway, I disliked this unit so much that despite having other issues to mention, I don&#x27;t want to give this brand that much of my time.</li>

            <li> but my flat iron solved that problem.</li>
            <li> This was my first wig and although the appearance of the quality of hair looks really nice, I was very disappointed overall in this unit.  </li>
            <li> I customized the wig by cutting it to shape it more for my frame.  </li>
            <li> I combed it by using a wide tooth comb and starting from the ends working my way up.</li>
            <li> so the wig was extremely long on my.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn it everyday so far</li>
            <li> I purchased it in black, but the OP27 &amp; OP99J are next on my list.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t mind doing a little extra work to customize it.</li>
            <li> and I have gotten very minimal shedding.</li>
            <li> It mattes really hard at the back of the wig and at the nap.</li>
            <li> have had it for less than week and it looks like I&#x27;ve had it a couple months already.</li>
            <li> the cap is a little tight on me but not so tight you have a headache.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint: after running my fingers through the unit ~ noticeable shedding &amp; the curls just flopped!</li>
            <li> It gets a little tangled but nothing a brush can&#x27;t fix</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this wig did not last very long!</li>
            <li> lace is hard and rough on your front hairs.  </li>
            <li> EVERYONE i met or saw everyday wearing this would always complement me on my hair and say &amp;#34;your</li>
            <li> it was waste of money.</li>
            <li> Tangled ridiculous for synthetic hair.</li>
            <li> Lol I hate to give a bad review, however, I will never purchase from this line again and would definately not recommend :(</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> as a matter of fact, I wouldnt recommend that you shake it all because you may find yourself with a knotty birds nest on your head :(  </li>

            <li> I love this wig!!! It keeps great, and looks amazing on me. I&#x27;ll be buying another one in a different color!!!!</li>
            <li> This wig is everything I call her Gabby.  I cut the lakefront off (YouTube if you don&#x27;t know how) because I don&#x27;t like that part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very flown and easy to brush,  I&#x27;ve only worn it once since it came yesterday :) the cap is a little tight on me but not so tight you have a headache.  I really like this wig.</li>
            <li> EVERYONE thought this was my real hair. EVERYONE i met or saw everyday wearing this would always complement me on my hair and say &amp;#34;your hair is ALWAYS on fleek&amp;#34; they also ask me if I actually do hair and if i would do theirs lol. Little did they know, it is a WIG not a weave baby. :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my wig! I have gotten so many compliments on it and so many times people have asked me if it was a sew-in!</li>
            <li> Wig was good, but tangled fast and wasn&#x27;t the color I ordered.</li>
            <li> This is my first wig, I seen a lot of good reviews for it on YouTube so I decided to purchase it, glad I did. For a more natural look I wear it slightly behind my hairline you can definitely shift the wig to a side or middle part. The curl/wave pattern in full of body love that I didn&#x27;t have to do anything to it. The only con is that it does tend to tangle here &amp; there and I have gotten very minimal shedding. And I wish the wig was a little bit more fuller but it&#x27;s still very wearable.</li>
            <li> I love this hair!!! I don&#x27;t really wear wigs but since starting a new work out I needed to have a quick style in the morning and this is Perfect.  Its already styled so I just put it on and blend my hair (5 mins top),  Because its not human hair it get tangled at the nape (especially in warm weather) but I work it and go.  I have gotten many compliments.  It has even been mistaken for human hair.  I will be ordering again!!!</li>
            <li> I really love this wig!!! The style is gorgeous and the curls are so luxuriously soft.  After 4 weeks of wear I still don&#x27;t need to refresh it with the curling iron yet.  But soon.  I favor bangs, so I cut some in but this wig has a very natural look right out of the pack.  It&#x27;s cut well and the curls frame the face perfectly.  My criteria while looking for this wig was one with a great natural looking part and I found it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negative:&lt;br /&gt;The lace is hard and rough on your front hairs.  I use fabric glue to soften the edges because I don&#x27;t expose the lace front anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I wish the parting was wider so I can pluck it thinner, but it still works fine.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll have to use concealer or a gray eyeliner pencil to the part to make it look authentic.  Use your finger nails to smudge out the excess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this wig all five stars because I feel as if I buy a synthetic lace front wig with a deep natural looking part for  under $40 that is as amazing as this, I don&#x27;t mind doing a little extra work to customize it.</li>
            <li> I love this wig. It does tangle at the end but my flat iron solved that problem. For this specific wig I do NOT recommend brushing it with any type of brush. I combed it by using a wide tooth comb and starting from the ends working my way up.</li>
            <li> i would definitely go with another wig like Honor Wig, DE530.</li>
            <li> love it exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> cool lace front but gets tangled super fast but is not human so what do you expect.  I could not curl with curlers eventhough they said it was safe.</li>
            <li> Awesome wig. Easy to put on, feels natural, looks great.</li>
            <li> This wig was Very pretty &amp; full but gets tangled and sheds quickly! Unfortunately, this wig did not last very long!</li>
            <li> It mattes really hard at the back of the wig and at the nap. I have second one. I put silicone based heat protector to detangle the nap and back of the wig. Now my current wig is lasting longer compared to the original one just lasted a month. It is a beautiful wig. Besides the tangling, I dislike you constantly has to re-position the wig to look natural since it can slip back and expose your real hairline and real hair. The combs in the wigs feels like it is pulling your hair. The need make the combs more comfortable and less hard. The first I had worn is color number 1B and the second one is in color OH227144; it is shown in the pictures below.</li>
            <li> I am in loveeeee with this unit! Must buy it doesnt tangle and it full like i like it very beautiful! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜œ</li>
            <li> It is not as full as it appears on the demonstrated version. I had to add more tracks myself. It also tangles a lot. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this unit.  She is definitely my go to wig.  I&#x27;m 5&#x27;0 so the wig was extremely long on my.  I customized the wig by cutting it to shape it more for my frame.  I would order Danity again and again.</li>
            <li> Tangled and matted upon reciept.</li>
            <li> i ordered this hair wednesday and got it the next day...it also came in a nice package! hair is exactly how it looks in the pic and was surprised how soft it is also the curls are absolutely lovely. didnt think to order hair from amazon but glad i did! you guys earned your 5 star rating</li>
            <li> Love this wig doesn&#x27;t even look synthetic. I will definitely buy another  one</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this wig. So much so, that I&#x27;m buying it in two more colours. I purchased it in black, but the OP27 &amp; OP99J are next on my list. I don&#x27;t usually wear long wigs, but it&#x27;s absolutely beautiful. The only complaint: after running my fingers through the unit ~ noticeable shedding &amp; the curls just flopped! I&#x27;ve never had that happen to me before, frizz yes, but not curls disappearing! I curled the hair on perm rods (pink) &amp; they bounced right back. I have the wig re-rolled on perm rods until I wear it again. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. Make the purchase.</li>
            <li> Omg I Love Danity I Will Soooooo Buy Another 1 Real Soon</li>
            <li> This wig exceeded my expectations. When I first received it in the mail, it was absolutely gorgeous. I didn&#x27;t purchase it from Amazon, but I do have the wig. I&#x27;ve been wearing it a month straight, and I really don&#x27;t have many complaints. The only thing I can say is that the ends are beginning to look really frizzy, but what would you expect out of a synthetic wig? Not to mention the fact that I haven&#x27;t been maintaining it like I should. It has lasted a long time, and I am so pleased. I just bought another wig from another company, and I am starting to feel regretful about not repurchasing this one. However, I will be getting this one again in another color, very soon. I love, love, love, love this hair. If you&#x27;re wondering whether or not you should order it, you should. Go on, buy DANITY. You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Tangled ridiculous for synthetic hair. And it was $50 it was waste of money. It only lasted like two days.</li>
            <li> This was my first wig and although the appearance of the quality of hair looks really nice, I was very disappointed overall in this unit.  My first issue was that is was Super thin at the top and long and thick towards the bottom; gave me a real &#x27;stripper&#x27; kind of vibe. Next, it tangles SOooOoooooOooOoo easily and frequently that it no way should this be advertised as &#x27;Shake-N-Go&#x27;; as a matter of fact, I wouldnt recommend that you shake it all because you may find yourself with a knotty birds nest on your head :(  Another issue that I had was that the cap was ginormous! Even with the straps, I literally had to tie the bands in a knot to keep it secure (smh). Anyway, I disliked this unit so much that despite having other issues to mention, I don&#x27;t want to give this brand that much of my time. A month later I purchased a different unit (Sensational Empress) which is a MUCH BETTER unit; she&#x27;s absolutely beautiful! This particular unit (Freetress Equal Brazilian) had the potential to make me never buy another lace front again... and this was my first!!! Lol I hate to give a bad review, however, I will never purchase from this line again and would definately not recommend :(</li>
            <li> Received quickly, wig looks good, I purchased it for a one time formal occasion, surprisingly natural looking, great if your hair is growing out natural and you need a quick change-up.</li>
            <li> The wig is perfect the only con about it is that it tangles a little but other then that it&#x27;s very secure and realistic looking ðŸ’—</li>
            <li> This Brazilian hair feel good and look Good this what i been looking for i love this hair</li>
            <li> i brought this for my wife and she&#x27;s extremely happy!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice wig but tangle too much</li>
            <li> Gorgeous long waves. Great to add to your wig collection</li>
            <li> It was perfect I loved it!! It gets a little tangled but nothing a brush can&#x27;t fix</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT! Used it for a photo shoot for a pageant and they looked amazing. It feels really soft and looks so natural! The only thing is it dies tangle but that&#x27;s what you get with synthetic hair!</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my purchase. I&#x27;ll post a picture soon.</li>
            <li> I LOVE MY WIG!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have had it for less than week and it looks like I&#x27;ve had it a couple months already. I&#x27;ve worn it everyday so far and it tangles really easy, sheds, and smells like weave which is kinda head-aching&lt;br /&gt;With all that being said it does look amazing. I cut my lace and line it on my hair line perfectly. People have no idea I&#x27;m wearing a piece. and because I love the fit and realism of it, I&#x27;m more than willing to purchase another one.</li>
            <li> Honey , I love this unit . It&#x27;s very stylish .. The feather flips and everything . Ive received many compliments on danity ..people believe that she&#x27;s a sew in because of the fact she blends so good with your natural hair. will be getting her in another color really soon .</li>
