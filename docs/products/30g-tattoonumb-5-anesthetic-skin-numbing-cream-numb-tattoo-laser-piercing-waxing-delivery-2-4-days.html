            <li>Absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>It is not as effective for injections</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s kind of puffy</li>
            <li>I really liked this cream, I used it for laser hair removal</li>
            <li>3 Hours of pain free tattooing :) I love it!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t for more tattoos</li>
            <li>if your going to get something get Dr.numb more money</li>
            <li>off.make sure you follow the direction...</li>
            <li>but hey you can add more and keep going</li>
            <li>It was ok.</li>
            <li>However, like I said it did significantly reduced the amount of pain</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good about this you get a hour of pain free tattooing</li>
            <li>I have a full sleeve tattoo plus a couple others here and there and never considered using a product like this.</li>
            <li>Put it on skin waited like two hr like it said and was not numb</li>
            <li>I feel the 2 hours and thickness of cream on contact isn&#x27;t worth it ..</li>
            <li>, I barely felt a thing with the tattoo on my spine, I was so glad it worked, I cried without it, it does wear off after awhile</li>
            <li>I heard someone mention this cream and figured it cant hurt at first</li>
            <li>and first I had to ask him if he had started</li>
            <li>Not like the first one.</li>
            <li>I want to be sure that the numbing cream I buy actually works when I go in for my tattoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got 2 tats on the in sides of my wrists,my first real tat...</li>
            <li>so I didnt end up using as much as i wanted.</li>
            <li>I had my whole side done and after 2 sessions with out it I almost didn&#x27;t want to finish the tattoo, but my artist recommended this</li>
            <li>and it really worked.</li>
            <li>Worked quickly and numbed completely prior to waxing.</li>
            <li>It was my first tattoo but definitely not my last</li>
            <li>I have tried to sit for a large rib tattoo 3 different times and could NOT do it</li>
            <li>This product definitely helped make the laser hair removal process a little more tolerable.</li>
            <li>it was a great experience.tattoo numb</li>
            <li>My wife and myself got tattoos and barely any pain!!!</li>
            <li>Make sure to use it 2hrs prior to tattoos and Saran Wrap that sucker up</li>
            <li>I get more time out of my session using this and less swelling and less healing time after</li>
            <li>I had my ribs tattooed today and could barely feel a thing.</li>
            <li>Followed the instructions and I could barely feel the Tattoo being done on my forearm.</li>
            <li>Well, the wife forgot to reorder this little gem for the final 2 hour session to finish a large back piece and said it was VERY apparent that it had previously worked very well!</li>
            <li>so I end up wasting it when trying to apply to my ears, and also because it comes in a metal tube, which I usually like but in this case, the cream constantly oozes out if you don&#x27;t replace the top immediately.  </li>

            <li> It takes about 45 minutes for it to work, but lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I did feel a very small stick for the IV placement but was a 95% improvement from how they normally are.  </li>
            <li> Numbs a little while on, remove it and numbness last 20 min.</li>
            <li> personally I felt like I wasted money......</li>
            <li> After about an hour of enhancement tattooing I was over it due to the pain.  </li>
            <li> I did another on the other and I could still feel it, but it did not hurt.</li>
            <li> and I hope that other buyers DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li> Like other people have said, it does need to be applied well in advance- at least 90 minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Greencaine in the past - and while that numbs it always cause a rash/redness.</li>
            <li> I would reccomend this to anyone that has trouble with pain!</li>
            <li> I bought 6 boxes, used 2 and the crap dont work, i sent the other 4 boxes back.</li>
            <li> I use this to numb my ear canals every night because they itch due to eczema.</li>
            <li> I tried Tattoo Numb because it&#x27;s less than half the price of Dr. Numb and has 5% Lidocaine.  </li>
            <li> is no good take to long to numb and still dont work.i would never buy again!!</li>
            <li> This product is fake, didn&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> Overall, this was a horrible experience</li>
            <li> If I apply it two hours before a blood test I cannot feel the blood test at all- completely numb.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s still cheaper than Dr Numb and works like a charm every time.</li>
            <li> The area stayed numb for about an hour</li>
            <li> If you follow the directions you will be numb for a couple hours.</li>
            <li> My stupid girlfriend thought it was toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Crap don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> It never got me numb at all!!!!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Works like a champ!!! My wife and myself got tattoos and barely any pain!!!</li>
            <li> Make sure to use it 2hrs prior to tattoos and Saran Wrap that sucker up so it soaks the skin. I love it! I can&#x27;t for more tattoos</li>
            <li> I have tried to sit for a large rib tattoo 3 different times and could NOT do it I heard someone mention this cream and figured it cant hurt at first I was thinking this stuff didn&#x27;t work because I didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; anything while I had my skin wrapped in saran wrap but I left it on and waited for my artist to unwrap me and first I had to ask him if he had started then I kept laughing because it tickled I will be keeping this stuff on hand from now</li>
            <li> I have a full sleeve tattoo plus a couple others here and there and never considered using a product like this. Christmas 2014 I received a gift card to enhance my sleeve that had faded and blurred over the years.  Some places on my sleeve were already cover ups making the enhancement the third layer of tattoo.  After about an hour of enhancement tattooing I was over it due to the pain.  I tried Tattoo Numb because it&#x27;s less than half the price of Dr. Numb and has 5% Lidocaine.  Basically all that I felt during the tattoo session was pressure.  It worked so well I could not believe it.  My artist said that it does not inhibit her work at all.  I already bought another tube for my next session!</li>
            <li> This product does not work I did everything I was suppose to do I felt everything on my foot the tattoo artist even said it doesn&#x27;t work and if your going to get something get Dr.numb more money but it actually works</li>
            <li> It works great for tattooing pain.</li>
            <li> 3 Hours of pain free tattooing :) I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m working on a 1/2 sleeve tattoo and I use this every time! I get more time out of my session using this and less swelling and less healing time after</li>
            <li> Well, the wife forgot to reorder this little gem for the final 2 hour session to finish a large back piece and said it was VERY apparent that it had previously worked very well!</li>
            <li> Numbs a little while on, remove it and numbness last 20 min. Crap don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> I used this cream for upcoming blood tests and an IV placement for a surgery.  It works beautifully.  If I apply it two hours before a blood test I cannot feel the blood test at all- completely numb.  I did feel a very small stick for the IV placement but was a 95% improvement from how they normally are.  It is not as effective for injections but I think that&#x27;s because injections go deeper into the body where it is not numbed.  Like other people have said, it does need to be applied well in advance- at least 90 minutes.</li>
            <li> My stupid girlfriend thought it was toothpaste. so I didnt end up using as much as i wanted. but it still ended up working out good.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product. If you need something to make you feel no pain at all when it comes to get a tattoo, this product kick ass... thank you, I&#x27;m looking forward for my next tattoo</li>
            <li> This does nothing , &amp;#34;super  numb&amp;#34; is the way to go!!</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d try the cheaper option since all these numbing creams claim to have 5% lidocaine. However this product did NOTHING for me. Try Lidocream- it&#x27;s still cheaper than Dr Numb and works like a charm every time.</li>
            <li> This product definitely helped make the laser hair removal process a little more tolerable.</li>
            <li> Put it on skin waited like two hr like it said and was not numb</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Greencaine in the past - and while that numbs it always cause a rash/redness. I found this to be a great alternative. Worked quickly and numbed completely prior to waxing. And didn&#x27;t cause any rash or redness. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> is no good take to long to numb and still dont work.i would never buy again!!</li>
            <li> I use this to numb my ear canals every night because they itch due to eczema. It takes about 45 minutes for it to work, but lasts a long time. I also use it on bug bites and rashes as I cannot tolerate itching and end up damaging my skin drim scratching. I gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s kind of puffy so I end up wasting it when trying to apply to my ears, and also because it comes in a metal tube, which I usually like but in this case, the cream constantly oozes out if you don&#x27;t replace the top immediately.  Numbs well.</li>
            <li> This product is fake, didn&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t bu y it!!!!!</li>
            <li> Sorry but it did not work at all I did what the instruction called for and it did not work whatsoever</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good about this you get a hour of pain free tattooing</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing. I had my ribs tattooed today and could barely feel a thing. Follow the directions and apply a generous amount. It will work wonders.</li>
            <li> I got 2 tats on the in sides of my wrists,my first real tat...it was a great experience.tattoo numb will take the edge off.make sure you follow the direction...the stuff works great!!!!</li>
            <li> It works but takes a wile</li>
            <li> I bought 6 boxes, used 2 and the crap dont work, i sent the other 4 boxes back.</li>
            <li> I had a 6x6 flag redone on the red. 30 minutes into the ink , the pain was felt. I feel the 2 hours and thickness of cream on contact isn&#x27;t worth it ..</li>
            <li> personally I felt like I wasted money......</li>
            <li> The product worked for about 2 maybe 3 hours. The problem was my tattoo artist didn&#x27;t start till an hour later after I applied it and suran wrapped it for 2 hours prior. And the total tat took about 5 hrs. ..So I was in pain for about 2 hours! Especially since the tattoo was on my chest and up by my collar bone! However, like I said it did significantly reduced the amount of pain and it worked for some time! Bottom line, ALL tattoos are going to hurt whether you use a cream or not, but this product eased the pain a lil.</li>
            <li> This stuff works awesome, I barely felt a thing with the tattoo on my spine, I was so glad it worked, I cried without it, it does wear off after awhile but hey you can add more and keep going I would reccomend this to anyone that has trouble with pain! Cant wait to order more!</li>
            <li> It was ok. The area stayed numb for about an hour and I did follow the instructions. Everything works to a point</li>
            <li> Followed the instructions and I could barely feel the Tattoo being done on my forearm. It was my first tattoo but definitely not my last</li>
            <li> This product worked excellent, beyond my expectations. If you follow the directions you will be numb for a couple hours.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!!! I had my whole side done and after 2 sessions with out it I almost didn&#x27;t want to finish the tattoo, but my artist recommended this and it worked great. You just apply it 2 hours before your appointment then cover the area with Saran Wrap. I literally couldn&#x27;t feel a THING!! You sorta can feel a tingling sensation almost like when you have your mouth numbed at the dentist but that&#x27;s all. I recommend it to anyone and everyone getting a tattoo!</li>
            <li> Fasy shipping. I have used this before. Works great</li>
            <li> This cream is like placebo, it does not work at all!!!!! I was in such pain, I could not take it!!! It never got me numb at all!!!!! I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical. Of course I figured it was just a rip off. So I tried it. I did one tattoo without it on one wrist, it hurt. I did another on the other and I could still feel it, but it did not hurt. Not like the first one. They aren&#x27;t kidding though when they say to put it on 2 hours before. Listen to the directions!!</li>
            <li> I wish I never purchased this item. The expiration date is October of 2016. I am not scheduled to go in for my tattoo until November and was trying to plan ahead. I will be returning this product and purchasing a different brand. I want to be sure that the numbing cream I buy actually works when I go in for my tattoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No child safety lock is on the cap of this product and the packaging does not specify that it is made in the USA - which means it probably is not made here. Overall, this was a horrible experience and I hope that other buyers DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li> I really liked this cream, I used it for laser hair removal and it really worked.</li>
